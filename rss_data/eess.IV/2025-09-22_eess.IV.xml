      <title>Analysis Plug-and-Play Methods for Imaging Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plug-and-Play Priors (PnP) is a popular framework for solving imaging inverse problems by integrating learned priors in the form of denoisers trained to remove Gaussian noise from images. In standard PnP methods, the denoiser is applied directly in the image domain, serving as an implicit prior on natural images. This paper considers an alternative analysis formulation of PnP, in which the prior is imposed on a transformed representation of the image, such as its gradient. Specifically, we train a Gaussian denoiser to operate in the gradient domain, rather than on the image itself. Conceptually, this is an extension of total variation (TV) regularization to learned TV regularization. To incorporate this gradient-domain prior in image reconstruction algorithms, we develop two analysis PnP algorithms based on half-quadratic splitting (APnP-HQS) and the alternating direction method of multipliers (APnP-ADMM). We evaluate our approach on image deblurring and super-resolution, demonstrating that the analysis formulation achieves performance comparable to image-domain PnP algorithms.</description>

      <title>Prostate Capsule Segmentation from Micro-Ultrasound Images using Adaptive Focal Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-ultrasound (micro-US) is a promising imaging technique for cancer detection and computer-assisted visualization. This study investigates prostate capsule segmentation using deep learning techniques from micro-US images, addressing the challenges posed by the ambiguous boundaries of the prostate capsule. Existing methods often struggle in such cases, motivating the development of a tailored approach. This study introduces an adaptive focal loss function that dynamically emphasizes both hard and easy regions, taking into account their respective difficulty levels and annotation variability. The proposed methodology has two primary strategies: integrating a standard focal loss function as a baseline to design an adaptive focal loss function for proper prostate capsule segmentation. The focal loss baseline provides a robust foundation, incorporating class balancing and focusing on examples that are difficult to classify. The adaptive focal loss offers additional flexibility, addressing the fuzzy region of the prostate capsule and annotation variability by dilating the hard regions identified through discrepancies between expert and non-expert annotations. The proposed method dynamically adjusts the segmentation model's weights better to identify the fuzzy regions of the prostate capsule. The proposed adaptive focal loss function demonstrates superior performance, achieving a mean dice coefficient (DSC) of 0.940 and a mean Hausdorff distance (HD) of 1.949 mm in the testing dataset. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating advanced loss functions and adaptive techniques into deep learning models. This enhances the accuracy of prostate capsule segmentation in micro-US images, offering the potential to improve clinical decision-making in prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Modeling of Articulatory Temporal Dynamics from real-time MRI for Phoneme Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rtMRI) visualizes vocal tract action, offering a comprehensive window into speech articulation. However, its signals are high dimensional and noisy, hindering interpretation. We investigate compact representations of spatiotemporal articulatory dynamics for phoneme recognition from midsagittal vocal tract rtMRI videos. We compare three feature types: (1) raw video, (2) optical flow, and (3) six linguistically-relevant regions of interest (ROIs) for articulator movements. We evaluate models trained independently on each representation, as well as multi-feature combinations. Results show that multi-feature models consistently outperform single-feature baselines, with the lowest phoneme error rate (PER) of 0.34 obtained by combining ROI and raw video. Temporal fidelity experiments demonstrate a reliance on fine-grained articulatory dynamics, while ROI ablation studies reveal strong contributions from tongue and lips. Our findings highlight how rtMRI-derived features provide accuracy and interpretability, and establish strategies for leveraging articulatory data in speech processing.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Gated Deformable Network for Breast Tumor Segmentation in MR Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of breast tumors in magnetic resonance images (MRI) is essential for breast cancer diagnosis, yet existing methods face challenges in capturing irregular tumor shapes and effectively integrating local and global features. To address these limitations, we propose an uncertainty-gated deformable network to leverage the complementary information from CNN and Transformers. Specifically, we incorporates deformable feature modeling into both convolution and attention modules, enabling adaptive receptive fields for irregular tumor contours. We also design an Uncertainty-Gated Enhancing Module (U-GEM) to selectively exchange complementary features between CNN and Transformer based on pixel-wise uncertainty, enhancing both local and global representations. Additionally, a Boundary-sensitive Deep Supervision Loss is introduced to further improve tumor boundary delineation. Comprehensive experiments on two clinical breast MRI datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation performance compared with state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its clinical potential for accurate breast tumor delineation.</description>

      <title>DPC-QA Net: A No-Reference Dual-Stream Perceptual and Cellular Quality Assessment Network for Histopathology Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable whole slide imaging (WSI) hinges on image quality,yet staining artefacts, defocus, and cellular degradations are common. We present DPC-QA Net, a no-reference dual-stream network that couples wavelet-based global difference perception with cellular quality assessment from nuclear and membrane embeddings via an Aggr-RWKV module. Cross-attention fusion and multi-term losses align perceptual and cellular cues. Across different datasets, our model detects staining, membrane, and nuclear issues with &gt;92% accuracy and aligns well with usability scores; on LIVEC and KonIQ it outperforms state-of-the-art NR-IQA. A downstream study further shows strong positive correlations between predicted quality and cell recognition accuracy (e.g., nuclei PQ/Dice, membrane boundary F-score), enabling practical pre-screening of WSI regions for computational pathology.</description>

      <title>QWD-GAN: Quality-aware Wavelet-driven GAN for Unsupervised Medical Microscopy Images Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image denoising plays a critical role in biomedical and microscopy imaging, especially when acquiring wide-field fluorescence-stained images. This task faces challenges in multiple fronts, including limitations in image acquisition conditions, complex noise types, algorithm adaptability, and clinical application demands. Although many deep learning-based denoising techniques have demonstrated promising results, further improvements are needed in preserving image details, enhancing algorithmic efficiency, and increasing clinical interpretability. We propose an unsupervised image denoising method based on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture. The approach introduces a multi-scale adaptive generator based on the Wavelet Transform and a dual-branch discriminator that integrates difference perception feature maps with original features. Experimental results on multiple biomedical microscopy image datasets show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art denoising performance, particularly excelling in the preservation of high-frequency information. Furthermore, the dual-branch discriminator is seamlessly compatible with various GAN frameworks. The proposed quality-aware, wavelet-driven GAN denoising model is termed as QWD-GAN.</description>

      <title>The Missing Piece: A Case for Pre-Training in 3D Medical Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale pre-training holds the promise to advance 3D medical object detection, a crucial component of accurate computer-aided diagnosis. Yet, it remains underexplored compared to segmentation, where pre-training has already demonstrated significant benefits. Existing pre-training approaches for 3D object detection rely on 2D medical data or natural image pre-training, failing to fully leverage 3D volumetric information. In this work, we present the first systematic study of how existing pre-training methods can be integrated into state-of-the-art detection architectures, covering both CNNs and Transformers. Our results show that pre-training consistently improves detection performance across various tasks and datasets. Notably, reconstruction-based self-supervised pre-training outperforms supervised pre-training, while contrastive pre-training provides no clear benefit for 3D medical object detection. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnDetection-finetuning.</description>

      <title>SLaM-DiMM: Shared Latent Modeling for Diffusion Based Missing Modality Synthesis in MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain MRI scans are often found in four modalities, consisting of T1-weighted with and without contrast enhancement (T1ce and T1w), T2-weighted imaging (T2w), and Flair. Leveraging complementary information from these different modalities enables models to learn richer, more discriminative features for understanding brain anatomy, which could be used in downstream tasks such as anomaly detection. However, in clinical practice, not all MRI modalities are always available due to various reasons. This makes missing modality generation a critical challenge in medical image analysis. In this paper, we propose SLaM-DiMM, a novel missing modality generation framework that harnesses the power of diffusion models to synthesize any of the four target MRI modalities from other available modalities. Our approach not only generates high-fidelity images but also ensures structural coherence across the depth of the volume through a dedicated coherence enhancement mechanism. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the BraTS-Lighthouse-2025 Challenge dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in synthesizing anatomically plausible and structurally consistent results. Code is available at https://github.com/BheeshmSharma/SLaM-DiMM-MICCAI-BraTS-Challenge-2025.</description>

      <title>FMD-TransUNet: Abdominal Multi-Organ Segmentation Based on Frequency Domain Multi-Axis Representation Learning and Dual Attention Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate abdominal multi-organ segmentation is critical for clinical applications. Although numerous deep learning-based automatic segmentation methods have been developed, they still struggle to segment small, irregular, or anatomically complex organs. Moreover, most current methods focus on spatial-domain analysis, often overlooking the synergistic potential of frequency-domain representations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework named FMD-TransUNet for precise abdominal multi-organ segmentation. It innovatively integrates the Multi-axis External Weight Block (MEWB) and the improved dual attention module (DA+) into the TransUNet framework. The MEWB extracts multi-axis frequency-domain features to capture both global anatomical structures and local boundary details, providing complementary information to spatial-domain representations. The DA+ block utilizes depthwise separable convolutions and incorporates spatial and channel attention mechanisms to enhance feature fusion, reduce redundant information, and narrow the semantic gap between the encoder and decoder. Experimental validation on the Synapse dataset shows that FMD-TransUNet outperforms other recent state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average DSC of 81.32\% and a HD of 16.35 mm across eight abdominal organs. Compared to the baseline model, the average DSC increased by 3.84\%, and the average HD decreased by 15.34 mm. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of FMD-TransUNet in improving the accuracy of abdominal multi-organ segmentation.</description>

      <title>PRISM: Probabilistic and Robust Inverse Solver with Measurement-Conditioned Diffusion Prior for Blind Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models are now commonly used to solve inverse problems in computational imaging. However, most diffusion-based inverse solvers require complete knowledge of the forward operator to be used. In this work, we introduce a novel probabilistic and robust inverse solver with measurement-conditioned diffusion prior (PRISM) to effectively address blind inverse problems. PRISM offers a technical advancement over current methods by incorporating a powerful measurement-conditioned diffusion model into a theoretically principled posterior sampling scheme. Experiments on blind image deblurring validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating the superior performance of PRISM over state-of-the-art baselines in both image and blur kernel recovery.</description>

      <title>Assessing metadata privacy in neuroimaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ethical and legal imperative to share research data without causing harm requires careful attention to privacy risks. While mounting evidence demonstrates that data sharing benefits science, legitimate concerns persist regarding the potential leakage of personal information that could lead to reidentification and subsequent harm. We reviewed metadata accompanying neuroimaging datasets from six heterogeneous studies openly available on OpenNeuro, involving participants across the lifespan, from children to older adults, with and without clinical diagnoses, and including associated clinical score data. Using metaprivBIDS (https://github.com/CPernet/metaprivBIDS), a novel tool for the systematic assessment of privacy in tabular data, we found that privacy is generally well maintained, with serious vulnerabilities being rare. Nonetheless, minor issues were identified in nearly all datasets and warrant mitigation. Notably, clinical score data (e.g., neuropsychological results) posed minimal reidentification risk, whereas demographic variables (age, sex, race, income, and geolocation) represented the principal privacy vulnerabilities. We outline practical measures to address these risks, enabling safer data sharing practices.</description>

      <title>Emulating Human-like Adaptive Vision for Efficient and Flexible Machine Visual Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human vision is highly adaptive, efficiently sampling intricate environments by sequentially fixating on task-relevant regions. In contrast, prevailing machine vision models passively process entire scenes at once, resulting in excessive resource demands scaling with spatial-temporal input resolution and model size, yielding critical limitations impeding both future advancements and real-world application. Here we introduce AdaptiveNN, a general framework aiming to drive a paradigm shift from 'passive' to 'active, adaptive' vision models. AdaptiveNN formulates visual perception as a coarse-to-fine sequential decision-making process, progressively identifying and attending to regions pertinent to the task, incrementally combining information across fixations, and actively concluding observation when sufficient. We establish a theory integrating representation learning with self-rewarding reinforcement learning, enabling end-to-end training of the non-differentiable AdaptiveNN without additional supervision on fixation locations. We assess AdaptiveNN on 17 benchmarks spanning 9 tasks, including large-scale visual recognition, fine-grained discrimination, visual search, processing images from real driving and medical scenarios, language-driven embodied AI, and side-by-side comparisons with humans. AdaptiveNN achieves up to 28x inference cost reduction without sacrificing accuracy, flexibly adapts to varying task demands and resource budgets without retraining, and provides enhanced interpretability via its fixation patterns, demonstrating a promising avenue toward efficient, flexible, and interpretable computer vision. Furthermore, AdaptiveNN exhibits closely human-like perceptual behaviors in many cases, revealing its potential as a valuable tool for investigating visual cognition.

      <title>OSI-flex: Optimization-Based Shearing Interferometry for Joint Phase and Shear Estimation Using a Flexible Open-Source Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shearing interferometry is a common-path quantitative phase imaging technique in which an object beam interferes with a laterally shifted replica of itself, providing high temporal stability, reduced sensitivity to environmental noise, compact design, and compatibility with partially coherent illumination that suppresses coherence-related artifacts. Its principal limitation, however, is that it yields only sheared phase-difference measurements rather than the absolute phase, thereby requiring additional reconstruction step. In this work, we introduce OSI-flex, a flexible, open-source computational framework for quantitative phase reconstruction from sheared phase-difference measurements. The method leverages modern machine learning tools, namely automatic differentiation and the advanced ADAM (Adaptive Moment Estimation) optimizer. The method simultaneously estimates the phase and shear values, enabling it to adapt to experimental conditions where the shear cannot be precisely determined. Because defining shear value is inherently difficult in most systems, yet crucial for effective phase reconstruction, this joint optimization leads to robust and reliable phase retrieval. OSI-flex is highly versatile, supporting arbitrary numbers, magnitudes, and orientations of shear vectors. While optimal reconstruction is achieved with two orthogonal shears, the inclusion of regularization - specifically total variation minimization and sign constraint - enables OSI-flex to remain effective with nonorthogonal or even single-shear measurements. Moreover, OSI-flex accommodates a wide range of shear magnitudes, from subpixel (differential configuration) to several dozen pixels (semi-total shear configuration). Validation with simulations and experimental data confirms quantitative accuracy on calibrated phase objects and demonstrates robustness with 3D-printed cell phantom and follicular thyroid cells.</description>

      <title>HistDiST: Histopathological Diffusion-based Stain Transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining is the cornerstone of histopathology but lacks molecular specificity. While Immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides molecular insights, it is costly and complex, motivating H&amp;E-to-IHC translation as a cost-effective alternative. Existing translation methods are mainly GAN-based, often struggling with training instability and limited structural fidelity, while diffusion-based approaches remain underexplored. We propose HistDiST, a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) based framework for high-fidelity H&amp;E-to-IHC translation. HistDiST introduces a dual-conditioning strategy, utilizing Phikon-extracted morphological embeddings alongside VAE-encoded H&amp;E representations to ensure pathology-relevant context and structural consistency. To overcome brightness biases, we incorporate a rescaled noise schedule, v-prediction, and trailing timesteps, enforcing a zero-SNR condition at the final timestep. During inference, DDIM inversion preserves the morphological structure, while an eta-cosine noise schedule introduces controlled stochasticity, balancing structural consistency and molecular fidelity. Moreover, we propose Molecular Retrieval Accuracy (MRA), a novel pathology-aware metric leveraging GigaPath embeddings to assess molecular relevance. Extensive evaluations on MIST and BCI datasets demonstrate that HistDiST significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 28% improvement in MRA on the H&amp;E-to-Ki67 translation task, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing true IHC semantics.</description>

      <title>Efficient RAW Image Deblurring with Adaptive Frequency Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24407v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image deblurring plays a crucial role in enhancing visual clarity across various applications. Although most deep learning approaches primarily focus on sRGB images, which inherently lose critical information during the image signal processing pipeline, RAW images, being unprocessed and linear, possess superior restoration potential but remain underexplored. Deblurring RAW images presents unique challenges, particularly in handling frequency-dependent blur while maintaining computational efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Frequency Enhanced Network (FrENet), a framework specifically designed for RAW-to-RAW deblurring that operates directly in the frequency domain. We introduce a novel Adaptive Frequency Positional Modulation module, which dynamically adjusts frequency components according to their spectral positions, thereby enabling precise control over the deblurring process. Additionally, frequency domain skip connections are adopted to further preserve high-frequency details. Experimental results demonstrate that FrENet surpasses state-of-the-art deblurring methods in RAW image deblurring, achieving significantly better restoration quality while maintaining high efficiency in terms of reduced MACs. Furthermore, FrENet's adaptability enables it to be extended to sRGB images, where it delivers comparable or superior performance compared to methods specifically designed for sRGB data. The code will be available at https://github.com/WenlongJiao/FrENet .</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Learning for Generalizable Surgical Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in surgical video analysis are transforming operating rooms into intelligent, data-driven environments. Computer-assisted systems support full surgical workflow, from preoperative planning to intraoperative guidance and postoperative assessment. However, developing robust and generalizable models for surgical video understanding remains challenging due to (I) annotation scarcity, (II) spatiotemporal complexity, and (III) domain gap across procedures and institutions. This doctoral research aims to bridge the gap between deep learning-based surgical video analysis in research and its real-world clinical deployment. To address the core challenge of recognizing surgical phases, actions, and events, critical for analysis, I benchmarked state-of-the-art neural network architectures to identify the most effective designs for each task. I further improved performance by proposing novel architectures and integrating advanced modules. Given the high cost of expert annotations and the domain gap across surgical video sources, I focused on reducing reliance on labeled data. We developed semi-supervised frameworks that improve model performance across tasks by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled surgical video. We introduced novel semi-supervised frameworks, including DIST, SemiVT-Surge, and ENCORE, that achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging surgical datasets by leveraging minimal labeled data and enhancing model training through dynamic pseudo-labeling. To support reproducibility and advance the field, we released two multi-task datasets: GynSurg, the largest gynecologic laparoscopy dataset, and Cataract-1K, the largest cataract surgery video dataset. Together, this work contributes to robust, data-efficient, and clinically scalable solutions for surgical video analysis, laying the foundation for generalizable AI systems that can meaningfully impact surgical care and training.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel approach which extends the existing Fully Convolutional One-Stage Object Detector (FCOS) for mitotic figure detection. Our composite model adds a Feedback Attention Ladder CNN (FAL-CNN) model for classification of normal versus abnormal mitotic figures, feeding into a fusion network that is trained to generate adjustments to bounding boxes predicted by FCOS. Our network aims to reduce the false positive rate of the FCOS object detector, to improve the accuracy of object detection and enhance the generalisability of the network. Our model achieved an F1 score of 0.655 for mitosis detection on the preliminary evaluation dataset.</description>

      <title>FLOAT: Generative Motion Latent Flow Matching for Audio-driven Talking Portrait</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01064v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of diffusion-based generative models, portrait image animation has achieved remarkable results. However, it still faces challenges in temporally consistent video generation and fast sampling due to its iterative sampling nature. This paper presents FLOAT, an audio-driven talking portrait video generation method based on flow matching generative model. Instead of a pixel-based latent space, we take advantage of a learned orthogonal motion latent space, enabling efficient generation and editing of temporally consistent motion. To achieve this, we introduce a transformer-based vector field predictor with an effective frame-wise conditioning mechanism. Additionally, our method supports speech-driven emotion enhancement, enabling a natural incorporation of expressive motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art audio-driven talking portrait methods in terms of visual quality, motion fidelity, and efficiency.</description>

      <title>iCBIR-Sli: Interpretable Content-Based Image Retrieval with 2D Slice Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current methods for searching brain MR images rely on text-based approaches, highlighting a significant need for content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems. Directly applying 3D brain MR images to machine learning models offers the benefit of effectively learning the brain's structure; however, building the generalized model necessitates a large amount of training data. While models that consider depth direction and utilize continuous 2D slices have demonstrated success in segmentation and classification tasks involving 3D data, concerns remain. Specifically, using general 2D slices may lead to the oversight of pathological features and discontinuities in depth direction information. Furthermore, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there have been no attempts to develop a practical CBIR system that preserves the entire brain's structural information. In this study, we propose an interpretable CBIR method for brain MR images, named iCBIR-Sli (Interpretable CBIR with 2D Slice Embedding), which, for the first time globally, utilizes a series of 2D slices. iCBIR-Sli addresses the challenges associated with using 2D slices by effectively aggregating slice information, thereby achieving low-dimensional representations with high completeness, usability, robustness, and interoperability, which are qualities essential for effective CBIR. In retrieval evaluation experiments utilizing five publicly available brain MR datasets (ADNI2/3, OASIS3/4, AIBL) for Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal, iCBIR-Sli demonstrated top-1 retrieval performance (macro F1 = 0.859), comparable to existing deep learning models explicitly designed for classification, without the need for an external classifier. Additionally, the method provided high interpretability by clearly identifying the brain regions indicative of the searched-for disease.</description>

      <title>DSDNet: Raw Domain Demoir\'eing via Dual Color-Space Synergy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of mobile imaging, capturing screens using smartphones has become a prevalent practice in distance learning and conference recording. However, moir\'e artifacts, caused by frequency aliasing between display screens and camera sensors, are further amplified by the image signal processing pipeline, leading to severe visual degradation. Existing sRGB domain demoir\'eing methods struggle with irreversible information loss, while recent two-stage raw domain approaches suffer from information bottlenecks and inference inefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a single-stage raw domain demoir\'eing framework, Dual-Stream Demoir\'eing Network (DSDNet), which leverages the synergy of raw and YCbCr images to remove moir\'e while preserving luminance and color fidelity. Specifically, to guide luminance correction and moir\'e removal, we design a raw-to-YCbCr mapping pipeline and introduce the Synergic Attention with Dynamic Modulation (SADM) module. This module enriches the raw-to-sRGB conversion with cross-domain contextual features. Furthermore, to better guide color fidelity, we develop a Luminance-Chrominance Adaptive Transformer (LCAT), which decouples luminance and chrominance representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSDNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and quantitative evaluation and achieves an inference speed $\mathrm{\textbf{2.4x}}$ faster than the second-best method, highlighting its practical advantages. We provide an anonymous online demo at https://xxxxxxxxdsdnet.github.io/DSDNet/.</description>

      <title>The Moon's Many Faces: A Single Unified Transformer for Multimodal Lunar Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal learning is an emerging research topic across multiple disciplines but has rarely been applied to planetary science. In this contribution, we propose a single, unified transformer architecture trained to learn shared representations between multiple sources like grayscale images, Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), surface normals, and albedo maps. The architecture supports flexible translation from any input modality to any target modality. Our results demonstrate that our foundation model learns physically plausible relations across these four modalities. We further identify that image-based 3D reconstruction and albedo estimation (Shape and Albedo from Shading) of lunar images can be formulated as a multimodal learning problem. Our results demonstrate the potential of multimodal learning to solve Shape and Albedo from Shading and provide a new approach for large-scale planetary 3D reconstruction. Adding more input modalities in the future will further improve the results and enable tasks such as photometric normalization and co-registration.</description>
