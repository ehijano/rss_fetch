      <title>Divergent Fluctuations from an Infrared 2D-Mode Catastrophe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular simulations of interfacial polar media routinely employ periodic boundary conditions parallel to the interface. We show that this geometry injects a uniform plane mode ($q_{\parallel}=0$) that converts the plane-averaged electrostatic potential into a cumulative sum of plane-dipole increments, a random walk in $z$. Consequently, the variance of the plane-averaged potential grows linearly with depth in semi-infinite slabs and follows a parabolic Brownian-bridge profile in finite cells with both ends fixed, with an amplitude inversely proportional to the cell's lateral area. Hence, at any finite area, the variance diverges with slab thickness, a 2D-mode catastrophe. In contrast, a pure 1D chain (no lateral replication) and a fully 3D, nonperiodic medium both exhibit bounded fluctuations that saturate with distance. The mechanism is generic to any solver of Poisson's equation with 2D periodicity, so the apparent growth and ultimate divergence in potential fluctuation are artifacts of boundary conditions rather than material response, and we provide a simple scaling criterion for choosing slab sizes that keeps these artifacts under quantitative control.</description>

      <title>A first passage problem for a Poisson counting process with a linear moving boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time to first crossing for the Poisson counting process with respect to a linear moving barrier with offset is a classic problem, although key results remain scattered across the literature and their equivalence is often unclear. Here we present a unified and pedagogical treatment of two approaches: the direct time-domain approach based on path-decomposition techniques and the Laplace-domain approach based on the Pollaczek-Spitzer formula. Beyond streamlining existing derivations and establishing their consistency, we leverage the complementary nature of the two methods to obtain new exact analytical results. Specifically, we derive an explicit large deviation function for the first-passage time distribution in the subcritical regime and closed-form expressions for the conditional mean first-passage time for arbitrary offset. Despite its simplicity, this first crossing process exhibits non-trivial critical behavior and provides a rare example where all the main results of interest can be derived exactly.</description>

      <title>Structural Comparison of Error Mitigation Methods for Ising Machines: Penalty-Spin Model versus Stacked Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Error-mitigation methods for Ising machines are reexamined not merely as noise-suppression techniques but as a structural design problem of replica-coupled Ising models. Using simulated annealing as a hardware-noise-free testbed, we systematically compare the penalty-spin (PS) model, which couples replicas through a centralized auxiliary layer, with the stacked model, which couples adjacent replicas directly. Numerical experiments on the quadratic assignment problem reveal that the ferromagnetically coupled stacked model stably maintains constraint satisfaction and improves solution quality over a broad parameter range, exhibiting favorable scalability with both the number of replicas and problem size. In contrast, the PS model suffers from cooperation collapse at large parallelism: many-replica averaging in the PS layer washes out sparse solution information, preventing effective inter-replica coordination. These findings demonstrate that the topology of inter-replica couplings decisively influences search robustness, and provide practical guidelines for model selection and parameter tuning in constrained optimization.</description>

      <title>Controlling thermal conductivity in harmonic chains with correlated mass and bond disorder: Analytical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate heat transport in one-dimensional harmonic chains with mass disorder and weak bond disorder, coupled at both ends to oscillator heat baths through weak impedance mismatches. The model incorporates correlations in mass disorder, in bond disorder, and between the two. We find that the scaling of thermal conductivity $\kappa$ with system size $N$ is determined solely by either mass disorder or bond disorder. This indicates that cross-correlations between the two types of disorder play no important role in the scaling behavior of $\kappa$. Consequently, by tuning the self-correlations, it is possible to control how the thermal conductivity scales with the system size. Such control could have potential applications in thermoelectric devices and thermal insulation technologies.</description>

      <title>Active alignment-driven coarsening in confined near-critical fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate vapor-liquid phase separation of an active near critical Lennard-Jones fluid confined within a cylindrical pore using molecular dynamics simulations. Activity is introduced via Vicsek-type alignment interactions, enabling a systematic study of how self-propulsion modifies domain morphology and coarsening kinetics under quasi-one-dimensional confinement. In the passive limit, the system undergoes early-time spinodal decomposition (diffusive growth characterized by the Lifshitz-Slyozov exponent $\alpha = 1/3$), followed by the formation of periodically modulated, plug-like liquid domains along the pore axis. At late times, coarsening becomes kinetically arrested, and the system remains trapped in a metastable striped state. Introducing activity destabilizes this arrested morphology by enhancing collective domain transport, leading to frequent domain mergers and complete phase separation at sufficiently high activity. The late-stage coarsening then exhibits a crossover to faster, ballistic growth with an effective exponent $\alpha = 2/3$, consistent with a cluster-coalescence mechanism. Analysis of two-point correlation functions and structure factors confirms dynamic scaling across all activity regimes. Our results demonstrate that alignment-induced activity can overcome confinement-driven kinetic arrest, providing new insight into phase separation in confined active fluids. The relevant growth laws are analyzed and interpreted using appropriate theoretical frameworks.</description>

      <title>A theory of state-to-state transitions based on the framework of classical reaction dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method to describe the population dynamics of distinct configurational states based on a continuous-time description of state-to-state transitions. According to classical reaction dynamics theory, the probability density associated with a given state obeys the Liouville equation, the probability density associate d with a given state obeys the Li ouville equation, including influx from and efflux to neighboring states. By introducing a Markov approximation for the crossing of boundaries separating the states, tractable integral equations governing the state populations are derived. Once the time-dependent quantities appearing in these equations are evaluated, the population dynamics on long timescales can be obtained. Because these quantities depend only on a few states in the local neighborhood of a given state, they can be computed using a set of short-timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We apply the present method to the binding and unbinding kinetics of CH$_4$/CH$_4$, Na$^+$/Cl$^-$, and 18-crown-6-ether (crown ether)/K$^+$ in water. For both kinetics, the time constants estimated from the present method are almost comparable to those obtained from brute-force MD simulations. The required timescale of each MD trajectory in the present method is approximately two orders of magnitude shorter than that in the brute-force MD approach in the crown ether/K$^+$ system. This reduction in the trajectory timescale enables applications to
  complex binding and unbinding sy stems whose characteristic timescales a re far beyond those directly acce ssible by brute-force MD simulati ons.</description>

      <title>Entropic Colloidal Crystal Prediction: A Quantum Density Functional Theory Inspired Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In pursuit of a colloidal analogue to quantum density functional theory (DFT) predictions of atomic crystal structures, we report a new, classical DFT that predicts the relative thermodynamic stability of colloidal crystals of hard, convex particle shapes. In contrast to standard classical DFT approaches, our theory maps the hard particle system to an auxiliary system in which we treat the particles as fixed "nuclei" embedded in a fictitious, spatially varying density field that distributes throughout the auxiliary system. By minimizing the free energy of the auxiliary system, and through comparison with known equations of state and free energy calculations using thermodynamic integration, we show that the auxiliary system with the lowest free energy corresponds to the most probable crystal of hard shapes in the original system.</description>

      <title>Matrix product operator representations for the local conserved quantities of the spin-$1/2$ XYZ chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present explicit matrix product operator (MPO) representations for the local conserved quantities of the spin-$1/2$ XYZ chain. Through these MPO representations, we simplify the coefficients appearing in the local conserved quantities originally derived by one of the authors, and reveal their combinatorial meaning: the coefficients prove to be a polynomial generalization of the Catalan numbers, defined via weighted monotonic lattice paths. Furthermore, we obtain a new simple $3 \times 3$ Lax operator for the XYZ chain that, unlike Baxter's R-matrix, does not involve elliptic functions.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Thermalization and Spectral Imprints of the Hamiltonian in Local Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis explains thermalization in isolated quantum systems through the statistical properties of observables in the energy eigenbasis. We investigate the crossover from integrability to chaos in the spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain, establishing a direct correspondence between the spectral correlations of the Hamiltonian and local observables expressed in the energy eigenbasis as a signature of ergodicity breaking. By introducing a local perturbation that drives the system from integrability to chaos, we track the standard ETH indicators and the eigenstate entanglement entropy. We introduce a submatrix-based framework for analyzing local observables in the energy eigenbasis. By extracting real-symmetric blocks along the diagonal of the local observables represented in eigenbasis, we show that these submatrices exhibit both the short-range and long-range spectral features of the Hamiltonian. Remarkably, this correspondence persists even in a partially ergodic regime, indicating that the emergence of chaos is already encoded locally within the observables' matrix structure and that small blocks are sufficient to capture the underlying spectral correlations.</description>

      <title>Brownian motion with soft constraints in soft matter systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stiff forces, which bind objects together or otherwise confine motion, are found widely in soft-matter systems - colloids with short range attractions, ligand-receptor contacts, particles in optical traps, fibres that resist stretching, etc. To assess the long-term effect of these stiff forces on dynamics and structure, it is useful to consider the limit where they are treated as constraints, so the system evolves strictly within allowed configurations. Efforts to derive equations involving both constraints, and the stochastic motion appropriate at the scales of soft matter, began around 50 years ago, yet, we are still lacking a straightforward way to extract the projected equations and apply them in modern formulations of mesoscale dynamics. Here, we address this gap with two key contributions: (1) a practical summary of the constrained Brownian dynamics equations with ``soft'' constraints, i.e. constraints imposed by stiff forces, which is illustrated through several representative examples, taking care to highlight the nontrivial effects of the constraints; and (2) a novel derivation using singular perturbation theory, establishing the validity of these equations over timescales exceeding the relaxation of stiffly constrained degrees of freedom. We further extend our approach to ``soft soft'' constraints, where mobility varies on lengthscales comparable to the restraining forces - a scenario typical for particles in fluids experiencing hydrodynamic interactions. We hope our results will be useful for soft matter research, as a robust toolkit for studying tethered or confined systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the genuine multipartite Rains entanglement (GMRE) as a measure of genuine multipartite entanglement that can be computed using semi-definite programming. Similar to the Rains relative entropy (its bipartite counterpart), the GMRE is monotone under selective quantum operations that completely preserve the positivity of the partial transpose, implying that it is a multipartite entanglement monotone. As a consequence, we show that the GMRE bounds both the one-shot standard and probabilistic approximate GHZ-distillable entanglement from above. We also develop a generalization of this quantity that incorporates other entropies, including quantum Renyi relative entropies.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Jahn--Teller Transitions in Correlated Oxides with Monte Carlo Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09705v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jahn--Teller (JT) distortions are a key driver of physical properties in many correlated oxide materials. Cooperative JT distortions, in which long-range orbital order reduces the symmetry of the average structure macroscopically, are common in JT-distorted materials at low temperatures. This long-range order will often melt on heating, \textit{via} a transition to a high-temperature state without long-range orbital order. The nature of this transition has been observed to vary with different materials depending on crystal structure; in LaMnO$_3$ the transition has generally been interpreted as order-disorder, whereas in layered nickelates $A$NiO$_2$ ($A$=Li,Na) there is a displacive transition. Alternatively, recent theoretical work has suggested that previous attributions of order-disorder may in fact be a consequence of phonon anharmonicity, rather than persistence of JT distortions, which would suggest that the displacive transition may be more common than currently believed. In this work, we run Monte Carlo simulations with a simple Hamiltonian which is modified to include terms dependent on the JT amplitude $\rho$, which is allowed to vary within the simulation \textit{via} the Metropolis algorithm. Our simulations yield distributions of JT amplitudes consistent with displacive rather than order-disorder behaviour for both perovskites and layered nickelates, suggesting that displacive-like JT transitions may be more common than previously assumed in both perovskites and layered nickelates. We also find significant differences between the transition observed for perovskites compared with layered nickelates, which we attribute to differing extensivity of configurational entropy on the two lattices, showing the crucial role of lattice geometry in determining behaviour.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Ratchet Principle: When Hidden Symmetries Prevent Steady Currents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The "ratchet principle", which states that non-equilibrium systems violating parity symmetry generically exhibit steady-state currents, is one of the few generic results outside thermal equilibrium. We study exceptions to this principle observed in active and passive systems with spatially varying fluctuations sources. For dilute systems, we show that a hidden time-reversal symmetry prevents the emergence of ratchet currents. At higher densities, pairwise forces break this symmetry but an emergent conservation law for the momentum field may nevertheless prevent steady currents. We show how the presence of this conservation law can be tested analytically and characterize the onset of ratchet currents in its absence. Our results show that the ratchet principle should be amended to preclude parity symmetry, time-reversal symmetry, and bulk momentum conservation.</description>

      <title>A Cold Tracer in a Hot Bath: In and Out of Equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a zero-temperature overdamped tracer in a bath of Brownian particles. As the bath density is increased, numerical simulations show the tracer to transition from an active dynamics, characterized by boundary accumulation and ratchet currents, to an effective equilibrium regime. To account for this analytically, we eliminate the bath degrees of freedom under the assumption of linear coupling to the tracer and show convergence, in the large density limit, to an equilibrium dynamics at the bath temperature. We then develop a perturbation theory to characterize the tracer's departure from equilibrium at large but finite bath densities, revealing an intermediate time-reversible yet non-Boltzmann regime, followed by a fully irreversible one. Finally, we show that when the bath particles are connected as a lattice, mimicking a gel or a soft active solid, the cold tracer drives the entire bath out of equilibrium, leading to a long-ranged suppression of bath fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: Pinning down a precise understanding of information flow within physical interactions remains a central concern to fields like stochastic thermodynamics and quantum information science. In both spheres a careful accounting of bits (or qubits) enables a deeper understanding of the physical nature of information. In this work we propose a measure of information flow as a saddle-point solution of the mutual information. This approach places a lower bound on the channel capacity between a particle and an interacting environment. The measure is given by P/2E in nats/sec, with P the average power flux between the particle and its environment, and E the initial average energy of the particle, all computed in a frame where the particle has zero average momentum. We use a communication theory lens to suggest an associated channel analogy, in which this bound is interpreted as a signal-to-noise ratio. We find that this measure can also quantify early-time information flow for a particle interacting with a thermal bath.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanics of a cold tracer in a hot bath</title>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of a zero-temperature particle interacting linearly with a bath of hot Brownian particles. Starting with the most general model of a linearly-coupled bath, we eliminate the bath degrees of freedom exactly to map the tracer dynamics onto a generalized Langevin equation, allowing for an arbitrary external potential on the tracer. We apply this result to determine the fate of a tracer connected by springs to $N$ identical bath particles or inserted within a harmonic chain of hot particles. In the former "fully-connected" case, we find the tracer to transition between an effective equilibrium regime at large $N$ and an FDT-violating regime at finite $N$, while in the latter "loop" model the tracer never satisfies an FDT. We then study the fully-connected model perturbatively for large but finite $N$, demonstrating signatures of irreversibility such as ratchet currents, non-Boltzmann statistics, and positive entropy production. Finally, we specialize to harmonic external potentials on the tracer, allowing us to exactly solve the dynamics of both the tracer and the bath for an arbitrary linear model. We apply our findings to show that a cold tracer in a hot lattice suppresses the fluctuations of the lattice in a long-ranged manner, and we generalize this result to linear elastic field theories.</description>

      <title>Exceptions to the Ratchet Principle in active and passive stochastic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The "ratchet principle" asserts that non-equilibrium systems which violate parity symmetry generically exhibit steady-state currents. As recently shown, there are exceptions to this principle, due to the existence of hidden time-reversal symmetry or bulk momentum conservation. For underdamped and overdamped Brownian dynamics, we show how thermal fluctuations cannot power the momentum sources required to sustain steady ratchet currents, even when time-reversal symmetry is broken due to an inhomogeneous temperature field. While Active Brownian and Run-and-Tumble particles display interaction-induced ratchet currents in asymmetric activity landscapes, we show that this is not the case for Active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles: not all inhomogeneous active fluctuations lead to net momentum sources. For each of the systems considered in this article, we numerically test for the emergence of interaction-induced ratchet currents. We then characterize time-reversal (a)symmetry in position space using a combination of path-integral and operator methods. When the existence of effective momentum conservation is ruled out, we develop perturbation theories to characterize the onset of interaction-induced currents.</description>

      <title>Impurity dynamics in a zero-temperature gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If energy is suddenly released in a localized region of space uniformly filled with identical stationary hard spheres, the outcome is a blast with an asymptotically spherical shock wave separating moving and stationary hard spheres. The radius $R(t)$ of the region filled with the moving spheres grows as $t^{2/(d+2)}$, where $d$ is the spatial dimension. The simplest way to inject energy is to kick a few `impurity' particles. Using hydrodynamics and kinetic theory, we argue that the typical displacement of an impurity scales as $R_{\rm imp} \sim \lambda (R/\lambda)^{(4+3d^2)/(8+3d^2)}$, where $\lambda$ is the mean-free path in the initial state. The number of collisions experienced by each impurity grows as $(R/\lambda)^{(8+2d^2)/(8+3d^2)}$, while its average speed decreases as $t^{-d(8-2d+3d^2)/[(2+d)(8+3d^2)]}$. In $2D$, the predictions for impurity displacement, collision numbers, and speed are $t^{2/5},~t^{2/5}$ and $t^{-2/5}$, respectively. These predictions are in reasonable agreement with the results of molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Electric Dipole Approximation: Electric and Magnetic Multipole Contributions Reveal Biaxial Water Structure from SFG Spectra at the Air-Water Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interpretation of sum-frequency-generation (SFG) spectra has been severely limited by the absence of quantitative theoretical predictions of higher-order multipole contributions. Magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole contributions are determined by bulk properties but appear in all experimental SFG spectra, obscuring the connection between measured spectra and interfacial structure. We present the simulation-based framework to predict the full set of multipole spectral contributions. This framework also yields depth-resolved spectra, enabling the precise spatial localization of spectroscopic features. Applied to the air-water interface, our approach achieves quantitative agreement with experimental spectra for different polarization combinations in both the bending and stretching regions. Higher-order multipole contributions are crucial for correctly interpreting SFG spectra: in the bending band, the electric dipole and the magnetic dipole contributions have similar intensities, while the electric quadrupole contribution is significantly larger. In the OH-stretch region, the electric quadrupole contribution is found to be in large part responsible for the characteristic shoulder at 3600/cm. Crucially, subtracting the quadrupole and magnetic contributions isolates the second-order electric dipole susceptibility, which is a quantitative probe for interfacial molecular orientational anisotropy. This electric-dipole susceptibility reveals a pronounced biaxial ordering of water at the air-water interface. By resolving a fundamental limitation of the interpretation of SFG spectroscopy, our framework allows for the detailed extraction of interfacial water ordering from SFG spectra.</description>

      <title>Topological Defect Formation Beyond the Kibble-Zurek Mechanism in Crossover Transitions with Approximate Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of topological defects during continuous second-order phase transitions is well described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). However, when the spontaneously broken symmetry is only approximate, such transitions become smooth crossovers, and the applicability of KZM in these scenarios remains an open question. In this work, we address this problem by analyzing both a weakly coupled Ginzburg-Landau model and a strongly coupled holographic setup, each featuring pseudo-spontaneous breaking of a global U(1) symmetry. In the slow quench regime, we observe a breakdown of the universal power-law scaling predicted by the Kibble-Zurek Mechanism. Specifically, the defect density acquires an exponential correction dependent on the quench rate, following a universal form dictated by the source of explicit symmetry breaking. Although these dynamics extend beyond the scope of the traditional KZM, we demonstrate that a generalized framework, that incorporates the effects of explicit symmetry breaking into the dynamical correlation length, remains valid and accurately captures the non-equilibrium defect formation across the entire range of quench rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method for approximating the large deviation rate function of time-integrated observables of diffusion processes, used in statistical physics to characterize the fluctuations of nonequilibrium systems. The method is based on linearizing the effective process associated with the large deviations of the process and observable considered, and is tested for a simple one-dimensional nonlinear diffusion model involving a cubic drift. The results show that the linear approximation compares well with the exact rate function, especially in the large fluctuation regime, and that its accuracy is related to the way the linearized process localizes in space. Possible extensions and applications to more complex diffusion models are proposed for future work.</description>

      <title>Bond percolation in distorted square and triangular lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a Monte Carlo study on bond percolation in distorted square and triangular lattices. The distorted lattices are generated by dislocating the sites from their regular positions. The amount and direction of the dislocations are random, but can be tuned by the distortion parameter $\alpha$. Once the sites are dislocated, the bond lengths $\delta$ between the nearest neighbors change. A bond can only be occupied if its bond length is less than a threshold value called the connection threshold $d$. It is observed that when the connection threshold is greater than the lattice constant (assumed to be $1$), the bond percolation threshold $p_\mathrm{b}$ always increases with distortion. For $d\le 1$, no spanning configuration is found for the square lattice when the lattice is distorted, even very slightly. On the other hand, the triangular lattice not only spans for $d\le 1$, it also shows a decreasing trend for $p_\mathrm{b}$ in the low-$\alpha$ range. These variation patterns have been linked with the average coordination numbers of the distorted lattices. A critical value $d_\mathrm{c}$ for the connection threshold has been defined as the value of $d$ below which no spanning configuration can be found even after occupying all the bonds satisfying the connection criterion $\delta\le d$. The behavior of $d_\mathrm{c}(\alpha)$ is markedly different for the two lattices.</description>

      <title>Generalized Finite-time Optimal Control Framework in Stochastic Thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00974v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal processes in stochastic thermodynamics are a frontier for understanding the control and design of non-equilibrium systems, with broad practical applications in biology, chemistry, and nanoscale/mesoscale systems. Optimal mass transport theory and thermodynamic geometry have emerged as optimal control methodology, but they are based on slow-driving and close to equilibrium assumptions. An optimal control framework in stochastic thermodynamics for finite time driving is still elusive. Therefore, we solve in this paper an optimal control problem for changing the control parameters of a discrete-state far-from-equilibrium process from an initial to a final value in finite-time. Optimal driving protocols are derived that minimize the total finite-time dissipation cost for the driving process. Our framework reveals that discontinuous endpoint jumps are a generic, model-independent physical mechanism that minimizes the optimal driving entropy production, whose importance is further amplified for far-from-equilibrium systems. The thermodynamic and dynamic physical interpretation and understanding of discontinuous endpoint jumps is formulated. An exact mapping between the finite-time to slow driving optimal control formulation is elucidated, developing the state-of-the-art of optimal mass transport theory and thermodynamic geometry, which has been the current paradigm for studying optimal processes in stochastic thermodynamics that relies on slow driving assumptions. Our framework opens up a plethora of applications to the thermodynamically efficient control of a far-from-equilibrium system in finite-time, which opens up a way to their efficient design principles.</description>

Abstract: The partition functions of ferromagnetic Ising models of square lattices in a finite magnetic field is deduced using topological considerations within a heuristic graph-theoretical approach. These equations are derived separately for low and high temperature regimes while the exact solution of Onsager is obtained therefrom when the magnetic field is zero. The derived partition function equations here are almost similar to those given by Onsager, thus indicating a straight-forward protocol, even when the magnetic field is present. The spontaneous magnetization derived here using the Helmholtz free energy is identical with that arising from the exact solution. The partition functions lead to the known series expansions of the magnetization and zero-field susceptibility.</description>

      <title>Unavoidable Canonical Nonlinearity Induced by Gaussian Measures Discretization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When we consider canonical averages for classical discrete systems, typically referred to as substitutional alloys, the map phi from many-body interatomic interactions to thermodynamic equilibrium configurations generally exhibits complicated nonlinearity. This canonical nonlinearity is fundamentally rooted in deviations of the discrete configurational density of states (CDOS) from continuous Gaussian families, and has conventionally been characterized by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence on discrete statistical manifold. Thus, the previous works inevitablly missed intrinsic nonlinearities induced by discretization of Gaussian families, which remains invisible within conventional information-geometric descriptions. In the present work, we identify and quantify such unavoidable canonical nonlinearity by employing the 2-Wasserstein distance with a cost function aligned with the Fisher metric for Gaussian families. We derive an explicit expression for the Wasserstein distance in the limit of vanishing discretization scale d to 0: W2 = d*sqrt(Tr(Gamma)^(-1)/12), where Gamma denotes covariance matrix of the CDOS. We further show that this limiting Wasserstein distance admits a clear geometric interpretation on the statistical manifold, equivalent to a KL divergence associated with the expected parallel translations of continuous Gaussian. Our framework thus provides a transport-information-geometric characterization of discretization-induced nonlinearity in classical discrete systems. In addition, we confirm that this W2-KL equivalence admits a natural generalization beyond Gaussian families, provided that the transport cost is aligned with the Fisher metric of an underlying statistical submanifold and the discretization scale induces infinitesimal parameter variations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light can be squeezed by reducing the quantum uncertainty of the electric field for some phases. We show how to use this purely quantum effect to extract net mechanical work from radiation pressure in a simple quantum photon engine. Along the way, we demonstrate that the standard definition of work in quantum systems does not capture the extractable mechanical work, as it does not reflect the energy leaked to these quantum degrees of freedom. We use these results to design an Otto engine able to produce mechanical work from squeezing baths, in the absence of a thermal gradient. Interestingly, while work extraction from squeezing generally improves for low temperatures, there exists a nontrivial squeezing-dependent temperature for which work production is maximal, demonstrating the complex interplay between thermal and squeezing effects.</description>

      <title>A Magnetic-like Model for Chemotactic Navigation in Ants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a physical framework for ant navigation of chemical trails. For this, we use controlled experiments in which individuals follow narrow pheromone trails, for which ants display oscillatory motion, as previously reported in the literature. We model this behavior by treating chemotaxis as an effective magnetic interaction between the ant velocity and the local chemical gradient. Under suitable approximations, the model yields an analytical expression for the velocity correlations in the direction perpendicular to the trail, predicting an underdamped oscillatory decay. This theoretical prediction is in qualitative agreement with our experimental measurements, indicating that the model captures the essential dynamical features of ant trail following. We fit the model parameters to individual trajectories in order to assess the consistency of the underlying assumptions, finding the same parameter relationship in both theory and experiment. Our results contribute to the characterization of chemotactic navigation in ants and illustrate how physical modeling can provide mechanistic insights into complex biological dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19998v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urban-induced changes in local microclimate, such as urban heat islands and air pollution, are known to vary with city size, leading to distinctive relations between average climate variables and city-scale quantities (e.g., total population). However, these approaches suffer from biases related to the choice of city boundaries and they neglect intra-urban variations of urban characteristics. Here, we use high-resolution data of urban temperatures, air quality, population, and street networks from 142 cities worldwide and show that their marginal and joint probability distributions collapse onto a set of general scaling functions. Using a logarithmic relation between urban spatial features and climate variables, we find that average street network properties are sufficient to characterize the entire variability of the temperature and air pollution fields observed within and across cities. These findings provide a unified statistical framework for characterizing intra-urban climate variability, with important implications for climate modeling and urban planning.</description>

      <title>The Topological Origin of Bohm Resistivity in Magnetic Reconnection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physical origin of 'anomalous' resistivity in magnetic reconnection remains one of the longest-standing problems in space plasma physics. While the empirical Bohm diffusion scaling ($\eta~\propto~T/B$) is widely invoked to explain fast reconnection rates, it lacks a rigorous derivation from first principles. Here, we derive this scaling by modeling the magnetized electron fluid as an overdamped spintronic condensate governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We demonstrate that the breakdown of the "frozen-in" condition is rigorously identified as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation in the model: a topological phase transition where electron gyro-axes lose synchronization with the magnetic field. By rigorously mapping the breakdown of adiabatic invariance to electron gyro axis slippage on the unit sphere, we show that the resulting resistivity naturally saturates at the Bohm limit. Numerical simulations of the $XY$ universality class confirm that the onset of this resistive state is explosive, following a logistic trigger consistent with the impulsive phase of solar flares. Furthermore, the topological defects in the condensate decay via a $t^{-0.75}$ power law, consistent with magnetic island coalescence as the mechanism of anomalous transport. These results suggest that Bohm resistivity is a universal topological property of magnetized matter at the critical point of reconnection.</description>

Abstract: Remarkably, even under negligible inertia, the addition of microstructural agents can generate chaotic flow fields. Such behavior can arise in polymer solutions, leading to elastic turbulence, or from active, self-driven particles, which generate active turbulence. Here, we demonstrate a close and hitherto unrecognized connection between these two classes of turbulence. Specifically, we reveal that their continuum descriptions are analogous at the macroscopic level, such that polymeric fluids can be interpreted as a deformable analogue of contractile active matter. Moreover, our numerical results for Kolmogorov flow demonstrate that the transition into the well-known traveling arrowhead structures in elastic turbulence is marked by the emergence of $\pm 1/2$ topological defects, long recognized as a defining feature of active turbulence, in the polymer director field. Importantly, these coherent structures originate from a transverse instability driven by activity-like gradients generated by anisotropically stretched, contractile polymers. At sufficiently strong activity, the system undergoes a transition into a flow-suppressed state characterized by weak polymer stretching and ordering, a behavior that can be explained by analogy with the spontaneous-flow transition observed in channel-confined active nematics.</description>
