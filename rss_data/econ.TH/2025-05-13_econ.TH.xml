      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08425v1 Announce Type: new

      <title>Optimal Prize Design in Parallel Rank-order Contests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a two-stage game-theoretical model with multiple parallel rank-order contests. In this model, each contest designer sets up a contest and determines the prize structure within a fixed budget in the first stage. Contestants choose which contest to participate in and exert costly effort to compete against other participants in the second stage. First, we fully characterize the symmetric Bayesian Nash equilibrium in the subgame of contestants, accounting for both contest selection and effort exertion, under any given prize structures. Notably, we find that, regardless of whether contestants know the number of participants in their chosen contest, the equilibrium remains unchanged in expectation. Next, we analyze the designers' strategies under two types of objective functions based on effort and participation, respectively. For a broad range of effort-based objectives, we demonstrate that the winner-takes-all prize structure-optimal in the single-contest setting-remains a dominant strategy for all designers. For the participation objective, which maximizes the number of participants surpassing a skill threshold, we show that the optimal prize structure is always a simple contest. Furthermore, the equilibrium among designers is computationally tractable when they share a common threshold.</description>

      <title>Paired Course and Dorm Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02686v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a university administrator who must assign students to both courses and dorms and runs (random) serial dictatorship independently in each market. While serial dictatorship is efficient for each individual matching problem holding the other fixed, Pareto improvements can be found via students jointly trading their allocated course and dorm. To align priorities with students' relative preferences between courses and dorms, we introduce paired serial dictatorship: a novel mechanism where students signal relative preferences to influence their priority in each market. Any deterministic allocation that arises in equilibrium is Pareto efficient, pointing towards ad-hoc tie-breaking as the key barrier to optimality. When students differ only in relative preferences, paired serial dictatorship ex-ante Pareto dominates running random serial dictatorship in each market. Such gains are realized despite students never reporting full preferences, a key advantage over other combinatorial allocation mechanisms that scale poorly with problem size.</description>

      <title>Matching, Unanticipated Experiences, Divorce, Flirting, Rematching, Etc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study dynamic decentralized two-sided matching in which players may encounter unanticipated experiences. As they become aware of these experiences, they may change their preferences over players on the other side of the market. Consequently, they may get ``divorced'' and rematch again with other agents, which may lead to further unanticipated experiences etc. A matching is stable if there is absence of pairwise common belief in blocking. Stable matchings can be destabilized by unanticipated experiences. Yet, we show that there exist self-confirming outcomes that are stable and do not lead to further unanticipated experiences. We introduce a natural decentralized matching process that, at each period assigns probability $1 - \varepsilon$ to the satisfaction of a mutual optimal blocking pair (if it exists) and picks any optimal blocking pair otherwise. The parameter $\varepsilon$ is interpreted as a friction of the matching market. We show that for any decentralized matching process, frictions are necessary for convergence to stability even without unawareness. Our process converges to self-confirming stable outcomes. Further, we allow for bilateral communication/flirting that changes the awareness and say that a matching is flirt-proof stable if there is absence of communication leading to pairwise common belief in blocking. We show that our natural decentralized matching process converges to flirt-proof self-confirming outcomes.</description>

      <title>A Prudent Framework for Understanding Risk-Awareness in Demand Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that risk-aware behaviors in demand response originate from superquadratic state-dependent cost functions and price uncertainty with skewed distributions. We obtain such results through developing a novel theoretical demand response framework that combines non-anticipatory multi-stage decision-making with superquadratic cost functions. We introduce the concept of prudent demand, defined by a positive third-order derivative of the cost function, which is the first principle for risk-averse behavior despite a risk-neutral objective. Our analysis establishes that future price uncertainty affects immediate consumption decisions, and the extent of this response scales proportionally with the skewness of the price distribution. We visualize our theoretical findings through numerical simulations and illustrate their practical implications using a real-world case study.</description>
