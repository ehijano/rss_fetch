      <title>Harnessing micro-Fabry-Perot reference cavities in photonic integrated circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact photonic systems that offer high frequency stability and low noise are of increasing importance to applications in precision metrology, quantum computing, communication, and advanced sensing technologies. However, on-chip resonators comprised of dielectrics cannot match the frequency stability and noise characteristics of Fabry-Perot cavities, whose electromagnetic modes live almost entirely in vacuum. In this study, we present a novel strategy to interface micro-fabricated Fabry-Perot cavities with photonic integrated circuits to realize compact, high-performance integrated systems. Using this new integration approach, we demonstrate self-injection locking of an on-chip laser to a milimeter-scale vacuum-gap Fabry-Perot using a circuit interface that transforms the reflected cavity response to enable efficient feedback to the laser. This system achieves a phase noise of -97 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz offset frequency, a fractional frequency stability of 5*10-13 at 10 ms, a 150 Hz 1/pi integral linewidth, and a 35 mHz fundamental linewidth. We also present a complementary integration strategy that utilizes a vertical emission grating coupler and a back-reflection cancellation circuit to realize a fully co-integrated module that effectively redirects the reflected signals and isolates back-reflections with a 10 dB suppression ratio, readily adaptable for on-chip PDH locking. Together, these demonstrations significantly enhance the precision and functionality of RF photonic systems, paving the way for continued advancements in photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Programmable lattices for non-Abelian topological photonics and braiding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Abelian physics, originating from noncommutative sequences of operations, unveils novel topological degrees of freedom for advancing band theory and quantum computation. In photonics, significant efforts have been devoted to developing reconfigurable non-Abelian platforms, serving both as classical testbeds for non-Abelian quantum phenomena and as programmable systems that harness topological complexities. Here we establish topological spinor lattices for non-Abelian programmable photonics. We design a building block for reconfigurable unitary coupling between pseudospin resonances, achieving a universal set of rotation gates through coupling along the unit cell boundary. The lattice assembly of our building blocks enables the emulation of the extended quantum Hall family across various eigenspinor bases. Particularly, we reveal the emergence of a non-Abelian interface even when the bulks are Abelian, which allows the topologically trivial engineering of topologically protected edge states. We also define the braid group for pseudospin observables, demonstrating non-Abelian braiding operations and the Yang-Baxter relations. Our results pave the way for realizing a reconfigurable testbed for a wide class of Abelian and non-Abelian topological phenomena and braiding operations.</description>

      <title>Measuring Blackbody Noise in Silica Optical Fibres for Quantum and Classical Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deployment of practical quantum networks, which operate at or near single photon levels, requires carefully quantifying noise processes. We investigate noise due to blackbody radiation emitted into the guided mode of silica single mode optical fibres near room temperature, which to date is under-explored in the literature. We utilise a single photon avalanche detector and lock in detection to measure $\approx$0.1 photons/s/THz ($\approx$-170dBm/THz) at 40{\deg}C near the optically thick limit of 20km in silica fibre. We also measure a coarse spectrum to validate the blackbody behaviour, and observe a prominent anomaly around the 1430nm CWDM channel, likely due to -OH impurities. Though the magnitude of this noise is small, it is additive noise which imposes a fundamental limit in raw fidelity in quantum communication, and a fundamental noise floor in classical communication over optical fibres.</description>

      <title>Superluminal spacetime boundary, time reflection and quantum light generation from relativistic plasma mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A plasma mirror is an optical device for high-power, ultrashort-wavelength electromagnetic fields, utilizing a sheet of relativistic oscillating electrons to generate and manipulate light. In this work, we propose that the spatiotemporally varying plasma oscillation, induced by an ultra-high-intensity laser beam, functions as a "spacetime mirror" with significant potential for exploring quantum light. We find that the spacetime mirror exhibits several exotic features: (i) a superluminal spacetime boundary, (ii) time reflection and refraction, and (iii) quantum light sources with pair generation. Our theoretical and simulation results are in excellent agreement, and experimental verification is underway. Our work demonstrates the interplay with emerging fields such as time varying media, suggesting the plasma mirror as an ideal platform to study strong-field quantum optics at extremes.</description>

      <title>Design, fabrication, and testing of diamond axicons for X-ray microscopy applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the design, fabrication, and experimental validation of a refractive diamond axicon for X-ray beam shaping. The diamond axicon was developed to overcome the limitations of polymer-based axicons particularly for application in Transmission X-ray Microscopy (TXM) systems, offering superior mechanical strength, thermal stability, and radiation resistance, making it ideal for synchrotron applications. The axicon was fabricated using femtosecond laser ablation and tested at 11 keV under various coherence conditions. Results demonstrated that the axicon efficiently transformed the X-ray beam into a ring-shaped profile with over 80% transmission. Simulations confirmed the experimental findings and highlighted the potential for further improvements. This work paves the way for the use of diamond axicons in next-generation synchrotron facilities, with future efforts focusing on optimizing fabrication and testing the axicon in full TXM systems.</description>

      <title>Two-level atom witness of thermalization of multimode optical fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present project, we study the dynamics of the two-level system coupled with the multimode optical system. In particular, we considered a square lattice of optical fibers. We aimed to answer whether we can infer information about the thermalization of optical modes through the thermalization of two-level atoms. After averaging over the set of modes, the dynamic of the two-level system is free of quantum revivals, and that is the signature of thermalization. We showed that the temperature of the two-level system increases with the temperature of optical modes and mean photon number. In the high-temperature limit of optical modes, the temperature of the level system tends to be infinity, and level populations are equal.</description>

      <title>Topological one-way Weyl fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological photonics enables unprecedented photon manipulation by realizing various topological states, such as corner states, edge states, and surface states. However, achieving a topological fiber state has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate a topological fiber state in a Weyl gyromagnetic photonic crystal fiber. By applying an in-plane magnetic bias to a gyromagnetic photonic crystal fiber with broken parity-inversion symmetry, we create an asymmetrical Weyl bandgap that supports one-way fiber states associated with type-II Weyl points. Dispersion and topological invariant calculations reveal the transition from Weyl surface states to one-way Weyl fiber states. Electromagnetic field simulations confirm the existence of one-way Weyl fiber states and their robust transport in the presence of metallic obstacle along the transport path. Our findings offer an intriguing pathway for exploring novel topological states and guiding the design of topological fibers.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian ultra-strong bosonic condensation through interaction-induced caging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We uncover a new mechanism whereby the triple interplay of non-Hermitian pumping, bosonic interactions and nontrivial band topology leads to ultra-strong bosonic condensation. The extent of condensation goes beyond what is naively expected from the interaction-induced trapping of non-Hermitian pumped states, and is based on an emergent caging mechanism that can be further enhanced by topological boundary modes. Beyond our minimal model with 2 bosons, this caging remains applicable for generic many-boson systems subject to a broad range of density interactions and non-Hermitian hopping asymmetry. Our novel new mechanism for particle localization and condensation would inspire fundamental shifts in our comprehension of many-body non-Hermitian dynamics and open new avenues for controlling and manipulating bosons.</description>

      <title>Automated Curvy Waveguide Routing for Large-Scale Photonic Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As photonic integrated circuit (PIC) designs advance and grow in complexity, largely driven by innovations in photonic computing and interconnects, traditional manual physical design processes have become increasingly cumbersome. Available PIC layout automation tools are mostly schematic-driven, which has not alleviated the burden of manual waveguide planning and layout drawing for engineers. Previous research in automated PIC routing largely relies on off-the-shelf algorithms designed for electrical circuits, which only support high-level route planning to minimize waveguide crossings. It is not customized to handle unique photonics-specific routing constraints and metrics, such as curvy waveguides, bending, port alignment, and insertion loss. These approaches struggle with large-scale PICs and cannot produce real layout geometries without design-rule violations (DRVs). This highlights the pressing need for electronic-photonic design automation (EPDA) tools that can streamline the physical design of modern PICs. In this paper, for the first time, we propose an open-source automated PIC detailed routing tool, dubbed APR, to generate DRV-free PIC layout for large-scale real-world PICs. APR features a grid-based curvy-aware A* engine with adaptive crossing insertion, congestion-aware net ordering and objective, and crossing-waveguide optimization scheme, all tailored to the unique property of PIC. On large-scale real-world photonic computing cores and interconnects, APR generates a DRV-free layout with 14% lower insertion loss and 6.25x speedup than prior methods, paving the way for future advancements in the EPDA toolchain. Our codes are open-sourced at https://github.com/ScopeX-ASU/APR.</description>

      <title>Statistical Virtual Temperature of Classical and Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a foundational definition of statistical virtual temperature, derived from the spectrum of the Gibbs Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) state and formulated using d-1 indices of purity (IP), where d represents the Hilbert space dimension within the C*-algebra framework. We demonstrate that the universal physical bounds between von Neumann entropy and statistical virtual temperature are constrained by these IPs, which may offer broader applications to quantum systems. Additionally, we geometrize classical optical polarization states of an arbitrary electromagnetic field and provide an interpretation of the quantum Mpemba effect, where a quantum system prepared at a higher statistical virtual temperature relaxes to equilibrium faster than one at a lower temperature. This behavior is explained through a novel concept of temperature-resolved entanglement asymmetry. Additionally, we present a geometric interpretation of the third law of thermodynamics using these entropy-temperature diagrams. Nevertheless, the defined statistical virtual temperature inherently exhibits the third law of thermodynamics. We believe that this work has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of classical polarization theory, quantum information theory, and quantum thermodynamics, and it may establish new connections and insights into these fields.</description>

      <title>The Unlikely Hero: Nonideality in Analog Photonic Neural Networks as Built-in Defender Against Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic-photonic computing systems have emerged as a promising platform for accelerating deep neural network (DNN) workloads. Major efforts have been focused on countering hardware non-idealities and boosting efficiency with various hardware/algorithm co-design methods. However, the adversarial robustness of such photonic analog mixed-signal AI hardware remains unexplored. Though the hardware variations can be mitigated with robustness-driven optimization methods, malicious attacks on the hardware show distinct behaviors from noises, which requires a customized protection method tailored to optical analog hardware. In this work, we rethink the role of conventionally undesired non-idealities in photonic analog accelerators and claim their surprising effects on defending against adversarial weight attacks. Inspired by the protection effects from DNN quantization and pruning, we propose a synergistic defense framework tailored for optical analog hardware that proactively protects sensitive weights via pre-attack unary weight encoding and post-attack vulnerability-aware weight locking. Efficiency-reliability trade-offs are formulated as constrained optimization problems and efficiently solved offline without model re-training costs. Extensive evaluation of various DNN benchmarks with a multi-core photonic accelerator shows that our framework maintains near-ideal on-chip inference accuracy under adversarial bit-flip attacks with merely &lt;3% memory overhead.

      <title>ADEPT-Z: Zero-Shot Automated Circuit Topology Search for Pareto-Optimal Photonic Tensor Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic tensor cores (PTCs) are essential building blocks for optical artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators based on programmable photonic integrated circuits. Most PTC designs today are manually constructed, with low design efficiency and unsatisfying solution quality. This makes it challenging to meet various hardware specifications and keep up with rapidly evolving AI applications. Prior work has explored gradient-based methods to learn a good PTC structure differentiably. However, it suffers from slow training speed and optimization difficulty when handling multiple non-differentiable objectives and constraints. Therefore, in this work, we propose a more flexible and efficient zero-shot multi-objective evolutionary topology search framework ADEPT-Z that explores Pareto-optimal PTC designs with advanced devices in a larger search space. Multiple objectives can be co-optimized while honoring complicated hardware constraints. With only &lt;3 hours of search, we can obtain tens of diverse Pareto-optimal solutions, 100x faster than the prior gradient-based method, outperforming prior manual designs with 2x higher accuracy weighted area-energy efficiency. The code of ADEPT-Z is available at https://github.com/ScopeX-ASU/ADEPT-Z.</description>

      <title>Quantum Photonic Gates with Two-Dimensional Random Walkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum gates are essential elements for processing quantum information. However, realizing them in a photonic platform is challenging due to the unique way photons propagate and interfere. In this study, we introduce new design of quantum photonic gates that operate based on continuous time two-dimensional random walking photons. These gates can be implemented using the inverse design method, where photons randomly walk in a two-dimensional silicon host medium embedded with silicon dioxide scatterers. We propose a C-NOT gate as a multiqubit gate and an X-gate as a single qubit gate. We will also provide numerical demonstrations of the gate operations using quantum formalism. Additionally, our investigation involves studying the non-trivial spatial correlations of random walking photons by utilizing the quantum correlation function. The results demonstrate high-fidelity probabilistic quantum gates. Further work is required to address error-correction. This work advances the practical implementation of integrated photonics in linear quantum optics.</description>

      <title>$^{229}\mathrm{ThF}_4$ thin films for solid-state nuclear clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After nearly fifty years of searching, the vacuum ultraviolet $^{229}$Th nuclear isomeric transition has recently been directly laser excited [1,2] and measured with high spectroscopic precision [3]. Nuclear clocks based on this transition are expected to be more robust [4,5] than and may outperform [6,7] current optical atomic clocks. They also promise sensitive tests for new physics beyond the standard model [5,8,9]. In light of these important advances and applications, a dramatic increase in the need for $^{229}$Th spectroscopy targets in a variety of platforms is anticipated. However, the growth and handling of high-concentration $^{229}$Th-doped crystals [5] used in previous measurements [1-3,10] are challenging due to the scarcity and radioactivity of the $^{229}$Th material. Here, we demonstrate a potentially scalable solution to these problems by demonstrating laser excitation of the nuclear transition in $^{229}$ThF$_4$ thin films grown with a physical vapor deposition process, consuming only micrograms of $^{229}$Th material. The $^{229}$ThF$_4$ thin films are intrinsically compatible with photonics platforms and nanofabrication tools for integration with laser sources and detectors, paving the way for an integrated and field-deployable solid-state nuclear clock with radioactivity up to three orders of magnitude smaller than typical \thor-doped crystals [1-3,10]. The high nuclear emitter density in $^{229}$ThF$_4$ also potentially enables quantum optics studies in a new regime. Finally, we describe the operation and present the estimation of the performance of a nuclear clock based on a defect-free ThF$_4$ crystal.</description>

      <title>Thermal Purcell effect and cavity-induced renormalization of dissipations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years there has been great interest towards optical cavities as a tool to manipulate the properties and phases of embedded quantum materials. Due to the Purcell effect, a cavity changes the photon phase space and thus the rate of electromagnetic transitions within the material, modifying the exchange rate of heat radiation with the photon environment. Here, I derive a simple expression for the radiative heat power absorbed by the material, investigate how it changes in the presence of a cavity and show that it is enhanced dramatically for appropriate cavity geometries. I compare this effect with typical energy dissipation processes, provide a criterion to establish its impact on the temperature of a material coupled to the cavity and apply it to 1T-TaS$_2$.</description>

      <title>All-optical Saddle Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superposition of frequency-shifted Laguerre-Gauss modes can produce a rotating saddle-like intensity profile. When spinning fast enough, the optical forces produced by this structured light saddle generate a dynamically stable equilibrium point capable of trapping nanoparticles in a high vacuum, akin to a Paul trap but with its unique characteristics. We analyze the stability conditions and center-of-mass motion, dynamics and cooling of a nanoparticle levitated in the optical saddle trap. We expect the optical saddle to find applications in levitated optomechanics experiments requiring fast parametric modulation and inverted squeezing potential landscapes.</description>

      <title>Methane Sensing via Unbalanced Nonlinear Interferometry using a CMOS Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we present a high-sensitivity, rapid, and low-cost method for methane sensing based on a nonlinear interferometer. This method utilizes signal photons generated by stimulated parametric down-conversion (ST-PDC), enabling the use of a silicon detector to capture high-precision methane absorption spectra in the mid-infrared region. By controlling the system loss, we achieve more significant changes in visibility, thereby increasing sensitivity. The methane concentration within a gas cell is determined accurately. In addition, ST-PDC enables long-distance sensing and the capability to measure low ambient methane concentrations in the real world. A low-cost CMOS camera is employed to capture spatial interference fringes, ensuring fast and efficient detection.</description>

      <title>Quantum correlations, mixed states and bistability at the onset of lasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a model for a single mode laser that includes all two particle quantum correlations between photons and electrons. In contrast to the predictions of semi-classical models, we find that lasing takes place in the presence of quantum bistability between a non-lasing and a non-classical coherent state. The coherent state is characterized by a central frequency and a finite linewidth and emerges with finite amplitude from a saddle-node bifurcation together with an unstable coherent state. Hence coherent emission in nanolasers originates through a mixing of lasing and non-lasing states. In the limit of a macrolaser with a large number of emitters and non-resonant modes, the laser threshold approaches the prediction of the semi-classical theory, but with the important difference that lasing can be achieved only in the presence of finite size perturbations.</description>
