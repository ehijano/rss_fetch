      <title>Modeling for the Growth of Unorganized Retailing in the Presence of Organized and E-Retailing in Indian Pharmaceutical Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study considers the rural pharmaceutical retail sector in India, where the arrival of organized retailers and e-retailers is testing the survival strategies of unorganized retailers. Grounded in a field investigation of the Indian pharmaceutical retail sector, this study integrates primary data collection, consumer conjoint analysis and design of experiments to develop an empirically grounded agent-based simulation of multi-channel competition among unorganized, organized and e-pharmaceutical retailers. The results of the conjoint analysis reveal that store attributes of price discount, quality of products offered, variety of assortment, and degree of personalized service, and customer attributes of distance, degree of mobility, and degree of emergency are key determinants of optimal store choice strategies. The primary insight obtained from the agent-based modeling is that the attribute levels of each individual retailer have some effect on other retailers performance. The field-calibrated simulation also evidenced counterintuitive behavior that an increase in unorganized price discounts initially leads to an increase in average footprint at unorganized retailers, but eventually leads to these retailers moving out of the market. Hence, the unorganized retailers should not increase the price discount offered beyond a tipping point or it will be detrimental to them. Another counterintuitive behavior found was that high emergency customers give less importance to variety of assortment than low emergency customers. This study aids in understanding the levers for policy design towards improving the competition dynamics among retail channels in the pharmaceutical retail sector in India.</description>

      <title>Weather-Aware AI Systems versus Route-Optimization AI: A Comprehensive Analysis of AI Applications in Transportation Productivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent research demonstrates that AI route-optimization systems improve taxi driver productivity by 14\%, this study reveals that such findings capture only a fraction of AI's potential in transportation. We examine comprehensive weather-aware AI systems that integrate deep learning meteorological prediction with machine learning positioning optimization, comparing their performance against traditional operations and route-only AI approaches. Using simulation data from 10,000 taxi operations across varied weather conditions, we find that weather-aware AI systems increase driver revenue by 107.3\%, compared to 14\% improvements from route-optimization alone. Weather prediction contributes the largest individual productivity gain, with strong correlations between meteorological conditions and demand ($r=0.575$). Economic analysis reveals annual earnings increases of 13.8 million yen per driver, with rapid payback periods and superior return on investment. These findings suggest that current AI literature significantly underestimates AI's transformative potential by focusing narrowly on routing algorithms, while weather intelligence represents an untapped \$8.9 billion market opportunity. Our results indicate that future AI implementations should adopt comprehensive approaches that address multiple operational challenges simultaneously rather than optimizing isolated functions.</description>

      <title>Quotas for scholarship recipients: an efficient race-neutral alternative to affirmative action?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since 2018, France's centralized higher education platform, Parcoursup, has implemented quotas for scholarship recipients, with program-specific thresholds based on the applicant's composition. Using difference-in-differences methods, I find these quotas enabled scholarship students to access more selective programs, though intention-to-treat effects remain modest (maximum 0.10 SD). Matching methods reveal that the policy improved the scholarship students' waiting list positions relative to those of comparable non-scholarship peers. However, I detect no robust or lasting effects on the extensive margin of higher education access. Despite high policy salience, quotas did not affect the application behavior or pre-college investment of scholarship students, even among high achievers. These findings align with research on affirmative action bans, suggesting that such policies primarily benefit disadvantaged students who access selective institutions, rather than expanding total enrollment. Nevertheless, scholarship quotas demonstrate that race-neutral alternatives can effectively promote socioeconomic diversity in prestigious programs.</description>

      <title>Homeownership as Life Cycle Goldmine: Evidence from Macrohistory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Should a household buy a home? Using data from 16 developed countries spanning 1870 to 2020, this study provides a resounding affirmative answer. Contrary to popular expert advice, homeownership enhances life cycle wealth by up to 9% and welfare by up to 23%, compared to all-equity investment strategy. Homeownership reduces wealth portfolio risk and improves wealth equality, though it comes at the cost of lower working-life wealth and curtailed financial asset holdings. Gains are heterogeneous: Low-income (high-income) households gain more in wealth (welfare), and home purchase during periods of moderately low interest rates and high housing prices maximizes these benefits.</description>

      <title>What do surveys say about the trend in inequality and the applicability of two table-transformation methods?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply a pseudo panel analysis of survey data from the years 2010 and 2017 about Americans' self-reported marital preferences and perform some formal tests on the sign and magnitude of the change in educational homophily from the generation of the early Boomers to the late Boomers, as well as from the early GenerationX to the late GenerationX. In the analysis, we control for changes in preferences over the course of the survey respondents' lives. We use the test results to decide whether the popular iterative proportional fitting (IPF) algorithm, or its alternative, the NM-method is more suitable for analyzing revealed marital preferences. These two methods construct different tables representing counterfactual joint educational distributions of couples. Thereby, they disagree on the trend of revealed preferences identified from the prevalence of homogamy by counterfactual decompositions. By finding self-reported homophily to display a U-shaped pattern, our tests reject the hypothesis that the IPF is suitable for constructing counterfactuals in general, while we cannot reject the applicability of the NM. The significance of our survey-based method-selection is due to the fact that the choice between the IPF and the NM makes a difference not only to the identified historical trend of revealed homophily, but also to what future paths of social inequality are believed to be possible.</description>

      <title>Efficiency through Evolution, A Darwinian Approach to Agent-Based Economic Forecast Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Darwinian Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) methodology formacroeconomic forecasting that leverages evolutionary principles to achieve remarkablecomputational efficiency and emergent realism. Unlike conventional DSGE and ABM approachesthat rely on complex behavioral rules derived from large firm analysis, our framework employssimple "common sense" rules representative of small firms directly serving final consumers. Themethodology treats households as the primary drivers of economic dynamics, with firms adaptingthrough market-based natural selection within limited interaction neighborhoods. We demonstrate that this approach, when constrained by Input-Output table structures,generates realistic economic patterns including wealth distributions, firm size distributions, andsectoral employment patterns without extensive parameter calibration. Using FIGARO Input-Output tables for 46 countries and focusing on Austria as a case study, we show that the modelreproduces empirical regularities while maintaining computational efficiency on standard laptopsrather than requiring supercomputing clusters. Key findings include: (1) emergence of realistic firm and employment distributions fromminimal behavioral assumptions, (2) accurate reproduction of the initial Social Accounting Matrixvalues through evolutionary dynamics, (3) successful calibration using only 5-6 country-specificparameters to complement the FIGARO data, and (4) computational performance enabling fullsimulations on consumer hardware. These results suggest that evolutionary ABM approaches canprovide robust policy insights by capturing decentralized market adaptations while avoiding thecomputational complexity of traditional DSGE and comprehensive ABM models.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Classification and Portfolio Allocation: with Implications from Machine Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.02283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use multi-class machine learning classifiers to identify the stocks that outperform or underperform other stocks. The resulting long-short portfolios achieve annual Sharpe ratios of 1.67 (value-weighted) and 3.35 (equal-weighted), with annual alphas ranging from 29\% to 48\%. These results persist after controlling for machine learning regressions and remain robust among large-cap stocks. Machine uncertainty, as measured by predicted probabilities, impairs the prediction performance. Stocks with higher machine uncertainty experience lower returns, particularly when human proxies of information uncertainty align with machine uncertainty. Consistent with the literature, such an effect is driven by the past underperformers.</description>

      <title>Enhancing supply chain security with automated machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of global supply chains have led to new challenges spanning various fields, such as supply chain disruptions due to long waiting lines at the ports, material shortages, and inflation. Coupled with the size of supply chains and the availability of vast amounts of data, efforts towards tackling such challenges have led to an increasing interest in applying machine learning methods in many aspects of supply chains. Unlike other solutions, ML techniques, including Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Neural Networks, make predictions and approximate optimal solutions faster. This paper presents an automated ML framework to enhance supply chain security by detecting fraudulent activities, predicting maintenance needs, and forecasting material backorders. Using datasets of varying sizes, results show that fraud detection achieves an 88% accuracy rate using sampling methods, machine failure prediction reaches 93.4% accuracy, and material backorder prediction achieves 89.3% accuracy. Hyperparameter tuning significantly improved the performance of these models, with certain supervised techniques like XGBoost and LightGBM reaching up to 100% precision. This research contributes to supply chain security by streamlining data preprocessing, feature selection, model optimization, and inference deployment, addressing critical challenges and boosting operational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Working with AI: Measuring the Occupational Implications of Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07935v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given the rapid adoption of generative AI and its potential to impact a wide range of tasks, understanding the effects of AI on the economy is one of society's most important questions. In this work, we take a step toward that goal by analyzing the work activities people do with AI, how successfully and broadly those activities are done, and combine that with data on what occupations do those activities. We analyze a dataset of 200k anonymized and privacy-scrubbed conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a publicly available generative AI system. We find the most common work activities people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information and writing, while the most common activities that AI itself is performing are providing information and assistance, writing, teaching, and advising. Combining these activity classifications with measurements of task success and scope of impact, we compute an AI applicability score for each occupation. We find the highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work occupation groups such as computer and mathematical, and office and administrative support, as well as occupations such as sales whose work activities involve providing and communicating information. Additionally, we characterize the types of work activities performed most successfully, how wage and education correlate with AI applicability, and how real-world usage compares to predictions of occupational AI impact.</description>
