      <title>2D hydrodynamic simulation of TeraFETs beyond the gradual-channel approximation for transient, large-signal or ultrahigh-frequency simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decade, detection of THz radiation by plasma-wave-assisted frequency mixing in antenna-coupled field-effect transistors (TeraFETs) -- implemented in various semiconductor material systems (Si CMOS, GaN/AlGaN, GaAs/AlGaAs, graphene, etc.) -- has matured and led to a practically applied detector technology. This has been supported by the development of powerful device simulation tools which take into account relevant collective carrier dynamics and mixing processes in various approximations. These tools mostly model carrier transport in 1D and they are usually geared towards continuous-wave illumination of the device and small-signal response. Depending on their implementation, it may not be possible readily to simulate large-signal and pulsed operation. Another approximation which may lead to unsatisfactory results is the 1D restriction to calculate only the longitudinal electric field components. Especially at the edges of the gate electrode, solving of the 2D Poisson equation promises better results. This contribution introduces a stable way to solve the 2D Poisson equation self-consistently with the hydrodynamic transport equations including the numerically challenging convection term. We employ a well-balanced approximate Harten-Lax-van-Leer-Contact Riemann solver. The approach is well suited for a future treatment of transient and large-signal cases as well as the Dyakonov-Shur instability. The 2D treatment also generically extends the model beyond the gradual-channel approximation and allows to calculate the FET's response at high THz frequencies where the gate-to-channel potential acquires a non-local character. Model calculations are performed for the exemplary case of a 65-nm Si CMOS TeraFET in the isothermal approximation.</description>

      <title>A Recipe for Charge Density Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In density functional theory, charge density is the core attribute of atomic systems from which all chemical properties can be derived. Machine learning methods are promising in significantly accelerating charge density prediction, yet existing approaches either lack accuracy or scalability. We propose a recipe that can achieve both. In particular, we identify three key ingredients: (1) representing the charge density with atomic and virtual orbitals (spherical fields centered at atom/virtual coordinates); (2) using expressive and learnable orbital basis sets (basis function for the spherical fields); and (3) using high-capacity equivariant neural network architecture. Our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while being more than an order of magnitude faster than existing methods. Furthermore, our method enables flexible efficiency-accuracy trade-offs by adjusting the model/basis sizes.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Regression for Beyond the Standard Model Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose symbolic regression as a powerful tool for studying Beyond the Standard Model physics. As a benchmark model, we consider the so-called Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, which has a four-dimensional parameter space defined at the GUT scale. We provide a set of analytical expressions that reproduce three low-energy observables of interest in terms of the parameters of the theory: the Higgs mass, the contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, and the cold dark matter relic density. To demonstrate the power of the approach, we employ the symbolic expressions in a global fits analysis to derive the posterior probability densities of the parameters, which are obtained extremely rapidly in comparison with conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Predicting Ground State Properties: Constant Sample Complexity and Deep Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in quantum many-body physics is that of finding ground states of local Hamiltonians. A number of recent works gave provably efficient machine learning (ML) algorithms for learning ground states. Specifically, [Huang et al. Science 2022], introduced an approach for learning properties of the ground state of an $n$-qubit gapped local Hamiltonian $H$ from only $n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ data points sampled from Hamiltonians in the same phase of matter. This was subsequently improved by [Lewis et al. Nature Communications 2024], to $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ samples when the geometry of the $n$-qubit system is known. In this work, we introduce two approaches that achieve a constant sample complexity, independent of system size $n$, for learning ground state properties. Our first algorithm consists of a simple modification of the ML model used by Lewis et al. and applies to a property of interest known beforehand. Our second algorithm, which applies even if a description of the property is not known, is a deep neural network model. While empirical results showing the performance of neural networks have been demonstrated, to our knowledge, this is the first rigorous sample complexity bound on a neural network model for predicting ground state properties. We also perform numerical experiments that confirm the improved scaling of our approach compared to earlier results.</description>

      <title>Towards an exact electronic quantum many-body treatment of Kondo correlation in magnetic impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kondo effect is a prototypical quantum phenomenon arising from the interaction between localized electrons in a magnetic impurity and itinerant electrons in a metallic host. Although it has served as the testing ground for quantum many-body methods for decades, the precise description of Kondo physics with material specificity remains challenging. Here, we present a systematic ab initio approach to converge towards an exact zero-temperature electronic treatment of Kondo correlations. Across a series of 3d transition metals, we extract Kondo temperatures matching the subtle experimental trends, with an accuracy far exceeding that of standard models. We further obtain microscopic insight into the origin of these trends. More broadly, we demonstrate the possibility to start from fully ab initio many-body simulations and push towards the realm of converged predictions.</description>

      <title>VBIM-Net: Variational Born Iterative Network for Inverse Scattering Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, studies have shown the potential of integrating field-type iterative methods with deep learning (DL) techniques in solving inverse scattering problems (ISPs). In this article, we propose a novel Variational Born Iterative Network, namely, VBIM-Net, to solve the full-wave ISPs with significantly improved flexibility and inversion quality. The proposed VBIM-Net emulates the alternating updates of the total electric field and the contrast in the variational Born iterative method (VBIM) by multiple layers of subnetworks. We embed the calculation of the contrast variation into each of the subnetworks, converting the scattered field residual into an approximate contrast variation and then enhancing it by a U-Net, thus avoiding the requirement of matched measurement dimension and grid resolution as in existing approaches. The total field and contrast of each layer's output is supervised in the loss function of VBIM-Net, which guarantees the physical interpretability of variables of the subnetworks. In addition, we design a training scheme with extra noise to enhance the model's stability. Extensive numerical results on synthetic and experimental data both verify the inversion quality, generalization ability, and robustness of the proposed VBIM-Net. This work may provide some new inspiration for the design of efficient field-type DL schemes.</description>

      <title>Are queries and keys always relevant? A case study on Transformer wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dot product attention mechanism, originally designed for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, is a cornerstone of modern Transformers. It adeptly captures semantic relationships between word pairs in sentences by computing a similarity overlap between queries and keys. In this work, we explore the suitability of Transformers, focusing on their attention mechanisms, in the specific domain of the parametrization of variational wave functions to approximate ground states of quantum many-body spin Hamiltonians. Specifically, we perform numerical simulations on the two-dimensional $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model, a common benchmark in the field of quantum-many body systems on lattice. By comparing the performance of standard attention mechanisms with a simplified version that excludes queries and keys, relying solely on positions, we achieve competitive results while reducing computational cost and parameter usage. Furthermore, through the analysis of the attention maps generated by standard attention mechanisms, we show that the attention weights become effectively input-independent at the end of the optimization. We support the numerical results with analytical calculations, providing physical insights of why queries and keys should be, in principle, omitted from the attention mechanism when studying large systems. Interestingly, the same arguments can be extended to the NLP domain, in the limit of long input sentences.</description>

      <title>Classification analysis of transition-metal chalcogenides and oxides using quantum machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) leverages the potential from machine learning to explore the subtle patterns in huge datasets of complex nature with quantum advantages. This exponentially reduces the time and resources necessary for computations. QML accelerates materials research with active screening of chemical space, identifying novel materials for practical applications and classifying structurally diverse materials given their measured properties. This study analyzes the performance of three efficient quantum machine learning algorithms viz., variational quantum eigen solver (VQE), quantum support vector machine (QSVM) and quantum neural networks (QNN) for the classification of transition metal chalcogenides and oxides (TMCs &amp;TMOs). The analysis is performed on three datasets of different sizes containing 102, 192 and 350 materials with TMCs and TMOs labelled as +1 and -1 respectively. By employing feature selection, classical machine learning achieves 100% accuracy whereas QML achieves the highest performance of 99% and 98% for test and train data respectively on QSVC. This study establishes the competence of QML models in materials classification and explores the quantum circuits in terms of over-fitting using the circuit descriptors expressibility and entangling capability. In addition, the perspectives on QML in materials research with noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices is given.</description>

      <title>Ion Correlation-Driven Hysteretic Adhesion and Repulsion between Opposing Polyelectrolyte Brushes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface interactions mediated by polyelectrolyte (PE) brushes has been of great significance in biotechnology and nanotechnology including lubrication of skeletal joints, protein-coated surfaces, and stabilization of nanoparticles. The addition of salt ions is an important tool to modulate the morphology and mechanical properties of PE brushes. In this work, the electrostatic correlation augmented self-consistent field theory we previously developed is applied to investigate the interactions between opposing PE brushes in a mixture of 1:1 and 3:1 salt solutions. Our theory predicts that adding a small amount of trivalent ions can lead to a hysteretic feature of the force profile: repulsion in the compression and adhesion in the separation. Coexistence of two collapsed modes of PE brushes induced by strong ion correlations can be obtained, clearly elucidating the molecular origin of the hysteretic force. Furthermore, trivalent ions with larger radius induce less pronounced ion correlation, leading to stronger repulsion in the compression and weaker adhesion in the separation. Our results are in good agreement with the experiments reported by Tirrell group.</description>

      <title>A hyperbolic-elliptic PDE model and conservative numerical method for gravity-dominated variably-saturated groundwater flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Richards equation is often used to represent two-phase fluid flow in an unsaturated porous medium when one phase is much heavier and more viscous than the other. However, it cannot describe the fully saturated flow for some capillary functions without specialized treatment due to degeneracy in the capillary pressure term. Mathematically, gravity-dominated variably saturated flows are interesting because their governing partial differential equation switches from hyperbolic in the unsaturated region to elliptic in the saturated region. Moreover, the presence of wetting fronts introduces strong spatial gradients often leading to numerical instability. In this work, we develop a robust, multidimensional mathematical model and implement a well-known efficient and conservative numerical method for such variably saturated flow in the limit of negligible capillary forces. The elliptic problem in saturated regions is integrated efficiently into our framework by solving a reduced system corresponding only to the saturated cells using fixed head boundary conditions in the unsaturated cells. In summary, this coupled hyperbolic-elliptic PDE framework provides an efficient, physics-based extension of the hyperbolic Richards equation to simulate fully saturated regions. Finally, we provide a suite of easy-to-implement yet challenging benchmark test problems involving saturated flows in one and two dimensions. These simple problems, accompanied by their corresponding analytical solutions, can prove to be pivotal for the code verification, model validation (V&amp;V) and performance comparison of simulators for variably saturated flow. Our numerical solutions show an excellent comparison with the analytical results for the proposed problems. The last test problem on two-dimensional infiltration in a stratified, heterogeneous soil shows the formation and evolution of multiple disconnected saturated regions.</description>

      <title>Entropy-stable positivity-preserving DG schemes for Boltzmann-Poisson models of collisional electronic transport along energy bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00593</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.00593v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is related to developing entropy-stable positivity-preserving Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods as a computational scheme for Boltzmann-Poisson systems modeling the probability density of collisional electronic transport along semiconductor energy bands. In momentum coordinates representing spherical / energy-angular variables, we pose the respective Vlasov-Boltzmann equation with a linear collision operator and a singular measure, modeling scatterings as functions of the band structure appropriately for hot electron nanoscale transport.
  We show stability results of semi-discrete DG schemes under an entropy norm for 1D-position (2D-momentum) and 2D-position (3D-momentum), using dissipative properties of the collisional operator given its entropy inequality. The latter depends on an exponential of the Hamiltonian rather than the Maxwellian associated with only kinetic energy. For the 1D problem, knowing the analytic solution to the Poisson equation and convergence to a constant current is crucial to obtaining full stability (weighted entropy norm decreasing over time). For the 2D problem, specular reflection boundary conditions and periodicity are considered in estimating stability under an entropy norm. Regarding the positivity-preservation proofs in the DG scheme for the 1D problem, inspired by \cite{ZhangShu1}, \cite{ZhangShu2}, and \cite{CGP}, \cite{EECHXM-JCP}, we treat collisions as a source and find convex combinations of the transport and collision terms which guarantee positivity of the cell average of our numerical probability density at the next time. The positivity of the numerical solution to the probability density in the domain is guaranteed by applying the limiters in \cite{ZhangShu1} and \cite{ZhangShu2} that preserve the cell average modifying the slope of the piecewise linear solutions to make the function non-negative.</description>

      <title>Homogenized Lattice Boltzmann Model for Simulating Multi-Phase Flows in Heterogeneous Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.11524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new homogenization approach for the simulation of multi-phase flows in heterogeneous porous media is presented. It is based on the lattice Boltzmann method and combines the grayscale with the multi-component Shan-Chen method. Thus, it mimics fluid-fluid and solid-fluid interactions also within pores that are smaller than the numerical discretization. The model is successfully tested for a broad variety of single- and two-phase flow problems. Additionally, its application to multi-scale and multi-phase flow problems in porous media is demonstrated using the electrolyte filling process of realistic 3D lithium-ion battery electrode microstructures as an example. The new method shows advantages over comparable methods from literature. The interfacial tension and wetting conditions are independent and not affected by the homogenization. Moreover, all physical properties studied here are continuous even across interfaces of porous media. The method is consistent with the original multi-component Shan-Chen method. It is accurate, efficient, easy to implement, and can be applied to many research fields, especially where multi-phase fluid flow occurs in heterogeneous and multi-scale porous media.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11735v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A growing body of research indicates that structural plasticity mechanisms are crucial for learning and memory consolidation. Starting from a simple phenomenological model, we exploit a mean-field approach to develop a theoretical framework of learning through this kind of plasticity, capable of taking into account several features of the connectivity and pattern of activity of biological neural networks, including probability distributions of neuron firing rates, selectivity of the responses of single neurons to multiple stimuli, probabilistic connection rules and noisy stimuli. More importantly, it describes the effects of stabilization, pruning and reorganization of synaptic connections. This framework is used to compute the values of some relevant quantities used to characterize the learning and memory capabilities of the neuronal network in training and testing procedures as the number of training patterns and other model parameters vary. The results are then compared with those obtained through simulations with firing-rate-based neuronal network models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) plays a crucial role in extracting valuable information from flow measurements in fluid dynamics problems. Often only time-averaged data is available, which poses challenges for DA in the context of unsteady flow problems. Recent works have shown promising results in optimizing Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of stationary flows using sparse data through variational data assimilation, enabling the reconstruction of mean flow profiles.
  In this study we perform three-dimensional variational data assimilation of sparse time-averaged data into an unsteady RANS (URANS) simulation by means of a stationary divergence-free forcing term in the URANS equations. Efficiency and speed of our method are enhanced by employing coarse URANS simulations and leveraging the stationary discrete adjoint method for the time-averaged URANS equations. The data assimilation codes were developed in-house using OpenFOAM for the URANS simulations as well as for the solution of the adjoint problem, and Python for the gradient-based optimization.
  Our results demonstrate that data assimilation of sparse time-averaged velocity measurements not only enables accurate mean flow reconstruction, but also improves the flow dynamics, specifically the vortex shedding frequency. To validate the efficacy of our approach, we applied it to turbulent flows around cylinders of various shapes at Reynolds numbers ranging from 3000 to 22000. Our findings indicate that data points near the cylinder play a crucial role in improving the vortex shedding frequency, while additional data points further downstream are necessary to also reconstruct the time-averaged velocity field in the wake region.</description>

Abstract: A bang-bang (BB) algorithm prepares the ground state of a two-dimensional (2D) quantum many-body Hamiltonian $H=H_1+H_2$ by evolving an initial product state alternating between $H_1$ and $H_2$. We use the neighborhood tensor update to simulate the BB evolution with an infinite pair-entangled projected state (iPEPS). The alternating sequence is optimized with the final energy as a cost function. The energy is calculated with the tangent space methods for the sake of their stability.
  The method is benchmarked in the 2D transverse field quantum Ising model near its quantum critical point against a ground state obtained by variational optimization of the iPEPS. The optimal BB sequence differs non-perturbatively from a sequence simulating quantum annealing or adiabatic preparation (AP) of the ground state. The optimal BB energy converges with the number of bangs much faster than the optimal AP energy.</description>

      <title>Six decades of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model: A guide through its spatio-temporal dynamics and influence across disciplines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11403v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The FitzHugh-Nagumo equation, originally conceived in neuroscience during the 1960s, became a key model providing a simplified view of excitable neuron cell behavior. Its applicability, however, extends beyond neuroscience into fields like cardiac physiology, cell division, population dynamics, electronics, and other natural phenomena. In this review spanning six decades of research, we discuss the diverse spatio-temporal dynamical behaviors described by the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation. These include dynamics like bistability, oscillations, and excitability, but it also addresses more complex phenomena such as traveling waves and extended patterns in coupled systems. The review serves as a guide for modelers aiming to utilize the strengths of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model to capture generic dynamical behavior. It not only catalogs known dynamical states and bifurcations, but also extends previous studies by providing stability and bifurcation analyses for coupled spatial systems.</description>

      <title>Spin Symmetry in Thermally-Assisted-Occupation Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For electronic systems with multi-reference (MR) character, Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) with the conventional exchange-correlation (xc) energy functionals can lead to incorrect spin densities and related properties. For example, for H2 dissociation, the spin-restricted and spin-unrestricted solutions obtained with the same xc energy functional in KS-DFT can be distinctly different, yielding the unphysical spin-symmetry breaking effects in the spin-unrestricted solutions. Recently, thermally-assisted-occupation density functional theory (TAO-DFT) has been shown to resolve the aforementioned spin-symmetry breaking, when the fictitious temperature is properly chosen. In this work, a response theory based on TAO-DFT is developed to demonstrate that TAO-DFT with a sufficiently large fictitious temperature can always resolve the unphysical spin-symmetry breaking in MR systems. To further support this, TAO-DFT calculations with various fictitious temperatures are performed for the dissociation of H2, N2, He2, and Ne2 as well as the twisted ethylene.</description>
