      <title>The Constraint Satisfaction Problem Over Multisorted Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs, for short) make up a class of problems with applications in many areas of computer science. The first classification of these problems was given by Schaeffer who showed that every CSP over the domain {0,1} is either in P or is NP-complete. More recently this was shown to hold for all CSPs over finite relational structures independently by Bulatov and Zhuk. Furthermore, they characterized the complexity based solely on the polymorphism algebra of the associated relational structure, building upon the deep connections between universal algebra and complexity theory. In this article we extend this and consider what happens if the instance forms a special type of relational core called a multisorted core. Our main result is that in this case the problem is reducible to computing the determinant of an integer valued matrix which places it in the complexity class DET, which is likely a strict subset of P.</description>

      <title>ASP-Completeness Proofs of Puzzles Using the T-Metacell Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pencil puzzles are puzzles that can be solved by writing down solutions on a paper, using only logical reasoning. In this paper, we utilize the "T-metacell" framework developed by Tang and the MIT Hardness Group to prove the ASP-completeness of four new pencil puzzles: Grand Tour, Entry Exit, Yagit, and Zahlenschlange. The results demonstrate how versatile the framework is, offering new insights into the computational complexity of problems with various constraints.</description>

      <title>Random Unitaries in Constant (Quantum) Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random unitaries are a central object of study in quantum information, with applications to quantum computation, quantum many-body physics, and quantum cryptography. Recent work has constructed unitary designs and pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) using $\Theta(\log \log n)$-depth unitary circuits with two-qubit gates.
  In this work, we show that unitary designs and PRUs can be efficiently constructed in several well-studied models of $\textit{constant-time}$ quantum computation (i.e., the time complexity on the quantum computer is independent of the system size). These models are constant-depth circuits augmented with certain nonlocal operations, such as (a) many-qubit TOFFOLI gates, (b) many-qubit FANOUT gates, or (c) mid-circuit measurements with classical feedforward control. Recent advances in quantum computing hardware suggest experimental feasibility of these models in the near future.
  Our results demonstrate that unitary designs and PRUs can be constructed in much weaker circuit models than previously thought. Furthermore, our construction of PRUs in constant-depth with many-qubit TOFFOLI gates shows that, under cryptographic assumptions, there is no polynomial-time learning algorithm for the circuit class $\mathsf{QAC}^0$. Finally, our results suggest a new approach towards proving that PARITY is not computable in $\mathsf{QAC}^0$, a long-standing question in quantum complexity theory.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Averaging Samplers and Matrix Samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first efficient averaging sampler that achieves asymptotically optimal randomness complexity and near-optimal sample complexity. For any $\delta &lt; \varepsilon$ and any constant $\alpha &gt; 0$, our sampler uses $m + O(\log (1 / \delta))$ random bits to output $t = O((\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} \log \frac{1}{\delta})^{1 + \alpha})$ samples $Z_1, \dots, Z_t \in \{0, 1\}^m$ such that for any function $f: \{0, 1\}^m \to [0, 1]$, \[ \Pr\left[\left|\frac{1}{t}\sum_{i=1}^t f(Z_i) - \mathbb{E}[f]\right| \leq \varepsilon\right] \geq 1 - \delta. \] The randomness complexity is optimal up to a constant factor, and the sample complexity is optimal up to the $O((\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} \log \frac{1}{\delta})^{\alpha})$ factor.
  Our technique generalizes to matrix samplers. A matrix sampler is defined similarly, except that $f: \{0, 1\}^m \to \mathbb{C}^{d \times d}$ and the absolute value is replaced by the spectral norm. Our matrix sampler achieves randomness complexity $m + \widetilde O (\log(d / \delta))$ and sample complexity $ O((\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} \log \frac{d}{\delta})^{1 + \alpha})$ for any constant $\alpha &gt; 0$, both near-optimal with only a logarithmic factor in randomness complexity and an additional $\alpha$ exponent on the sample complexity.
  We use known connections with randomness extractors and list-decodable codes to give applications to these objects. Specifically, we give the first extractor construction with optimal seed length up to an arbitrarily small constant factor above 1, when the min-entropy $k = \beta n$ for a large enough constant $\beta &lt; 1$. Finally, we generalize the definition of averaging sampler to any normed vector space.</description>
