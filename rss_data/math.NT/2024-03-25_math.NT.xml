      <title>New portions of $M\setminus L$ and a lower bound on the Hausdorff distance between $L$ and $M$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ and $L$ be the Markov and Lagrange spectra, respectively. It is known that $L$ is contained in $M$ and Freiman showed in 1968 that $M\setminus L\neq \emptyset$. In 2018 the first region of $M\setminus L$ above $\sqrt{12}$ was discovered by C. Matheus and C. G. Moreira, thus disproving a conjecture of Cusick of 1975. In 2022, the same authors together with L. Jeffreys discovered a new region near 3.938. In this paper, we will study two new regions of $M\setminus L$ above $\sqrt{12}$, in the vicinity of the Markov value of two periodic words of odd length that are non semisymmetric, which are $\overline{212332111}$ and $\overline{123332112}$. We will demonstrate that for both cases, there is a maximal gap of $L$ and a Gauss-Cantor set inside this gap that is contained in $M$. Moreover we show that at the right endpoint of those gaps we have local Hausdorff dimension equal to $1$.
  After studying the mentioned examples, we will provide a lower bound for the value of $d_H(M,L)$ (the Hausdorff distance between $M$ and $L$).</description>

      <title>On the series expansion of the secondary zeta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In article, we explore the secondary zeta function $Z(s)$, which is defined as a generalized zeta type of series over imaginary parts of non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)$. This function has been analytically continued as a meromorphic function in $\mathbb{C}$ with one double pole and an infinity of simple poles. The secondary zeta function is of interest because it can naturally represent an analytical formula for non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function that we will explore, and we show that the non-trivial zeros can be generated directly from primes by introducing a new form of an explicit formula written in terms of the prime zeta function. Additionally, we will also give several new series expansions for $Z(s)$ and numerically compute these coefficients to high precision, and also develop several new methods to analytically extend $Z(s)$ to larger domains and develop algorithms to compute them.</description>

      <title>Special values of $L$-functions for $\mathrm{GL}_5 \times \mathrm{GL}_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Pi$ be a cuspidal automorphic representation of $\mathrm{GL}_5(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q})$, and let $\Sigma = \mathrm{Ind}(\pi, \chi_2|\cdot|^{1/2}, \chi_3|\cdot|^{-1/2})$ be an automorphic representation of $\mathrm{GL}_4(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q})$ induced from the standard parabolic subgroup of the form $(2, 1, 1)$ where $\pi$ is a cuspidal automorphic representation of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q})$. Assume that $\Pi_{\infty}$ and $\Sigma_{\infty}$ are cohomological with respect to the trivial representation in which case $s=1/2$ is a critical point for the Rankin-Selberg $L$-function $L(s, \Pi \times \Sigma)$. Following Mahnkopf, we prove a result about $L(\tfrac{1}{2}, \Pi \times \Sigma)$, and as a corollary, obtain an algebraicity result for the ratio $L(1, \Pi \times \chi)/L(1, \Pi \times \chi')$, where $\chi,\chi'$ are finite order Hecke characters such that $\chi_{\infty} = \chi'_{\infty} = \mathrm{sgn}$.</description>

      <title>Ramanujan type congruences for quotients of Klein forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, Ramanujan type congruences modulo powers of primes $p \ge 5$ are derived for a general class of products that are modular forms of level $p$. These products are constructed in terms of Klein forms and subsume generating functions for $t$-core partitions known to satisfy Ramanujan type congruences for $p=5,7,11$. The vectors of exponents corresponding to products that are modular forms for $\Gamma_{1}(p)$ are subsets of bounded polytopes with explicit parameterizations. This allows for the derivation of a complete list of products that are modular forms for $\Gamma_{1}(p)$ of weights $1\le k \le 5$ for primes $5\le p \le 19$ and whose Fourier coefficients satisfy Ramanujan type congruences for all powers of the primes. For each product satisfying a congruence, cyclic permutations of the exponents determine additional products satisfying congruences. Common forms among the exponent sets lead to products satisfying Ramanujan type congruences for a broad class of primes, including $p&gt; 19$. Canonical bases for modular forms of level $5\le p \le 19$ are constructed by summing weight one Hecke Eisensten series of levels $5\le p \le 19$ and expressing the result as a quotient of Klein forms. Generating sets for the graded algebras of modular forms for $\Gamma_{1}(p)$ and $\Gamma(p)$ are formulated in terms of permutations of the exponent sets. A sieving process is described by decomposing the space of modular forms of weight $1$ for $\Gamma_{1}(p)$ as a direct sum of subspaces of modular forms for $\Gamma(p)$ of the form $q^{r/p}\Bbb Z[[q]]$. Since the relevant bases generate the graded algebra of modular forms for these groups, the weight one decompositions determine series dissections for modular forms of higher weight that lead to additional classes of congruences.</description>

      <title>Determination of Hilbert modular forms using squarefree coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ (over $\mathbb{Q}$) be a totally real number field of narrow class number $1$. We generalize a result of Kohnen on the determination of half integral weight modular forms by their Fourier coefficients supported on squarefree (algebraic) integers. We also give a soft proof that infinitely many Fourier coefficients supported on squarefree integers are non-vanishing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper makes the following conjecture: For every prime $p$ there exists a positive integer $x$ with $\left\lceil \frac{p}{4} \right\rceil \leq x \leq \left\lceil \frac{p}{2} \right\rceil$ and a positive divisor $d|x^2$ so that either: (1) $ d \bmod \left( 4x - p \right) \equiv -px$; or (2) $d \leq x$ and $ d \bmod \left( 4x - p \right) \equiv -x$. Furthermore this paper proves that the solutions to these modular equations are in one-to-one correspondence with the solutions of the diophantine equation used in the Erd\H{o}s Straus conjecture.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic of critical $p$-adic $L$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our objective in the present work is to develop a fairly complete arithmetic theory of critical $p$-adic $L$-functions on the eigencurve. To this end, we carry out the following tasks:
  a) We give an "\'etale" construction of Bella\"iche's $p$-adic $L$-functions at a $\theta$-critical point on the cuspidal eigencurve.
  b) We introduce the algebraic counterparts of these objects (which arise as appropriately defined Selmer complexes) and develop Iwasawa theory in this context, including a definition of an Iwasawa theoretic $\mathscr L$-invariant $\mathscr{L}^{\rm cr}_{\rm Iw}$.
  c) We formulate the (punctual) critical main conjecture and study its relationship with its slope-zero counterparts. Along the way, we also develop descent theory (paralleling Perrin-Riou's work).
  d) We introduce what we call thick (Iwasawa theoretic) fundamental line and the thick Selmer complex to counter Bella\"iche's secondary $p$-adic $L$-functions. This allows us to formulate an infinitesimal thickening of the Iwasawa main conjecture, and we observe that it implies both slope-zero and punctual critical main conjectures, but it seems stronger than both.
  e) We establish an $\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{X}}$-adic leading term formula for the two-variable $p$-adic $L$-function over the affinoid neighbourhood $\mathcal{X}={\rm Spm}(\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{X}})$ in the eigencurve about a $\theta$-critical point. Using this formula we prove, when the Hecke $L$-function of $f$ vanishes to order one at the central critical point, that the derivative of the secondary $p$-adic $L$-function can be computed in terms of the second order derivative of an $\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{X}}$-adic regulator (rather than a regulator itself).</description>

      <title>The cone conjecture for vector-valued Siegel automorphic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the effective cone of automorphic vector bundles on the Siegel modular variety of rank $n$ in characteristic $p$ at a place of good reduction is encoded by the stack of $G$-zips of Pink--Wedhorn--Ziegler. Specifically, we show that the degree zero cohomology groups of automorphic vector bundles always vanish outside of the zip cone. This result is a special case of a general conjecture formulated by the Goldring and the author for all Hodge-type Shimura varieties of good reduction. In the case $n=3$, we give explicit conditions for the vanishing of the $0$-th cohomology group. Finally, in the course of the proof we define the notion of automorphic forms of trivial-type and study their properties.</description>

      <title>Local square mean in the hyperbolic circle problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma\subseteq PSL_2({\bf R})$ be a finite volume Fuchsian group. The hyperbolic circle problem is the estimation of the number of elements of the $\Gamma$-orbit of $z$ in a hyperbolic circle around $w$ of radius $R$, where $z$ and $w$ are given points of the upper half plane and $R$ is a large number. An estimate with error term $e^{{2\over 3}R}$ is known, and this has not been improved for any group. Petridis and Risager proved that in the special case $\Gamma =PSL_2({\bf Z})$ taking $z=w$ and averaging over $z$ locally the error term can be improved to $e^{\left({7\over {12}}+\epsilon\right)R}$. Here we show such an improvement for the local $L^2$-norm of the error term. Our estimate is $e^{\left({9\over {14}}+\epsilon\right)R}$, which is better than the pointwise bound $e^{{2\over 3}R}$ but weaker than the bound of Petridis and Risager for the local average.</description>

      <title>Open image computations for elliptic curves over number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a non-CM elliptic curve $E$ defined over a number field $K$, the Galois action on its torsion points gives rise to a Galois representation $\rho_E: Gal(\overline{K}/K)\to GL_2(\widehat{\mathbb{Z}})$ that is unique up to isomorphism. A renowned theorem of Serre says that the image of $\rho_E$ is an open, and hence finite index, subgroup of $GL_2(\widehat{\mathbb{Z}})$. In an earlier work of the author, an algorithm was given, and implemented, that computed the image of $\rho_E$ up to conjugacy in $GL_2(\widehat{\mathbb{Z}})$ in the special case $K=\mathbb{Q}$. A fundamental ingredient of this earlier work was the Kronecker-Weber theorem whose conclusion fails for number fields $K\neq \mathbb{Q}$. We shall give an overview of an analogous algorithm for a general number field and work out the required group theory. We also give some bounds on the index in Serre's theorem for a typical elliptic curve over a fixed number field.</description>

      <title>Gap distribution of $\sqrt{n} \,\mathrm{mod}\, 1$ and the circle method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of the properly renormalized gaps of $\sqrt{n} \,\mathrm{mod}\, 1$ with $n &lt; N$ converges (when $N\rightarrow \infty$) to a non-standard limit distribution, as Elkies and McMullen proved in 2004 using techniques from homogeneous dynamics. In this paper we give an essentially self-contained proof based on the circle method. Our main innovation consists in showing that a new type of correlation functions of $\sqrt{n} \,\mathrm{mod}\, 1$ converge. To define these correlation functions we restrict, smoothly, to those $\sqrt{n} \,\mathrm{mod}\, 1$ that lie in minor arcs, i.e. away from rational numbers with small denominators.</description>

      <title>On the $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions of a totally $p$-adic imaginary quadratic field -- With an appendix by Jean-Fran\c{c}ois Jaulent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be an imaginary quadratic field, and let $p$ be an odd prime number split in $k$. We analyze some properties of arbitrary $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions K/k. These properties are governed by the Hase norm residue symbol of the fundamental $p$-unit of $k$, in terms of the valuation $\delta_p(k)$ of a Fermat quotient, which determines the order of the logarithmic class group $\widetilde{\mathcal{H}_k}$ (Theorem 2.2) and leads, under some conditions, to generalizations of Gold's criterion characterizing $\lambda_p(K/k) = 1$ (Theorems 3.3, 5.1, 5.3). This uses the higher rank Chevalley-Herbrand formulas, for the filtrations of the p-class groups in $K$, that we gave in the 1994's, and the theorem of $\lambda$-stability (2022). This study is in connection with articles of Gold, Sands, Dummit-Ford-Kisilevsky-Sands, Ozaki, Jaulent, Fujii. In Appendix A, is given a general proof, by Jaulent, of the link between $\widetilde{\mathcal{H}_k}$ and $\delta_p(k)$ in a broader context. Numerical illustrations (with pari/gp programs) are given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For all $\alpha_1,\alpha_2\in(1,2)$ with $1/\alpha_1+1/\alpha_2&gt;5/3$, we show that the number of pairs $(n_1,n_2)$ of positive integers with $N=\lfloor{n_1^{\alpha_1}}\rfloor+\lfloor{n_2^{\alpha_2}}\rfloor$ is equal to $\Gamma(1+1/\alpha_1)\Gamma(1+1/\alpha_2)\Gamma(1/\alpha_1+1/\alpha_2)^{-1}N^{1/\alpha_1+1/\alpha_2-1} + o(N^{1/\alpha_1+1/\alpha_2-1})$ as $N\to\infty$, where $\Gamma$ denotes the gamma function. Moreover, we show a non-asymptotic result for the same counting problem when $\alpha_1,\alpha_2\in(1,2)$ lie in a larger range than the above. Finally, we give some asymptotic formulas for similar counting problems in a heuristic way.</description>

      <title>On the Continued Fraction Expansion of Almost All Real Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By a classical result of Gauss and Kuzmin, the continued fraction expansion of a ``random'' real number contains each digit $a\in\mathbb{N}$ with asymptotic frequency $\log_2(1+1/(a(a+2)))$.
  We generalize this result in two directions: First, for certain sets $A\subset\mathbb{N}$, we establish simple explicit formulas for the frequency with which the continued fraction expansion of a random real number contains a digit from the set $A$. For example, we show that digits of the form $p-1$, where $p$ is prime, appear with frequency $\log_2(\pi^2/6)$.
  Second, we obtain a simple formula for the frequency with which a string of $k$ consecutive digits $a$ appears in the continued fraction expansion of a random real number. In particular, when $a=1$, this frequency is given by $|\log_2(1+(-1)^k/F_{k+2})|$, where $F_n$ is the $n$th Fibonacci number.
  Finally, we compare the frequencies predicted by these results with actual frequencies found among the first 300 million continued fraction digits of $\pi$, and we provide strong statistical evidence that the continued fraction expansion of $\pi$ behaves like that of a random real number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a notion of $p$-adic families of Hecke eigenforms that allows for the slope of the forms be infinite at $p$. We prove that, contrary to the case of finite slope when every eigenform lives in a Hida or Coleman family, the only families of infinite slope are either twists of Hida or Coleman families with Dirichlet characters of $p$-power conductor, or non-ordinary families with complex multiplication. Our proof goes via a local study of deformations of potentially trianguline Galois representations, relying on work of Berger and Chenevier, and a global input coming from an analogue of a result of Balasubramanyam, Ghate and Vatsal on a Greenberg-type conjecture for families of Hilbert modular forms.</description>

      <title>A complete proof of a supercongruence conjecture of Rodriguez-Villegas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an odd prime $p$ and a positive integer $n$, let ${_n}G_n[\cdots]_p$ denote McCarthy's $p$-adic hypergeometric function. In this article, we prove $p$-adic analogue of certain classical hypergeometric identities and using these identities we express the $p$-th Fourier coefficient of certain modular forms of weight three in terms of special values of ${_3}G_3[\cdots]_p$. As a consequence, we prove a conjecture of Rodriguez-Villegas which was earlier proved by Mortenson for certain particular cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the Fermat surface of degree $d\geq 3$ has $3d^2$ lines. However, it has not yet been established what is the maximum number of pairwise disjoint lines that it can have if $d\geq 4$. In this article we show that the maximal number of skew lines on the Fermat surface of degree $d \geq 4$ is $3d$ either $d$ even or $d$ odd distinct of $5$, otherwise ($d = 5$) it contains no more than $13$ pairwise disjoint lines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the notion of almost consecutive partitions. A partition is almost consecutive if every term is consecutive, with the possible exception of the smallest one. We find formulas relating to the smallest parts of consecutive and almost consecutive partitions. We also find an alternate combinatorial interpretation of the number of almost consecutive partitions of a given integer $n$ and an asymptotic formula for this quantity.</description>

      <title>The smooth Mordell-Weil group and mapping class groups of elliptic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a paper in smooth $4$-manifold topology, inspired by the Mordell-Weil Theorem in number theory. More precisely, we prove a smooth version of the Mordell-Weil Theorem and apply it to the `unipotent radical' case of a Thurston-type classification of mapping classes of simply-connected $4$-manifolds $M_d$ that admit the structure of an elliptic complex surface of arithmetic genus $d\geq 1$. Applications include Nielsen realization theorems for $M_d$.
  By combining this with known results, we obtain the following remarkable consequence: if the singular fibers of such an elliptic fibration are of the simplest (i.e.\ nodal) type, then the fibered structure is unique up topological isotopy. In particular, any diffeomorphism of $M_d,d\geq 3$ is topologically isotopic to a diffeomorphism taking fibers to fibers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quadratic residue patterns modulo a prime are studied since 19th century. In the first part we extend existing results on the number of consecutive $\ell$-tuples of quadratic residues, studying corresponding algebraic curves and their jacobians, which happen to be products of jacobians of hyperelliptic curves. In the second part we state the last unpublished result of Lydia Goncharova on squares such that their differences are also squares, reformulate it in terms of algebraic geometry of a K3 surface, and prove it. The core of this theorem is an unexpected relation between the number of points on the K3 surface and that on a CM elliptic curve.</description>

      <title>On divergent on average trajectories for higher rank actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $d\ge 3$ we first show that the Hausdorff dimension of the set of $A$-divergent on average points in the $(d-1)$-dimensional closed horosphere in the space of $d$-dimensional Euclidean lattices, where $A$ is the group of positive diagonal matrices, is at most $\frac{d-1}{2}$. In particular, this upper bound is sharp for $d=3$.
  We apply this to compute the Hausdorff dimension of the set of exceptions to the inhomogeneous uniform version of Littlewood conjecture. We say that a pair $(\xi_1,\xi_2)\in\mathbb{R}^2$ satisfies the inhomogeneous Littlewood conjecture if $$\liminf_{q\to\infty}q\|q\xi_1-\theta_1\|_{\mathbb{Z}}\|q\xi_2-\theta_2\|_{\mathbb{Z}}=0$$ for all $(\theta_1,\theta_2)\in\mathbb{R}^2$, where $\|\cdot\|_\mathbb{Z}$ denotes the distance to the nearest integer. We prove that the Hausdorff dimension of the set of pairs $(\xi_1,\xi_2)\in\mathbb{R}^2$ not satisfying the inhomogeneous Littlewood conjecture is $1$, which is equal to the Hausdorff dimension of the conjectural set of exceptions.</description>

      <title>Moments of Margulis functions and indefinite ternary quadratic forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the moments of the Margulis $\alpha$-function integrating over expanding translates of a unipotent orbit in $\operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})/\operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z})$. We show that for some $\lambda&gt;1$ the $\lambda$-moments of the Margulis $\alpha$-function over expanding translates of a unipotent orbit are uniformly bounded, under suitable Diophantine conditions of the initial unipotent orbit.
  As an application, we prove that for any indefinite irrational ternary quadratic form $Q$ with suitable Diophantine conditions and $a&lt;b$ the number of integral vectors of norm at most $T$ satisfying $a&lt;Q(v)&lt;b$ is asymptotically equivalent to $\mathsf{C}_Q(b-a)T$ as $T$ tends to infinity, where the constant $\mathsf{C}_Q&gt;0$ depends only on $Q$.</description>

      <title>On the Connection Between Irrationality Measures and Polynomial Continued Fractions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.04468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear recursions with integer coefficients, such as the one generating the Fibonacci sequence, have been intensely studied over millennia and yet still hide new mathematics. Such a recursion was used by Ap\'ery in his proof of the irrationality of $\zeta(3)$, later named the Ap\'ery constant. Ap\'ery's proof used a specific linear recursion containing integer polynomials forming a continued fraction; called polynomial continued fractions (PCFs). Similar polynomial recursions prove the irrationality of other mathematical constants such as $\pi$ and $e$. More generally, the sequences generated by PCFs form Diophantine approximations (DAs), which are ubiquitous in areas of math such as number theory. It is not known which polynomial recursions create useful DAs and whether they prove irrationality. Here, we present general conclusions and conjectures about DAs created from PCFs. Specifically, we generalize Ap\'ery's work, going beyond his particular choice of PCF, finding the conditions under which a PCF proves irrationality or provides an efficient DA. To provide concrete examples, we apply our findings to PCFs found by the Ramanujan Machine algorithms to represent fundamental constants such as $\pi$, $e$, $\zeta(3)$, and the Catalan constant G. For each such PCF, we demonstrate the extraction of its convergence rate and efficiency, as well as the bound it provides for the irrationality measure of the fundamental constant. We further propose new DA conjectures based on PCFs. Our findings motivate future research on sequences created by any linear recursions with integer coefficients, to aid the development of systematic algorithms for finding DAs of fundamental constants. Consequently, our study may contribute to ongoing efforts to answer open questions, such as the proof of the irrationality of the Catalan constant or of values of the Riemann zeta function (e.g., $\zeta(5)$).</description>

Abstract: In this article, we prove the boundedness of minimal slopes of adelic line bundles over function fields of characteristic 0. This can be applied to prove the equidistribution of generic and small points with respect to a big and semipositive adelic line bundle. Our methods can be applied to the finite places of number fields as well. We also show the continuity of $\chi$-volumes over function fields.</description>

Abstract: We prove that there exist Salem numbers with trace $-3$ and every even degree $\geq 34$. Our proof combines a theoretical approach, which allows us to treat all sufficiently large degrees, with a numerical search for small degrees. Since it is known that there are no Salem numbers of trace $-3$ and degree $\leq 30$, our result is optimal up to possibly the single value $32$, for which it is expected there are no such numbers.</description>

Abstract: Given a compact subset $\Sigma \subset \mathbb{R}$ (or $\mathbb{C}$) with logarithmic capacity greater than zero, we construct an explicit family of probability measures supported on $\Sigma$ such that their closure is all the possible weak limit measures of complete sets of conjugate algebraic integers lying inside $\Sigma$. We give an asymptotic formula for the number of algebraic integers with given degree and prescribed distribution. We exploit the algorithmic nature of our approach to give a family of upper bounds that converges to the smallest limiting trace-to-degree ratio of totally positive algebraic integers and improve the best previously known upper bound on the Schur-Siegel-Smyth trace problem to 1.8216.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The work of Darmon, Pozzi, and Vonk has recently shown that the RM-values of the Dedekind-Rademacher cocycle $J_{DR}$ are Gross-Stark units up to a controlled torsion. In the aforementioned work, it is remarked that the measure-valued cohomology class $\mu_{DR}$ which underlies $J_{DR}$ is the level 1 incarnation of earlier constructions by Darmon and Dasgupta. In this paper, we make this relationship explicit by computing a concrete cocycle representative of $\mu_{DR}$ by tracing the construction of the cohomology class and comparing periods of weight 2 Eisenstein series. While maintaining a global perspective in our computations, we configure the appropriate method of smoothing cocycles which exactly yields the $p$-adic measures of Darmon and Dasgupta when applied to $\mu_{DR}$. These methods will also explain the optional degree zero condition imposed in Darmon and Dasgupta's work which was remarked upon in works of Fleischer and Liu as well as Dasgupta and Kakde.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a kind of survey on properties of correlations of two very general arithmetic functions, mainly from the point of view of Ramanujan expansions. In fact, our previous papers on these links had, as a focus, the "Ramanujan coefficients" of these correlations and the resulting "R.e.e.f.", i.e., Ramanujan exact explicit formula. This holds, actually, under a variety of sufficient conditions, mainly under two conditions of convergence involving correlations' "Eratosthenes Transform", namely what we call "Delange Hypothesis" and "Wintner Assumption" (the former implying the latter). We proved Hardy-Littlewood Conjecture on $2k-$twin primes, in particular, from the first of these two (that implies convergence of classic Ramanujan expansion, whence the R.e.e.f.); more recently, we gave a more general proof, from second condition, entailing the R.e.e.f. again, but this time from another method of summation for Ramanujan expansions, we detailed in "A smooth summation of Ramanujan expansions"; in which paper (see 8th ver.) we also started to give few elementary methods for correlations. Which we deepen here, adding recent, elementary and entirely new ones.</description>

Abstract: We give an adelic version of a spectral reciprocity formula relating $\mathrm{GL}_3 \times \mathrm{GL}_2$ with $\mathrm{GL}_3 \times \mathrm{GL}_1$ and $\mathrm{GL}_1$ moments of $L$-functions discovered by Xiaoqing Li. For many types of the $\mathrm{GL}_3$ representation, we describe the local weight transforms via a decomposition of Voronoi's formula in terms of elementary transforms, which generalizes the one given by Miller--Schmid in a way consistent with the local Langlands correspondence. We obtain some integral representation of the Bessel functions for $\mathrm{GL}_2$ uniformly over all local fields. We announce the dual weight computation in a new case, which identifies the coset problem parallel to that in Petrow--Young's Weyl-type subconvexity for general Dirichlet $L$-functions. The proof and extensive study of other accessible cases will be given in a separate paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that there are at most two solutions in positive integers $(x,y,z)$ to the equation $a^x+b^y=c^z$ for positive integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ all greater than one, where at least one of $a$, $b$, $c$ is not a power of 2, and $(a,b,c) \ne (3,5,2)$. The case in which $\gcd(a,b)=1$ has been handled by in a series of successive results by Scott and Styer, Hu and Le, and Miyazaki and Pink, who showed that there are at most two solutions except for $(a,b,c) = (3,5,2)$, which has three solutions. So here we treat the case $\gcd(a,b)&gt;1$, showing that there are at most two solutions in this case if at least one of $a$, $b$, $c$ is not a power of 2 (two solutions $(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2,z_2)$ are considered the same solution if $a^{x_1} = b^{y_2}$ and $a^{x_2} = b^{y_1}$). This generalizes work of Bennett who proved the equivalent result (for both $\gcd(a,b)=1$ and $\gcd(a,b)&gt;1$) for the case in which either $x=1$ or $y=1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ belong to the same quadratic field. We show that the inhomogeneous Beatty sequence $(\lfloor n \alpha + \beta \rfloor)_{n \geq 1}$ is synchronized, in the sense that there is a finite automaton that takes as input the Ostrowski representations of $n$ and $y$ in parallel, and accepts if and only if $y = \lfloor n \alpha + \beta \rfloor$. Since it is already known that the addition relation is computable for Ostrowski representations based on a quadratic number, a consequence is a new and rather simple proof that the first-order logical theory of these sequences with addition is decidable. The decision procedure is easily implemented in the free software Walnut.
  As an application, we show that for each $r \geq 1$ it is decidable whether the set $\{ \lfloor n \alpha + \beta \rfloor \, : \, n \geq 1 \}$ forms an additive basis (or asymptotic additive basis) of order $r$. Using our techniques, we also solve some open problems of Reble and Kimberling, and give an explicit characterization of a sequence of Hildebrand et al.</description>

      <title>On the adjoint Selmer groups of semi-stable elliptic curves and Flach's zeta elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explicitly construct the rank one primitive Stark (equivalently, Kolyvagin) system extending a constant multiple of Flach's zeta elements for semi-stable elliptic curves. As its arithmetic applications, we obtain the equivalence between a specific behavior of the Stark system and the minimal modularity lifting theorem, and we also discuss the cyclicity of the adjoint Selmer groups. This Stark system construction yields a more refined interpretation of the collection of Flach's zeta elements than the "geometric Euler system" approach due to Flach, Wiles, Mazur, and Weston.</description>

      <title>Folding $\pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the set of origami constructible numbers is larger than the classical straight-edge and compass constructible numbers. However, the Huzita-Justin-Hatori origami constructible numbers remain algebraic so that the transcendental number $\pi$ can only be approximated using a finite number of straight line folds. Using these methods we give a convergent sequence for folding $\pi$ as well as other methods to approximate $\pi$. Folding along curved creases, however, allows for the construction of transcendental numbers. We here give a method to construct $\pi$ exactly by folding along a parabola, and we discuss generalizations for folding other transcendental numbers such as $\Gamma(1/4)$.</description>

      <title>Iterated Monodromy Group With Non-Martingale Fixed-Point Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct families of rational functions $f: \mathbb{P}^1_k \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^1_k$ of degree $d \geq 2$ over a perfect field $k$ with non-martingale fixed-point processes. Then for any normal variety $X$ over $\mathbb{P}_{\bar{k}}^N$, we give conditions on $f: X \rightarrow X$ to guarantee that the associated fixed-point process is a martingale. This work extends the previous work of Bridy, Jones, Kelsey, and Lodge on martingale conditions and answers their question on the existence of a non-martingale fixed-point process associated with the iterated monodromy group of a rational function.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{X}\rightarrow C$ be a dominant morphism between smooth irreducible varieties over a finitely generated field $k$ such that the generic fiber $X$ is smooth, projective and geometrically connected. Assuming that $C$ is a curve with function field $K$, we build a relation between the Tate-Shafarevich group for $\mathrm{Pic}^0_{X/K}$ and the geometric Brauer groups for $\mathcal{X}$ and $X$, generalizing a theorem of Artin and Grothendieck for fibered surfaces to arbitrary relative dimension.</description>

Abstract: Assuming Lehmer's conjecture, we estimate the degree of the trace field $K(M_{p/q})$ of a hyperbolic Dehn-filling $M_{p/q}$ of a 1-cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold $M$ by $$ \dfrac{1}{C}(\max\;\{|p|,|q|\})\leq \text{deg }K(M_{p/q}) \leq C(\max\;\{|p|,|q|\}) $$ where $C=C_M$ is a constant that depends on $M$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interacting particle systems studied in this paper are probabilistic cellular automata with nearest-neighbor interaction including the Domany-Kinzel model. A special case of the Domany-Kinzel model is directed percolation. We regard the interacting particle system as a Markov chain on a graph. Then we present a new quantization of the interacting particle system. After that, we introduce a zeta function of the quantized model and give its determinant expression. Moreover, we calculate the absolute zeta function of the quantized model for the Domany-Kinzel model.</description>

      <title>The Schur polynomials in all primitive $n$th roots of unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Schur polynomials in all primitive $n$th roots of unity are $1$, $0$, or $-1$, if $n$ has at most two distinct odd prime factors. This result can be regarded as a generalization of properties of the coefficients of the cyclotomic polynomial and its multiplicative inverse. The key to the proof is the notion of a unimodular system of vectors. Namely, this result is reduced in turn to four propositions on the unimodularity of vector systems, and the last proposition is proved by using graph theory.</description>

      <title>3d Modularity Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The three-manifold topological invariants $\hat Z$ capture the half-index of the three-dimensional theory with ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetry obtained by compactifying the M5 brane theory on the closed three-manifold. In 2019, surprising general relations between the $\hat Z$-invariants, quantum modular forms, and vertex algebras, have been proposed. In the meanwhile, an extensive array of examples have been studied, but several general important structural questions remain. First, for many three-manifolds it was observed that the different $\hat Z$-invariants for the same three-manifolds are quantum modular forms that span a subspace of a Weil representation for the modular group $SL_2(Z)$, corresponding to the structure of vector-valued quantum modular forms. We elucidate the meaning of this vector-valued quantum modular form structure by first proposing the analogue $\hat Z$-invariants with supersymmetric defects, and subsequently showing that the full vector-valued quantum modular form is precisely the object capturing all the $\hat Z$-invariants, with and without defects, of a given three-manifold. Second, it was expected that matching radial limits is a key feature of $\hat Z$-invariants when changing the orientation of the plumbed three-manifold, suggesting the relevance of mock modularity. We substantiate the conjecture by providing explicit proposals for such $\hat Z$-invariants for an infinite family of three-manifolds and verify their mock modularity and limits. Third, we initiate the study of the vertex algebra structure of the mock type invariants by showcasing a systematic way to construct cone vertex operator algebras associated to these invariants, which can be viewed as the partner of logarithmic vertex operator algebras in this context.</description>
