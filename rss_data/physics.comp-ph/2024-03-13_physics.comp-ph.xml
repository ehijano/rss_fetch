      <title>A Real-time Dyson Expansion Scheme: Efficient Inclusion of Dynamical Correlations in Non-equilibrium Spectral Propertie</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time resolved photoemission spectroscopy is the key technique to probe the real-time non-equilibrium dynamics of electronic states. Theoretical predictions of the time dependent spectral function for realistic systems is however, a challenge. Employing the Kadanoff-Baym equations to find this quantity results in a cubic scaling in the total number of time steps, quickly becoming prohibitive and often fail quantitatively and even qualitatively. In comparison, mean field methods have more favorable numerical scaling both in the number number of time steps and in the complexity associated with the cost of a evolving for a single time step, however they miss key spectral properties such as emergent spectral features. Here we present a scheme that allows for the inclusion of dynamical correlations to the spectral function while maintaining the same scaling in the number of time steps as for mean field approaches, while capturing the emergent physics. Further, the scheme can be efficiently implemented on top of equilibrium real-time many-body perturbation theory schemes and codes. We see excellent agreement with exact results for test systems. Furthermore we exemplify the method on a periodic system and demonstrate clear evidence that our proposed scheme produces complex spectral features including excitonic band replicas, features that are not observed using static mean field approaches.</description>

      <title>The \v{d}Alembert solution in hyperboloidal foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explicitly construct the analogue of the \v{d}Alembert solution to the 1+1 wave equation in an hyperboloidal setting. This hyperboloidal \v{d}Alembert solution is used, in turn, to gain intuition into the behaviour of solutions to the wave equation in a hyperboloidal foliation and to explain some apparently anomalous behaviour observed in numerically constructed solutions discussed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Generalized many-body approach for near-field radiative heat transfer between nonspherical particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generalized fluctuational electrodynamics-based many-body approach for calculating near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) between nonspherical dipoles is proposed. The geometric parameters of nonspherical dipoles are implemented in the definition of the self-term of the free-space Green's function and, conversely to previous many-body models of NFRHT, dipole polarizability is defined a posteriori from the free-space Green's function solution such that polarizability calculation is an optional post-processing step rather than a required input. Both strong and weak forms of the generalized many-body approach are presented. It is shown that the approximate weak form is less computationally expensive but is only applicable to small particles characterized by size parameters less than ~0.24. The generalized many-body method is compared against an analytical solution for NFRHT between two spheroidal dipoles. Acceptable agreement is obtained, and the discrepancies are ascribed to differences in approximations for multiple reflections and from the way in which particle orientation is implemented in each method. The generalized many-body method is then applied to analyze the near-field spectral conductance between two SiC ellipsoidal dipoles. Results reveal that changes in the orientation of one of the ellipsoidal dipoles lead to active tuning of localized surface phonon resonance by up to three orders of magnitude. Finally, the spectral radiative thermal conductivity of a metamaterial composed of 1000 SiO2 ellipsoidal particles is studied. The metamaterial displays anisotropic radiative thermal conductivity, with differences in the value at resonance up to 2.8 times between different directions. The generalized many-body model of NFRHT presented in this paper may be used to develop particle-based metamaterials with novel, engineered radiative thermal properties.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio variational wave functions for the time-dependent many-electron Schr\"odinger equation</title>

Abstract: Describing the dynamics of many-electron quantum systems is crucial for applications such as predicting electronic structures in quantum chemistry, the properties of condensed matter systems, and the behaviors of complex materials. However, the real-time evolution of non-equilibrium quantum electronic systems poses a significant challenge for theoretical and computational approaches, due to the system's exploration of a vast configuration space. This work introduces a variational approach for fermionic time-dependent wave functions, surpassing mean-field approximations by capturing many-body correlations. The proposed methodology involves parameterizing the time-evolving quantum state, enabling the approximation of the state's evolution. To account for electron correlations, we employ time-dependent Jastrow factors and backflow transformations. We also show that we can incorporate neural networks to parameterize these functions. The time-dependent variational Monte Carlo technique is employed to efficiently compute the optimal time-dependent parameters. The approach is demonstrated in three distinct systems: the solvable harmonic interaction model, the dynamics of a diatomic molecule in intense laser fields, and a quenched quantum dot. In all cases, we show clear signatures of many-body correlations in the dynamics not captured by mean-field methods. The results showcase the ability of our variational approach to accurately capture the time evolution of quantum states, providing insight into the quantum dynamics of interacting electronic systems, beyond the capabilities of mean-field.</description>

      <title>Physics-Transfer Learning for Material Strength Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strength of materials, like many problems in the natural sciences, spans multiple length and time scales, and the solution has to balance accuracy and performance. Peierls stress is one of the central concepts in crystal plasticity that measures the strength through the resistance of a dislocation to plastic flow. The determination of Peierls stress involves a multiscale nature depending on both elastic lattice responses and the energy landscape of crystal slips. Material screening by strength via the Peierls stress from first-principles calculations is computationally intractable for the nonlocal characteristics of dislocations, and not included in the state-of-the-art computational material databases. In this work, we propose a physics-transfer framework to learn the physics of crystal plasticity from empirical atomistic simulations and then predict the Peierls stress from chemically accurate density functional theory-based calculations of material parameters. Notably, the strengths of single-crystalline metals can be predicted from a few single-point calculations for the deformed lattice and on the {\gamma} surface, allowing efficient, high-throughput screening for material discovery. Uncertainty quantification is carried out to assess the accuracy of models and sources of errors, showing reduced physical and system uncertainties in the predictions by elevating the fidelity of training models. This physics-transfer framework can be generalized to other problems facing the accuracy-performance dilemma, by harnessing the hierarchy of physics in the multiscale models of materials science.</description>

      <title>Phonon pseudoangular momentum in $\alpha$-MoO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent studies, it has been discovered that phonons can carry angular momentum, leading to a series of investigations into systems with 3-fold rotation symmetry. However, for systems with 2-fold screw rotational symmetry, such as $\alpha$-MoO$_3$, there has been no relevant discussion. In this paper, we investigated the pseudoangular momentum of phonons in crystals with 2-fold screw rotational symmetry. Taking $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ as an example, we explain the selection rules in circularly polarized Raman experiments resulting from pseudoangular momentum conservation, providing important guidance for experiments. This study of pseudoangular momentum in $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ opens up a new degree of freedom for its potential applications, expanding into new application domains.</description>

      <title>Photo-induced Ferromagnetic and Superconducting Orders in Multi-orbital Hubbard Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for hidden orders in photoexcited lattice systems is an active research field driven by experimental reports of light-induced or light-stabilized phases. In this study, we investigate hidden electronic orders in strongly correlated two-orbital Hubbard models with orbital-dependent bandwidths. In equilibrium, the half-filled systems are antiferromagnetically ordered. Using non-equilibrium dynamical mean field theory we demonstrate the appearance of nonthermal ferromagnetic order in the photo-doped state, if the two bandwidths are sufficiently different, and its coexistence with spin-singlet $\eta$-superconductivity in the high photo-doping region. Spin-triplet $\eta$-superconducting order appears instead if the two bandwidths are comparable. The rich nonequilibrium phasediagram uncovered in this work shows that Mott insulating multi-orbital systems provide an interesting platform for the realization of nonthermal electronic orders.</description>

      <title>Transparent boundary condition and its effectively local approximation for the Schr\"{o}dinger equation on a rectangular computational domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transparent boundary condition for the free Schr\"{o}dinger equation on a rectangular computational domain requires implementation of an operator of the form $\sqrt{\partial_t-i\triangle_{\Gamma}}$ where $\triangle_{\Gamma}$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator. It is known that this operator is nonlocal in time as well as space which poses a significant challenge in developing an efficient numerical method of solution. The computational complexity of the existing methods scale with the number of time-steps which can be attributed to the nonlocal nature of the boundary operator. In this work, we report an effectively local approximation for the boundary operator such that the resulting complexity remains independent of number of time-steps. At the heart of this algorithm is a Pad\'e approximant based rational approximation of certain fractional operators that handles corners of the domain adequately. For the spatial discretization, we use a Legendre-Galerkin spectral method with a new boundary adapted basis which ensures that the resulting linear system is banded. A compatible boundary-lifting procedure is also presented which accommodates the segments as well as the corners on the boundary. The proposed novel scheme can be implemented within the framework of any one-step time marching schemes. In particular, we demonstrate these ideas for two one-step methods, namely, the backward-differentiation formula of order 1 (BDF1) and the trapezoidal rule (TR). For the sake of comparison, we also present a convolution quadrature based scheme conforming to the one-step methods which is computationally expensive but serves as a golden standard. Finally, several numerical tests are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our novel method as well as to verify the order of convergence empirically.</description>

      <title>NPCoronaPredict: A computational pipeline for the prediction of the nanoparticle-biomolecule corona</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The corona of a nanoparticle immersed in a biological fluid is of key importance to its eventual fate and bioactivity in the environment or inside live tissues. It is critical to have insight into both the underlying bionano interactions and the corona composition to ensure biocompatibility of novel engineered nanomaterials. A prediction of these properties in silico requires the successful spanning of multiple orders of magnitude of both time and physical dimensions to produce results in a reasonable amount of time, necessitating the development of a multiscale modelling approach. Here, we present the NPCoronaPredict open-source software package: a suite of software tools to enable this prediction for complex multi-component nanomaterials in essentially arbitrary biological fluids, or more generally any medium containing organic molecules. The package integrates several recent physics-based computational models and a library of both physics-based and data-driven parameterisations for nanomaterials and organic molecules. We describe the underlying theoretical background and the package functionality from the design of multi-component NPs through to the evaluation of the corona.</description>

      <title>Probing the state of hydrogen in $\delta$-AlOOH at mantle conditions with machine learning potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06712v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrous and nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs) are a fundamental class of solids of enormous significance to geophysics. They are the water carriers in the deep geological water cycle and impact structural, elastic, plastic, and thermodynamic properties and phase relations in Earth's forming aggregates (rocks). They play a critical role in the geochemical and geophysical processes that shape the planet. Their complexity has prevented predictive calculations of their properties, but progress in materials simulations ushered by machine learning potentials is transforming this state of affairs. Here, we adopt a hybrid approach that combines deep learning potentials (DP) with the SCAN meta-GGA functional to simulate a prototypical hydrous system. We illustrate the success of this approach to simulate $\delta$-AlOOH ($\delta$), a phase capable of transporting water down to near the core-mantle boundary of the Earth (~2,900 km depth and ~135 GPa) in subducting slabs. A high-throughput sampling of phase space using molecular dynamics simulations with DP-potentials sheds light on the hydrogen-bond behavior and proton diffusion at geophysical conditions. These simulations provide a pathway for a deeper understanding of these crucial components that shape Earth's internal state.</description>

      <title>Validation of the GreenX library time-frequency component for efficient GW and RPA calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic structure calculations based on many-body perturbation theory (e.g. GW or the random-phase approximation (RPA)) require function evaluations in the complex time and frequency domain, for example inhomogeneous Fourier transforms or analytic continuation from the imaginary axis to the real axis. For inhomogeneous Fourier transforms, the time-frequency component of the GreenX library provides time-frequency grids that can be utilized in low-scaling RPA and GW implementations. In addition, the adoption of the compact frequency grids provided by our library also reduces the computational overhead in RPA implementations with conventional scaling. In this work, we present low-scaling GW and conventional RPA benchmark calculations using the GreenX grids with different codes (FHI-aims, CP2K and ABINIT) for molecules, two-dimensional materials and solids. Very small integration errors are observed when using 30 time-frequency points for our test cases, namely $&lt;10^{-8}$ eV/electron for the RPA correlation energies, and 10 meV for the GW quasiparticle energies.</description>

      <title>Short-range order and compositional phase stability in refractory high-entropy alloys via first principles theory and atomistic modelling: NbMoTa, NbMoTaW and VNbMoTaW</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an all-electron, first principles, Landau-type theory, we study the nature of short-range order and compositional phase stability in equiatomic refractory high entropy alloys, NbMoTa, NbMoTaW, and VNbMoTaW. We also investigate selected binary subsystems to provide insight into the physical mechanisms driving order. Our approach examines the short-range order of the solid solutions directly, infers disorder/order transitions, and also extracts parameters suitable for atomistic modelling of diffusional phase transformations. We find a hierarchy of relationships between the chemical species in these materials which promote ordering tendencies. The most dominant is a relative atomic size difference between the 3d element, V, and the other 4d and 5d elements which drives a B32-like order. For systems where V is not present, ordering is dominated by the difference in filling of valence states; pairs of elements which are isoelectronic remain weakly correlated to low temperatures, while pairs with a valence difference present B2-like order. Our estimated order-disorder transition temperature in VNbMoTaW is sufficiently high for us to suggest that SRO in this material may be experimentally observable.</description>

Abstract: This article investigates the effect of explicitly adding auxiliary algebraic trajectory information to neural networks for dynamical systems. We draw inspiration from the field of differential-algebraic equations and differential equations on manifolds and implement related methods in residual neural networks, despite some fundamental scenario differences. Constraint or auxiliary information effects are incorporated through stabilization as well as projection methods, and we show when to use which method based on experiments involving simulations of multi-body pendulums and molecular dynamics scenarios. Several of our methods are easy to implement in existing code and have limited impact on training performance while giving significant boosts in terms of inference.</description>
