      <title>The Gauss Circle Problem and Fourier Quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gauss circle problem asks for an approximation to the number of lattice points of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ contained in $B_r$, the disk of radius $r$ centered at the origin. Upper, lower, and average bounds have been established for this number-theoretic problem and have been generalized to any lattice in any dimension. We extend this problem to a more general class of structures known as Fourier quasicrystals. Recent work from Alon, Kummer, Kurasov, and Vinzant provides an upper bound $\#(\Lambda \cap B_r) = c_0\textrm{Vol}_d\left(B_r\right)+ O\left(r^{d-1}\right)$ for any Fourier quasicrystal $\Lambda \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ of density $c_0$, where $B_r$ is the $d$-dimensional ball of radius $r$. In this paper, we improve the upper bound for any uniformly discrete Fourier quasicrystal, by showing we can write $\#\left(\Lambda \cap B_r\right) = c_0\textrm{Vol}_d\left(B_r\right) + O\left(r^{\theta(\Lambda)}\right)$, where $\frac{d-1}{2} &lt; \theta(\Lambda) &lt; d-1$ is some exponent depending on $\Lambda$. In the special case $d = 2$, we also prove lower and upper bounds for the average of the error.</description>

      <title>Multivector (MV) functions in Clifford algebras of arbitrary dimension: Defective MV case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explicit formulas to calculate MV functions in a basis-free representation are presented for an arbitrary Clifford geometric algebra Cl(p,q). The formulas are based on analysis of the roots of minimal MV polynomial and covers defective MVs, i.e. the MVs that have non-diagonalizable matrix representations. The method may be generalized straightforwardly to matrix functions and to finite dimensional linear operators. The results can find wide application in Clifford algebra analysis.</description>

      <title>Lower and upper bounds for configurations of points on a sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new proof (based on spectral decomposition) of a bound originally proved by Sidelnikov~\, for the frame potentials $\sum_{ij} \left( {\bf P}_i \cdot {\bf P}_j \right)^\ell $ on a unit--sphere in $d$ dimensions. Sidelnikov's bound is a special case of the lower bound for the weighted sums $\sum_{ij} f_i f_j \left( {\bf P}_i \cdot {\bf P}_j \right)^\ell$, where $f_i&gt;0$ are scalar quantities associated to each point on the sphere, which we also prove using spectral decomposition. Moreover, in three dimensions, again using spectral decomposition, we find a sharp upper bound for $\sum_{ijk}^N \left[ \left( {\bf P}_i \times {\bf P}_j\right) \cdot {\bf P}_k \right]^2$.
  We explore two applications of these bounds: first, we examine configurations of points corresponding to the local minima of the Thomson problem for $N=972$; second, we analyze various distributions of points within a three-dimensional volume, where a suitable weighted sum is defined to satisfy a specific bound.</description>

      <title>Extreme Gibbs measures for a Hard-Core-SOS model on Cayley trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate splitting Gibbs measures (SGMs) of a three-state (wand-graph) hardcore SOS model on Cayley trees of order $ k \geq 2 $. Recently, this model was studied for the hinge-graph with $ k = 2, 3 $, while the case $ k \geq 4 $ remains unresolved. It was shown that as the coupling strength $\theta$ increases, the number of translation-invariant SGMs (TISGMs) evolves through the sequence $ 1 \to 3 \to 5 \to 6 \to 7 $.
  In this paper, for wand-graph we demonstrate that for arbitrary $ k \geq 2 $, the number of TISGMs is at most three, denoted by $ \mu_i $, $ i = 0, 1, 2 $. We derive the exact critical value $\theta_{\text{cr}}(k)$ at which the non-uniqueness of TISGMs begins. The measure $ \mu_0 $ exists for any $\theta &gt; 0$.
  Next, we investigate whether $ \mu_i $, $i=0,1,2$ is extreme or non-extreme in the set of all Gibbs measures.
  The results are quite intriguing:
  1) For $\mu_0$:
  - For $ k = 2 $ and $ k = 3 $, there exist critical values $\theta_1(k)$ and $\theta_2(k)$ such that $ \mu_0 $ is extreme if and only if $\theta \in (\theta_1, \theta_2)$, excluding the boundary values $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$, where the extremality remains undetermined.
  - Moreover, for $ k \geq 4 $, $ \mu_0 $ is never extreme.
  2) For $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ at $k=2$ there is $\theta_5&lt;\theta_{\text{cr}}(2)=1$ such that these measures are extreme if $\theta \in (\theta_5, 1)$.</description>

      <title>Generalized Buchdahl equations as Lie-Hamilton systems: Quantum deformations and their general solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the nonlinear second-order differential equations $$ \ddot{x}(t)=a(x)\dot{x}(t)^2+b(t)\dot{x}(t) $$ where $a(x)$ and $b(t)$ are arbitrary functions on their argument from the perspective of Lie-Hamilton systems. For the particular choice $a(x)=3/x$ and $b(t)=1/t$, these equations reduce to the Buchdahl equation considered in the context of General Relativity. It is shown that these equations are associated to the 'book' Lie algebra $\mathfrak{b}_2$, determining a Lie-Hamilton system for which the corresponding $t$-dependent Hamiltonian and the general solution of the equations are given. The procedure is illustrated considering several particular cases. We also make use of the quantum deformation of $\mathfrak{b}_2$ with quantum deformation parameter $z$ (where $q={\rm e}^z$), leading to a deformed generalized Buchdahl equation. Applying the formalism of Poisson-Hopf deformations of Lie-Hamilton systems, we derive the corresponding deformed $t$-dependent Hamiltonian, as well as its general solution. The presence of the quantum deformation parameter $z$ is interpreted as the introduction of an integrable perturbation of the initial generalized Buchdahl equation, which is described in detail in its linear approximation.</description>

      <title>Theory of general theta relations, addition formulas, and theta constants identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jacobi's theta relations among quartic products of theta functions are generalized to those of arbitrary $n$ products. Igusa's procedure of derivation is extended to prove such general theta relations, from which we obtain general addition formulas and theta constants identities. To complete the proof, the concept of {\it cycle number $\lambda$} is essential. The case of $n=3$ is discussed and examined explicitly.</description>

      <title>Extended Landen's formulas and double product theta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an arbitrary positive integer $p$, Landen's formula is extended to express theta function with modulus $p\tau$ by $p$ product of theta functions with $\tau$, which is applied to several examples. Next it is shown that double product of theta functions of genus $g=1$ is written by a sum of $g=2$ theta functions, which is a subset having a special period matrix of $\tau_{11}=\tau_{22}$. Several applied examples are shown, which include the cubic identity of Borwein and Borwein.</description>

      <title>Curvature-Enhanced Dynamics and Exponential Decay of the Non-Cutoff Boltzmann Equation on Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the long-time behavior of solutions to the non-cutoff Boltzmann equation on compact Riemannian manifolds with bounded Ricci curvature. The paper introduces new results on the exponential decay of hydrodynamic quantities, such as density, momentum, and energy fields, influenced by both the curvature of the manifold and singularities in the collision kernel. We demonstrate that for initial data in $H^s_x \times L^p_v$, the solutions exhibit sharp exponential decay rates in Sobolev norms, with the decay rate determined by the manifold's geometry and the regularity of the kernel. Specifically, we prove that the density $\rho(t, x)$, momentum $\mathbf{m}(t, x)$, and energy field $E(t, x)$ all decay exponentially in time, with decay rates that depend on the manifold's curvature and the nature of the collision kernel's singularity. Additionally, we address the case of angular singularities in the collision kernel, providing conditions under which the exponential decay persists. The analysis combines energy methods, Fourier analysis, and coercivity estimates for the collision operator, extended to curved geometries. These results extend the understanding of dissipation mechanisms in kinetic theory, especially in curved settings, and offer valuable insights into the behavior of rarefied gases and plasma flows in non-Euclidean environments. The findings have applications in plasma physics, astrophysics, and the study of rarefied gases, opening new directions for future research in kinetic theory and geometric analysis.</description>

      <title>Gibbs measures as local equilibrium KMS states for focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the study of statistical equilibria for focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger and Hartree equations on the d-dimensional torus when d=1,2,3. Due to the focusing nature of the nonlinearity in these PDEs, Gibbs measures have to be appropriately localized. First, we show that these local Gibbs measures are stationary solutions for the Liouville probability density equation and that they satisfy a local equilibrium Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition. Secondly, under some natural assumptions, we characterize all possible local KMS equilibrium states for these PDEs as local Gibbs measures.
  Our methods are based on Malliavin calculus in Gross-Stroock Sobolev spaces and on a suitable Gaussian integration by parts formula. To handle the technical problems due to localization, we rely on the works of Aida and Kusuoka on irreducibility of Dirichlet forms over infinite-dimensional domains. This leads us to the study of sublevel sets of the renormalized mass and their connectedness properties. In this paper, we also revisit Bourgain's proof of the normalizability of the local Gibbs measure for the focusing Hartree equation on the d-dimensional torus with d=2,3 by using concentration inequalities.</description>

      <title>Dual Euler--Poincar\'e/Lie--Poisson formulation of subinertial stratified thermal ocean flow with identification of Casimirs as Noether quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the geometric structure of a quasigeostrophic approximation to a recently introduced reduced-gravity thermal rotating shallow-water model that accounts for stratification. Specifically, it considers a low-frequency approximation of a model for flow above the ocean thermocline, governed by primitive equations with buoyancy variations in both horizontal and vertical directions. Like the thermal model, the stratified variant generates circulation patterns reminiscent of submesoscale instabilities visible in satellite images. An improvement is its ability to model mixed-layer restratification due to baroclinic instability.
  The primary contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that the model is derived from an Euler--Poincar\'e variational principle, culminating in a Kelvin--Noether theorem, previously established solely for the primitive-equation parent model. The model's Lie--Poisson Hamiltonian structure, earlier obtained through direct calculation, is shown to result from a Legendre transform with the associated geometry elucidated by identifying the relevant momentum map.
  Another significant contribution of this paper is the identification of the Casimirs of the Lie--Poisson system, including a newly found weaker Casimir family forming the kernel of the Lie--Poisson bracket, which results in potential vorticity evolution independent of buoyancy details as it advects under the flow. These conservation laws related to particle relabeling symmetry are explicitly linked to Noether quantities from the Euler--Poincar\'e principle when variations are not constrained to vanish at integration endpoints.
  The dual Euler--Poincar\'e/Lie--Poisson formalism provides a unified framework for describing quasigeostrophic reduced-gravity stratified thermal flow, mirroring the approach used in the primitive-equation setting.</description>

Abstract: In this paper the fields of multiply periodic, or Kleinian $\wp$-functions are exposed. Such a field arises on the Jacobian variety of an algebraic curve, and provides natural algebraic models of the Jacobian and Kummer varieties, possesses the addition law, and accommodates dynamical equations with solutions. All this will be explained in detail for plane algebraic curves in their canonical forms. Example of hyperelliptic and non-hyperelliptic curves are presented.</description>

      <title>Nakajima quiver bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a Nakajima bundle representation. Given a labelled quiver and a variety or manifold $X$, such a representation involves an assignment of a complex vector bundle on $X$ to each node of the doubled quiver; to the edges, we assign sections of, and connections on, associated twisted bundles. We for the most part restrict attention in our development to algebraic curves or Riemann surfaces. Our construction simultaneously generalizes ordinary Nakajima quiver representations on the one hand and quiver bundles on the other hand. These representations admit gauge-theoretic characterizations, analogous to the ADHM equations in the original work of Nakajima, allowing for the construction of these generalized quiver varieties using a reduction procedure with moment maps. We study the deformation theory of Nakajima bundle representations, prove a Hitchin-Kobayashi correspondence between such representations and stable quiver bundles, examine the natural torus action on the resulting moduli varieties, and comment on scenarios where the variety is hyperk\"ahler. Finally, we produce concrete examples that recover known and new moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and exponential stability of dispersive nonlinear Maxwell equations with PML: An evolutionary approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical foundation for physical models in nonlinear optics through the lens of evolutionary equations. It focuses on two key concepts: well-posedness and exponential stability of Maxwell equations, with models that include materials with complex dielectric properties, dispersion, and discontinuities. We use a Hilbert space framework to address these complex physical models in nonlinear optics. While our focus is on the first-order formulation in space and time, higher solution regularity recovers and equates to the second-order formulation. We incorporate perfectly matched layers (PMLs), which model absorbing boundary conditions, to facilitate the development of numerical methods. We demonstrate that the combined system remains well-posed and exponentially stable. Our approach applies to a broad class of partial differential equations (PDEs) and accommodates materials with nonlocal behavior in space and time. The contribution of this work is a unified framework for analyzing wave interactions in advanced optical materials.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider spread-out models of lattice trees and lattice animals on $\mathbb Z^d$, for $d$ above the upper critical dimension $d_{\mathrm c}=8$. We define a correlation length and prove that it diverges as $(p_c-p)^{-1/4}$ at the critical point $p_c$. Using this, we prove that the near-critical two-point function is bounded above by $C|x|^{-(d-2)}\exp[-c(p_c-p)^{1/4}|x|]$. We apply the near-critical bound to study lattice trees and lattice animals on a discrete $d$-dimensional torus (with $d &gt; d_{\mathrm c}$) of volume $V$. For $p_c-p$ of order $V^{-1/2}$, we prove that the torus susceptibility is of order $V^{1/4}$, and that the torus two-point function behaves as $|x|^{-(d-2)} + V^{-3/4}$ and thus has a plateau of size $V^{-3/4}$. The proofs require significant extensions of previous results obtained using the lace expansion.</description>

      <title>Critical scaling profile for trees and connected subgraphs on the complete graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse generating functions for trees and for connected subgraphs on the complete graph, and identify a single scaling profile which applies for both generating functions in a critical window. Our motivation comes from the analysis of the finite-size scaling of lattice trees and lattice animals on a high-dimensional discrete torus, for which we conjecture that the identical profile applies in dimensions $d \ge 8$.</description>

      <title>On the Equivalence of Equilibrium and Freezing States in Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with freezing phase transitions in general dynamical systems. A freezing phase transition is one in which, for a given potential $\phi$, there exists some inverse temperature $\beta_0 &gt; 0$ such that for all $\alpha, \beta &gt; \beta_0$, the collection of equilibrium states for $\alpha \phi$ and $\beta \phi$ coincide. In this sense, below the temperature $1 / \beta_0$, the system "freezes" on a fixed collection of equilibrium states.
  We show that for a given invariant measure $\mu$, it is no more restrictive that $\mu$ is the freezing state for some potential than it is for $\mu$ to be the equilibrium state for some potential. In fact, our main result applies to any collection of equilibrium states with the same entropy. In the case where the entropy map $h$ is upper semi-continuous, we show any ergodic measure $\mu$ can be obtained as a freezing state for some potential. In this upper semi-continuous setting, we additionally show that the collection of potentials that freeze at a single state is dense in the space of all potentials.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study extensions of the GD tensor inverse using the M-product. The aim of current research is threefold. In the first place, the tensor GD inverse under the M-product is introduced and considered. We give the several properties and representations of the GD inverse using the core nilpotent decomposition and then establish the reverse-order law rules for the GD inverse. Second, the tensor GDMP inverse is studied and the corresponding numerical algorithm is given. In addition, the reverse- and forward-order laws of the GDMP inverse are established. Third, the GD-Star tensor inverse under the M-product is introduced and studied. Finally, the GD inverse, GDMP inverse and GD-Star inverse solutions of multilinear equations are investigated. Illustrative numerical calculation is performed.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal coherent states in an infinite array of boson sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A regular coherent state (CS) is a special type of quantum state for boson particles placed in a single site. The defining feature of the CS is that it is an eigenmode of the annihilation operator. The construction easily generalizes to the case of a finite number of sites. However, the challenge is altogether different when one considers an infinite array of sites. In this work we demonstrate a mathematically rigorous construction that resolves the latter case. The resulting nonlocal coherent states (NCS) are simultaneous eigenmodes for all of the infinitely many annihilation operators acting in the infinite array's Fock space. Our construction fundamentally relies on Dirichlet series-based analysis and number theoretic arguments.</description>

      <title>Zeros of conditional Gaussian analytic functions, random sub-unitary matrices and q-series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate radial statistics of zeros of hyperbolic Gaussian Analytic Functions (GAF) of the form $\varphi (z) = \sum_{k\ge 0} c_k z^k$ given that $|\varphi (0)|^2=t$ and assuming coefficients $c_k$ to be independent standard complex normals. We obtain the full conditional distribution of $N_q$, the number of zeros of $\varphi (z)$ within a disk of radius $\sqrt{q}$ centred at the origin, and prove its asymptotic normality in the limit when $q\to 1^{-}$, the limit that captures the entire zero set of $\varphi (z)$. In the same limit we also develop precise estimates for conditional probabilities of moderate to large deviations from normality. Finally, we determine the asymptotic form of $P_k(t;q)=\mathrm{Prob} \{ N_q= k | |\varphi(0)|^2=t \}$ in the limit when $k$ is kept fixed whilst $q$ approaches 1. To leading order, the hole probability $P_0(t;q)$ does not depend on $t$ for $t&gt;0$ but yet is different from that of $P_0(t=0;q)$ and coincides with the hole probability for unconditioned hyperbolic GAF of the form $\sum_{k\ge 0} \sqrt{k+1}\, c_k z^k$. We also find that asymptotically as $q \to 1^{-}$, $P_k(t;q)= e^t P_{k}(0;q)$ for every fixed $k \ge 1$ with $P_{k}(0;q)= \mathrm{Prob} \{ N_q =k-1 \}$.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Qubit Mapping with Quasi-Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes and Quaternion Orthogonal Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the qubit mapping through the integration of Quasi-Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes (QOSTBCs) with Quaternion Orthogonal Designs (QODs) in quantum error correction (QEC) frameworks. QOSTBCs have gained prominence for enhancing performance and reliability in quantum computing and communication systems. These codes draw on stabilizer group formalism and QODs to boost error correction, with QOSTBCs mapping logical qubits to physical ones, refines error handling in complex channels environments. Simulations results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by comparing the percentage improvement under various detected and corrected error conditions for four different cases, \textbf{$Z_1$} up to \textbf{$Z_4$}. The obtained simulations and implemental results show that QOSTBCs consistently achieve a higher correction improvement percentage than stabilizer Group for \textbf{$Z_1$}, \textbf{$Z_2$}, and \textbf{$Z_4$}; QOSTBCs can correct more errors than those detected, achieving over 100\% correction rates for first two cases, which indicates their enhanced resilience and redundancy in high-error environments. While for \textbf{$Z_3$}, stabilizer consistently remains above that of QOSTBCs, reflecting its slightly better performance. These outcomes indicate that QOSTBCs are reliable in making better logarithmic efficiency and error resilience, making them a valuable asset for quantum information processing and advanced wireless communication.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional fractional discrete NLS equations: dispersion relations, rogue waves, fundamental and vortex solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce physically relevant new models of two-dimensional (2D) fractional lattice media accounting for the interplay of fractional intersite coupling and onsite self-focusing. Our approach features novel discrete fractional operators based on an appropriately modified definition of the continuous Riesz fractional derivative. The model of the 2D isotropic lattice employs the discrete fractional Laplacian, whereas the 2D anisotropic system incorporates discrete fractional derivatives acting independently along orthogonal directions with different L\'evy indices (LIs). We derive exact linear dispersion relations (DRs), and identify spectral bands that permit linear modes to exist, finding them to be similar to their continuous counterparts, apart from differences in the wavenumber range. Additionally, the modulational instability in the discrete models is studied in detail, and, akin to the linear DRs, it is found to align with the situation in continuous models. This consistency highlights the nature of our newly defined discrete fractional derivatives. Furthermore, using Gaussian inputs, we produce a variety of rogue-wave structures. By means of numerical methods, we systematically construct families of 2D fundamental and vortex solitons, and examine their stability. Fundamental solitons maintain the stability due to the discrete nature of the interactions, preventing the onset of the critical and supercritical collapse. On the other hand, vortex solitons are unstable in the isotropic lattice model. However, the anisotropic one -- in particular, its symmetric version with equal LIs acting in both directions -- maintains stable vortex solitons with winding numbers $S=1$ and $S=3$. The detailed results stress the robustness of the newly defined discrete fractional Laplacian in supporting well-defined soliton modes in the 2D lattice media.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the neural tangent kernel (NTK) for general partial differential equations (PDEs) based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). As we all know, the training of an artificial neural network can be converted to the evolution of NTK. We analyze the initialization of NTK and the convergence conditions of NTK during training for general PDEs. The theoretical results show that the homogeneity of differential operators plays a crucial role for the convergence of NTK. Moreover, based on the PINNs, we validate the convergence conditions of NTK using the initial value problems of the sine-Gordon equation and the initial-boundary value problem of the KdV equation.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a quantum strategy from nonlocal games to improve the stabilizer approximation we proposed previously. The resulting approach turns out to be a qubit-by-qubit gauging procedure for standard stabilizers, which could involve discrete or continuous gauge parameters. We take examples from many-body physics and quantum chemistry to show such a procedure leads to an improvement of the performance.</description>

      <title>The local similarity theory, including the "spectral" Prandtl mixing length. Dissipation of energies and structural parameters in the atmospheric CBL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper discusses a variant of the local similarity theory, employing the second moment of vertical velocity and the "spectral" Prandtl mixing length as basic parameters. This approach allows expressing the turbulent exchange coefficient, dissipations of kinetic energy and buoyancy square, mixed moments of the buoyancy and vertical velocity, as well as structural parameters solely through two independent basic parameters of local similarity. Comparison of local similarity approximations with experimental data convincingly confirms the correctness of the proposed relationships and demonstrates the high efficiency of the considered theory. It is established that the approximations of the turbulent exchange coefficient and dissipations of local similarity are fully consistent with the semi-empirical theories of Prandtl, Hanna, Richardson-Onsager and the Kolmogorov-Obukhov spectral theory with the law -5/3 for the atmospheric CBL. Thus, the new theory of local similarity significantly extends the scope of applications of well-known turbulence theories and substantially complements our understanding of turbulent convection.</description>

We show that the Mess map is a symplectic diffeomorphism from $T^*T_0(1)$ to $T_0(1)\times T_0(1)$ for a canonical symplectic form on $T^*T_0(1)$ and the difference of two Weil-Petersson symplectic forms on $T_0(1)\times T_0(1)$. Moreover, we show that the anti-holomorphic energy functional of the induced Gauss map is a K\"ahler potential of the canonical symplectic form over certain subspaces of $T^*T_0(1)$.</description>

Abstract: We present numerical minimizers for the first seven eigenvalues of the magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian with constant magnetic field in a wide range of field strengths. Adapting an approach by Antunes and Freitas, we use gradient descent for the minimization procedure together with the Method of Fundamental solutions for eigenvalue computation. Remarkably, we observe that when the magnetic flux exceeds the index of the target eigenvalue, the minimizer is always a disk.</description>

      <title>Cluster volumes for the Gaussian free field on metric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the volume of the critical clusters for the percolation of the level sets of the Gaussian free field on metric graphs. On $\mathbb{Z}^d$ below the upper-critical dimension $d=6$, we show that the largest such cluster in a box of side length $r$ has volume of order $r^{\frac{d+2}{2}}$, as conjectured by Werner in arXiv:2002.11487. This is in contrast to the mean-field regime $d&gt;6$, where this volume is of order $r^4$. We further obtain precise asymptotic tails for the volume of the critical cluster of the origin, and a lower bound on the tail of the volume of the near-critical cluster of the origin below the upper-critical dimension. Our proof extends to any graph with polynomial volume growth and polynomial decay of the Green's function as long as the critical one-arm probability decays as the square root of the Green's function, which is satisfied in low enough dimension.</description>

The FOEL conjecture was a guess made by Nachtergaele, Spitzer and an author for the Heisenberg model on certain graphs: a family of inequalities, the first of which is the statement that the spectral gap of the Heisenberg model equals the gap of the random walk. That first guess was originally a conjecture of Aldous which was later proved by Caputo, Liggett and Richthammer. We claim that for spin rings of even length $L&gt;4$, the lowest spin $S=0$ energy is lower than the lowest spin $S=1$ energy. This violates the $(L/2)$-th inequality in the FOEL conjecture.
  Our methodology is largely numerical: we have applied exact diagonalization up to $L=20$. We also rigorously consider the Hamiltonian of the Heisenberg spin ring for even length $L$ projected to the spin $S=0$ sector. We prove that it has a unique ground state. Then, using the single mode approximation the uniqueness explains the energy turn-around. Important insight comes from reconsideration of previous work by Sutherland, using the Bethe ansatz. Especially important is a work of Dhar and Shastry that goes beyond the Bethe ansatz.</description>

      <title>Deformation quantization with separation of variables of $G_{2,4}\left(\mathbb{C}\right)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the deformation quantization with separation of variables on the Grassmannian $G_{2,4}\left(\mathbb{C}\right)$. The star product on $G_{2,4}\left(\mathbb{C}\right)$ can be explicitly determined as the solution of the recurrence relations for $G_{2,4}\left(\mathbb{C}\right)$ given by Hara and one of the authors (A. S.). To give the solution of the recurrence relations, it is necessary to solve a system of linear equations at each order. However, to give the concrete expression of the general term is not easy because the variables increase with the order of the differentiation of the star product. For this reason, there has been no formula to express the general term of the recurrence relations. In this paper, by overcoming this problem by transforming the recurrence relations into simpler ones, we obtain the formula for the general term. We solve the recurrence relations by using creation and annihilation operators on a Fock space. From this solution, we obtain the explicit formula of the star product with separation of variables on $G_{2,4}\left(\mathbb{C}\right)$.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the contact structures and dynamics of stochastic vector bundles. It finds that the probability space of stochastic vector bundles possesses an infinite-order jet structure, enabling a geometric analysis of stochastic processes. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates that stochastic vector bundles have a natural contact structure, leading to a decomposition of the tangent space and providing insights into the system's evolution and constraints. Finally, it derives a set of canonical equations for stochastic vector bundles. These equations result from the principle of least constraint, showing the relation between the geometric structure of stochastic system evolution and its tendency to minimize constraint. This study provides a valuable geometric framework for analyzing stochastic systems, with potential applications in various fields where probabilistic behavior is crucial.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Lieb-Robinson bounds for commuting long-range interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works have revealed the intricate effect of long-range interactions on information transport in quantum many-body systems: In $D$ spatial dimensions, interactions decaying as a power-law $r^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha &gt; 2D+1$ exhibit a Lieb-Robinson bound (LRB) with a linear light cone and the threshold $2D+1$ is sharp in general. Here, we observe that mutually commuting, long-range interactions satisfy an enhanced LRB of the form $t \, r^{-\alpha}$ for any $\alpha &gt; 0$. In particular, the linear light cone occurs at $\alpha = 1$ in any dimension. Part of our motivation stems from quantum error-correcting codes. As applications, we derive enhanced bounds on ground state correlations and an enhanced local perturbations perturb locally (LPPL) principle for which we adapt a recent subharmonicity argument of Wang-Hazzard. Similar enhancements hold for commuting interactions with stretched exponential decay.</description>

      <title>Functional analytic insights into irreversibility of quantum resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15678v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an approach to the study of quantum resource manipulation based on the basic observation that quantum channels which preserve certain sets of states are contractive with respect to the base norms induced by those sets. We forgo the usual physical assumptions on quantum dynamics: instead of enforcing complete positivity, trace preservation, or resource-theoretic considerations, we study transformation protocols as norm-contractive maps. This allows us to apply to this problem a technical toolset from functional and convex analysis, unifying previous approaches and introducing new families of bounds for the distillable resources and the resource cost, both one-shot and asymptotic. Since our expressions lend themselves naturally to single-letter forms, they can often be calculated in practice; by doing so, we demonstrate with examples that they can yield the best known bounds on quantities such as the entanglement cost. As applications, we not only give an alternative derivation of the recent result of [arXiv:2111.02438] which showed that entanglement theory is asymptotically irreversible, but also provide the quantities introduced in that work with explicit operational meaning in the context of entanglement distillation through a variation of the hypothesis testing relative entropy. Besides entanglement, we reveal a new irreversible quantum resource: through improved bounds for state transformations in the resource theory of magic-state quantum computation, we show that there exist qutrit magic states that cannot be reversibly interconverted under stabiliser protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new geometric procedure to construct symplectic methods for constrained mechanical systems is developed in this paper. The definition of a map coming from the notion of retraction maps allows to adapt the continuous problem to the discretization rule rather than viceversa. As a result, the constraint submanifold is exactly preserved by the symplectic discrete flow and the extension of these methods to the case of non-linear configuration spaces is doable.</description>

      <title>The Non-cutoff Boltzmann Equation in Bounded Domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00494v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The initial-boundary value problem for the inhomogeneous non-cutoff Boltzmann equation is a challenging open problem. In this paper, we study the stability and long-time dynamics of the Boltzmann equation near a global Maxwellian without angular cutoff assumption in a general $C^3$ bounded domain $\Omega$ (including convex and non-convex cases) with physical boundary conditions: inflow and Maxwell-reflection (with accommodation coefficient $\alpha&gt;0$) boundary conditions. We obtain the global-in-time existence, which has an exponential decay rate towards the global Maxwellian for both hard and soft potentials. The crucial methods are the forward-backward extension of the boundary problem to the whole space by Vlasov-type equations, an $L^\infty$ trace lemma with an improved velocity averaging lemma, and an extra damping provided by the advection operator, followed by the De Giorgi iteration and the $L^2$--$L^q$--$L^\infty$ method with large $q$.</description>

Abstract: We present a marginal likelihood strategy integrated into the Kennedy-O'Hagan (KOH) Bayesian framework, where a Gaussian process serves as a prior for model discrepancy. The proposed method is both computationally efficient and numerically stable, even in large dataset regimes where the likelihood function approaches degeneracy. Applied to the characterization of a super-conducting quantum device at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the approach enhances the predictive accuracy of the Lindblad master equations for modeling Ramsey measurement data by effectively quantifying uncertainties consistent with the quantum data</description>

      <title>Okounkov's conjecture via BPS Lie algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $Q$ be an arbitrary finite quiver. We use nonabelian stable envelopes to relate representations of the Maulik-Okounkov Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}^{MO}_Q$ to representations of the BPS Lie algebra associated to the tripled quiver $\tilde Q$ with its canonical potential. We use this comparison to provide an isomorphism between the Maulik-Okounkov Lie algebra and the BPS Lie algebra. Via this isomorphism we prove Okounkov's conjecture, equating the graded dimensions of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}^{MO}_Q$ with the coefficients of Kac polynomials. Via general results regarding cohomological Hall algebras in dimensions two and three we furthermore give a complete description of $\mathfrak{g}^{MO}_Q$ as a generalised Kac-Moody Lie algebra with Cartan datum given by intersection cohomology of singular Nakajima quiver varieties, and prove a conjecture of Maulik and Okounkov, stating that their Lie algebra is obtained from a Lie algebra defined over the rationals, by extension of scalars. Finally, we explain how our results suggest the correct definition of critical stable envelopes in vanishing cycle cohomology.</description>

      <title>Representations of a quantum-deformed Lorentz algebra, Clebsch-Gordan map, and Fenchel-Nielsen representation of complex Chern-Simons theory at level-${N}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A family of infinite-dimensional irreducible $*$-representations on $\mathcal{H}\simeq L^2(\mathbb{R})\otimes\mathbb{C}^N$ is defined for a quantum-deformed Lorentz algebra $\mathscr{U}_{\bf q}(sl_2)\otimes \mathscr{U}_{\widetilde{\bf {q}}}(sl_2)$, where $\mathbf{q}=\exp[\frac{\pi i}{N}(1+b^2)]$ and $\tilde{\mathbf{q}}=\exp[\frac{\pi i}{N}(1+b^{-2})]$ with $N\in\mathbb{Z}_+$ and $|b|=1$. The representations are constructed with the irreducible representation of quantum torus algebra at level-$N$, which is developed from the quantization of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory. We study the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition of the tensor product representation, and we show that it reduces to the same problem as diagonalizing the complex Fenchel-Nielson length operators in quantizing $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory on 4-holed sphere. Finally, we explicitly compute the spectral decomposition of the complex Fenchel-Nielson length operators and the corresponding direct-integral representation of the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, which we call the Fenchel-Nielson representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate and prove examples of a conjecture which describes the W-algebras in type A as successive quantum Hamiltonian reductions of affine vertex algebras associated with several hook-type nilpotent orbits. This implies that the affine coset subalgebras of hook-type W-algebras are building blocks of the W-algebras in type A. In the rational case, it turns out that the building blocks for the simple quotients are provided by the minimal series of the regular W-algebras. In contrast, they are provided by singlet-type extensions of W-algebras at collapsing levels which are irrational. In the latter case, several new sporadic isomorphisms between different W-algebras are established.</description>

      <title>The Existence and Distribution of Photon Spheres Near Spherically Symmetric Black Holes -- A Geometric Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14035v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photon sphere has attracted significant attention since the discovery of black hole shadow images by Event Horizon Telescope. Recently, a number of studies have highlighted that the number of photon spheres and their distributions near black holes are strongly constrained by black hole properties. Specifically, for black holes with event horizons and proper asymptotic behaviors, the number of stable and unstable photon spheres satisfies the relation $n_{\text{stable}} - n_{\text{unstable}} = -1$. In this study, we provide a novel proof on this relation using a completely new geometric approach, in which the stable and unstable photon spheres are determined by Gaussian curvature and geodesic curvature in the optical geometry of black hole spacetimes. Firstly, we demonstrated the existence of photon spheres near black holes with proper asymptotic behaviors (asymptotically flat black holes, asymptotically de-Sitter and anti-de-Sitter black holes). Subsequently, we proved that the stable and unstable photon spheres near black holes must be one-to-one alternatively separated from each other, such that each unstable photon sphere is sandwiched between two stable photon spheres (and each stable photon sphere is sandwiched between two unstable photon spheres). Our analysis in this study is limited to the spherically symmetric black hole spacetime (with the spacetime metric $ds^{2}=g_{tt}dt^{2}+g_{rr}dr^{2}+g_{\theta\theta}d\theta^{2}+g_{\phi\phi}d\phi^{2}$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A spin (qubit) is in contact with a bosonic reservoir. The state of the reservoir contains a parameter {\varepsilon} interpolating between quantum and classical reservoir features. We derive the explicit expression for the time-dependent reduced spin density matrix, valid for all values of {\varepsilon} and for energy conserving interactions. We study decoherence and markovianity properties. Our main finding is that the spin decoherence is enhanced (full decoherence) when the spin is coupled to quantum reservoir states while it is dampened (partial decoherence) when coupled to classical reservoir states. The markovianity properties depend in a subtle way on the classicality parameter {\varepsilon} and on the finer details of the spin-reservoir interaction. We further examine scattering and periodicity properties for energy exchange interactions.</description>

      <title>Perturbation theory for resonant states near a bound state in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a perturbation theory to analyze resonant states near a bound state in the continuum (BIC) in photonic crystal slabs. The theory allows us to rigorously determine the asymptotic behavior of $Q$-factor and the far-field polarization. We show that the resonant states close to a BIC can be nearly circularly polarized if the scattering matrix satisfies a certain condition. Moreover, our theory offers a novel perspective on super-BICs and provides a clear and precise condition to efficiently identify them in both symmetric and asymmetric structures without requiring a merging process. For practical applications, we find a super-BIC in a square lattice of rods on a dielectric substrate. Our theory addresses the non-Hermitian nature of the system, can be generalized to treat other structures that support BICs, and has potential applications in resonance and chiral optics.</description>

      <title>Continuity bounds for quantum entropies arising from a fundamental entropic inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a tight upper bound for the difference in von Neumann entropies between two quantum states, $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$. This bound is expressed in terms of the von Neumann entropies of the mutually orthogonal states derived from the Jordan-Hahn decomposition of the difference operator $(\rho_1 - \rho_2)$. This yields a novel entropic inequality that implies the well-known Audenaert-Fannes (AF) inequality. In fact, it also leads to a refinement of the AF inequality. We employ this inequality to obtain a uniform continuity bound for the quantum conditional entropy of two states whose marginals on the conditioning system coincide. We additionally use it to derive a continuity bound for the quantum relative entropy in both variables. Interestingly, the fundamental entropic inequality is also valid in infinite dimensions.</description>

Abstract: It has been shown in Phys. Rev. Lett., 108 170402 (2012) (https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.170402), that quantum tunneling is instantaneous using a time-of-arrival (TOA) operator constructed by Weyl quantization of the classical TOA. However, there are infinitely many possible quantum images of the classical TOA, leaving it unclear if one is uniquely preferred over the others. This raises the question on whether instantaneous tunneling time is simply an artifact of the chosen ordering rule. Here, we demonstrate that tunneling time vanishes for all possible quantum images of the classical arrival time, irrespective of the ordering rule between the position and momentum observables. The result still holds for TOA-operators that are constructed independent of canonical quantization, while still imposing the correct algebra defined by the time-energy canonical commutation relation.</description>

      <title>Efficient Verification of Stabilizer Code Subspaces with Local Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the task of verifying whether a quantum computer, designed to be protected by a specific stabilizer code, correctly encodes the corresponding logical qubits. To achieve this, we develop a general framework for subspace verification and explore several stabilizer code subspaces of practical significance. First, we present two efficient verification strategies for general stabilizer code subspaces, utilizing measurements of their stabilizer generators and stabilizer groups, respectively. Then, building on the observation that certain tests can be conducted in parallel when the subspace exhibits specific structural properties, we propose a coloring strategy tailored to graph code subspaces and an XZ strategy tailored to Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code subspaces. Compared to stabilizer-based strategies, these new strategies require significantly fewer measurement settings and consume fewer state copies, approaching near-global optimality. Notably, all the strategies employ a limited number of Pauli measurements, are non-adaptive, and work on mixed states, enabling efficient experimental certification of both logical qubits and logical operations in noisy quantum computers. This work contributes to the first systematic study of efficient verification of stabilizer code subspaces with local measurements.</description>

      <title>Quantum Groups as Global Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum field theories which have quantum groups as global internal symmetries. We show that in such theories operators are generically non-local, and should be thought as living at the ends of topological lines. We describe the general constraints of the quantum group symmetry, given by Ward identities, that correlation functions of the theory should satisfy. We also show that generators of the symmetry can be represented by topological lines with some novel properties. We then discuss a particular example of $U_q(sl_2)$ symmetric CFT, which we solve using the bootstrap techniques and relying on the symmetry. We finally show strong evidence that for a special value of $q$ a subsector of this theory reproduces the fermionic formulation of the Ising model. This suggests that a quantum group can act on local operators as well, however, it generically transforms them into non-local ones.</description>

      <title>Peierls substitution and Hall motion in exotic Carroll dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The particle with first-order dynamics proposed by Dunne, Jackiw and Trugenberger (DJT) to justify the ``Peierls substitution" is obtained by reduction from both of the planar two-parameter centrally extended Galilean and Carroll systems. In the latter case the extension parameters $\kappa_{exo}$ and $\kappa_{mag}$ generate non-commutativity of the coordinates resp. behave as an internal magnetic field. The position and momentum follow uncoupled anomalous Hall motions. Consistently with partial immobility, one of the Carroll boost generators is broken but the other remains a symmetry. Switching off $\kappa_{exo}$, the immobility of unextended Carroll particles is recovered. The Carroll system is dual to an uncharged anyon on the horizon of a black hole which exhibits the spin-Hall effect.</description>

      <title>On the Replica Symmetry of a Variant of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Spin Glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider $N$ i.i.d. Ising spins with mean $m\in (-1,1)$ whose interactions are described by a Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Hamiltonian with a quartic correction. This model was recently introduced by Bolthausen in \cite{Bolt2} as a toy model to understand whether a second moment argument can be used to derive the replica symmetric formula in the full high temperature regime if $m\neq 0$. In \cite{Bolt2}, Bolthausen suggested that a natural analogue of the de Almeida-Thouless condition for the toy model is
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:conj} \beta^2(1-m^2)^2\leq 1. \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, (1)\end{equation} Here, $\beta \geq 0$ corresponds to the inverse temperature. While the second moment method implies replica symmetry for $\beta $ sufficiently small, Bolthausen showed that the method fails to prove replica symmetry in the full region described by (1). A natural question that was left open in \cite{Bolt2} is whether (1) correctly characterizes the high temperature phase of the toy model. In this note, we show that this is indeed not the case. We prove that if $|m| \geq m_*$, for some $m_* \in (0,1)$, the limiting free energy of the toy model is negative for suitable $\beta $ that satisfy (1).</description>
