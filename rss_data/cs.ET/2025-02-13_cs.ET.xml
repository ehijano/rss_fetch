      <title>Improving VANET Simulation Channel Model in an Urban Environment via Calibration Using Real-World Communication Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless communication channels in Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs) suffer from packet losses, which severely influences the performance of their applications. There are several reasons for this loss, including but not limited to signal interference with itself after being reflected from the ground and other objects, the doppler effect caused by the speed of the vehicle, and buildings and other vehicles blocking the signal. As a result, VANET simulators must be calibrated in order to mimic the behavior of real-world vehicular communication channels effectively. In this paper, we calibrated an OMNET++(Objective Modular Network Testbed in C++)/Veins simulator for VANET's dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) protocol using the field data from the urban testbed in Downtown Chattanooga, TN. Channel propagation models, as well as physical layer parameters, were calibrated using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The performance of the calibrated simulator was improved significantly in comparison with the default settings in Veins. The final results were compared to the real-world data collected from the testbed and performance shows that the final calibrated channel model performs better than uncalibrated models in simulating the packet delivery pattern of DSRC channels.</description>

      <title>AR Glulam: Accurate Augmented Reality Using Multiple Fiducial Markers for Glulam Fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Augmented Reality (AR) have demonstrated applications in architecture, design, and fabrication. Compared to conventional 2D construction drawings, AR can be used to superimpose contextual instructions, display 3D spatial information and enable on-site engagement. Despite the potential of AR, the widespread adoption of the technology in the industry is limited by its precision. Precision is important for projects requiring strict construction tolerances, design fidelity, and fabrication feedback. For example, the manufacturing of glulam beams requires tolerances of less than 2mm. The goal of this project is to explore the industrial application of using multiple fiducial markers for high-precision AR fabrication. While the method has been validated in lab settings with a precision of 0.97, this paper focuses on fabricating glulam beams in a factory setting with an industry manufacturer, Unalam Factory.</description>

      <title>Scalable Thermodynamic Second-order Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many hardware proposals have aimed to accelerate inference in AI workloads. Less attention has been paid to hardware acceleration of training, despite the enormous societal impact of rapid training of AI models. Physics-based computers, such as thermodynamic computers, offer an efficient means to solve key primitives in AI training algorithms. Optimizers that normally would be computationally out-of-reach (e.g., due to expensive matrix inversions) on digital hardware could be unlocked with physics-based hardware. In this work, we propose a scalable algorithm for employing thermodynamic computers to accelerate a popular second-order optimizer called Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (K-FAC). Our asymptotic complexity analysis predicts increasing advantage with our algorithm as $n$, the number of neurons per layer, increases. Numerical experiments show that even under significant quantization noise, the benefits of second-order optimization can be preserved. Finally, we predict substantial speedups for large-scale vision and graph problems based on realistic hardware characteristics.</description>

      <title>Being good (at driving): Characterizing behavioral expectations on automated and human driven vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For over a century, researchers have wrestled with how to define good driving behavior, and the debate has surfaced anew for automated vehicles (AVs). We put forth the concept of Drivership as a framing for the realization of good driving behaviors. Drivership grounds the evaluation of driving behaviors in the alignment between the mutualistic expectations that exist amongst road users. Leveraging existing literature, we distinguish Empirical Expectations (i.e., reflecting "beliefs that a certain behavior will be followed," drawing on past experiences) (Bicchieri, 2006); and Normative Expectations (i.e., reflecting "beliefs that a certain behavior ought to be followed," based on societally agreed-upon principles) (Bicchieri, 2006). Because societal expectations naturally shift over time, we introduce a third type of expectation, Furtherance Expectations, denoting behavior which could be exhibited to enable continuous improvement of the transportation ecosystem. We position Drivership within the space of societal Normative Expectations, which may overlap with some Empirical and Furtherance Expectations, constrained by what is technologically and physically feasible.
  Additionally, we establish a novel vocabulary to rigorously tackle conversations on stakeholders' expectations, a key feature of value-sensitive design. We also detail how Drivership comprises safety-centric behaviors and what we term socially-aware behaviors (where there are no clear safety stakes).
  Drivership supports multiple purposes, including advancing the understanding and evaluation of driving performance through benchmarking based on many criteria. As such, we argue that an appropriate framing of the notion of Drivership also underpins the overall development of a safety case. The paper explores these applications under the more general tenet of Drivership as a central element to roadway citizenship.</description>

      <title>Semantic Learning for Molecular Communication in Internet of Bio-Nano Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) provides a foundational framework for information transmission in the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT), where efficiency and reliability are crucial. However, the inherent limitations of molecular channels, such as low transmission rates, noise, and inter-symbol interference (ISI), limit their ability to support complex data transmission. This paper proposes an end-to-end semantic learning framework designed to optimize task-oriented molecular communication, with a focus on biomedical diagnostic tasks under resource-constrained conditions. The proposed framework employs a deep encoder-decoder architecture to efficiently extract, quantize, and decode semantic features, prioritizing task-relevant semantic information to enhance diagnostic classification performance. Additionally, a probabilistic channel network is introduced to approximate molecular propagation dynamics, enabling gradient-based optimization for end-to-end learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed semantic framework improves diagnostic accuracy by at least 25% compared to conventional JPEG compression with LDPC coding methods under resource-constrained communication scenarios.</description>

      <title>Operational Framework for a Quantum Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Databases are an essential component of modern computing infrastructures and allow efficient manipulation of inherently structured data. The structure depends on the type and relationships of the individual data elements and on the access pattern. Extending the concept of databases to the quantum domain is expected to increase both the storage efficiency and the access parallelism through quantum superposition. In addition, quantum databases may be seen as the result of a prior state preparation ready to be used by quantum algorithms when needed. On the other hand, limiting factors exist and include entanglement creation, the impossibility of perfect copying due to the no-cloning theorem, and the impossibility of coherently erasing a quantum state. In this work, we introduce quantum databases within the broader context of data structures using classical, or more precisely cloneable, and quantum data and indexing. In particular, we are interested in quantum databases' practical implementation and usability, focusing on the definition of the basic operations needed to create and manipulate data stored in a superposition state. Specifically, we address the case of quantum indexing in combination with cloneable data. For this scenario, we define the operations for database preparation, extension, removal of indices, writing, and read-out of data, as well as index permutation. We present their algorithmic implementation and highlight their advantages and limitations. Finally, we introduce the next steps toward defining the same operations in the more general context of quantum indexing and quantum data.</description>
