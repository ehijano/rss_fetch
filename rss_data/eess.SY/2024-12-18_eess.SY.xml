      <title>Investigating the Convergence of Sigmoid-Based Fuzzy General Grey Cognitive Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fuzzy General Grey Cognitive Map (FGGCM) and Fuzzy Grey Cognitive Map (FGCM) extend the Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) by integrating uncertainty from multiple interval data or fuzzy numbers. Despite extensive studies on the convergence of FCM and FGCM, the convergence behavior of FGGCM under sigmoid activation functions remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by deriving sufficient conditions for the convergence of FGGCM to a unique fixed point.
  Using the Banach and Browder-Gohde-Kirk fixed point theorems, and Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, the study establishes conditions for the kernels and greyness of FGGCM to converge to unique fixed points. A Web Experience FCM is adapted to design an FGGCM with weights modified to GGN. Comparisons with existing FCM and FGCM convergence theorems confirm that they are special cases of the theorems proposed here.
  The conclusions support the application of FGGCM in domains such as control, prediction, and decision support systems.</description>

      <title>Generative Modeling and Data Augmentation for Power System Production Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a key component of power system production simulation, load forecasting is critical for the stable operation of power systems. Machine learning methods prevail in this field. However, the limited training data can be a challenge. This paper proposes a generative model-assisted approach for load forecasting under small sample scenarios, consisting of two steps: expanding the dataset using a diffusion-based generative model and then training various machine learning regressors on the augmented dataset to identify the best performer. The expanded dataset significantly reduces forecasting errors compared to the original dataset, and the diffusion model outperforms the generative adversarial model by achieving about 200 times smaller errors and better alignment in latent data distributions.</description>

      <title>Anti-bullying Adaptive Cruise Control: A proactive right-of-way protection approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems are vulnerable to "road bully" such as cut-ins. This paper proposed an Anti-bullying Adaptive Cruise Control (AACC) approach with proactive right-of-way protection ability. It bears the following features: i) with the enhanced capability of preventing bullying from cut-ins; ii) optimal but not unsafe; iii) adaptive to various driving styles of cut-in vehicles; iv) with real-time field implementation capability. The proposed approach can identify other road users' driving styles online and conduct game-based motion planning for right-of-way protection. A detailed investigation of the simulation results shows that the proposed approach can prevent bullying from cut-ins and be adaptive to different cut-in vehicles' driving styles. The proposed approach is capable of enhancing travel efficiency by up to 29.55% under different cut-in gaps and can strengthen driving safety compared with the current ACC controller. The proposed approach is flexible and robust against traffic congestion levels. It can improve mobility by up to 11.93% and robustness by 8.74% in traffic flow. Furthermore, the proposed approach can support real-time field implementation by ensuring less than 50 milliseconds computation time.</description>

      <title>The impact of AI on engineering design procedures for dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is driving transformative changes across numerous fields, revolutionizing conventional processes and creating new opportunities for innovation. The development of mechatronic systems is undergoing a similar transformation. Over the past decade, modeling, simulation, and optimization techniques have become integral to the design process, paving the way for the adoption of AI-based methods. In this paper, we examine the potential for integrating AI into the engineering design process, using the V-model from the VDI guideline 2206, considered the state-of-the-art in product design, as a foundation. We identify and classify AI methods based on their suitability for specific stages within the engineering product design workflow. Furthermore, we present a series of application examples where AI-assisted design has been successfully implemented by the authors. These examples, drawn from research projects within the DFG Priority Program \emph{SPP~2353: Daring More Intelligence - Design Assistants in Mechanics and Dynamics}, showcase a diverse range of applications across mechanics and mechatronics, including areas such as acoustics and robotics.</description>

      <title>Ultra-wideband Double-Directionally Resolved Channel Measurements of Line-of-Sight Microcellular Scenarios in the Upper Mid-band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for higher data rates and expanded bandwidth is driving the exploration of new frequency ranges, including the upper mid-band spectrum (6-24 GHz), which is a promising candidate for future Frequency Range 3 (FR3) applications. This paper presents ultra-wideband double-directional channel measurements in line-of-sight microcellular scenarios within the upper mid-band spectrum (6-18 GHz). Conducted in an urban street canyon environment, these measurements explore key channel characteristics such as power delay profiles, angular power spectra, path loss, delay spread, and angular spread to provide insights essential for robust communication system design. Our results reveal that path loss values for both omni-directional and best beam configurations are lower than free-space predictions due to multipath contributions from the environment. Analysis also indicates a high degree of stability in delay spread and angular spread across the entire band, with small variation between sub-bands.</description>

      <title>Circuit-Theoretic Joint Parameter-State Estimation of Utility-Scale Photovoltaic, Battery, and Grid Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar PV and battery storage systems have become integral to modern power grids. Therefore, bulk grid models in real-time operation must include their physical behavior accurately for analysis and optimization. AC state estimation is critical to building real-time bulk power systems models. However, current ACSE techniques do not include detailed physics and measurements for battery and PV systems. This results in sub-optimal estimation results and subsequent less accurate bulk grid models for real-time operation.
  To address these challenges, we formulate a circuit-theoretic AC state estimator with accurate PV and battery systems physics and corresponding measurements. First, we propose an aggregated equivalent circuit model of the solar PV, battery, and traditional grid components. Next, we add measurements from PV and battery systems to the traditional measurement set to facilitate accurate estimation of the overall grid model. Finally, we develop a circuit-theoretic joint parameter-state estimation algorithm that can accurately estimate grid, PV, and battery system states and is robust against erroneous parameters. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework, we estimate the states of 10k node transmission networks with hundreds of battery+PV-tied systems. We compare the accuracy against the estimation of stand-alone grid, battery, and PV systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control Operator Perspective and a Neural Adaptive Spectral Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal control problems (OCPs) involve finding a control function for a dynamical system such that a cost functional is optimized. It is central to physical systems in both academia and industry. In this paper, we propose a novel instance-solution control operator perspective, which solves OCPs in a one-shot manner without direct dependence on the explicit expression of dynamics or iterative optimization processes. The control operator is implemented by a new neural operator architecture named Neural Adaptive Spectral Method (NASM), a generalization of classical spectral methods. We theoretically validate the perspective and architecture by presenting the approximation error bounds of NASM for the control operator. Experiments on synthetic environments and a real-world dataset verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, including substantial speedup in running time, and high-quality in- and out-of-distribution generalization.</description>

      <title>Multi-UAV Collaborative Trajectory Planning for Seamless Data Collection and Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted plenty of attention due to their high flexibility and enhanced communication ability. However, the limited coverage and energy of UAVs make it difficult to provide timely wireless service for large-scale sensor networks, which also exist in multiple UAVs. To this end, the advanced collaboration mechanism of UAVs urgently needs to be designed. In this paper, we propose a multi-UAV collaborative scheme for seamless data collection and transmission, where UAVs are dispatched to collection points (CPs) to collect and transmit the time-critical data to the ground base station (BS) simultaneously through the cooperative backhaul link. Specifically, the mission completion time is minimized by optimizing the trajectories, task allocation, collection time scheduling, and transmission topology of UAVs while ensuring backhaul link to the BS. However, the formulated problem is non-convex and challenging to solve directly. To tackle this problem, the CP locations and transmission topology of UAVs are obtained by sensor node (SN) clustering and region division. Next, the transmission connectivity condition between UAVs is derived to facilitate the trajectory discretization and thus reduce the dimensions of variables. This simplifies the problem to optimizing the UAV hovering locations, hovering time, and CP serving sequence. Then, we propose a point-matching-based trajectory planning algorithm to solve the problem efficiently. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves significant performance gains over the two benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Controllability and Tracking of Ensembles: An Optimal Transport Theory Viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the controllability and state tracking of ensembles from the perspective of optimal transport theory. Ensembles, characterized as collections of systems evolving under the same dynamics but with varying initial conditions, are a fundamental concept in control theory and applications. By leveraging optimal transport, we provide a novel framework for analyzing and solving the state tracking problem of ensembles, particularly when state observations are limited and only accessible at discrete time points. This study establishes connections between the ensemble dynamics and finite-horizon optimal control problems, demonstrating that the problem can be reformulated as a computationally efficient linear program using Kantorovich's formulation of optimal transport. We raise notions of observability and controllability for nonlinear ensembles, and propose methods for state tracking in Gaussian output distributions settings. Numerical examples and theoretical insights are provided to validate the approach, highlighting the utility of optimal transport in ensemble control problems.</description>

      <title>A MARL Based Multi-Target Tracking Algorithm Under Jamming Against Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have played an increasingly important role in military operations and social life. Among all application scenarios, multi-target tracking tasks accomplished by UAV swarms have received extensive attention. However, when UAVs use radar to track targets, the tracking performance can be severely compromised by jammers. To track targets in the presence of jammers, UAVs can use passive radar to position the jammer. This paper proposes a system where a UAV swarm selects the radar's active or passive work mode to track multiple differently located and potentially jammer-carrying targets. After presenting the optimization problem and proving its solving difficulty, we use a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm to solve this control problem. We also propose a mechanism based on simulated annealing algorithm to avoid cases where UAV actions violate constraints. Simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexibility provision from active distribution grids requires efficient and robust methods of optimization and control suitable to online operation. In this paper we introduce conditions for the safe operation of feedback optimization based controllers. We use the feasible operating region of a controlled system as bounds for safe system states and evaluate the trajectories of the controller based on the projection of the full system state onto the two-dimensional PQ-plane. We demonstrate the defined conditions for an exemplary sub-transmission system. We show that the proposed method is suitable to evaluate controller performance and robustness for systems subject to disturbances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-term load prediction (STLP) is critical for modern power distribution system operations, particularly as demand and generation uncertainties grow with the integration of low-carbon technologies, such as electric vehicles and photovoltaics. In this study, we evaluate the zero-shot prediction capabilities of five Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs)-a new approach for STLP where models perform predictions without task-specific training-against two classical models, Gaussian Process (GP) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), which are trained on task-specific datasets. Our findings indicate that even without training, TSFMs like Chronos, TimesFM, and TimeGPT can surpass the performance of GP and SVR. This finding highlights the potential of TSFMs in STLP.</description>

      <title>Prediction-Based Control Barrier Functions for Input-Constrained Safety Critical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) have emerged as a popular topic in safety critical control due to their ability to provide formal safety guarantees for dynamical systems. Despite their powerful capabilities, the determination of feasible CBFs for input-constrained systems is still a formidable task and a challenging research issue. The present work aims to tackle this problem by focusing on an alternative approach towards a generalization of some ideas introduced in the existing CBF literature. The approach provides a rigorous yet straightforward method to define and implement prediction-based control barrier functions for complex dynamical systems to ensure safety with bounded inputs. This is accomplished by introducing a prediction-based term into the CBF that allows for the required margin needed to null the CBF rate of change given the specified input constraints. Having established the theoretical groundwork, certain remarks are subsequently presented with regards to the scheme's implementation. Finally, the proposed prediction-based control barrier function (PB-CBF) scheme is implemented for two numerical examples. In particular, the second example is related to aircraft stall prevention, which is meant to demonstrate the functionality and capability of the PB-CBFs in handling complex nonlinear dynamical systems via simulations. In both examples, the performance of the PB-CBF is compared with that of a non-prediction based basic CBF.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Economic Model Predictive Control: Performance Guarantees for Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing the economic performance of nonlinear constrained systems subject to uncertain time-varying parameters and bounded disturbances. In particular, we propose an adaptive economic model predictive control (MPC) framework that: (i) directly minimizes transient economic costs, (ii) addresses parametric uncertainty through online model adaptation, (iii) determines optimal setpoints online, and (iv) ensures robustness by using a tube-based approach. The proposed design ensures recursive feasibility, robust constraint satisfaction, and a transient performance bound. In case the disturbances have a finite energy and the parameter variations have a finite path length, the asymptotic average performance is (approximately) not worse than the performance obtained when operating at the best reachable steady-state. We highlight performance benefits in a numerical example involving a chemical reactor with unknown time-invariant and time-varying parameters.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Sinusoidal Input Describing Functions for Open-Loop and Closed-Loop Reset Control with Application to Mechatronics Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reset control enhances the performance of high-precision mechatronics systems. This paper introduces a generalized reset feedback control structure that integrates a single reset-state reset controller, a shaping filter for tuning reset actions, and linear compensators arranged in series and parallel configurations with the reset controller. This structure offers greater tuning flexibility to optimize reset control performance. However, frequency-domain analysis for such systems remains underdeveloped. To address this gap, this study makes three key contributions: (1) developing Higher-Order Sinusoidal Input Describing Functions (HOSIDFs) for open-loop reset control systems; (2) deriving HOSIDFs for closed-loop reset control systems and establishing a connection with open-loop analysis; and (3) creating a MATLAB-based App to implement these methods, providing mechatronics engineers with a practical tool for reset control system design and analysis. The accuracy of the proposed methods is validated through simulations and experiments. Finally, the utility of the proposed methods is demonstrated through case studies that analyze and compare the performance of three controllers: a PID controller, a reset controller, and a shaped reset controller on a precision motion stage. Both analytical and experimental results demonstrate that the shaped reset controller provides higher tracking precision while reducing actuation forces, outperforming both the reset and PID controllers. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed frequency-domain methods in analyzing and optimizing the performance of reset-controlled mechatronics systems.</description>

      <title>Koopman Mode-Based Detection of Internal Short Circuits in Lithium-ion Battery Pack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring of internal short circuit (ISC) in Lithium-ion battery packs is imperative to safe operations, optimal performance, and extension of pack life. Since ISC in one of the modules inside a battery pack can eventually lead to thermal runaway, it is crucial to detect its early onset. However, the inaccuracy and aging variability of battery models and the unavailability of adequate ISC datasets pose several challenges for both model-based and data-driven approaches. Thus, in this paper, we proposed a model-free Koopman Mode-based module-level ISC detection algorithm for battery packs. The algorithm adopts two parallel Koopman mode generation schemes with the Arnoldi algorithm to capture the Kullback-Leibler divergence-based distributional deviations in Koopman mode statistics in the presence of ISC. Our proposed algorithm utilizes module-level voltage measurements to accurately identify the shorted battery module of the pack without using specific battery models or pre-training with historical battery data. Furthermore, we presented two case studies on shorted battery module detection under both resting and charging conditions. The simulation results illustrated the sensitivity of the proposed algorithm toward ISC and the robustness against measurement noise.</description>

      <title>SprayCraft: Graph-Based Route Optimization for Variable Rate Precision Spraying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To efficiently manage plant diseases, Agriculture Cyber-Physical Systems (A-CPS) have been developed to detect and localize disease infestations by integrating the Internet of Agro-Things (IoAT). By the nature of plant and pathogen interactions, the spread of a disease appears as a focus with density of infected plants and intensity of infection diminishing outwards. This gradient of infection needs variable rate and precision pesticide spraying to efficiently utilize resources and effectively handle the diseases. This article, SprayCraft presents a graph based method for disease management A-CPS to identify disease hotspots and compute near optimal path for a spraying drone to perform variable rate precision spraying. It uses graph to represent the diseased locations and their spatial relation, Message Passing is performed over the graph to compute the probability of a location to be a disease hotspot. These probabilities also serve as disease intensity measures and are used for variable rate spraying at each location. Whereas, the graph is utilized to compute tour path by considering it as Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for precision spraying by the drone. Proposed method has been validated on synthetic data of locations of diseased locations in a farmland.</description>

      <title>Task-Parameter Nexus: Task-Specific Parameter Learning for Model-Based Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the Task-Parameter Nexus (TPN), a learning-based approach for online determination of the (near-)optimal control parameters of model-based controllers (MBCs) for tracking tasks. In TPN, a deep neural network is introduced to predict the control parameters for any given tracking task at runtime, especially when optimal parameters for new tasks are not immediately available. To train this network, we constructed a trajectory bank with various speeds and curvatures that represent different motion characteristics. Then, for each trajectory in the bank, we auto-tune the optimal control parameters offline and use them as the corresponding ground truth. With this dataset, the TPN is trained by supervised learning. We evaluated the TPN on the quadrotor platform. In simulation experiments, it is shown that the TPN can predict near-optimal control parameters for a spectrum of tracking tasks, demonstrating its robust generalization capabilities to unseen tasks.</description>

      <title>Singularity-Free Guiding Vector Field over B\'ezier's Curves Applied to Rovers Path Planning and Path Following</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a guidance algorithm for solving the problem of following parametric paths, as well as a curvature-varying speed setpoint for land-based car-type wheeled mobile robots (WMRs). The guidance algorithm relies on Singularity-Free Guiding Vector Fields SF-GVF. This novel GVF approach expands the desired robot path and the Guiding vector field to a higher dimensional space, in which an angular control function can be found to ensure global asymptotic convergence to the desired parametric path while avoiding field singularities. In SF-GVF, paths should follow a parametric definition. This feature makes using Bezier's curves attractive to define the robot's desired patch. The curvature-varying speed setpoint, combined with the guidance algorithm, eases the convergence to the path when physical restrictions exist, such as minimal turning radius or maximal lateral acceleration. We provide theoretical results, simulations, and outdoor experiments using a WMR platform assembled with off-the-shelf components.</description>

      <title>TIMESAFE: Timing Interruption Monitoring and Security Assessment for Fronthaul Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 5G and beyond cellular systems embrace the disaggregation of Radio Access Network (RAN) components, exemplified by the evolution of the fronthual (FH) connection between cellular baseband and radio unit equipment. Crucially, synchronization over the FH is pivotal for reliable 5G services. In recent years, there has been a push to move these links to an Ethernet-based packet network topology, leveraging existing standards and ongoing research for Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). However, TSN standards, such as Precision Time Protocol (PTP), focus on performance with little to no concern for security. This increases the exposure of the open FH to security risks. Attacks targeting synchronization mechanisms pose significant threats, potentially disrupting 5G networks and impairing connectivity.
  In this paper, we demonstrate the impact of successful spoofing and replay attacks against PTP synchronization. We show how a spoofing attack is able to cause a production-ready O-RAN and 5G-compliant private cellular base station to catastrophically fail within 2 seconds of the attack, necessitating manual intervention to restore full network operations. To counter this, we design a Machine Learning (ML)-based monitoring solution capable of detecting various malicious attacks with over 97.5% accuracy.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we survey the primary research on polyhedral computing methods for constrained linear control systems. Our focus is on the modeling power of convex optimization, featured to design set-based robust and optimal controllers. In detail, we review the state-of-the-art techniques for computing geometric structures such as robust control invariant polytopes. Moreover, we survey recent methods for constructing control Lyapunov functions with polyhedral epigraphs as well as the extensive literature on robust model predictive control. The article concludes with a discussion of both the complexity and potential of polyhedral computing methods that rely on large-scale convex optimization.</description>

      <title>Suboptimality analysis of receding horizon quadratic control with unknown linear systems and its applications in learning-based control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07876v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work analyzes how the trade-off between the modeling error, the terminal value function error, and the prediction horizon affects the performance of a nominal receding-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) controller. By developing a novel perturbation result of the Riccati difference equation, a novel performance upper bound is obtained and suggests that for many cases, the prediction horizon can be either one or infinity to improve the control performance, depending on the relative difference between the modeling error and the terminal value function error. The result also shows that when an infinite horizon is desired, a finite prediction horizon that is larger than the controllability index can be sufficient for achieving a near-optimal performance, revealing a close relation between the prediction horizon and controllability. The obtained suboptimality performance bound is applied to provide novel sample complexity and regret guarantees for nominal receding-horizon LQ controllers in a learning-based setting. We show that an adaptive prediction horizon that increases as a logarithmic function of time is beneficial for regret minimization.</description>

      <title>Notes on data-driven output-feedback control of linear MIMO systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works have approached the data-driven design of dynamic output-feedback controllers for discrete-time LTI systems by constructing non-minimal state vectors composed of past inputs and outputs. Depending on the system's complexity (order $n$, lag $\ell$ and number of outputs $p$), it was observed in several works that such an approach presents significant limitations. In particular, many works require to restrict the class of LTI systems to those satisfying the relation $p\ell=n$. In this note, we show how to address the general MIMO case (for which $p\ell\geq n$ in general) by constructing an alternative non-minimal state vector from data. Different from the existing literature, our method guarantees the satisfaction of certain rank conditions when the system is persistently excited, thereby facilitating the direct data-driven dynamic output-feedback control of MIMO systems by applying methods that were originally developed for the input-state data setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14738v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncrewed Vehicles (UVs) functioning as autonomous agents are anticipated to play a crucial role in the 6th Generation of wireless networks. Their seamless integration, cost-effectiveness, and the additional controllability through motion planning make them an attractive deployment option for a wide range of applications, both as assets in the network (e.g., mobile base stations) and as consumers of network services (e.g., autonomous delivery systems). However, despite their potential, the convergence of UVs and wireless systems brings forth numerous challenges that require attention from both academia and industry. This paper then aims to offer a comprehensive overview encompassing the transformative possibilities as well as the significant challenges associated with UV-assisted next-generation wireless communications. Considering the diverse landscape of possible application scenarios, problem formulations, and mathematical tools related to UV-assisted wireless systems, the underlying core theme of this paper is the unification of the problem space, providing a structured framework to understand the use cases, problem formulations, and necessary mathematical tools. Overall, the paper sets forth a clear understanding of how uncrewed vehicles can be integrated in the 6G ecosystem, paving the way towards harnessing the full potential at this intersection.</description>

Abstract: A novel State-Space Neural Network with Ordered variance (SSNNO) is presented in which the state variables are ordered in decreasing variance. A systematic way of model order reduction with SSNNO is proposed, which leads to a Reduced order SSNNO (R-SSNNO). Theoretical results for the existence of an SSNNO with arbitrary bounds on the output prediction error are presented. The application of SSNNO in control: Model Predictive Control (MPC) and state estimation: Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is discussed. The effectiveness of SSNNO in system identification and control is illustrated using simulations on a nonlinear continuous reactor process example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based algorithm to jointly train (1) a trajectory planner and (2) a tracking controller in a layered control architecture. Our algorithm arises naturally from a rewrite of the underlying optimal control problem that lends itself to an actor-critic learning approach. By explicitly learning a \textit{dual} network to coordinate the interaction between the planning and tracking layers, we demonstrate the ability to achieve an effective consensus between the two components, leading to an interpretable policy. We theoretically prove that our algorithm converges to the optimal dual network in the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) setting and empirically validate its applicability to nonlinear systems through simulation experiments on a unicycle model.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Vulnerability of Zero-Carbon Power Grids under Climate-Technological Changes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15079v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transition to decarbonized energy systems has become a priority globally to mitigate carbon emissions and, therefore, climate change. However, the vulnerabilities of zero-carbon power grids under climatic and technological changes have not been thoroughly examined. In this study, we focus on modeling the zero-carbon grid using a dataset that captures diverse future climatic-technological scenarios, with New York State as a case study. By accurately representing the topology and operational constraints of the power grid, we identify spatiotemporal heterogeneity in vulnerabilities arising from the interplay of renewable resource availability, high load, and severe transmission line congestion. Our findings reveal a need for 61-105\% more firm, zero-emission capacity to ensure system reliability. Merely increasing wind and solar capacity is ineffective in improving reliability due to transmission congestion and spatiotemporal variations in vulnerabilities. This underscores the importance of considering spatiotemporal dynamics and operational constraints when making decisions regarding additional investments in renewable resources.</description>

      <title>Lane-Keeping Control of Autonomous Vehicles Through a Soft-Constrained Iterative LQR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of smooth steering inputs is crucial for automotive applications because control actions with jitter might cause the vehicle system to become unstable. To address this problem in automobile lane-keeping control without the use of additional smoothing algorithms, we developed a novel soft-constrained iterative linear quadratic regulator (soft-CILQR) algorithm by integrating CILQR algorithm and a model predictive control (MPC) constraint relaxation method. We incorporated slack variables into the state and control barrier functions of the soft-CILQR solver to soften the constraints in the optimization process such that control input stabilization can be achieved in a computationally simple manner. Two types of automotive lane-keeping experiments (numerical simulations and experiments involving challenging vision-based maneuvers) were conducted with a linear system dynamics model to test the performance of the proposed soft-CILQR algorithm, and its performance was compared with that of the CILQR algorithm. In the numerical simulations, the soft-CILQR and CILQR solvers managed to drive the system toward the reference state asymptotically; however, the soft-CILQR solver obtained smooth steering input trajectories more easily than did the CILQR solver under conditions involving additive disturbances. The results of the vision-based experiments in which an ego vehicle drove in perturbed TORCS environments with various road friction settings were consistent with those of the numerical tests. The proposed soft-CILQR algorithm achieved an average runtime of 2.55 ms and is thus applicable for real-time autonomous driving scenarios.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Control of Discrete-Time Stochastic Systems: Integrating Kalman Filter and Worst-case CVaR in Control Barrier Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15638v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes control approaches for discrete-time linear systems subject to stochastic disturbances. It employs Kalman filter to estimate the mean and covariance of the state propagation, and the worst-case conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) to quantify the tail risk using the estimated mean and covariance. The quantified risk is then integrated into a control barrier function (CBF) to derive constraints for controller synthesis, addressing tail risks near safe set boundaries. Two optimization-based control methods are presented using the obtained constraints for half-space and ellipsoidal safe sets, respectively. The effectiveness of the obtained results is demonstrated using numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>InfraLib: Enabling Reinforcement Learning and Decision-Making for Large-Scale Infrastructure Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient management of infrastructure systems is crucial for economic stability, sustainability, and public safety. However, infrastructure sustainment is challenging due to the vast scale of systems, stochastic deterioration of components, partial observability, and resource constraints. Decision-making strategies that rely solely on human judgment often result in suboptimal decisions over large scales and long horizons. While data-driven approaches like reinforcement learning offer promising solutions, their application has been limited by the lack of suitable simulation environments. We present InfraLib, an open-source modular and extensible framework that enables modeling and analyzing infrastructure management problems with resource constraints as sequential decision-making problems. The framework implements hierarchical, stochastic deterioration models, supports realistic partial observability, and handles practical constraints including cyclical budgets and component unavailability. InfraLib provides standardized environments for benchmarking decision-making approaches, along with tools for expert data collection and policy evaluation. Through case studies on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world road networks, we demonstrate InfraLib's ability to model diverse infrastructure management scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency at scale.</description>

Abstract: A major challenge in autonomous flights is unknown disturbances, which can jeopardize safety and lead to collisions, especially in obstacle-rich environments. This paper presents a disturbance-aware motion planning and control framework designed for autonomous aerial flights. The framework is composed of two key components: a disturbance-aware motion planner and a tracking controller. The disturbance-aware motion planner consists of a predictive control scheme and a learned model of disturbances that is adapted online. The tracking controller is designed using contraction control methods to provide safety bounds on the quadrotor behaviour in the vicinity of the obstacles with respect to the disturbance-aware motion plan. Finally, the algorithm is tested in simulation scenarios with a quadrotor facing strong crosswind and ground-induced disturbances.</description>
