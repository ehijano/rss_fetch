      <title>Compact Neural Network Algorithm for Electrocardiogram Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a high-performance, compact electrocardiogram (ECG)-based system for automatic classification of arrhythmias, integrating machine learning approaches to achieve robust cardiac diagnostics. Our method combines a compact artificial neural network with feature enhancement techniques, including mathematical transformations, signal analysis and data extraction algorithms, to capture both morphological and time-frequency features from ECG signals. A novel aspect of this work is the addition of 17 newly engineered features, which complement the algorithm's capability to extract significant data and physiological patterns from the ECG signal. This combination enables the classifier to detect multiple arrhythmia types, such as atrial fibrillation, sinus tachycardia, ventricular flutter, and other common arrhythmic disorders. The system achieves an accuracy of 97.36% on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, using a lower complexity compared to state-of-the-art models. This compact tool shows potential for clinical deployment, as well as adaptation for portable devices in long-term cardiac health monitoring applications.</description>

      <title>Gaussian entropic optimal transport: Schr\"odinger bridges and the Sinkhorn algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entropic optimal transport problems are regularized versions of optimal transport problems. These models play an increasingly important role in machine learning and generative modelling. For finite spaces, these problems are commonly solved using Sinkhorn algorithm (a.k.a. iterative proportional fitting procedure). However, in more general settings the Sinkhorn iterations are based on nonlinear conditional/conjugate transformations and exact finite-dimensional solutions cannot be computed. This article presents a finite-dimensional recursive formulation of the iterative proportional fitting procedure for general Gaussian multivariate models. As expected, this recursive formulation is closely related to the celebrated Kalman filter and related Riccati matrix difference equations, and it yields algorithms that can be implemented in practical settings without further approximations. We extend this filtering methodology to develop a refined and self-contained convergence analysis of Gaussian Sinkhorn algorithms, including closed form expressions of entropic transport maps and Schr\"odinger bridges.</description>

      <title>Computationally efficient variational-like approximations of possibilistic inferential models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inferential models (IMs) offer provably reliable, data-driven, possibilistic statistical inference. But despite IMs' theoretical and foundational advantages, efficient computation is often a challenge. This paper presents a simple and powerful numerical strategy for approximating the IM's possibility contour, or at least its $\alpha$-cut for a specified $\alpha \in (0,1)$. Our proposal starts with the specification a parametric family that, in a certain sense, approximately covers the credal set associated with the IM's possibility measure. Then the parameters of that parametric family are tuned in such a way that the family's $100(1-\alpha)\%$ credible set roughly matches the IM contour's $\alpha$-cut. This is reminiscent of the variational approximations now widely used in Bayesian statistics, hence the name variational-like IM approximation.</description>

      <title>Smoothing Variances Across Time: Adaptive Stochastic Volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11315v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel Bayesian framework for estimating time-varying volatility by extending the Random Walk Stochastic Volatility (RWSV) model with a new Dynamic Shrinkage Process (DSP) in (log) variances. Unlike classical Stochastic Volatility or GARCH-type models with restrictive parametric stationarity assumptions, our proposed Adaptive Stochastic Volatility (ASV) model provides smooth yet dynamically adaptive estimates of evolving volatility and its uncertainty (vol of vol). We derive the theoretical properties of the proposed global-local shrinkage prior. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that ASV exhibits remarkable misspecification resilience with low prediction error across various data generating scenarios in simulation. Furthermore, ASV's capacity to yield locally smooth and interpretable estimates facilitates a clearer understanding of underlying patterns and trends in volatility. Additionally, we propose and illustrate an extension for Bayesian Trend Filtering simultaneously in both mean and variance. Finally, we show that this attribute makes ASV a robust tool applicable across a wide range of disciplines, including in finance, environmental science, epidemiology, and medicine, among others.</description>
