      <title>One-step data-driven generative model via Schr\"odinger Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating samples from a probability distribution is a fundamental task in machine learning and statistics. This article proposes a novel scheme for sampling from a distribution for which the probability density $\mu({\bf x})$ for ${\bf x}\in{\mathbb{R}}^d$ is unknown, but finite independent samples are given. We focus on constructing a Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) diffusion process on finite horizon $t\in[0,1]$ which induces a probability evolution starting from a fixed point at $t=0$ and ending with the desired target distribution $\mu({\bf x})$ at $t=1$. The diffusion process is characterized by a stochastic differential equation whose drift function can be solely estimated from data samples through a simple one-step procedure. Compared to the classical iterative schemes developed for the SB problem, the methodology of this article is quite simple, efficient, and computationally inexpensive as it does not require the training of neural network and thus circumvents many of the challenges in building the network architecture. The performance of our new generative model is evaluated through a series of numerical experiments on multi-modal low-dimensional simulated data and high-dimensional benchmark image data. Experimental results indicate that the synthetic samples generated from our SB Bridge based algorithm are comparable with the samples generated from the state-of-the-art methods in the field. Our formulation opens up new opportunities for developing efficient diffusion models that can be directly applied to large scale real-world data.</description>

      <title>EKM: An exact, polynomial-time algorithm for the $K$-medoids problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $K$-medoids problem is a challenging combinatorial clustering task, widely used in data analysis applications. While numerous algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem, none of these are able to obtain an exact (globally optimal) solution for the problem in polynomial time. In this paper, we present EKM: a novel algorithm for solving this problem exactly with worst-case $O\left(N^{K+1}\right)$ time complexity. EKM is developed according to recent advances in transformational programming and combinatorial generation, using formal program derivation steps. The derived algorithm is provably correct by construction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by comparing it against various approximate methods on numerous real-world datasets. We show that the wall-clock run time of our algorithm matches the worst-case time complexity analysis on synthetic datasets, clearly outperforming the exponential time complexity of benchmark branch-and-bound based MIP solvers. To our knowledge, this is the first, rigorously-proven polynomial time, practical algorithm for this ubiquitous problem.</description>

      <title>A canonical polyadic tensor basis for fast Bayesian estimation of multi-subject fMRI activation patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Task-evoked functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, such as the Human Connectome Project (HCP), are a powerful tool for exploring how brain activity is influenced by cognitive tasks like memory retention, decision-making, and language processing. A fast Bayesian function-on-scalar model is proposed for estimating population-level activation maps linked to the working memory task. The model is based on the canonical polyadic (CP) tensor decomposition of coefficient maps obtained for each subject. This decomposition effectively yields a tensor basis capable of extracting both common features and subject-specific features from the coefficient maps. These subject-specific features, in turn, are modeled as a function of covariates of interest using a Bayesian model that accounts for the correlation of the CP-extracted features. The dimensionality reduction achieved with the tensor basis allows for a fast MCMC estimation of population-level activation maps. This model is applied to one hundred unrelated subjects from the HCP dataset, yielding significant insights into brain signatures associated with working memory.</description>

      <title>Particle swarm optimization with Applications to Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Penalized Negative Binomial Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General purpose optimization routines such as nlminb, optim (R) or nlmixed (SAS) are frequently used to estimate model parameters in nonstandard distributions. This paper presents Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), as an alternative to many of the current algorithms used in statistics. We find that PSO can not only reproduce the same results as the above routines, it can also produce results that are more optimal or when others cannot converge. In the latter case, it can also identify the source of the problem or problems. We highlight advantages of using PSO using four examples, where: (1) some parameters in a generalized distribution are unidentified using PSO when it is not apparent or computationally manifested using routines in R or SAS; (2) PSO can produce estimation results for the log-binomial regressions when current routines may not; (3) PSO provides flexibility in the link function for binomial regression with LASSO penalty, which is unsupported by standard packages like GLM and GENMOD in Stata and SAS, respectively, and (4) PSO provides superior MLE estimates for an EE-IW distribution compared with those from the traditional statistical methods that rely on moments.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification by block bootstrap for differentially private stochastic gradient descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a widely used tool in machine learning. In the context of Differential Privacy (DP), SGD has been well studied in the last years in which the focus is mainly on convergence rates and privacy guarantees. While in the non private case, uncertainty quantification (UQ) for SGD by bootstrap has been addressed by several authors, these procedures cannot be transferred to differential privacy due to multiple queries to the private data. In this paper, we propose a novel block bootstrap for SGD under local differential privacy that is computationally tractable and does not require an adjustment of the privacy budget. The method can be easily implemented and is applicable to a broad class of estimation problems. We prove the validity of our approach and illustrate its finite sample properties by means of a simulation study. As a by-product, the new method also provides a simple alternative numerical tool for UQ for non-private SGD.</description>

      <title>Quantum Non-Identical Mean Estimation: Efficient Algorithms and Fundamental Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate quantum algorithms and lower bounds for mean estimation given query access to non-identically distributed samples. On the one hand, we give quantum mean estimators with quadratic quantum speed-up given samples from different bounded or sub-Gaussian random variables. On the other hand, we prove that, in general, it is impossible for any quantum algorithm to achieve quadratic speed-up over the number of classical samples needed to estimate the mean $\mu$, where the samples come from different random variables with mean close to $\mu$. Technically, our quantum algorithms reduce bounded and sub-Gaussian random variables to the Bernoulli case, and use an uncomputation trick to overcome the challenge that direct amplitude estimation does not work with non-identical query access. Our quantum query lower bounds are established by simulating non-identical oracles by parallel oracles, and also by an adversarial method with non-identical oracles. Both results pave the way for proving quantum query lower bounds with non-identical oracles in general, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Geostatistics Using Predictive Stacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop Bayesian predictive stacking for geostatistical models, where the primary inferential objective is to provide inference on the latent spatial random field and conduct spatial predictions at arbitrary locations. We exploit analytically tractable posterior distributions for regression coefficients of predictors and the realizations of the spatial process conditional upon process parameters. We subsequently combine such inference by stacking these models across the range of values of the hyper-parameters. We devise stacking of means and posterior densities in a manner that is computationally efficient without resorting to iterative algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and can exploit the benefits of parallel computations. We offer novel theoretical insights into the resulting inference within an infill asymptotic paradigm and through empirical results showing that stacked inference is comparable to full sampling-based Bayesian inference at a significantly lower computational cost.</description>
