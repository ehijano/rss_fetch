      <title>Strong Feller Regularisation of 1-d Nonlinear Transport by Reflected Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider equations of nonlinear transport on the circle with regular self interactions appearing in aggregation models and deterministic mean field dynamics. We introduce a random perturbation of such systems through a stochastic orientation preserving flow, which is given as an integrated infinite dimensional periodic Ornstein- Uhlenbeck process with reflection. As our main result we show that the induced stochastic dynamics yields a measure valued Markov process on a class of regular measures. Moreover, we show that this process is strong Feller in the corresponding topology. This is interpreted as a qualitative regularisation by noise phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Singular values of sparse random rectangular matrices: Emergence of outliers at criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the random bipartite Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph $\mathbb{G}(n, m, p)$, where each edge with one vertex in $V_{1}=[n]$ and the other vertex in $V_{2} =[m]$ is connected with probability $p$, and $n=\lfloor \gamma m\rfloor$ for a constant aspect ratio $\gamma \geq 1$. It is well known that the empirical spectral measure of its centered and normalized adjacency matrix converges to the Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur (MP) distribution. However, largest and smallest singular values may not converge to the right and left edges, respectively, especially when $p = o(1)$. Notably, it was proved by Dumitriu and Zhu (2024) that there are almost surely no singular value outside the compact support of the MP law when $np = \omega(\log(n))$. In this paper, we consider the critical sparsity regime where $p = b\log(n)/\sqrt{mn}$ for some constant $b&gt;0$. We quantitatively characterize the emergence of outlier singular values as follows. For explicit $b_{*}$ and $b^{*}$ functions of $\gamma$, we prove that when $b &gt; b_{*}$, there is no outlier outside the bulk; when $b^{*}&lt; b &lt; b_{*}$, outliers are present only outside the right edge of the MP law; and when $b &lt; b^{*}$, outliers are present on both sides, all with high probability. Moreover, locations of those outliers are precisely characterized by a function depending on the largest and smallest degree vertices of the random graph. We estimate the number of outliers as well. Our results follow the path forged by Alt, Ducatez and Knowles (2021), and can be extended to sparse random rectangular matrices with bounded entries.</description>

      <title>Bulk asymptotics of the Gaussian $\beta$-ensemble characteristic polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gaussian $\beta$-ensemble (G$\beta$E) is a fundamental model in random matrix theory. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive asymptotic description of the characteristic polynomial of the G$\beta$E anywhere in the bulk of the spectrum that simultaneously captures both local-scale fluctuations (governed by the Sine-$\beta$ point process) and global/mesoscopic log-correlated Gaussian structure, which is accurate down to vanishing errors as $N\to\infty$.
  As immediate corollaries, we obtain several important results: (1) convergence of characteristic polynomial ratios to the stochastic zeta function, extending known results from Valko and Virag to the G$\beta$E; (2) a martingale approximation of the log-characteristic polynomial which immediately recovers the central limit theorem from Bourgade, Mody and Pain; (3) a description of the order one correction to the martingale in terms of the stochastic Airy function.</description>

      <title>Exponential mixing for the stochastic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation on the 1D torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the large-time behaviors of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation (KSE) on the 1D torus while being subjected to random perturbation via additive Gaussian noise. It is well-known that under suitable assumptions on the stochastic forcing, the KSE admits a unique invariant probability measure. In this work, we make further progress on the topic of ergodicity by addressing the issue of convergence rate toward equilibrium. In comparison with the previous results, we can prove that the unique invariant probability measure is exponentially attractive and smallness condition of anti-diffusion coefficient is not necessary here. The proof relies on a coupling argument while making use of Lyapunov functions motivated by those of deterministic equations.</description>

      <title>Density convergence of spatial average of solution to a one dimensional stochastic wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the spatial averages of the solution of a one-dimensional stochastic wave equation driven by a Gaussian multiplicative noise, which is white in time and has a homogeneous spatial covariance described by the Riesz kernel. We establish the rate of convergence for the uniform distance between the density of spatial averages and the standard normal density. The proof combines Malliavin calculus with Stein's method for normal approximations. The key technical challenges lie in estimating the Lp-norm of the second Malliavin derivative and the existence of negative moments of Malliavin covariance matrix.</description>

      <title>Time multidimensional Markov Renewal chains -- An algebraic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, a new extension of the Markov Renewal theory is introduced by allowing time to evolve in multiple dimensions. The resulting chains are referred to as multi-time Markov Renewal chains and since this extension is new, the state space is assumed to be finite to cover the theoretical framework of applications, where the possible number of states of a physical system is finite. The flexibility of Markov renewal theory is still present in multiple time dimensions by allowing the sojourn times in the different states of the system to be arbitrarily selected from a multidimensional distribution. The convolution product of multidimensional matrix sequences plays a particular role in the development of the theory and some of its algebraic properties are given and explored, paying particular attention to the existence, the representation and the computation of the convolutional inverse. Some basic definitions and properties of this new class are given as well as the multi-time Markov renewal equations associated to the resulting processes. The practical implementation is achieved very efficiently through a novel adaptation of the Gauss-Jordan algorithm for multidimensional matrix sequences.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish conditions on a H\"older continuous kernel $K\in\bC^\beta$ under which strong well-posedness holds for McKean-Vlasov SDEs driven by an $\alpha$-stable process. In certain cases, these conditions coincide with the classical criterion $\beta&gt;1-\alpha$ known for weak well-posedness.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds for the connective constant of weighted self-avoiding walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on an earlier work by Alm, we consider a model of weighted self-avoiding walks on a generic lattice and develop a systematic method for deriving upper bounds on the corresponding weighted connective constant. These bounds are obtained as the dominant eigenvalues of certain matrices and provide detailed information about the domain of convergence of the model's multivariate generating function. We discuss potential applications of this framework to developing Peierls-type estimates for contour models in statistical physics with anisotropic weights, generalizing a technique recently introduced by Fahrbach--Randall.</description>

      <title>McKean-Vlasov SPDEs driven by Poisson random measure: Well-posedness and large deviation principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the McKean-Vlasov stochastic partial differential equations driven by Poisson random measure. By adapting the variational framework, we prove the well-posedness and large deviation principle for a class of McKean-Vlasov stochastic partial differential equations with monotone coefficients. The main results can be applied to quasi-linear McKean-Vlasov equations such as distribution dependent stochastic porous media equation and stochastic p-Laplace equation. Our proof is based on the weak convergence approach introduced by Budhiraja et al. for Poisson random measures, the time discretization procedure and relative entropy estimates. In particular, we succeed in dropping the compactness assumption of embedding in the Gelfand triple in order to deal with the case of bounded and unbounded domains in applications.</description>

      <title>The Arnoldi Aggregation for Approximate Transient Distributions of Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper proposes a new aggregation method, based on the Arnoldi iteration, for computing approximate transient distributions of Markov chains. This aggregation is not partition-based, which means that an aggregate state may represent any portion of any original state, leading to a reduced system which is not a Markov chain. Results on exactness (in case the algorithm finds an invariant Krylov subspace) and minimality of the size of the Arnoldi aggregation are proven. For practical use, a heuristic is proposed for deciding when to stop expanding the state space once a certain accuracy has been reached. Apart from the theory, the paper also includes an extensive empirical section where the new aggregation algorithm is tested on several models and compared to a lumping-based state space reduction scheme.</description>

      <title>Model reduction for fully nonlinear stochastic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel model order reduction framework tailored for fully nonlinear stochastic dynamics without lifting them to quadratic systems and without using linearization techniques. By directly leveraging structural properties of the nonlinearities -- such as local and one-sided Lipschitz continuity or one-sided linear growth conditions -- the approach defines generalized reachability and observability Gramians through Lyapunov-type differential operators. These Gramians enable projection-based reduction while preserving essential dynamics and stochastic characteristics. The paper provides sufficient conditions for the existence of these Gramians, including a Lyapunov-based mean square stability criterion, and derives explicit output error bounds for the reduced order models. Furthermore, the work introduces a balancing and truncation procedure for obtaining reduced systems and demonstrates how dominant subspaces can be identified from the spectrum of the Gramians. The theoretical findings are grounded in rigorous stochastic analysis, extending balanced truncation techniques to a broad class of nonlinear systems under stochastic excitation.</description>

      <title>On the surjectivity of the conditional expectation given a real random variable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distributions of random couples $(X,Y)$ with $X$ real-valued such that any non-negative integrable random variable $f(X)$ can be represented as a conditional expectation, $f(X)=\mathbb{E}[g(Y)|X]$, for some non-negative measurable function $g$. It turns out that this representation property is related to the smallness of the support of the conditional law of $X$ given $Y$, and in particular fails when this conditional law almost surely has a non-zero absolutely continuous component with respect to the Lebesgue measure. We give a sufficient condition for the representation property and check that it is also necessary under some additional assumptions (for instance when $X$ or $Y$ are discrete). We also exhibit a rather involved example where the representation property holds but the sufficient condition does not. Finally, we discuss a weakened representation property where the non-negativity of $g$ is relaxed. This study is motivated by the calibration of time-discretized path-dependent volatility models to the implied volatility surface.</description>

      <title>Strong disorder for Stochastic Heat Flow and 2D Directed Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The critical 2D Stochastic Heat Flow (SHF) is a universal process of random measures, arising as the scaling limit of two-dimensional directed polymer partition functions (or solutions to the stochastic heat equation with mollified noise) under a critical renormalisation of disorder strength. We investigate the SHF in the strong disorder (or super-critical) regime, proving that it vanishes locally with an optimal doubly-exponential decay rate in the disorder intensity. We also establish a strengthened version of this result for 2D directed polymers, from which we deduce sharp bounds on the free energy. Our proof is based on estimates for truncated and fractional moments, exploiting refined change of measure and coarse-graining techniques.</description>

      <title>Optimality of empirical measures as quantizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common way to discretize a probability measure is to use an empirical measure as a discrete approximation. But how far from being optimal is this approximation in the p-Wasserstein distance? In this paper, we study this question in two contexts: (1) optimality among all uniform quantizers and (2) optimality among all (non-uniform) quantizers. In the first context, for p=1, we provide a complete answer to this question up to a polylog(n) factor. From the probabilistic point of view, this resolves, up to a polylog(n) factor, the problem of characterizing the expected 1-Wasserstein distance between a probability measure and its empirical measure in terms of non-random quantities. We also obtain some partial results for p&gt;1 in the first context and for p&gt;=1 in the second context.</description>

      <title>Multi-Community Spectral Clustering for Geometric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the soft geometric block model (SGBM) with a fixed number $k \geq 2$ of homogeneous communities in the dense regime, and we introduce a spectral clustering algorithm for community recovery on graphs generated by this model. Given such a graph, the algorithm produces an embedding into $\mathbb{R}^{k-1}$ using the eigenvectors associated with the $k-1$ eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the graph that are closest to a value determined by the parameters of the model. It then applies $k$-means clustering to the embedding. We prove weak consistency and show that a simple local refinement step ensures strong consistency. A key ingredient is an application of a non-standard version of Davis-Kahan theorem to control eigenspace perturbations when eigenvalues are not simple. We also analyze the limiting spectrum of the adjacency matrix, using a combination of combinatorial and matrix techniques.</description>

      <title>Inequalities for Optimization of Classification Algorithms: A Perspective Motivated by Diagnostic Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by canonical problems in medical diagnostics, we propose and study properties of an objective function that uniformly bounds uncertainties in quantities of interest extracted from classifiers and related data analysis tools. We begin by adopting a set-theoretic perspective to show how two main tasks in diagnostics -- classification and prevalence estimation -- can be recast in terms of a variation on the confusion (or error) matrix ${\boldsymbol {\rm P}}$ typically considered in supervised learning. We then combine arguments from conditional probability with the Gershgorin circle theorem to demonstrate that the largest Gershgorin radius $\boldsymbol \rho_m$ of the matrix $\mathbb I-\boldsymbol {\rm P}$ (where $\mathbb I$ is the identity) yields uniform error bounds for both classification and prevalence estimation. In a two-class setting, $\boldsymbol \rho_m$ is minimized via a measure-theoretic ``water-leveling'' argument that optimizes an appropriately defined partition $U$ generating the matrix ${\boldsymbol {\rm P}}$. We also consider an example that illustrates the difficulty of generalizing the binary solution to a multi-class setting and deduce relevant properties of the confusion matrix.</description>

      <title>M-estimation for Gaussian processes with time-inhomogeneous drifts from high-frequency data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a contrast-based estimation method for Gaussian processes with time-inhomogeneous drifts, observed under high-frequency sampling. The process is modeled as the sum of a deterministic drift function and a stationary Gaussian component with a parametric kernel. Our method constructs a local contrast function from adjacent increments, which avoids inversion of large covariance matrices and allows for efficient computation. We prove consistency and asymptotic normality of the resulting estimators under general ergodicity conditions. A distinctive feature of our approach is that the drift estimator attains a nonstandard convergence rate, stemming from the direct Riemann integrability of the drift density. This highlights a fundamental difference from standard estimation regimes. Furthermore, when the local contrast fails to identify all parameters in the covariance kernel, moment-based corrections can be incorporated to recover identifiability. The proposed framework is simple, flexible, and particularly well suited for high-frequency inference with time-inhomogeneous structure.</description>

      <title>Quenched large deviations for Monte Carlo integration with Coulomb gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gibbs measures, such as Coulomb gases, are popular in modelling systems of interacting particles. Recently, we proposed to use Gibbs measures as randomized numerical integration algorithms with respect to a target measure $\pi$ on $\mathbb R^d$, following the heuristics that repulsiveness between particles should help reduce integration errors. A major issue in this approach is to tune the interaction kernel and confining potential of the Gibbs measure, so that the equilibrium measure of the system is the target distribution $\pi$. Doing so usually requires another Monte Carlo approximation of the \emph{potential}, i.e. the integral of the interaction kernel with respect to $\pi$. Using the methodology of large deviations from Garcia--Zelada (2019), we show that a random approximation of the potential preserves the fast large deviation principle that guarantees the proposed integration algorithm to outperform independent or Markov quadratures. For non-singular interaction kernels, we make minimal assumptions on this random approximation, which can be the result of a computationally cheap Monte Carlo preprocessing. For the Coulomb interaction kernel, we need the approximation to be based on another Gibbs measure, and we prove in passing a control on the uniform convergence of the approximation of the potential.</description>

      <title>Central Limit Theorems for Transition Probabilities of Controlled Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a central limit theorem (CLT) for the non-parametric estimator of the transition matrices in controlled Markov chains (CMCs) with finite state-action spaces. Our results establish precise conditions on the logging policy under which the estimator is asymptotically normal, and reveal settings in which no CLT can exist. We then build upon it to derive CLTs for the value, Q-, and advantage functions of any stationary stochastic policy, including the optimal policy recovered from the estimated model. Goodness-of-fit tests are derived as a corollary, which enable us to test whether the logged data is stochastic. These results provide new statistical tools for offline policy evaluation and optimal policy recovery, and enable hypothesis tests for transition probabilities.</description>

      <title>Geometric post-Lie deformations of post-Lie algebras and regularity structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to derive a class of geometric-type deformations of post-Lie algebras, we first extend the geometrical notions of torsion and curvature for a general bilinear operation on a Lie algebra, then we derive compatibility conditions which will ensure that the post-Lie structure remains preserved. This type of deformation applies in particular to the post-Lie algebra introduced in arXiv:2306.02484v3 in the context of regularity structures theory. We use this deformation to derive a pre-Lie structure for the regularity structures approach given in arXiv:2103.04187v4, which is isomorphic to the post-Lie algebra studied in arXiv:2306.02484v3 at the level of their associated Hopf algebras. In the case of sections of smooth vector bundles of a finite-dimensional manifold, this deformed structure contains also, as a subalgebra, the post-Lie algebra structure introduced in arXiv:1203.4738v3 in the geometrical context of moving frames.</description>

      <title>An analytical framework for the Levine hats problem: new strategies, bounds and generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Levine hat problem, a classic combinatorial puzzle introduced by Lionel Levine in 2010. This problem involves a game in which $n \geq 2$ players, each seeing an infinite stack of hats on each of their teammates' heads but not on their own, must simultaneously guess the index of a black hat on their own stack. If one of the players fails to do so, the team loses collectively. The players must therefore come up with a good strategy before the game starts. While the optimal winning probability $V_{n}$ remains unknown even for $n=2$, we make three key advances. First, we develop a novel geometric framework for representing strategies through measurable functions, providing a new expression of $V_{n}$ and a unified treatment of the game for finite and for infinite stacks via integral formulations. Secondly, we construct a new strategy $K_{5}$ that reaches the conjectured optimal probability of victory : $0.35$. We also show that $K_{5}$ is part of a larger class of strategies that allow us to improve current bounds and resolve conjectured inequalities. Finally, we introduce and entirely solve a continuous generalization of the problem, demonstrating that extending to uncountable hat stacks increases the optimal winning probability to exactly $1/2$. This generalization naturally leads to a broader and smoother strategic framework, within which we also describe how to compute optimal responses to a range of strategies.</description>

      <title>Distributed games with jumps: An $\alpha$-potential game approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by game-theoretic models of crowd motion dynamics, this paper analyzes a broad class of distributed games with jump diffusions within the recently developed $\alpha$-potential game framework. We demonstrate that analyzing the $\alpha$-Nash equilibria reduces to solving a finite-dimensional control problem. Beyond the viscosity and verification characterizations for the general games, we explicitly and in detail examine how spatial population distributions and interaction rules influence the structure of $\alpha$-Nash equilibria in these distributed settings, and in particular for crowd motion games.
  Our theoretical results are supported by numerical implementations using policy gradient-based algorithms, further demonstrating the computational advantages of the $\alpha$-potential game framework in computing Nash equilibria for general dynamic games.</description>

      <title>Abstract Formulation of Mean-Field Models and Propagation of Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we formulate an abstract framework to study mean-field systems. In contrast to most approaches in the available literature which primarily rely on the analysis of SDEs, ours is based on optimal transport and semigroup theory. This allows for the inclusion of a wider range of mean-field particle systems within a unified structure. This new approach involves: (1) constructing an abstract framework using semigroups and generators; (2) formulating a corresponding mean-field evolution problem, and proving its well-posedness; (3) demonstrating the propagation of chaos for a class of N-particle systems associated with the mean-field model. Our results are readily applicable to various mean-field models. To demonstrate this, we apply our findings to obtain a new result for Levy-type mean-field systems, which encompass the McKean-Vlasov diffusion.</description>

Abstract: Given a function $f$ defined on a nonempty and convex subset of the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, we prove that if $f$ is bounded from below and it satisfies a convexity-type functional inequality with infinite convex combinations, then $f$ has to be convex. We also give alternative proofs of a generalization of some known results on convexity with infinite convex combinations due to Dar\'oczy and P\'ales (1987) and Pavi\'c (2019) using a probabilistic version of Jensen inequality.</description>

      <title>A notion of partial order in the Choose the Leader model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we continue the study of non-chaotic asymptotic correlations in many element systems and discuss the emergence of a new notion of asymptotic correlation -- partial order -- in the Choose the Leader (CL) system. Similarly to the newly defined notion of order, partial order refers to alignment of the elements in the system -- though it allows for deviation from total adherence. Our presented work revolves around the definition of partial order and shows its emergence in the CL model in its original critical scaling. Furthermore, we discuss the propagation of partial order in the CL model and give a quantitative estimate to the convergence to this state. This new notion (as well as that of order) opens the door to exploring old and new (probabilistic) models of biological and societal nature in a more realistic way.</description>

Abstract: We consider a random walk in a random environment on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ under ballisticity condition $(T)$. We show the existence of the invariant measure $Q$ with respect to the environment viewed from the particle for $d=2$ and $d=3$, which disproves a conjecture made in arXiv:1405.6819 regarding the two-dimensional case. We also prove tail estimates for the Radon-Nikodym derivative $dQ/dP$, where $P$ is the original distribution on the environment. Lastly, we provide nearly sharp tail bounds for regeneration times for $d=3$.</description>

      <title>Smoothness of solutions of hyperbolic stochastic partial differential equations with $L^{\infty}$-vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we are interested in a quasi-linear hyperbolic stochastic differential equation (HSPDE) when the vector field is merely bounded and measurable. Although the deterministic counterpart of such equation may be ill-posed (in the sense that uniqueness or even existence might not be valid), we show for the first time that the corresponding HSPDE has a unique (Malliavin differentiable) strong solution. Our approach for proving this result rests on: 1) tools from Malliavin calculus and 2) variational techniques introduced in [Davie, Int. Math. Res. Not., Vol. 2007] non trivially extended to the case of SDEs in the plane by using an algorithm for the selection of certain rectangles. As a by product, we also obtain the Sobolev differentiability of the solution with respect to its initial value. The results derived here constitute a significant improvement of those in the current literature on SDEs on the plane and can be regarded as an analogous equivalent of the pioneering works by [Zvonkin, Math. URSS Sbornik, 22:129-149] and [Veretennikov, Theory Probab. Appl., 24:354-366] in the case of one-parameter SDEs with singular drift.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04267v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a category of probability spaces and measure-preserving Markov kernels up to almost sure equality. This category contains, among its isomorphisms, mod-zero isomorphisms of probability spaces. It also gives an isomorphism between the space of values of a random variable and the sigma-algebra that it generates on the outcome space, reflecting the standard mathematical practice of using the two interchangeably, for example when taking conditional expectations.
  We show that a number of constructions and results from classical probability theory, mostly involving notions of equilibrium, can be expressed and proven in terms of this category. In particular: - Given a stochastic dynamical system acting on a standard Borel space, we show that the almost surely invariant sigma-algebra can be obtained as a limit and as a colimit; - In the setting above, the almost surely invariant sigma-algebra gives rise, up to isomorphism of our category, to a standard Borel space; - As a corollary, we give a categorical version of the ergodic decomposition theorem for stochastic actions; - As an example, we show how de Finetti's theorem and the Hewitt-Savage and Kolmogorov zero-one laws fit in this limit-colimit picture.
  This work uses the tools of categorical probability, in particular Markov categories, as well as the theory of dagger categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that under minimal assumptions on a class of functions $\mathcal{H}$ defined on a probability space $(\mathcal{X},\mu)$, there is a threshold $\Delta_0$ satisfying the following: for every $\Delta\geq\Delta_0$, with probability at least $1-2\exp(-c\Delta m)$ with respect to $\mu^{\otimes m}$,
  \[ \sup_{h\in\mathcal{H}} \sup_{t\in\mathbb{R}} \left| \mathbb{P}(h(X)\leq t) - \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m 1_{(-\infty,t]}(h(X_i)) \right| \leq \sqrt{\Delta};\]
  here $X$ is distributed according to $\mu$ and $(X_i)_{i=1}^m$ are independent copies of $X$.
  The value of $\Delta_0$ is determined by an unexpected complexity parameter of the class $\mathcal{H}$ that captures the set's geometry (Talagrand's $\gamma_1$-functional).
  The bound, the probability estimate and the value of $\Delta_0$ are all optimal up to a logarithmic factor.</description>

In this paper, we investigate the following stochastic differential equation (SDE) in ${\mathbb R}^d$ driven by Brownian motion $$ {\rm d} X_t=b(t,X_t){\rm d} t+\sqrt{2}{\rm d} W_t, $$ where $b$ belongs to the space ${\mathbb L}_T^q \mathbf{H}_p^\alpha$ with $\alpha \in [-1, 0]$ and $p,q\in[2, \infty]$, which is a distribution-valued and divergence-free vector field. In the subcritical case $\frac dp+\frac 2q&lt;1+\alpha$, we establish the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution to the integral equation: $$ X_t=X_0+\lim_{n\to\infty}\int^t_0b_n(s,X_s){\rm d} s+\sqrt{2} W_t. $$ Here, $b_n:=b*\phi_n$ represents the mollifying approximation, and the limit is taken in the $L^2$-sense. In the critical and supercritical case $1+\alpha\leq\frac dp+\frac 2q&lt;2+\alpha$, assuming the initial distribution has an $L^2$-density, we show the existence of weak solutions and associated Markov processes. Moreover, under the additional assumption that $b=b_1+b_2+{\rm div} a$, where $b_1\in {\mathbb L}^\infty_T{\mathbf B}^{-1}_{\infty,2}$, $b_2\in {\mathbb L}^2_TL^2$, and $a$ is a bounded antisymmetric matrix-valued function, we establish the convergence of mollifying approximation solutions without the need to subtract a subsequence. To illustrate our results, we provide examples of Gaussian random fields and singular interacting particle systems, including the two-dimensional vortex models.</description>

      <title>Functional limit theorems and parameter inference for multiscale stochastic models of enzyme kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) with jumps modeling multistage Michaelis--Menten enzyme kinetics, in which a substrate is sequentially transformed into a product via a cascade of intermediate complexes. These networks are typically high dimensional and exhibit multiscale behavior with strong coupling between different components, posing substantial analytical and computational challenges. In particular, the problem of statistical inference of reaction rates is significantly difficult, and becomes even more intricate when direct observations of system states are unavailable and only a random sample of product formation times is observed. We address this in two stages. First, in a suitable scaling regime consistent with the Quasi-Steady State Approximation (QSSA), we rigorously establish two asymptotic results: (i) a stochastic averaging principle yielding a reduced model for the product--substrate dynamics; and (ii) a Functional Central Limit Theorem (FCLT) characterizing the associated fluctuations. Guided by the reduced-order dynamics, we next construct a novel Interacting Particle System (IPS) that approximates the product-substrate process at the particle level. This IPS plays a pivotal role in the inference methodology; in particular, we establish a propagation of chaos result that mathematically justifies an approximate product-form likelihood based solely on a random sample of product formation times, without requiring access to the system states. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and applicability of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A generalised spatial branching process with ancestral branching to model the growth of a filamentous fungus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a spatial branching process to model the growth of the mycelial network of a filamentous fungus. In this model, each filament is described by the position of its tip, the trajectory of which is solution to a stochastic differential equation with a drift term which depends on all the other trajectories. Each filament can branch either at its tip or along its length, that is to say at some past position of its tip, at some time- and space-dependent rates. It can stop growing at some rate which also depends on the positions of the other tips. We first construct the measure-valued process corresponding to this dynamics, then we study its large population limit and we characterise the limiting process as the weak solution to a system of partial differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the one-dimensional stochastic heat and wave equations driven by Gaussian noises with constant initial conditions. We study the spatial average of the solutions on an interval of length $R$ and show that the family of laws of the spatial average satisfies the large deviation principle as $R$ goes to infinity. We also present the large deviation principle in the space of continuous functions. We prove these results using the tools of Malliavin calculus to evaluate the covariance of nonlinear functionals of the solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a path of the reflected Brownian motion in the half-plane $\{y \ge 0\}$, and erase its part contained in the interior $\{y &gt; 0\}$. What is left is, in an appropriate sense, a path of a jump-type stochastic process on the line $\{y = 0\}$ -- the boundary trace of the reflected Brownian motion. It is well known that this process is in fact the 1-stable L\'evy process, also known as the Cauchy process.
  The PDE interpretation of the above fact is the following. Consider a bounded harmonic function $u$ in the half-plane $\{y &gt; 0\}$, with sufficiently smooth boundary values $f$. Let $g$ denote the normal derivative of $u$ at the boundary. The mapping $f \mapsto g$ is known as the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator, and it is again well known that this operator coincides with the square root of the 1-D Laplace operator $-\Delta$. Thus, the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator coincides with the generator of the boundary trace process.
  Molchanov and Ostrovskii proved that isotropic stable L\'evy processes are boundary traces of appropriate diffusions in half-spaces. Caffarelli and Silvestre gave a PDE counterpart of this result: the fractional Laplace operator is the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator for an appropriate second-order elliptic equation in the half-space. Again, the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator turns out to be the generator of the boundary trace process.
  During my talk I will discuss boundary trace processes and Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators in a more general context. My main goal will be to explain the connections between probabilistic and analytical results. Along the way, I will introduce the necessary machinery: Brownian local times and additive functionals, Krein's spectral theory of strings, and Fourier transform methods.</description>

Abstract: We explore the connection between tasep-like interacting particle systems and last passage percolation type polymer models, focusing on three models: Geometric, Exponential and Brownian last passage percolation and their associated tasep particle systems. We explain how formulas for certain natural observables in last passage percolation translate to formulas for tasep, by going through a notion of "duality". In turn, we obtain determinantal formulas for last passage percolation with a deterministic boundary and for tasep with a deterministic first particle trajectory.</description>

      <title>Coupling between Brownian motion and random walks on the infinite percolation cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the supercritical Bernoulli bond percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ ($d \geq 2$), we give a coupling between the random walk on the infinite cluster and its limit Brownian motion, such that the maximum distance between the paths during $[0,T]$ has a mean of order $T^{\frac{1}{3}+o(1)}$. The construction of the coupling utilizes the optimal transport tool. The analysis mainly relies on local CLT and the concentration of the cluster density. This partially answers an open question posed by Biskup [Probab. Surv., 8:294-373, 2011]. As a direct application, our result recovers the law of the iterated logarithm proved by Duminil-Copin [arXiv:0809.4380], and further identifies the limit constant.</description>

Abstract: We derive the exact probability density function of the product of $N$ independent variance-gamma random variables with zero location parameter. We then apply this formula to derive formulas for the cumulative distribution function and characteristic function, as well as asymptotic approximations for the density, tail probabilities and quantile function. From our general results, we deduce closed-form formulas for the density, cumulative distribution function and characteristic function of the product of $N$ independent asymmetric Laplace random variables and mixed products of independent Laplace and centred normal random variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we consider McKean stochastic differential equations, as well as their corresponding McKean-Vlasov partial differential equations, which admit a unique stationary state, and we study the linearized It\^o diffusion process that is obtained by replacing the law of the process in the convolution term with the unique invariant measure. We show that the law of the nonlinear McKean process converges to the law of this linearized process exponentially fast in time, both in relative entropy and in Wasserstein distance. We study the problem in both the whole space and the torus. We then show how we can employ the resulting linear (in the sense of McKean) Markov process to analyze properties of the original nonlinear and nonlocal dynamics that depend on their long-time behavior. In particular, we propose a linearized maximum likelihood estimator for the nonlinear process which is asymptotically unbiased, and we study the joint diffusive-mean field limit of the underlying interacting particle system.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Optimality of Projected Inventory Level Policies for Lost Sales Inventory Systems with Large Leadtime and Penalty Cost</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10132v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the canonical periodic review lost sales inventory system with positive leadtime and independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) demand under the average cost criterion. We demonstrate that the relative value function under the constant order policy satisfies the Wiener-Hopf equation. We employ ladder processes associated with a random walk featuring i.i.d. increments, to obtain an explicit solution for the relative value function. This solution can be expressed as a quadratic form and a term that grows sublinearly. Then we perform an approximate policy iteration step on the constant order policy and uniformly bound the gap relative to the otimal cost rate for large lead times. This leads to our main result that projected inventory level policies are asymptotically optimal as the leadtime grows when the cost of losing a sale is sufficiently large and demand has a finite second moment.</description>

Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional Coulomb gas with a general potential at the determinantal temperature, or equivalently, the eigenvalues of random normal matrices. We prove that the smallest gaps between particles are typically of order $n^{-3/4}$, and that the associated joint point process of gap locations and gap sizes, after rescaling the gaps by $n^{3/4}$, converges to a Poisson point process. As a consequence, we show that the $k$-th smallest rescaled gap has a limiting density proportional to $x^{4k-1}e^{-\frac{\mathcal{J}}{4}x^{4}}$, where $\mathcal{J}=\pi^{2}\int \rho(z)^{3}d^{2}z$ and $\rho$ is the density of the equilibrium measure. This generalizes a result of Shi and Jiang beyond the quadratic potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01329v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops two mathematical models to understand subjects' behavior in response to the urgency of a change and inputs from governments e.g., (subsides) in the context of the diffusion of the solar photovoltaic in Italy. The first model is a Markovian model of interacting particle systems. The second one, instead, is a Mean Field Game model. In both cases, we derive the scaling limit deterministic dynamics, and we compare the latter to the Italian solar photovoltaic data. We identify periods where the first model describes the behavior of domestic data well and a period where the second model captures a particular feature of data corresponding to companies. The comprehensive analysis, integrated with a philosophical inquiry focusing on the conceptual vocabulary and correlative implications, leads to the formulation of hypotheses about the efficacy of different forms of governmental subsidies.</description>

      <title>An entropy penalized approach for stochastic control problems. Complete version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01534v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an original approach to stochastic control problems. We consider a weak formulation that is written as an optimization (minimization) problem on the space of probability measures. We then introduce a penalized version of this problem obtained by splitting the minimization variables and penalizing the discrepancy between the two variables via an entropy term. We show that the penalized problem provides a good approximation of the original problem when the weight of the entropy penalization term is large enough. Moreover, the penalized problem has the advantage of giving rise to two optimization subproblems that are easy to solve in each of the two optimization variables when the other is fixed. We take advantage of this property to propose an alternating optimization procedure that converges to the infimum of the penalized problem with a rate $O(1/k)$, where $k$ is the number of iterations. The relevance of this approach is illustrated by solving a high-dimensional stochastic control problem aimed at controlling consumption in electrical systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14531v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a dynamic Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph in which edges, according to an alternating renewal process, change from present to absent and vice versa. The objective is to estimate the on- and off-time distributions while only observing the aggregate number of edges. This inverse problem is dealt with, in a parametric context, by setting up an estimator based on the method of moments. We provide conditions under which the estimator is asymptotically normal, and we point out how the corresponding covariance matrix can be identified. It is also demonstrated how to adapt the estimation procedure if alternative subgraph counts are observed, such as the number of wedges or triangles.</description>

      <title>Deformation of the heat kernel and the Brownian motion from the perspective of the Ben Sa\"id--Kobayashi--{\O}rsted $(k,a)$-generalized Laguerre semigroup theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We deform the heat kernel and the Brownian motion on $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ from the perspective of "$(k,a)$-generalized Fourier analysis" with $k=0$. This is a new type of harmonic analysis proposed by S.Ben Sa\"id--T.Kobayashi--B.{\O}rsted from the representation theoretic viewpoint. In this paper, we construct the $a$-deformed heat kernel and $a$-deformed Brownian motion, and explore their some basic properties. We also prove that the $(k,a)$-generalized Fourier integral kernels are polynomial growth when $k=0$, for a justification of some discussions.</description>

      <title>The Exact Mixing Time for Trees with Fixed Diameter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the extremal structure for the exact mixing time for random walks on trees $T_{n,d}$ of order $n$ with diameter $d$. Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, let $H(v,\pi)$ denote the expected length of an optimal stopping rule from vertex $v$ to the stationary distributon $\pi$. We show that the quantity $\max_{G \in T_{n,d} } T_{\mbox{mix}}(G) = \max_{G \in T_{n,d} } \max_{v \in V} H(v,\pi)$ is achieved uniquely by the balanced double broom.</description>

      <title>The hypergraph removal process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $k\geq 2$ and fix a $k$-uniform hypergraph $\mathcal{F}$. Consider the random process that, starting from a $k$-uniform hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ on $n$ vertices, repeatedly deletes the edges of a copy of $\mathcal{F}$ chosen uniformly at random and terminates when no copies of $\mathcal{F}$ remain. Let $R(\mathcal{H},\mathcal{F})$ denote the number of edges that are left after termination. We show that $R(\mathcal{H},\mathcal{F})=n^{k-1/\rho\pm o(1)}$, where $\rho:=(\lvert E(\mathcal{F})\rvert-1)/(\lvert V(\mathcal{F})\rvert -k)$, holds with high probability provided that $\mathcal{F}$ is strictly $k$-balanced and $\mathcal{H}$ is sufficiently dense with pseudorandom properties. Since we may in particular choose $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{H}$ to be complete graphs, this confirms the major folklore conjecture in the area in a very strong form.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching: Markov Kernels, Stochastic Processes and Transport Plans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16839v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among generative neural models, flow matching techniques stand out for their simple applicability and good scaling properties. Here, velocity fields of curves connecting a simple latent and a target distribution are learned. Then the corresponding ordinary differential equation can be used to sample from a target distribution, starting in samples from the latent one. This paper reviews from a mathematical point of view different techniques to learn the velocity fields of absolutely continuous curves in the Wasserstein geometry. We show how the velocity fields can be characterized and learned via i) transport plans (couplings) between latent and target distributions, ii) Markov kernels and iii) stochastic processes, where the latter two include the coupling approach, but are in general broader. Besides this main goal, we show how flow matching can be used for solving Bayesian inverse problems, where the definition of conditional Wasserstein distances plays a central role. Finally, we briefly address continuous normalizing flows and score matching techniques, which approach the learning of velocity fields of curves from other directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a flexible technique to bound the characters of symmetric groups, via the Naruse hook length formula, the Larsen--Shalev character bounds, and appropriate diagram slicings. It allows us to prove a uniform exponential character bound with optimal constant $1/2$. We furthermore prove sharp character bounds for conjugacy classes having a macroscopic number of fixed points, and deduce that the random walks on the associated Cayley graphs exhibit a total variation and $L^2$ cutoff.</description>

      <title>Representative Action Selection for Large Action Space Meta-Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of selecting a subset from a large action space shared by a family of bandits, with the goal of achieving performance nearly matching that of using the full action space. We assume that similar actions tend to have related payoffs, modeled by a Gaussian process. To exploit this structure, we propose a simple epsilon-net algorithm to select a representative subset. We provide theoretical guarantees for its performance and compare it empirically to Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic error distribution for stochastic Runge--Kutta methods of strong order one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work gives the asymptotic error distribution of the stochastic Runge--Kutta (SRK) method of strong order $1$ applied to Stratonovich-type stochastic differential equations. For dealing with the implicitness introduced in the diffusion term, we propose a framework to derive the asymptotic error distribution of diffusion-implicit or fully implicit numerical methods, which enables us to construct a fully explicit numerical method sharing the same asymptotic error distribution as the SRK method. Further, we show that the limit distribution $U(T)$ satisfies $\mathbf E|U(T)|^2\le e^{L_1T}(1+\eta_1)T^3$ for some $\eta_1\ge0$ only depending on the coefficients of the SRK method. Thus, we infer that $\eta_1$ is the key parameter reflecting the growth rate of the mean-square error of the SRK method. Especially, among the SRK methods of strong order $1$, those of weak order $2$ correspond to $\eta_1=0$, sharing the unified asymptotic error distribution, and have the smallest mean-square errors after a long time. This property is also found for the case of additive noise. It seems that we are the first to give the asymptotic error distribution of fully implicit numerical methods for stochastic differential equations.</description>

      <title>The Gittins Index: A Design Principle for Decision-Making Under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gittins index is a tool that optimally solves a variety of decision-making problems involving uncertainty, including multi-armed bandit problems, minimizing mean latency in queues, and search problems like the Pandora's box model. However, despite the above examples and later extensions thereof, the space of problems that the Gittins index can solve perfectly optimally is limited, and its definition is rather subtle compared to those of other multi-armed bandit algorithms. As a result, the Gittins index is often regarded as being primarily a concept of theoretical importance, rather than a practical tool for solving decision-making problems.
  The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate that the Gittins index can be fruitfully applied to practical problems. We start by giving an example-driven introduction to the Gittins index, then walk through several examples of problems it solves - some optimally, some suboptimally but still with excellent performance. Two practical highlights in the latter category are applying the Gittins index to Bayesian optimization, and applying the Gittins index to minimizing tail latency in queues.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Modeling of Antibody Kinetics Post Infection and Vaccination: A Markov Chain Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of antibody levels is crucial for characterizing the time-dependent response to immune events: either infections or vaccinations. The sequence and timing of these events significantly influence antibody level changes. Despite extensive interest in the topic in the recent years and many experimental studies, the effect of immune event sequences on antibody levels is not well understood. Moreover, disease or vaccination prevalence in the population are time-dependent. This, alongside the complexities of personal antibody kinetics, makes it difficult to analyze a sample immune measurement from a population. As a solution, we design a rigorous mathematical characterization in terms of a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain model for event-to-event transitions coupled with a probabilistic framework for the post-event antibody kinetics of multiple immune events. We demonstrate that this is an ideal model for immune event sequences, referred to as personal trajectories. This novel modeling framework surpasses the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) characterizations by rigorously tracking the probability distribution of population antibody response across time. To illustrate our ideas, we apply our mathematical framework to longitudinal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) data from individuals with multiple documented infection and vaccination events. Our work is an important step towards a comprehensive understanding of antibody kinetics that could lead to an effective way to analyze the protective power of natural immunity or vaccination, predict missed immune events at an individual level, and inform booster timing recommendations.</description>
