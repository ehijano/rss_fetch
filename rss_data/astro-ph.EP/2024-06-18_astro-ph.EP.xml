      <title>Vertical shear instability with dust evolution and consistent cooling times. On the importance of the initial dust distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Gas in protoplanetary disks mostly cools via thermal accommodation with dust particles. Thermal relaxation is thus highly sensitive to the local dust size distributions and the spatial distribution of the grains. So far, the interplay between thermal relaxation and gas turbulence has not been dynamically modeled in hydrodynamic simulations of protoplanetary disks with dust.
  Aims. We aim to study the effects of the vertical shear instability (VSI) on the thermal relaxation times, and vice versa. We are particularly interested in the influence of the initial dust grain size on the VSI and whether the emerging turbulence is sustained over long timescales.
  Results. We find that the emergence of the VSI is strongly dependent on the initial dust grain size. Coagulation also counteracts the emergence of hydrodynamic turbulence in our simulations, as shown by others before. Starting a simulation with larger grains (100 $\mu$m) generally leads to a less turbulent outcome. While the inner disk regions (within $\sim$ 70 au) develop turbulence in all three simulations, we find that the simulations with larger particles do not develop VSI in the outer disk.
  Conclusions. Our simulations with dynamically calculated thermal accommodation times based on the drifting and settling dust distribution show that the VSI, once developed in a disk, can be sustained over long timescales, even if grain growth is occurring. The VSI corrugates the dust layer and even diffuses the smaller grains into the upper atmosphere, where they can cool the gas. Whether the instability can emerge for a specific stratification depends on the initial dust grain sizes and the initial dust scale height. If the grains are initially $\gtrsim$ 100 $\mu$m and if the level of turbulence is initially assumed to be low, we find no VSI turbulence in the outer disk regions.</description>

      <title>Characterizing planetary systems with SPIRou: a temperate sub-Neptune exoplanet orbiting the nearby fully-convective star GJ 1289 and a candidate around GJ 3378</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of two new exoplanet systems around fully convective stars, found from the radial-velocity (RV) variations of their host stars measured with the nIR spectropolarimeter CFHT/SPIRou over multiple years. GJ 3378 b is a planet with minimum mass of $5.26^{+0.94}_{-0.97}$ Mearth in an eccentric 24.73-day orbit around an M4V star of 0.26 Msun. GJ 1289 b has a minimum mass of $6.27\pm1.25$ Mearth in a 111.74-day orbit, in a circular orbit around an M4.5V star of mass 0.21 Msun. Both stars are in the solar neighbourhood, at respectively 7.73 and 8.86 pc. The low-amplitude RV signals are detected after line-by-line post-processing treatment. These potential sub-Neptune class planets around cool stars may have temperate atmospheres and be interesting nearby systems for further studies. We also recovered the large-scale magnetic field of both stars, found to be mostly axisymmetric and dipolar, and with a polar strength of 20-30 G and 200-240 G for GJ 3378 (in 2019-21) and GJ 1289 (in 2022-23), respectively. The rotation periods measured with the magnetic field differ from the orbital periods, and in general, stellar activity is not seen in the studied nIR RV time series of both stars. GJ 3378 b detection is not confirmed by optical RVs and is therefore considered a candidate at this point.</description>

      <title>Four microlensing giant planets detected through signals produced by minor-image perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the nature of the anomalies appearing in four microlensing events KMT-2020-BLG-0757, KMT-2022-BLG-0732, KMT-2022-BLG-1787, and KMT-2022-BLG-1852. The light curves of these events commonly exhibit initial bumps followed by subsequent troughs that extend across a substantial portion of the light curves. We performed thorough modeling of the anomalies to elucidate their characteristics. Despite their prolonged durations, which differ from the usual brief anomalies observed in typical planetary events, our analysis revealed that each anomaly in these events originated from a planetary companion located within the Einstein ring of the primary star. It was found that the initial bump arouse when the source star crossed one of the planetary caustics, while the subsequent trough feature occurred as the source traversed the region of minor image perturbations lying between the pair of planetary caustics. The estimated masses of the host and planet, their mass ratios, and the distance to the discovered planetary systems are $(M_{\rm host}/M_\odot, M_{\rm planet}/M_{\rm J}, q/10^{-3}, \dl/{\rm kpc}) = (0.58^{+0.33}_{-0.30}, 10.71^{+6.17}_{-5.61}, 17.61\pm 2.25,6.67^{+0.93}_{-1.30})$ for KMT-2020-BLG-0757, $(0.53^{+0.31}_{-0.31}, 1.12^{+0.65}_{-0.65}, 2.01 \pm 0.07, 6.66^{+1.19}_{-1.84})$ for KMT-2022-BLG-0732, $(0.42^{+0.32}_{-0.23}, 6.64^{+4.98}_{-3.64}, 15.07\pm 0.86, 7.55^{+0.89}_{-1.30})$ for KMT-2022-BLG-1787, and $(0.32^{+0.34}_{-0.19}, 4.98^{+5.42}_{-2.94}, 8.74\pm 0.49, 6.27^{+0.90}_{-1.15})$ for KMT-2022-BLG-1852. These parameters indicate that all the planets are giants with masses exceeding the mass of Jupiter in our solar system and the hosts are low-mass stars with masses substantially less massive than the Sun.</description>

      <title>Predicting Exoplanetary Features with a Residual Model for Uniform and Gaussian Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of technology has led to rampant growth in data collection across almost every field, including astrophysics, with researchers turning to machine learning to process and analyze this data. One prominent example of this data in astrophysics is the atmospheric retrievals of exoplanets. In order to help bridge the gap between machine learning and astrophysics domain experts, the 2023 Ariel Data Challenge was hosted to predict posterior distributions of 7 exoplanetary features. The procedure outlined in this paper leveraged a combination of two deep learning models to address this challenge: a Multivariate Gaussian model that generates the mean and covariance matrix of a multivariate Gaussian distribution, and a Uniform Quantile model that predicts quantiles for use as the upper and lower bounds of a uniform distribution. Training of the Multivariate Gaussian model was found to be unstable, while training of the Uniform Quantile model was stable. An ensemble of uniform distributions was found to have competitive results during testing (posterior score of 696.43), and when combined with a multivariate Gaussian distribution achieved a final rank of third in the 2023 Ariel Data Challenge (final score of 681.57).</description>

      <title>Seven white dwarfs with circumstellar gas discs II: Tracing the composition of exoplanetary building blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This second paper presents an in-depth analysis of the composition of the planetary material that has been accreted onto seven white dwarfs with circumstellar dust and gas emission discs with abundances reported in Paper I. The white dwarfs are accreting planetary bodies with a wide range of oxygen, carbon, and sulfur volatile contents, including one white dwarf that shows the most enhanced sulfur abundance seen to date. Three white dwarfs show tentative evidence (2-3$\sigma$) of accreting oxygen-rich material, potentially from water-rich bodies, whilst two others are accreting dry, rocky material. One white dwarf is accreting a mantle-rich fragment of a larger differentiated body, whilst two white dwarfs show an enhancement in their iron abundance and could be accreting core-rich fragments. Whilst most planetary material accreted by white dwarfs display chondritic or bulk Earth-like compositions, these observations demonstrate that core-mantle differentiation, disruptive collisions, and the accretion of core-mantle differentiated material are important. Less than one percent of polluted white dwarfs host both observable circumstellar gas and dust. It is unknown whether these systems are experiencing an early phase in the disruption and accretion of planetary bodies, or alternatively if they are accreting larger planetary bodies. From this work there is no substantial evidence for significant differences in the accreted refractory abundance ratios for those white dwarfs with or without circumstellar gas, but there is tentative evidence for those with circumstellar gas discs to be accreting more water rich material which may suggest that volatiles accrete earlier in a gas-rich phase.</description>

      <title>Insights on the Formation Conditions of Uranus and Neptune from their Deep Elemental Compositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study, placed in the context of the preparation for the Uranus Orbiter Probe mission, aims to predict the bulk volatile compositions of Uranus and Neptune. Using a protoplanetary disk model, it examines the evolution of trace species through vapor and solid transport as dust and pebbles. Due to the high carbon abundance found in their envelopes, the two planets are postulated to have formed at the carbon monoxide iceline within the protosolar nebula. The time evolution of the abundances of the major volatile species at the location of the CO iceline is then calculated to derive the abundance ratios of the corresponding key elements, including the heavy noble gases, in the feeding zones of Uranus and Neptune. Supersolar metallicity in their envelopes likely results from accreting solids in these zones. Two types of solids are considered: pure condensates (Case 1) and a mixture of pure condensates and clathrates (Case 2). The model, calibrated to observed carbon enrichments, predicts deep compositions. In Case 1, argon is deeply depleted, while nitrogen, oxygen, krypton, phosphorus, sulfur, and xenon are significantly enriched relative to their protosolar abundances in the two planets. Case 2 predicts significant enrichments for all species, including argon, relative to their protosolar abundances. Consequently, Case 1 predicts near-zero Ar/Kr or Ar/Xe ratios, while Case 2 suggests these ratios are 0.1 and 0.5-1 times their protosolar ratios. Both cases predict a bulk sulfur-to-nitrogen ratio consistent with atmospheric measurements.</description>

      <title>PLATO's signal and noise budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ESA's PLATO mission aims the detection and characterization of terrestrial planets around solar-type stars as well as the study of host star properties. The noise-to-signal ratio (NSR) is the main performance parameter of the PLATO instrument, which consists of 24 Normal Cameras and 2 Fast Cameras. In order to justify, verify and breakdown NSR-relevant requirements the software simulator PINE was developed. PINE models the signal pathway from a target star to the digital output of a camera based on physical models and considers the major noise contributors. In this paper, the simulator's coarse mode is introduced which allows fast performance analyses on instrument level. The added value of PINE is illustrated by exemplary applications.</description>

      <title>Seeing the unseen: a method to detect unresolved rings in protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While high resolution ALMA observations reveal a wealth of substructure in protoplanetary discs, they remain incapable of resolving the types of small scale dust structures predicted, for example, by numerical simulations of the streaming instability. In this Letter, we propose a method to find evidence for unresolved, optically thick dusty rings in protoplanetary disks. We demonstrate that, in presence of unresolved rings, the brightness of an inclined disc exhibits a distinctive emission peak at the minor axis. Furthermore, the azimuthal brightness depends on both the geometry of the rings and the dust optical properties; we can therefore use the azimuthal brightness variations to both detect unresolved rings and probe their properties. By analyzing the azimuthal brightness in the test-case of ring-like substructures formed by streaming instability, we show that the resulting peak is likely detectable by ALMA for typical disc parameters. Moreover, we present an analytic model that not only qualitatively but also quantitatively reproduces the peak found in the simulations, validating its applicability to infer the presence of unresolved rings in observations and characterize their optical properties and shape. This will contribute to the identification of disk regions where streaming instability (and thus planet formation) is occurring.</description>

      <title>Detecting Planetary Oblateness in the Era of JWST: A Case Study of Kepler-167e</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planets may be rotationally flattened, and their oblateness thus provide useful information on their formation and evolution. Here we develop a new algorithm that can compute the transit light curve due to an oblate planet very efficiently and use it to study the detectability of planet oblateness (and spin obliquity) with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Using the Jupiter analog, Kepler-167e, as an example, we show that observations of a single transit with JWST are able to detect a Saturn-like oblateness ($f=0.1$) with high confidence, or set a stringent upper limit on the oblateness parameter, as long as the planetary spin is slightly misaligned ($\gtrsim 20^\circ$) with respect to its orbital direction. Based on known obliquity measurements and theoretical arguments, it is reasonable to believe that this level of misalignment may be common. We estimate the sensitivity limit of JWST in oblateness detections and highlight the importance of better characterizations of cold planets in planning future JWST transit observations. The potential to detect rings, moons, and atmospheric species of the cold giants with JWST is also discussed.</description>

      <title>The Focal-plane Actualized Shifted Technique Realized for a Shack Hartmann Wavefront Sensor (fastrSHWFS)</title>

Abstract: Astronomical adaptive optics (AO) is a critical approach to enable ground-based diffraction-limited imaging and high contrast science, with the potential to enable habitable exoplanet imaging on future extremely large telescopes. However, AO systems must improve significantly to enable habitable exoplanet imaging. Time lag between the end of an exposure and end of deformable mirror commands being applied in an AO loop is now the dominant error term in many extreme AO systems (e.g., Poyneer et al. 2016), and within that lag component detector read time is becoming non-negligible (e.g., Cetre et al. 2018). This term will decrease as faster detector readout capabilities are developed by vendors. In complement, we have developed a modified Shack Hartmann Wavefront Sensor (SHWFS) to address this problem called the Focal-plane Actualized Shifted Technique Realized for a SHWFS (fastrSHWFS). The novelty of this design is to replace the usual lenslet array with a bespoke pupil-plane phase mask that redistributes the spot pattern on the detector into a rectangular array with a custom aspect ratio (in an extreme case, if the detector size can accommodate it, the array can be a single line). We present the fastrSHWFS concept and preliminary laboratory tests. For some detectors and AO systems, the fastrSHWFS technique can decrease the read time per frame compared to a regular SHWFS by up to 30x, supporting the goal of reduced AO lag needed to eventually enable habitable exoplanet imaging.</description>

      <title>Climate Change Task Force Report for the American Astronomical Society</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AAS Strategic Plan for 2021-26 called for the creation of a task force to identify how the AAS can meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. The AAS and its membership recognize the danger climate change represents to humanity and our world, and to astronomy -- as a profession, a hobby, and a cultural good. Our profession in general -- and the AAS in particular -- should work to make it possible for all astronomers to have an equal opportunity to be successful without needing to incur high carbon emissions, and to preserve astronomy for future generations.
  A study was completed of the carbon emissions associated with the AAS, finding that 84% of total AAS-related emissions are from in-person conferences. We also conducted a survey of AAS members to determine their attitudes about climate change. Respondents overwhelmingly (97%) think that the AAS should reduce its carbon footprint. Our task force created a list of fourteen recommendations, with two ranked as top priorities: The AAS should not schedule additional in-person meetings before 2030 and it should work to innovate the AAS conference model. Based upon our analysis it is clear that online interaction is the only way to increase participation while meaningfully decreasing emissions.
  Our recommendations are aligned with the Astro2020 Decadal Survey as well as AAS values to disseminate our scientific understanding of the universe, and to do our work in an ethically responsible way. Because of their other benefits -- particularly in making our society more welcoming to those who traditionally have been excluded -- we feel that these are sound decisions, worthy of implementation even if the AAS wasn't trying to reduce its carbon footprint. They simply make sense as steps towards a professional society that better serves a broader membership, as our profession evolves to be greener, more inclusive, and more productive.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Heating and Parallel Heat Flux in Electron-only Magnetic Reconnection with Intense Guide Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron-only reconnection is a process recently observed in the Earth's magnetosheath, where magnetic reconnection occurs at electron kinetic scales with only electrons involved. Electron-only reconnection is likely to have a significant impact on the energy conversion and dissipation of turbulence cascades at kinetic scales. This paper investigates electron-only reconnection under different intensities of strong guide fields via two-dimensional fully kinetic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations, focusing on electron heating. The simulations are initialized with a force-free current sheet equilibrium under various intensities of strong guide fields. The quadrupolar structures of the out-of-plane magnetic field and asymmetric structures of density are found to become narrower in space as the guide field increases. Electron velocities are considerably larger than ion velocities, and the motion of both species is notably affected by the strength of guide fields. Similarly to previous experiments studies, electron temperature anisotropy along separatrices is observed, which is found to be mainly caused by the variations of parallel temperature. Both regions of anisotropy and parallel temperature increase/decrease along separatrices become thinner with increasing guide fields. Besides, we find a transition from a quadrupolar to a six-polar to an eight-polar structure in temperature anisotropy and parallel temperature as the guide field intensifies. Non-Maxwellian electron velocity distribution functions (EVDFs) at different locations in the three simulations are observed. Our results show that parallel electron velocity varies notably with different guide field intensities and strong parallel electron heat flux is observed.</description>

      <title>Magnetohydrodynamical modeling of star-disk formation: from isolated spherical collapse towards incorporation of external dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of protostars and their disks has been understood as the result of the gravitational collapse phase of an accumulation of dense gas that determines the mass reservoir of the star-disk system. Against this background, the broadly applied scenario of considering the formation of disks has been to model the collapse of a dense core assuming spherical spherical symmetry. Our understanding of the formation of star-disk systems is currently undergoing a reformation though. The picture evolves from interpreting disks as the sole outcome of the collapse of an isolated prestellar core to a more dynamic picture where disks are affected by the molecular cloud environment in which they form. In this review, we provide a status report of the state-of-the-art of spherical collapse models that are highly advanced in terms of the incorporated physics together with constraints from models that account for the possibility of infall onto star-disk systems in simplified test setups, as well as in multi-scale simulations that cover a dynamical range from the Giant Molecular Cloud environment down to the disk. Considering the observational constraints that favor a more dynamical picture of star formation, we finally discuss the challenges and prospects in linking the efforts of tackle the problem of star-disk formation in combined multi-scale, multi-physics simulations.</description>

      <title>Astrometry as a Tool for Discovering and Weighing Faint Companions to Nearby Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This tutorial covers the use of absolute astrometry, in particular from the combination of the Hipparcos and Gaia missions, to identify faint companions to nearby stars and to measure the masses and orbits of those companions. Absolute astrometry has been used with increasing success to discover new planets and brown dwarfs and to measure masses and orbits for systems with periods as long as centuries. This tutorial summarizes the nature of the underlying astrometric data, the approach typically used to fit orbits, and the assumptions about that data implicit throughout the process. It attempts to provide intuition for the sensitivity of astrometry as a function of stellar and companion properties and how the available constraints depend on the character and quantity of data available. This tutorial is written for someone with some background in astronomy but with no more than a minimal acquaintance with astrometry or orbit fitting.</description>

      <title>Direct Imaging Detection of the Protoplanet AB Aurigae b at Wavelengths Covering Pa$\beta$: Rebuttal to Biddle et al. (2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Biddle et al. (2024) claimed a non-detection of the protoplanet AB Aurigae b in Keck/NIRC2 Pa$\beta$ imaging. I reprocess these newly-public data and compare them to data from the extreme AO platform (SCExAO/CHARIS) used to discover AB Aur b. AB Aur b is decisively imaged with SCExAO/CHARIS at wavelengths covering Pa$\beta$. The Biddle et al. non detection of AB Aur b results from a far poorer image quality that is non competitive with SCExAO/CHARIS. Their contrast limits and thus constraints on accretion are overestimated due to an inaccurate AB Aur b source model. Consequentially, the revised Pa$\beta$ 2-$\sigma$ upper limit from these data is about three times higher than previously reported. Irrespective of image quality, single-band Pa$\beta$ imaging is ill suited to conclusively identifying accretion onto AB Aur b. Instead, high-resolution H$\alpha$ spectroscopy may provide accretion signatures. Aside from PDS 70, AB Aurigae remains the system with the strongest evidence for having a directly-imaged protoplanet.</description>

      <title>Mind the gap: Distinguishing disc substructures and their impact on the inner disc composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Improved observational technologies have enabled the resolution of substructures and the measurement of chemical abundances in discs. Understanding the chemical composition of the inner disc allows us to infer the building blocks available for planet formation. Recently, the depletion of water in the inner disc has been suggested to be linked to the presence of substructures, such as gaps and rings, further out. We investigate this hypothesis further by running 1D semi-analytical models of a disc with a gap to understand the combined effects of disc viscosity, gap depth, gap location, and gap formation timescales on the inner disc composition. Our results show that for a specific value of disc viscosity, the simulation outcome can be classified into three regimes: shallow gap, "traffic jam", and deep gap. While deep gaps may already be distinguishable with moderate-resolution techniques, it is still challenging to resolve shallow gaps with the current capabilities. On the other hand, discs with traffic jams have a higher chance of being resolved when observed with a high resolution, but they may appear as an intensity enhancement or even featureless when observed with moderate to low angular resolution. In this regard, information on the inner disc composition is useful because it can help to infer the existence of traffic jams or distinguish them from deep gaps: discs with deep gaps are expected to have a low water content and thus high C/O ratio in the inner disc due to the effective blocking of pebbles, while discs with shallow gaps would demonstrate the opposite trend. Furthermore, discs with a traffic jam would have a constant inward flux of water-rich pebbles resulting in a moderate water content and sub-stellar C/O ratios. Finally, we find that the effectiveness of gaps as pebble barriers diminishes quickly when they form late, as most of the pebbles have already drifted inwards.</description>

      <title>Probing the Dark Matter Capture Rate in a Local Population of Brown Dwarfs with IceCube Gen 2</title>

Abstract: This study explores the potential for dark matter annihilation within brown dwarfs, investigating an unconventional mechanism for neutrino production. Motivated by the efficient accumulation of dark matter particles in brown dwarfs through scattering interactions, we focus on a mass range above 10 GeV, considering dark matter annihilation channels $\chi \chi \rightarrow \nu \bar{\nu} \nu \bar{\nu}$ through long-lived mediators. Using the projected sensitivity of IceCube Generation 2, we assess the detection capability of the local population of brown dwarfs within 20 pc and exclude dark matter-nucleon scattering with cross-sections as low as a few multiples of $10^{-36}~\rm cm^{2}$.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous FUV and NUV observations of T Tauri stars with UVIT/AstroSat: probing accretion process in young stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present results from simultaneous FUV and NUV observations of T-Tauri stars (TTSs) in the Taurus molecular cloud with UVIT/AstroSat. This is the very first UVIT study of TTSs. From the spectral energy distribution of TTSs from FUV to near-IR, we show that classical TTSs (CTTSs) emit significantly higher UV excess compared to weak-line TTSs (WTTSs). The equivalent black-body temperatures corresponding to the UV excess in CTTSs ($&gt;10^4$ K) are also found to be relatively higher than that in WTTSs ($&lt;9250$ K). From the UV excess, we have re-classified two WTTSs (BS Tau, V836 Tau) as CTTSs, which has been supported by the follow-up optical spectroscopic study using the Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT), showing strong H$\alpha$ line emission. We find that CTTSs show strong excess emission in both FUV ($&gt;$10$^7$) and NUV ($&gt;$10$^3$) bands, while WTTSs show strong excess only in the FUV ($\lesssim$10$^5$), suggesting that excess emission in NUV can be used as a tool to classify the TTSs. We also find a linear correlation between UV luminosity (a primary indicator of mass accretion) and H$\alpha$ luminosity (a secondary indicator of mass accretion) with a slope of 1.20$\pm$0.22 and intercept of 2.16$\pm$0.70.</description>

      <title>Rotation and Abundances of the Benchmark Brown Dwarf HD 33632 Ab from Keck/KPIC High-resolution Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the projected rotational velocity and molecular abundances for HD 33632 Ab obtained via Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer high-resolution spectroscopy. HD 33632 Ab is a nearby benchmark brown dwarf companion at a separation of $\sim$20 au that straddles the L/T transition. Using a forward-modeling framework with on-axis host star spectra, self-consistent substellar atmospheric and retrieval models for HD 33632 Ab, we derive a projected rotational velocity of 53 $\pm$ 3 km/s and carbon/water mass fractions of log CO = $-$2.3 $\pm$ 0.3 and log H$_2$O = $-$2.7 $\pm$ 0.2. The inferred carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O = 0.58 $\pm$ 0.14), molecular abundances, and metallicity ([C/H] = 0.0 $\pm$ 0.2 dex) of HD 33632 Ab are consistent with its host star. Although detectable methane opacities are expected in L/T transition objects, we did not recover methane in our KPIC spectra, partly due to the high $v\sin{i}$ and to disequilibrium chemistry at the pressures we are sensitive to. We parameterize the spin as the ratio of rotation over break-up velocity, and compare HD 33632 Ab to a compilation of &gt;200 very low-mass objects (M$\lesssim$0.1 M$_{\odot}$) that have spin measurements in the literature. There appears to be no clear trend for the isolated field low-mass objects versus mass, but a tentative trend is identified for low-mass companions and directly imaged exoplanets, similar to previous findings. A larger sample of close-in gas giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs will critically examine our understanding of their formation and evolution through rotation and chemical abundance measurements.</description>

      <title>Whistler waves in the quasi-parallel and quasi-perpendicular magnetosheath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Earth's magnetosheath (MSH), several processes contribute to energy dissipation and plasma heating, one of which is wave-particle interactions between whistler waves and electrons. However, the overall impact of whistlers on electron dynamics in the MSH remains to be quantified. We analyze 18 hours of burst-mode measurements from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission, including data from the unbiased magnetosheath campaign during February-March 2023. We present a statistical study of 34,409 whistler waves found using automatic detection. We compare wave occurrence in the different MSH geometries and find three times higher occurrence in the quasi-perpendicular MSH compared to the quasi-parallel case. We also study the wave properties and find that the waves propagate quasi-parallel to the background magnetic field, have a median frequency of 0.2 times the electron cyclotron frequency, median amplitude of 0.03-0.06 nT (30-60 pT), and median duration of a few tens of wave periods. The whistler waves are preferentially observed in local magnetic dips and density peaks and are not associated with an increased temperature anisotropy. Also, almost no whistlers are observed in regions with parallel electron plasma beta lower than 0.1. Importantly, when estimating pitch-angle diffusion times we find that the whistler waves cause significant pitch-angle scattering of electrons in the MSH.</description>
