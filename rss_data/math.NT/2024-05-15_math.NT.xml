      <title>An Exponential Diophantine equation $x^2+3^{\alpha} 113^{\beta}=y^{\mathfrak{n}}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of the paper is to determine the complete solutions for the Diophantine equation $x^2 + 3^{\alpha}113^{\beta} = y^{\mathfrak{n}}$ in positive integers $x$ and $y$ (where $x, y \geq 1$), non-negative exponents $\alpha$ and $\beta$, and an integer $\mathfrak{n}\geq 3$, subject to the condition $\text{gcd}(x, y) = 1$.</description>

      <title>Sums of rational cubes and the $3$-Selmer group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Alp\"oge-Bhargava-Shnidman determined the average size of the $2$-Selmer group in the cubic twist family of any elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}$ with $j$-invariant $0$. We obtain the distribution of the $3$-Selmer groups in the same family. As a consequence, we improve their upper bound on the density of integers expressible as a sum of two rational cubes. Assuming a $3$-converse theorem, we also improve their lower bound on this density.
  The $\sqrt{-3}$-Selmer group in this cubic twist family is well-known to be large, which poses significant challenges to the methods previously developed by the second author. We overcome this problem by strengthening the analytic core of these methods. Specifically, we prove a "trilinear large sieve" for an appropriate generalization of the classical R\'edei symbol, then use this to control the restriction of the Cassels-Tate pairing to the $\sqrt{-3}$-Selmer groups in these twist families.</description>

      <title>Imaginary quadratic fields $F$ with $X_0(15)(F)$ finite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Caraiani and Newton have proven that if $F$ is an imaginary quadratic number field such that $X_0(15)$ has rank $0$ over $F$, then every elliptic curve over $F$ is modular. This paper is concerned with the quadratic fields $F=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-p})$ for a prime number $p$. We give explicit conditions on $p$ under which the rank is $0$, and prove that these conditions are satisfied for $87,5\%$ of the primes for which the rank is expected to be even based on the parity conjecture. We also show these conditions are satisfied if and only if rank $0$ follows from a $4$-descent over $\mathbb{Q}$ on the quadratic twist $X_0(15)_{-p}$. To prove this, we perform two consecutive $2$-descents and prove this gives rank bounds equivalent to those obtained from a $4$-descent using visualisation techniques for $\mathrm{Sha}[2]$. In fact we prove a more general connection between higher descents for elliptic curves which seems interesting in its own right.</description>

      <title>A positive proportion of monic odd-degree hyperelliptic curves of genus $g \geq 4$ have no unexpected quadratic points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}_g$ be the family of monic odd-degree hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. Poonen and Stoll have shown that for every $g \geq 3$, a positive proportion of curves in $\mathcal{F}_g$ have no rational points except the point at infinity. In this note, we prove the analogue for quadratic points: for each $g\geq 4$, a positive proportion of curves in $\mathcal{F}_g$ have no points defined over quadratic extensions except those that arise by pulling back rational points from $\mathbb{P}^1$.</description>

      <title>Paley-like quasi-random graphs arising from polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Paley graphs and Paley sum graphs are classical examples of quasi-random graphs. In this paper, we provide new constructions of families of quasi-random graphs that behave like Paley graphs but are neither Cayley graphs nor Cayley sum graphs. These graphs give a unified perspective of studying various graphs arising from polynomials over finite fields such as Paley graphs, Paley sum graphs, and graphs coming from Diophantine tuples and their generalizations. We also provide new lower bounds on the clique number and independence number of general quasi-random graphs. In particular, we give a sufficient condition for the clique number of quasi-random graphs of $n$ vertices to be at least $(1-o(1)\log_{3.008}n$. Such a condition applies to many classical quasi-random graphs, including Paley graphs and Paley sum graphs, as well as some new Paley-like graphs we construct.</description>

Abstract: We determine the structure of the graded ring of Siegel modular forms of degree 3. It is generated by 19 modular forms, among which we identify a homogeneous system of parameters with 7 forms of weights 4, 12, 12, 14, 18, 20 and 30. We also give a complete dictionary between the Dixmier-Ohno invariants of ternary quartics and the above generators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2005.09970v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Shafarevich-Tate group $W (\mathscr{A})$ measures the failure of the Hasse principle for an abelian variety $\mathscr{A}$. Using a correspondence between the abelian varieties and the higher dimensional non-commutative tori, we prove that $W (\mathscr{A})\cong Cl~(\Lambda)\oplus Cl~(\Lambda)$ or $W (\mathscr{A})\cong \left(\mathbf{Z}/2^k\mathbf{Z}\right) \oplus Cl_{~\mathbf{odd}}~(\Lambda)\oplus Cl_{~\mathbf{odd}}~(\Lambda)$, where $Cl~(\Lambda)$ is the ideal class group of a ring $\Lambda$ associated to the K-theory of the non-commutative tori and $2^k $ divides the order of $Cl~(\Lambda)$. The case of elliptic curves with complex multiplication is considered in detail.</description>

      <title>$\ell$-adic images of Galois for elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.11141v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the $\ell$-adic case of Mazur's "Program B" over $\mathbb{Q}$, the problem of classifying the possible images of $\ell$-adic Galois representations attached to elliptic curves $E$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, equivalently, classifying the rational points on the corresponding modular curves. The primes $\ell=2$ and $\ell\ge 13$ are addressed by prior work, so we focus on the remaining primes $\ell = 3, 5, 7, 11$. For each of these $\ell$, we compute the directed graph of arithmetically maximal $\ell$-power level modular curves $X_H$, compute explicit equations for all but three of them, and classify the rational points on all of them except $X_{{\rm ns}}^{+}(N)$, for $N = 27, 25, 49, 121$, and two level $49$ curves of genus $9$ whose Jacobians have analytic rank $9$.
  Aside from the $\ell$-adic images that are known to arise for infinitely many $\bar{\mathbb{Q}}$-isomorphism classes of elliptic curves $E/\mathbb{Q}$, we find only 22 exceptional images that arise for any prime $\ell$ and any $E/\mathbb{Q}$ without complex multiplication; these exceptional images are realized by 20 non-CM rational $j$-invariants. We conjecture that this list of 22 exceptional images is complete and show that any counterexamples must arise from unexpected rational points on $X_{\rm ns}^+(\ell)$ with $\ell\ge 19$, or one of the six modular curves noted above. This yields a very efficient algorithm to compute the $\ell$-adic images of Galois for any elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}$.
  In an appendix with John Voight we generalize Ribet's observation that simple abelian varieties attached to newforms on $\Gamma_1(N)$ are of ${\rm GL}_2$-type; this extends Kolyvagin's theorem that analytic rank zero implies algebraic rank zero to isogeny factors of the Jacobian of $X_H$.</description>

      <title>Correlations of the Riemann zeta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming the Riemann hypothesis, we investigate the shifted moments of the zeta function \[ M_{\alpha,{\beta}}(T) = \int_T^{2T} \prod_{k = 1}^m |\zeta(\tfrac{1}{2} + i (t + \alpha_k))|^{2 \beta_k} dt \] introduced by Chandee, where ${\alpha} = {\alpha}(T) = (\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_m)$ and ${\beta} = (\beta_1 \ldots , \beta_m)$ satisfy $|\alpha_k| \leq T/2$ and $\beta_k\geq 0$. We shall prove that \[ M_{{\alpha},{\beta}}(T) \ll_{{\beta}} T (\log T)^{\beta_1^2 + \cdots + \beta_m^2} \prod_{1\leq j &lt; k \leq m} |\zeta(1 + i(\alpha_j - \alpha_k) + 1/ \log T )|^{2\beta_j \beta_k}. \] This improves upon the previous best known bounds due to Chandee and Ng, Shen, and Wong, particularly when the differences $|\alpha_j - \alpha_k|$ are unbounded as $T \rightarrow \infty$. The key insight is to combine work of Heap, Radziwi{\l}{\l}, and Soundararajan and work of the author with the work of Harper on the moments of the zeta function.</description>

      <title>Hasse principle for Kummer varieties in the case of generic 2-torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conditional on finiteness of relevant Shafarevich--Tate groups, Harpaz and Skorobogatov used Swinnerton-Dyer's descent-fibration method to establish the Hasse principle for Kummer varieties associated to a 2-covering of a principally polarised abelian variety under certain largeness assumptions on its mod 2 Galois image. Their method breaks down however when the Galois image is maximal, due to the possible failure of the Shafarevich--Tate group of quadratic twists of A to have square order. In this work we overcome this obstruction by combining second descent ideas in the spirit of Harpaz and Smith with results on the parity of 2-infinity Selmer ranks in quadratic twist families. This allows Swinnerton-Dyer's method to be successfully applied to K3 surfaces arising as quotients of 2-coverings of Jacobians of genus 2 curves with no rational Weierstrass points.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff dimension estimates for Sudler products with positive lower bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an irrational number $\alpha$, we study the asymptotic behaviour of the Sudler product denoted by $P_N(\alpha) = \prod_{r=1}^N 2\lvert \sin \pi r \alpha \rvert$. We show that $\liminf_{N \to \infty} P_N(\alpha) &gt;0$ and $\limsup_{N \to \infty} P_N(\alpha)/N &lt; \infty$ whenever the sequence of partial quotients in the continued fraction expansion of $\alpha$ exceeds 3 only finitely often, which confirms a conjecture of the second-named author and partially answers a question of J. Shallit. Furthermore, we show that the Hausdorff dimension of the set of those $\alpha$ that satisfy $\limsup_{N \to \infty} P_N(\alpha)/N &lt; \infty,\liminf_{N \to \infty} P_N(\alpha) &gt;0$ lies between $0.7056$ and $0.8677$, which makes significant progress in a question raised by Aistleitner, Technau, and Zafeiropoulos. We also show that the set of such $\alpha$ is invariant under the Gauss map $T$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10870v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an odd prime $p$ and an unramified maximal torus $H $ of $\mathrm{GL}_{2/\mathbf{Q}_p}$, inspired by work of Loeffler-Skinner-Zerbes, we construct natural $H(\mathbf{Q}_p)$-stable lattices in spaces of functions on $\left(\mathrm{GL}_2\times H\right)(\mathbf{Q}_p)$ and positively answer a conjecture of Loeffler. These local lattices give rise to canonical Hecke operators in local spherical Hecke algebras, that enjoy certain integrality properties away from $p$, with respect to equivariant maps into any smooth $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbf{Q}_p)$-representation. In the process, we also obtain integral results on $H$-invariant periods for local unramified Whittaker type representations, and global automorphic representations attached to cuspidal Hecke eigenforms.</description>

Abstract: Recent work of the author established dual representation theorems for certain vector spaces that arise in an important article of Allcock and Vaaler. These results constructed an object called a consistent map which acts like a measure on the set of places of $\bar{\mathbb Q}$, but is not a Borel measure on this space. We describe the appropriate ring of sets $\mathcal R$ for which every consistent map arises from a measure on $\mathcal R$. We further obtain the conditions under which a consistent map may be extended to a measure on the smallest algebra containing $\mathcal R$.</description>

      <title>A conjecture of Zhi-Wei Sun on matrices concerning multiplicative subgroups of finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent work of Zhi-Wei Sun on determinants involving the Legendre symbol, in this paper, we study some matrices concerning subgroups of finite fields.
  For example, let $q\equiv 3\pmod 4$ be an odd prime power and let $\phi$ be the unique quadratic multiplicative character of the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. If set $\{s_1,\cdots,s_{(q-1)/2}\}=\{x^2:\ x\in\mathbb{F}_q\setminus\{0\}\}$, then we prove that
  $$\det\left[t+\phi(s_i+s_j)+\phi(s_i-s_j)\right]_{1\le i,j\le (q-1)/2}=\left(\frac{q-1}{2}t-1\right)q^{\frac{q-3}{4}}.$$
  This confirms a conjecture of Zhi-Wei Sun.</description>

      <title>On the Paley RIP and Paley graph extractor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constructing explicit RIP matrices is an open problem in compressed sensing theory. In particular, it is quite challenging to construct explicit RIP matrices that break the square-root bottleneck. On the other hand, providing explicit $2$-source extractors is a fundamental problem in theoretical computer science, cryptography and combinatorics. Nowadays, there are only a few known constructions for explicit $2$-source extractors (with negligible errors) that break the half barrier for min-entropy.
  In this paper, we establish a new connection between RIP matrices breaking the square-root bottleneck and $2$-source extractors breaking the half barrier for min-entropy. Here we focus on an RIP matrix (called the Paley ETF) and a $2$-source extractor (called the Paley graph extractor), where both are defined from quadratic residues over the finite field of odd prime order $p\equiv 1 \pmod{4}$. As a main result, we prove that if the Paley ETF breaks the square-root bottleneck, then the Paley graph extractor breaks the half barrier for min-entropy as well. Since it is widely believed that the Paley ETF breaks the square-root bottleneck, our result accordingly provides a new affirmative intuition on the conjecture for the Paley graph extractor by Benny Chor and Oded Goldreich.</description>
