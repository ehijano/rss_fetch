      <title>Atomic Column Generation For Consensus Between Algorithms: Application to Path Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real-life applications, most optimization problems are variants of well-known combinatorial optimization problems, including additional constraints to fit with a particular use case. Usually, efficient algorithms to handle a restricted subset of these additional constraints already exist, or can be easily derived, but combining them together is difficult. The goal of our paper is to provide a framework that allows merging several so-called atomic algorithms to solve an optimization problem including all associated additional constraints together. The core proposal, referred to as Atomic Column Generation (ACG) and derived from Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition, allows converging to an optimal global solution with any kind of atomic algorithms. We show that this decomposition improves the continuous relaxation and describe the associated Branch-and-Price algorithm. We consider a specific use case in telecommunication networks where several Path Computation Elements (PCE) are combined as atomic algorithms to route traffic. We demonstrate the efficiency of ACG on the resource-constrained shortest path problem associated with each PCE and show that it remains competitive with benchmark algorithms.</description>

      <title>Subtree Distances, Tight Spans and Diversities</title>

Abstract: Metric embeddings are central to metric theory and its applications. Here we consider embeddings of a different sort: maps from a set to subsets of a metric space so that distances between points are approximated by minimal distances between subsets. Our main result is a characterization of when a set of distances $d(x,y)$ between elements in a set $X$ have a subtree representation, a real tree $T$ and a collection $\{S_x\}_{x \in X}$ of subtrees of~$T$ such that $d(x,y)$ equals the length of the shortest path in~$T$ from a point in $S_x$ to a point in $S_y$ for all $x,y \in X$. The characterization was first established for {\em finite} $X$ by Hirai (2006) using a tight span construction defined for distance spaces, metric spaces without the triangle inequality. To extend Hirai's result beyond finite $X$ we establish fundamental results of tight span theory for general distance spaces, including the surprising observation that the tight span of a distance space is hyperconvex. We apply the results to obtain the first characterization of when a diversity -- a generalization of a metric space which assigns values to all finite subsets of $X$, not just to pairs -- has a tight span which is tree-like.</description>

      <title>A Polynomial-Time Algorithm for EFX Orientations of Chores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of finding EFX orientations of graphs of chores, in which each vertex corresponds to an agent, each edge corresponds to a chore, and a chore has zero marginal utility to an agent if its corresponding edge is not incident to the vertex corresponding to the agent. Recently, Zhou~et~al.~(IJCAI,~2024) analyzed the complexity of deciding whether graphs containing a mixture of goods and chores admit EFX orientations, and conjectured that deciding whether graphs containing only chores admit EFX orientations is NP-complete. In this paper, we resolve this conjecture by exhibiting a polynomial-time algorithm that finds an EFX orientation of a graph containing only chores if one exists, even if the graph contains self-loops. Remarkably, our first result demonstrates a surprising separation between the case of goods and the case of chores, because deciding whether graphs containing only goods admit EFX orientations of goods was shown to be NP-complete by Christodoulou et al.~(EC,~2023). In addition, we show the analogous decision problem for multigraphs to be NP-complete.</description>

      <title>Network Centrality as a New Perspective on Microservice Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Over the past decade, the adoption of Microservice Architecture (MSA) has led to the identification of various patterns and anti-patterns, such as Nano/Mega/Hub services. Detecting these anti-patterns often involves modeling the system as a Service Dependency Graph (SDG) and applying graph-theoretic approaches. Aim: While previous research has explored software metrics (SMs) such as size, complexity, and quality for assessing MSAs, the potential of graph-specific metrics like network centrality remains largely unexplored. This study investigates whether centrality metrics (CMs) can provide new insights into MSA quality and facilitate the detection of architectural anti-patterns, complementing or extending traditional SMs. Method: We analyzed 24 open-source MSA projects, reconstructing their architectures to study 53 microservices. We measured SMs and CMs for each microservice and tested their correlation to determine the relationship between these metric types. Results and Conclusion: Among 902 computed metric correlations, we found weak to moderate correlation in 282 cases. These findings suggest that centrality metrics offer a novel perspective for understanding MSA properties. Specifically, ratio-based centrality metrics show promise for detecting specific anti-patterns, while subgraph centrality needs further investigation for its applicability in architectural assessments.</description>

      <title>The r-Dynamic Chromatic Number is Bounded in the Strong 2-Coloring Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A proper vertex-coloring of a graph is $r$-dynamic if the neighbors of each vertex $v$ receive at least $\min(r, \mathrm{deg}(v))$ different colors. In this note, we prove that if $G$ has a strong $2$-coloring number at most $k$, then $G$ admits an $r$-dynamic coloring with no more than $(k-1)r+1$ colors. As a consequence, for every class of graphs of bounded expansion, the $r$-dynamic chromatic number is bounded by a linear function in $r$. We give a concrete upper bound for graphs of bounded row-treewidth, which includes for example all planar graphs.</description>

      <title>On total transitivity of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G=(V, E)$ be a graph where $V$ and $E$ are the vertex and edge sets, respectively. For two disjoint subsets $A$ and $B$ of $V$, we say $A$ \emph{dominates} $B$ if every vertex of $B$ is adjacent to at least one vertex of $A$. A vertex partition $\pi = \{V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_k\}$ of $G$ is called a \emph{transitive partition} of size $k$ if $V_i$ dominates $V_j$ for all $1\leq i&lt;j\leq k$. In this article, we study a variation of transitive partition, namely \emph{total transitive partition}. The total transitivity $Tr_t(G)$ is equal to the maximum order of a vertex partition $\pi = \{V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_k\}$ of $G$ obtained by repeatedly removing a total dominating set from $G$, until no vertices remain. Thus, $V_1$ is a total dominating set of $G$, $V_2$ is a total dominating set of the graph $G_1=G-V_1$, and, in general, $V_{i+1}$ is a total dominating set in the graph $G_i=G-\bigcup_{j=1}^i V_i$. A vertex partition of order $Tr_t(G)$ is called $Tr_t$-partition. The \textsc{Maximum Total Transitivity Problem} is to find a total transitive partition of a given graph with the maximum number of parts. First, we characterize split graphs with total transitivity equal to $1$ and $\omega(G)-1$. Moreover, for the split graph $G$ and $1\leq p\leq \omega(G)-1$, we give some necessary conditions for $Tr_t(G)=p$. Furthermore, we show that the decision version of this problem is NP-complete for bipartite graphs. On the positive side, we design a polynomial-time algorithm to solve \textsc{Maximum Total Transitivity Problem} in trees.</description>

      <title>On Supportedness in Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses an inconsistency in various definitions of supported non-dominated points within multi-objective combinatorial problems (MOCO). MOCO problems are known to contain supported and unsupported non-dominated points, with the latter typically outnumbering the former. Supported points are, in general, easier to determine, can serve as representations, and are used in two-phase methods to generate the entire non-dominated point set. Despite their importance, several different characterizations for supported efficient solutions (and supported non-dominated points) are used in the literature.
  While these definitions are equivalent for multi-objective linear problems, they can yield different sets of supported non-dominated points for MOCO problems. We show by an example that these definitions are not equivalent for MOCO or general multi-objective optimization problems. Moreover, we analyze the structural and computational properties of the resulting sets of supported non-dominated points. These considerations motivate us to summarize equivalent definitions and characterizations for supported efficient solutions and to introduce a distinction between supported and weakly supported efficient solutions.</description>

      <title>Forbidden Induced Subgraphs for Bounded Shrub-Depth and the Expressive Power of MSO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The graph parameter shrub-depth is a dense analog of tree-depth. We characterize classes of bounded shrub-depth by forbidden induced subgraphs. The obstructions are well-controlled flips of large half-graphs and of disjoint unions of many long paths. Applying this characterization, we show that on every hereditary class of unbounded shrub-depth, MSO is more expressive than FO. This confirms a conjecture of [Gajarsk\'y and Hlin\v{e}n\'y; LMCS 2015] who proved that on classes of bounded shrub-depth FO and MSO have the same expressive power. Combined, the two results fully characterize the hereditary classes on which FO and MSO coincide, answering an open question by [Elberfeld, Grohe, and Tantau; LICS 2012].
  Our work is inspired by the notion of stability from model theory. A graph class C is MSO-stable, if no MSO-formula can define arbitrarily long linear orders in graphs from C. We show that a hereditary graph class is MSO-stable if and only if it has bounded shrub-depth. As a key ingredient, we prove that every hereditary class of unbounded shrub-depth FO-interprets the class of all paths. This improves upon a result of [Ossona de Mendez, Pilipczuk, and Siebertz; Eur. J. Comb. 2025] who showed the same statement for FO-transductions instead of FO-interpretations.</description>

      <title>Graphs with no long claws: An improved bound for the analog of the Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s' path argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a fixed integer $t \geq 1$, a ($t$-)long claw, denoted $S_{t,t,t}$, is the unique tree with three leaves, each at distance exactly $t$ from the vertex of degree three. Majewski et al. [ICALP 2022, ACM ToCT 2024] proved an analog of the Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s' path argument for $S_{t,t,t}$-free graphs: given an $n$-vertex $S_{t,t,t}$-free graph, one can delete neighborhoods of $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ vertices so that the remainder admits an extended strip decomposition (an appropriate generalization of partition into connected components) into particles of multiplicatively smaller size. This statement has proven to be very useful in designing quasi-polynomial time algorithms for Maximum Weight Independent Set and related problems in $S_{t,t,t}$-free graphs.
  In this work, we refine the argument of Majewski et al. and show that a constant number of neighborhoods suffice.</description>

      <title>Simplifying and Characterizing DAGs and Phylogenetic Networks via Least Common Ancestor Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00708v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rooted phylogenetic networks, or more generally, directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), are widely used to model species or gene relationships that traditional rooted trees cannot fully capture, especially in the presence of reticulate processes or horizontal gene transfers. Such networks or DAGs are typically inferred from observable data (e.g. genomic sequences of extant species), providing only an estimate of the true evolutionary history. However, these inferred DAGs are often complex and difficult to interpret. In particular, many contain vertices that do not serve as least common ancestors (LCAs) for any subset of the underlying genes or species, thus may lack direct support from the observable data. In contrast, LCA vertices are witnessed by historical traces justifying their existence and thus represent ancestral states substantiated by the data. To reduce unnecessary complexity and eliminate unsupported vertices, we aim to simplify a DAG to retain only LCA vertices while preserving essential evolutionary information.
  In this paper, we characterize $\mathrm{LCA}$-relevant and $\mathrm{lca}$-relevant DAGs, defined as those in which every vertex serves as an LCA (or unique LCA) for some subset of taxa. We introduce methods to identify LCAs in DAGs and efficiently transform any DAG into an $\mathrm{LCA}$-relevant or $\mathrm{lca}$-relevant one while preserving key structural properties of the original DAG or network. This transformation is achieved using a simple operator ``$\ominus$'' that mimics vertex suppression.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Algorithm for Permutation Iteration Using a Singly Linked List</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for iterating over all permutations of a sequence. The algorithm leverages elementary $O(1)$ operations on recursive lists. As a result, no new nodes are allocated during the computation. Instead, all elements are rearranged within the original nodes of the singly linked list throughout the process. While permutations are generated in an unusual order, the transitions between consecutive permutations remain smooth. A proof of concept written in the Lisp programming language is proposed and discussed.</description>
