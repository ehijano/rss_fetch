      <title>Collective Behavior of AI Agents: the Case of Moltbook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a large scale data analysis of Moltbook, a Reddit-style social media platform exclusively populated by AI agents. Analyzing over 369,000 posts and 3.0 million comments from approximately 46,000 active agents, we find that AI collective behavior exhibits many of the same statistical regularities observed in human online communities: heavy-tailed distributions of activity, power-law scaling of popularity metrics, and temporal decay patterns consistent with limited attention dynamics. However, we also identify key differences, including a sublinear relationship between upvotes and discussion size that contrasts with human behavior. These findings suggest that, while individual AI agents may differ fundamentally from humans, their emergent collective dynamics share structural similarities with human social systems.</description>

      <title>Structure-aware imitation dynamics on higher-order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation is a basic updating mechanism for strategy evolution in structured populations, determining how individuals sample social information and translate it into behavioral changes. Higher-order networks, such as hypergraphs, generalize pairwise links to hyperedges and provide a natural representation of group interactions. Yet existing studies on higher-order networks largely emphasize structural effects, while the impact of imitation-based update rules and how they interact with group structures remains poorly understood. Here, we introduce a class of structure-aware imitation rules on hypergraphs that explicitly parameterize how many groups are sampled and how many peers are consulted within each sampled group. Under weak selection, we derive an analytical condition for the success of cooperation for any multiplayer social dilemmas on homogeneous hypergraphs. This analysis yields an interpretable metric, information diversity, which quantifies how an update rule diversifies the sources of social information across groups. Analytical predictions and numerical simulations show that cooperation is more effectively promoted by update rules that induce higher information diversity for three representative dilemmas. Further simulations demonstrate that this principle extends to non-homogeneous hypergraphs and a broad class of multiplayer social dilemmas. Our work thus provides a unifying metric that links microscopic updating to evolutionary outcomes in higher-order networked systems and establishes a general design principle for promoting cooperation beyond pairwise interactions.</description>

      <title>Impact of Market Reforms on Deterministic Frequency Deviations in the European Power Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deterministic frequency deviations (DFDs) are systematic and predictable excursions of grid frequency that arise from synchronized generation ramps induced by electricity market scheduling. In this paper, we analyze the impact of the European day-ahead market reform of 1 October 2025, which replaced hourly trading blocks with quarter-hourly blocks, on DFDs in the Central European synchronous area. Using publicly available frequency measurements, we compare periods before and after the reform based on daily frequency profiles, indicators characterizing frequency deviations, principal component analysis, Fourier-based functional data analysis, and power spectral density analysis. We show that the reform substantially reduces characteristic hourly frequency deviations and suppresses dominant spectral components at hourly and half-hourly time scales, while quarter-hourly structures gain relative importance. While the likelihood of large frequency deviations decreases overall, reductions for extreme events are less clear and depend on the metric used. Our results demonstrate that market design reforms can effectively mitigate systematic frequency deviations, but also highlight that complementary technical and regulatory measures are required to further reduce large frequency excursions in low-inertia power systems.</description>

      <title>Topology and higher-order global synchronization on directed and hollow simplicial and cell complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order networks encode the many-body interactions of complex systems ranging from the brain to biological transportation networks. Simplicial and cell complexes are ideal higher-order network representations for investigating higher-order topological dynamics where dynamical variables are not only associated with nodes, but also with edges, triangles, and higher-order simplices and cells. Global Topological Synchronization (GTS) refers to the dynamical state in which identical oscillators associated with higher-dimensional simplices and cells oscillate in unison. On standard unweighted and undirected complexes this dynamical state can be achieved only under strict topological and combinatorial conditions on the underlying discrete support. In this work we consider generalized higher-order network representations including directed and hollow complexes. Based on an in depth investigation of their topology defined by their associated algebraic topology operators and Betti numbers, we determine under which conditions GTS can be observed. We show that directed complexes always admit a global topological synchronization state independently of their topology and structure. However, we demonstrate that for directed complexes this dynamical state cannot be asymptotically stable. While hollow complexes require more stringent topological conditions to sustain global topological synchronization, these topologies can favor both the existence and the stability of global topological synchronization with respect to undirected and unweighted complexes.</description>

      <title>Symmetric preferences, asymmetric outcomes: Tipping dynamics in an open-city segregation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schelling's model of segregation demonstrates that even in the absence of social or governmental interventions, individuals with mild in-group preferences can self-organize into strongly segregated neighborhoods. Many variants of this celebrated model have been proposed by assuming agents tend to increase their satisfaction. Complementary to this traditional, utility-based approach, we model residential moves using satisfaction-independent reaction rates in a spatially extended chemical reaction network. The resulting model exhibits a counter-intuitive phenomenon: despite symmetric in-group preferences, the system undergoes a tipping transition at a critical preference level, beyond which one agent type dominates. We characterize this asymmetric phase transition in details using mean-field analysis, numerical simulations and finite size scaling methods. We find that while the transition shares key features with the Ising universality class, such as $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking and similar exponent ratios, the full set of critical exponents does not match any known universality class.</description>

      <title>Importance inversion transfer identifies shared principles for cross-domain learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capacity to transfer knowledge across scientific domains relies on shared organizational principles. However, existing transfer-learning methodologies often fail to bridge radically heterogeneous systems, particularly under severe data scarcity or stochastic noise. This study formalizes Explainable Cross-Domain Transfer Learning (X-CDTL), a framework unifying network science and explainable artificial intelligence to identify structural invariants that generalize across biological, linguistic, molecular, and social networks. By introducing the Importance Inversion Transfer (IIT) mechanism, the framework prioritizes domain-invariant structural anchors over idiosyncratic, highly discriminative features. In anomaly detection tasks, models guided by these principles achieve significant performance gains - exhibiting a 56\% relative improvement in decision stability under extreme noise - over traditional baselines. These results provide evidence for a shared organizational signature across heterogeneous domains, establishing a principled paradigm for cross-disciplinary knowledge propagation. By shifting from opaque latent representations to explicit structural laws, this work advances machine learning as a robust engine for scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Pedestrian Dynamics Models for Common Scenarios: An Evaluation of Force-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extensive research in pedestrian dynamics has primarily focused on crowded conditions and associated phenomena, such as lane formation, evacuation, etc. Several force-based models have been developed to predict the behavior in these situations. In contrast, there is a notable gap in terms of investigations of the moderate-to-low density situations. These scenarios are extremely commonplace across the world, including the highly populated nations like India. Additionally, the details of force-based models are expected to show significant effects at these densities, whereas the crowded, nearly packed, conditions may be expected to be governed largely by contact forces. In this study, we address this gap and comprehensively evaluate the performance of different force-based models in some common scenarios. Towards this, we perform controlled experiments in four situations: avoiding a stationary obstacle, position-swapping by walking toward each other, overtaking to reach a common goal, and navigating through a maze of obstacles. The performance evaluation consists of two stages and six evaluating parameters - successful trajectories, overlapping proportion, oscillation strength, path smoothness, speed deviation, and travel time. Firstly, models must meet an eligibility criterion of at least 80\% successful trajectories and secondly, the models are scored based on the cutoff values established from the experimental data. We evaluated five force-based models where the best one scored 57.14\%. Thus, our findings reveal significant shortcomings in the ability of these models to yield accurate predictions of pedestrian dynamics in these common situations.</description>

      <title>Optimal ambition in business, politics and life</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10500v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In business, politics and life, folk wisdom encourages people to aim for above-average results, but to not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Here, we mathematically formalize and extend this folk wisdom. We model a time-limited search for strategies having uncertain rewards. At each time step, the searcher either is satisfied with their current reward or continues searching. We prove that the optimal satisfaction threshold is both finite and strictly larger than the mean of available rewards -- matching the folk wisdom. This result is robust to search costs, unless they are high enough to prohibit all search. We show that being too ambitious has a higher expected cost than being too cautious. We show that the optimal satisfaction threshold increases if the search time is longer, or if the reward distribution is rugged (i.e., has low autocorrelation) or left-skewed. The skewness result reveals counterintuitive contrasts between optimal ambition and optimal risk taking. We show that using upward social comparison to assess the reward landscape substantially harms expected performance. We show how these insights can be applied qualitatively to real-world settings, using examples from entrepreneurship, economic policy, political campaigns, online dating and college admissions. We discuss implications of several possible extensions of our model, including intelligent search, reward landscape uncertainty and risk aversion.</description>

      <title>Relationship between household attributes and contact patterns in urban and rural South Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Households play a crucial role in the propagation of infectious diseases due to the frequent and prolonged interactions that typically occur between their members. Recent studies have emphasized the need to include socioeconomic variables in epidemic models to account for the heterogeneity induced by human behavior. While sub-Saharan Africa suffers the highest burden of infectious disease diffusion, few studies have investigated the mixing patterns in the countries and their relation with social indicators. This work analyzes household contact matrices measured with wearable proximity sensors in a rural and an urban village in South Africa. Leveraging a rich data collection describing additional individual and household attributes, we investigate how the household contact matrix varies according to the household type (whether it is composed only of a familiar nucleus or by a larger group), the gender of its head (the primary decision-maker), the rural or urban context, and the season in which it was measured. We show the household type and the gender of its head induce differences in the interaction patterns between household members, particularly regarding child caregiving, suggesting they are relevant attributes to include in epidemic modeling.</description>

      <title>Modelling Pedestrian Behaviour in Autonomous Vehicle Encounters Using Naturalistic Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how pedestrians adjust their movement when interacting with autonomous vehicles (AVs) is essential for improving safety in mixed traffic. This study examines micro-level pedestrian behaviour during midblock encounters in the NuScenes dataset using a hybrid discrete choice-machine learning framework based on the Residual Logit (ResLogit) model. The model incorporates temporal, spatial, kinematic, and perceptual indicators. These include relative speed, visual looming, remaining distance, and directional collision risk proximity (CRP) measures. Results suggest that some of these variables may meaningfully influence movement adjustments, although predictive performance remains moderate. Marginal effects and elasticities indicate strong directional asymmetries in risk perception, with frontal and rear CRP showing opposite influences. The remaining distance exhibits a possible mid-crossing threshold. Relative speed cues appear to have a comparatively less effect. These patterns may reflect multiple behavioural tendencies driven by both risk perception and movement efficiency.</description>

      <title>Public goods games on any population structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the emergence of cooperation in social networks has advanced through pairwise interactions, but the corresponding theory for group-based public goods games (PGGs) remains less explored. Here, we provide theoretical conditions under which cooperation thrives in PGGs on arbitrary population structures, which are accurate under weak selection. We find that a class of networks that would otherwise fail to produce cooperation, such as star graphs, are particularly conducive to cooperation in PGGs. More generally, PGGs can support cooperation on almost all networks, which is robust across all kinds of model details. This fundamental advantage of PGGs derives from self-reciprocity realized by group separations and from clustering through second-order interactions. We also apply PGGs to empirical networks, which shows that PGGs could be a promising interaction mode for the emergence of cooperation in real-world systems.</description>
