      <title>Fast computation of the statistical significance test for spatio-temporal receptive field estimates obtained using spike-triggered averaging of binary pseudo-random sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Spatio-temporal receptive fields (STRF) of visual neurons are often estimated using spike-triggered averaging of binary pseudo-random stimulus sequences. The stimuli are visual displays that contain black and white pixels that flicker randomly at a fixed frame rate without any spatial or temporal correlation. The spike train of a visual neuron, such as a retinal ganglion cell, is recorded simultaneously with the stimulus presentation. The neuron's STRF is estimated by averaging the stimulus frames that coincide with spikes at fixed latencies. Recently, an exact analytical method for determining the statistical significance of the estimated value of the STRF pixels has been developed. Application of the method on spike trains collected from individual mouse retinal ganglion cells revealed that the time required to compute the test ranged from a couple of minutes to half a day for different neurons. New method: Here, this method is accelerated by using the Normal approximation to the null distribution of STRF pixel estimates. Results: The significance threshold and computation time obtained under the approximate distribution are examined systematically as a function of various input spike trains collected from individual mouse retinal ganglion cells. Comparison with existing methods: The accuracy and the time saved by the use of the approximate distribution are examined in comparison with the exact distribution. Conclusions: For the real data analyzed here, the approximate distribution yields the same significance thresholds as the exact distribution within a much shorter computation time.</description>

      <title>Assessing the properties of the prediction interval in random-effects meta-analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random effects meta-analysis is a widely applied methodology to synthetize research findings of studies in a specific scientific question. Besides estimating the mean effect, an important aim of the meta-analysis is to summarize the heterogeneity, i.e. the variation in the underlying effects caused by the differences in study circumstances. The prediction interval is frequently used for this purpose: a 95% prediction interval contains the true effect of a similar new study in 95% of the cases when it is constructed, or in other words, it covers 95% of the true effects distribution on average. In this article, after providing a clear mathematical background, we present an extensive simulation investigating the performance of all frequentist prediction interval methods published to date. The work focuses on the distribution of the coverage probabilities and how these distributions change depending on the amount of heterogeneity and the number of involved studies. Although the single requirement that a prediction interval has to fulfill is to keep a nominal coverage probability on average, we demonstrate why the distribution of coverages cannot be disregarded, and that for small number of studies no reliable conclusion can be drawn from the prediction interval. We argue that assessing only the mean coverage can easily lead to misunderstanding and misinterpretation. The length of the intervals and the robustness of the methods concerning non-normality of the true effects are also investigated.</description>

      <title>MicroBundlePillarTrack: A Python package for automated segmentation, tracking, and analysis of pillar deflection in cardiac microbundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Movies of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived engineered cardiac tissue (microbundles) contain abundant information about structural and functional maturity. However, extracting these data in a reproducible and high-throughput manner remains a major challenge. Furthermore, it is not straightforward to make direct quantitative comparisons across the multiple in vitro experimental platforms employed to fabricate these tissues. Here, we present "MicroBundlePillarTrack," an open-source optical flow-based package developed in Python to track the deflection of pillars in cardiac microbundles grown on experimental platforms with two different pillar designs ("Type 1" and "Type 2" design). Our software is able to automatically segment the pillars, track their displacements, and output time-dependent metrics for contractility analysis, including beating amplitude and rate, contractile force, and tissue stress. Because this software is fully automated, it will allow for both faster and more reproducible analyses of larger datasets and it will enable more reliable cross-platform comparisons as compared to existing approaches that require manual steps and are tailored to a specific experimental platform. To complement this open-source software, we share a dataset of 1,540 brightfield example movies on which we have tested our software. Through sharing this data and software, our goal is to directly enable quantitative comparisons across labs, and facilitate future collective progress via the biomedical engineering open-source data and software ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning: a Heuristic Three-stage Mechanism for Grid Searches to Optimize the Future Risk Prediction of Breast Cancer Metastasis Using EHR-based Clinical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A grid search, at the cost of training and testing a large number of models, is an effective way to optimize the prediction performance of deep learning models. A challenging task concerning grid search is the time management. Without a good time management scheme, a grid search can easily be set off as a mission that will not finish in our lifetime. In this study, we introduce a heuristic three-stage mechanism for managing the running time of low-budget grid searches, and the sweet-spot grid search (SSGS) and randomized grid search (RGS) strategies for improving model prediction performance, in predicting the 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year risk of breast cancer metastasis. We develop deep feedforward neural network (DFNN) models and optimize them through grid searches. We conduct eight cycles of grid searches by applying our three-stage mechanism and SSGS and RGS strategies. We conduct various SHAP analyses including unique ones that interpret the importance of the DFNN-model hyperparameters. Our results show that grid search can greatly improve model prediction. The grid searches we conducted improved the risk prediction of 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year breast cancer metastasis by 18.6%, 16.3%, and 17.3% respectively, over the average performance of all corresponding models we trained using the RGS strategy. We not only demonstrate best model performance but also characterize grid searches from various aspects such as their capabilities of discovering decent models and the unit grid search time. The three-stage mechanism worked effectively. It made our low-budget grid searches feasible and manageable, and in the meantime helped improve model prediction performance. Our SHAP analyses identified both clinical risk factors important for the prediction of future risk of breast cancer metastasis, and DFNN-model hyperparameters important to the prediction of performance scores.</description>
