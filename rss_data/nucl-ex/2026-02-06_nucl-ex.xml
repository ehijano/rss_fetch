      <title>Westcott $g$ Factors Extended to Arbitrary Neutron Energy Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Westcott $g$ factors are used in Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) and Prompt Gamma-ray Activation Analysis (PGAA) to evaluate the impact of non-$1/v$ behavior in the neutron-capture cross sections of certain nuclei on activation product yields. This non-$1/v$ behavior arises from the presence of neutron resonances in the neutron-capture cross sections that overlap with the source neutron spectrum at low ($&lt;5$~eV) energies. Historically, Westcott $g$ factors that have been cataloged for NAA and PGAA applications are the result of calculations that assume a Maxwellian neutron velocity distribution with a given average temperature. In this study, we use this approach with updated neutron-capture cross sections from the Evaluated Nuclear Data File, version VIII.1 (ENDF/B-VIII.1) to tabulate Westcott $g$ factor values for a broad range of Maxwellian distribution temperatures, comparing the results against currently-available $g$ factors from International Atomic Energy Agency tables and other sources. It was discovered during this analysis that the use of guided thermal and cold-neutron beams at certain facilities necessitates an approach for evaluating Westcott $g$ factors based on arbitrary non-Maxwellian spectra. In this paper, we present an approach for calculating $g$ factors with user-specified neutron spectra, and we apply these methods to obtain Westcott $g$-factors for guided- and cold-neutron beams at the Budapest Research Reactor and the Forschungsreaktor M{\"u}nchen II reactor. Open-source software has been developed as part of this study that can be used to perform these calculations for applications in PGAA and NAA experiments</description>

      <title>Neglecting correlations leads to misestimated model errors in EFT predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian analyses of the convergence pattern of Effective Field Theories (EFTs) enable estimation of the uncertainty induced by a truncated expansion. When an EFT that has been calibrated to data is used to make a prediction this truncation uncertainty enters the posterior predictive distribution twice: directly from the finite-order calculation of the predicted quantity and indirectly through the posterior probability distributions of the EFT low-energy constants (LECs) determined by the calibration. In this work, we focus on the interplay of these two sources of uncertainty. We do this in the context of a toy EFT that we fit to pseudodata and use to make predictions. Direct EFT truncation uncertainty and LEC uncertainty are correlated in predictions when the predicted quantity is correlated with the observables used to fit the LECs. Here this results in the overall theoretical uncertainty in the EFT prediction being smaller than either the uncertainty induced by the truncation error or that stemming from the LECs alone.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic chemical potentials across the (hyper)nuclear landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite nuclei constrain the dense-matter equation of state (EOS), yet they are self-bound quantum droplets far from the thermodynamic limit. Motivated by an analogy to quantum dots, we show that the nuclear chart nevertheless defines a mesoscopic regime in which mesoscopic chemical-potential analogs $\{\mu_B,\mu_Q,\mu_S\}$ can be extracted directly from nuclear and hypernuclear binding energies after consistent Coulomb subtraction. These are discrete finite-difference response functions -- local slopes of the strong-interaction energy landscape -- not equilibrium grand-canonical chemical potentials. The nuclear chart itself supplies an "ensemble of nearby droplets": finite differences across neighboring nuclei suppress shell- and pairing-scale oscillations while retaining the smooth bulk trend, producing robust slopes without a macroscopic limit. Thus, the data provide empirical local derivatives that any strangeness-enabled EOS must reproduce near saturation. Mapping the measured (hyper)nuclear landscape at $T\simeq 0$, we find smooth, numerically stable responses, including a large, negative strangeness chemical-potential analog, and we identify specific hypernuclear measurements that can directly test and sharpen these EOS constraints.</description>

      <title>First Study of the Nuclear Response to Fast Hadrons via Angular Correlations between Pions and Slow Protons in Electron-Nucleus Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the first measurement of angular correlations between high-energy pions and slow protons in electron-nucleus ($eA$) scattering, providing a new probe of how a nucleus responds to a fast-moving quark. The experiment employed the CLAS detector with a 5-GeV electron beam incident on deuterium, carbon, iron, and lead targets. For heavier nuclei, the pion-proton correlation function is more spread-out in azimuth than for lighter ones, and this effect is more pronounced in the $\pi p$ channel than in earlier $\pi\pi$ studies. The proton-to-pion yield ratio likewise rises with nuclear mass, although the increase appears to saturate for the heaviest targets. These trends are qualitatively reproduced by state-of-the-art $eA$ event generators, including BeAGLE, eHIJING, and GiBUU, indicating that current descriptions of target fragmentation rest on sound theoretical footing. At the same time, the precision of our data exposes model-dependent discrepancies, delineating a clear path for future improvements in the treatment of cold-nuclear matter effects in $eA$ scattering.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks for 3D Characterisation of AGATA Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise localisation of gamma-ray interactions is crucial for the performance of the Advanced GAmma Tracking Array (AGATA). The Pulse Shape Analysis (PSA) method used for the position estimation of gamma-ray interactions relies on a simulated signal database. The Pulse Shape Comparison Scanning (PSCS) method was used to scan AGATA crystals in order to produce an experimental database of signals. This paper presents a novel approach using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to determine the 3D interaction position of gamma rays within AGATA crystals, trained on data from IPHC Strasbourg, allowing for the construction of an experimental database. A custom masked loss function is introduced to enable training with incomplete position information. The database generated by this new method outperforms the existing simulated database, and the experimental database obtained from the conventional PSCS algorithm.</description>

      <title>Beam test results of the Intermediate Silicon Tracker for sPHENIX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Intermediate Silicon Tracker (INTT), a two-layer barrel silicon strip tracker, is a key component of the tracking system for sPHENIX at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The INTT is designed to enable the association of reconstructed tracks with individual RHIC bunch crossings. To evaluate the performance of preproduction INTT ladders and the readout chain, a beam test was conducted at the Research Center for Accelerator and Radioisotope Science, Tohoku University, Japan. This paper presents the performance of the INTT evaluated through studies of the signal-to-noise ratio, residual distribution, spatial resolution, hit-detection efficiency, and multiple track reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Exclusive photoproduction of light and heavy vector mesons: thresholds to very high energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A reaction model for $\gamma + p \to V + p$, $V=\rho^0, \phi, J/\psi, \Upsilon$, which exposes the quark-antiquark content of the photon in making the transition $\gamma\to {q} \bar{q} + \mathbb P \to V$, where ${q}$ depends on $V$, and couples the intermediate ${q} \bar{q}$ system to the proton's valence quarks via Pomeron ($\mathbb P$) exchange, is used to deliver a unified description of available data -- both differential and total cross sections -- from near threshold to very high energies, $W$, for all the $V$-mesons. For the $\Upsilon$, this means $10\lesssim W/{\rm GeV} \lesssim 2\,000$. Also provided are predictions for the power-law exponents that are empirically used to characterise the large-$W$ behaviour of the total cross sections and slope parameters characterising the near-threshold differential cross sections. Appealing to notions of vector meson dominance, the latter have been interpreted as vector-meson--proton scattering lengths. The body of results indicate that it is premature to link any $\gamma + p \to V + p$ data with, for instance, in-proton gluon distributions, the quantum chromodynamics trace anomaly, or pentaquark production. Further developments in reaction theory and higher precision data are required before the validity of any such links can be assessed.</description>
