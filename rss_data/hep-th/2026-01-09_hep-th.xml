      <title>Chiral Lattice Gauge Theories from Symmetry Disentanglers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Hamiltonian framework for constructing chiral gauge theories on the lattice based on symmetry disentanglers: constant-depth circuits of local unitaries that transform not-on-site symmetries into on-site ones. When chiral symmetry can be realized not-on-site and such a disentangler exists, the symmetry can be implemented in a strictly local Hamiltonian and gauged by standard lattice methods. Using lattice rotor models, we realize this idea in 1+1 and 3+1 spacetime dimensions for $U(1)$ symmetries with mixed 't Hooft anomalies, and show that symmetry disentanglers can be constructed when anomalies cancel. As an example, we present an exactly solvable Hamiltonian lattice model of the (1+1)-dimensional "3450" chiral gauge theory, and we argue that a related construction applies to the $U(1)$ hypercharge symmetry of the Standard Model fermions in 3+1 dimensions. Our results open a new route toward fully local, nonperturbative formulations of chiral gauge theories.</description>

      <title>QFT as a set of ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlation functions of local operators in Quantum Field Theory (QFT) on hyperbolic space can be fully characterized by the set of QFT data $\lbrace \Delta_i,C_{ijk},b^{\hat{\mathcal{O}}}_j\rbrace$. These are the scaling dimensions of boundary operators $\Delta_i$, the boundary Operator Product Expansion (OPE) coefficients $C_{ijk}$ and the Boundary Operator Expansion (BOE) coefficients $b^{\hat{\mathcal{O}}}_j$ that characterize how each bulk operator $\hat{\mathcal{O}}$ can be expanded in terms of boundary operators $\mathcal{O}_j$.For simplicity, we focus on two dimensional QFTs and derive a universal set of first order Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) that encode the variation of the QFT data under an infinitesimal change of a bulk relevant coupling. In principle, our ODEs can be used to follow a Renormalization Group (RG) flow starting from a solvable QFT into a strongly coupled phase and to the flat space limit.</description>

      <title>Direct and Indirect Loop Equations in Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of Wilson loops is governed by an infinite set of Schwinger-Dyson equations and trace relations. In the context of the lattice positivity bootstrap, a central challenge is determining a dynamically independent basis of these operators within a truncated space. We present a systematic framework to solve this problem, utilizing a geometric plaquette-cut and subloop-cut strategy to efficiently generate all (local) direct equations. Furthermore, we identify and analyze ``indirect equations", which arise from the elimination of higher-length intermediate loops. We elucidate the origin of these subtle relations and propose a vertex-filtering strategy to construct them. Applying the above framework to SU(2) lattice Yang-Mills theory, we provide explicit counting of independent canonical loops and equations in 2, 3, and 4 dimensions, along with a statistical analysis of their asymptotic growth.</description>

      <title>Framing Anomaly in Lattice Chern-Simons-Maxwell Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Framing anomaly is a key property of $(2+1)d$ chiral topological orders, for it reveals that the chirality is an intrinsic bulk property of the system, rather than a property of the boundary between two systems. Understanding framing anomaly in lattice models is particularly interesting, as concrete, solvable lattice models of chiral topological orders are rare. In a recent work, we defined and solved the $U(1)$ Chern-Simons-Maxwell theory on spacetime lattice, showing its chiral edge mode and the associated gravitational anomaly on boundary. In this work, we show its framing anomaly in the absence of boundary, by computing the expectation of a lattice version of the modular $T$ operator in the ground subspace on a spatial torus, from which we extract that $\langle T \rangle$ has a universal phase of $-2\pi/12$ as expected: $-2\pi/8$ from the Gauss-Milgram sum of the topological spins of the ground states, and $2\pi/24$ from the framing anomaly; we can also extract the $2\pi/24$ framing anomaly phase alone from the full spectrum of $T$ in the ground subspace by computing $\langle T^m \rangle$. This pins down the last and most crucial property required for a valid lattice definition of $U(1)$ Chern-Simons theory.</description>

      <title>Dressing and Screening in Anti-de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a question of defining gauge-invariant observables in cosmology and by the close connection between perturbation theory in de Sitter (dS) and Anti-de Sitter (AdS), we study scalar electrodynamics in AdS in setups that are largely unexplored but relevant for dS physics. For photons with standard (Dirichlet) boundary conditions, we analyze charged scalars whose boundary conditions break the $U(1)$ symmetry. This leads to a nonstandard Higgs mechanism in which the gauge field acquires a one-loop mass without a classical vacuum expectation value. Using recent advances in perturbation theory in AdS, we compute this mass explicitly and evaluate charged-scalar four-point functions. We also provide an alternative derivation based on boundary Ward identities. For photons with alternate (Neumann) boundary conditions, where local charged operators are not gauge invariant, we construct physical observables by dressing charged fields with geodesic Wilson lines. These dressed operators have well-behaved conformal properties and unphysical photon modes decouple from their correlation functions. Explicit one-loop computations further reveal the decoupling of boundary field strengths, for which we provide a nonperturbative argument based on higher-form symmetry. Along the way, we explain the physical consequences of spontaneous breaking of higher-form symmetry in AdS, including the role of the tilt operator, the relation between one-form symmetry and endpoints of Wilson lines at the boundary, and a generalized-symmetry interpretation of conserved currents dual to bulk gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Multi-particle Celestial Operator Product Expansions from the Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In celestial holography, scattering particles in four-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes are dual to conformal primary field operators on the celestial sphere. Multi-particle celestial operators can be formed from regularized coincident limits of single-particle celestial operators. The singular terms in the operator product expansion of multi-particle operators are shown to be determined entirely by the singular terms in the operator product expansion between single-particle celestial operators, as expected in a standard conformal field theory. Boundary operator product expansions in celestial holography are known to be dual to subtle collinear limits of bulk scattering amplitudes. The multi-particle operator product expansions derived from standard conformal-field theoretic techniques are shown to reproduce precisely the results from the corresponding bulk collinear limits in tree-level Yang-Mills and Einstein gravity. Finally, the coefficients of multi-particle celestial operator product expansions are derived from a third complementary method that enforces bulk four-dimensional translational invariance as a global symmetry of the celestial dual. The results of all three methods agree precisely.</description>

      <title>Four-point function of the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model at finite chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that, for a range of chemical potentials, the infrared behavior of the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (cSYK) model is governed by a 1D Nearly Conformal Field Theory (NCFT$_{1}$), thereby realizing a continuous line of NCFTs. A finite chemical potential $\mu$ introduces an asymmetry parameter $\mathscr{E}$ into the cSYK fermion two-point function in the conformal limit. In this work, we compute the cSYK four-point function in the conformal limit for an arbitrary value of $\mathscr{E}$ at leading order in $1/N$. We show that the result is fully consistent with the NCFT$_{1}$ structure of the cSYK model and use it to extract the structure constants for correlation functions of two complex fermions with bilinear operators.</description>

      <title>Local gauge-invariant vector operators in the adjoint $SU(2)$ Higgs model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we scrutinize local gauge-invariant vector operators of dimension four in the adjoint $SU(2)$ Higgs model, which are candidates for interpolating fields of the fundamental excitations of the model due to the so-called FMS mechanism. We use the equations of motion and the properties of the BRST operator to derive a Ward identity that allows us to determine whether a given operator can propagate. To corroborate this analysis, we explicitly compute the two-point function of the non-propagating operator at the one-loop level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct singly and doubly spinning non-supersymmetric F1--P black ring solutions in five-dimensional supergravity. These black rings have regular horizons and non-zero temperature. The singly spinning configuration lies in the duality orbit of the black ring constructed by Elvang, Emparan, and Figueras, while the doubly spinning configuration is a charged extension of the black ring constructed by Chen, Hong, and Teo. We analyze the physical properties of these solutions and the various limits they admit. In particular, the doubly spinning solution admits an extremal limit in which the entropy satisfies the relation S= 2 \pi J_\phi, thereby linking it directly to the angular momentum on the S^2.</description>

      <title>Index saddle for supersymmetric F1-P black ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the index saddle for the supersymmetric F1--P black ring. Our construction proceeds by taking a supersymmetric limit of a non-supersymmetric doubly spinning F1--P black ring. We express the resulting saddle as a three-center Bena--Warner solution. The black ring saddle possesses a finite-area event horizon, yet the two-derivative index vanishes. The solution is singular on certain subspaces of the horizon, where higher-derivative corrections are expected to become important. We argue that, once such corrections are taken into account, the solution can yield a finite result. In particular, we present a scaling analysis showing that the index agrees with the microscopic result, up to an overall numerical constant that cannot be fixed by the scaling argument alone. This analysis applies only within a restricted region of parameter space, whose full significance is not yet fully understood.</description>

      <title>A four-dimensional conformal construction of Virasoro-Shapiro amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a four-dimensional conformal amplitude whose four-point structure matches the Virasoro-Shapiro form familiar from string theory. The construction uses only general principles of conformal field theory - radial quantization, scale invariance, and analyticity - and does not rely on worldsheet geometry or string degrees of freedom. The resulting object is a kinematical, first quantized amplitude defined by symmetry and consistency, providing a four-dimensional realization of stringlike analytic structure and a concrete target for amplitude bootstrap approaches.</description>

      <title>Probing Black Hole Thermal Effects in the Dual CFT via Wave Packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the gravitational effects of a black hole manifest themselves as thermal behavior in the dual finite-temperature conformal field theory (CFT). In the holographic framework of AdS/CFT, we analyze a wave packet propagating into a black hole geometry in the bulk by computing three-point functions of a scalar primary operator in the boundary CFT. Our setup captures thermal signatures such as exponential damping of the expectation value, which are absent at zero-temperature. This provides a concrete and analytically tractable example of how black hole physics can be probed from the CFT side.</description>

      <title>Applied foliated conformal Carroll symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the conformal compensating technique for constructing matter couplings to conformal scalars on a $D$-dimensional foliated conformal Carroll manifold dividing the tangent space into $(p+1)$-dimensional longitudinal and $(D-p-1)$-dimensional transversal directions corresponding to $p$-branes. We show that the conformal Carroll algebra that was used for particle-like foliated geometries with $p=0$ cannot be used for higher-dimensional objects, called $p$-branes, with $0 &lt; p \le D-2$. Furthermore, string-like foliated geometries are not suitable for the conformal compensating technique due to the conformal invariance in the longitudinal directions that is present for $p=1$. All other cases can be dealt with provided one uses a different conformal extension of the Carroll algebra that amounts to a conformal extension in the longitudinal directions only supplemented with an additional an-isotropic dilatation.
  By brane-duality similar results hold for foliated Galilean geometries which we present as well. Our results nicely fit in with recent work on foliated Aristotelian geometries.</description>

      <title>Entanglement negativity for a free scalar chiral current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the entanglement negativity for the free, scalar chiral current in two spacetime dimensions, which is a simple model violating the Haag duality in regions with nontrivial topology. For the ground state of the system, both on the line and on the circle, we consider the setups given by two intervals, either adjacent or disjoint. We find analytic expressions for the moments of the partial transpose of the reduced density matrix and the logarithmic negativity. In the limit of small separation distance, this expression yields the same subleading topological contribution occurring in the mutual information. In the limit of large separation distance between the two intervals, the exponential decay of the logarithmic negativity is obtained from its analytic expression. The analytic formulas are checked against exact numerical results from a bosonic lattice model, finding a perfect agreement. We observe that, since the chiral current generates the neutral subalgebra of the full chiral Dirac fermion theory, this analysis highlights how symmetries produce nontrivial features in the entanglement structure that are analogue to those ones already observed in the mutual information for regions with nontrivial topology.</description>

      <title>The dual twistor theory of self-dual black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Taub-NUT and Eguchi-Hanson gravitational instantons, along with the self-dual Plebanski-Demianski metric, form a set of Euclidean metrics which can naturally be called `self-dual black holes', as they arise from self-dual slices of the most general vacuum, asymptotically flat black hole metric. These self-dual black holes are of interest for many reasons, and can famously be described through the non-linear graviton construction of twistor theory. However, the implicit nature of this twistor description obscures some features of the underlying geometry, particularly for the most general self-dual black holes. In this paper, we give a new construction of all asymptotically flat self-dual black holes based on holomorphic quadrics in flat dual twistor space, rather than the usual twistor space associated with self-duality. Remarkably, the geometry of the self-dual black holes -- including their hyperkahler structure, as well as Kerr-Schild and Gibbons-Hawking forms -- is directly encoded in the corresponding quadric. As a consequence, we obtain a previously unknown single Kerr-Schild form of the self-dual Plebanski-Demianski metric.</description>

      <title>Extended Heun Hierarchy in Quantum Seiberg-Witten Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum geometry of the Seiberg-Witten curve for $\mathcal{N}=2$, $\mathrm{SU(2)}^n$ linear quiver gauge theories. By applying the Weyl quantization prescription to the algebraic curve, we derive the corresponding second-order differential equation and demonstrate that it is isomorphic to the Extended Heun Equation with $n+3$ regular singular points. The physical parameters of the gauge theory are linked to the canonical coefficients of the Heun equation via a polynomial representation of the Seiberg-Witten curve. This framework provides the necessary mathematical foundation to apply non-perturbative gauge-theoretic techniques, such as instanton counting, to spectral problems in gravitational physics, most notably for higher-dimensional black holes.</description>

      <title>Cat states and violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality in relativistic Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cat state localized in the right Rindler wedge is employed to study the violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality in a relativistic scalar free Quantum Field Theory. By means of the bounded Hermitian operator $sign(\varphi(f))$, where $\varphi(f)$ stands for the smeared scalar field, it turns out that the Bell-CHSH correlator can be evaluated in closed analytic form in terms of the imaginary error function. Being the superposition of two coherent states, cat states allow for the existence of interference terms which give rise to a violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality. As such, the present setup can be considered as an explicit realization of the results obtained by Summers-Werner.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative spaces as quantized constrained Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the strong-field limit of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field as a toy model for general covariant systems, establishing a novel connection between constrained Hamiltonian dynamics and noncommutative geometry. Starting from the action $S=\int d\tau \, \dot{x}^i A_i(x)$, which represents the holonomy of the particle's path with respect to the electromagnetic potential $A_i$, we analyze the resulting general covariant system with vanishing Hamiltonian. The equations of motion $F_{ij}\dot{x}^j=0$ confine the particle to leaves of a singular foliation defined by the field strength tensor $F_{ij}=\partial_i A_j -\partial_j A_i$. We show that the physical state space corresponds to the space of leaves of this foliation, with points connected by field lines being gauge equivalent. The Hamiltonian analysis reveals constraints $\kappa_i=p_i-A_i$ that are locally classified as first-class or second-class depending on the rank of the field strength tensor. Upon quantization, this leads to noncommuting coordinate operators, establishing the physical state space as a noncommutative geometry. We provide explicit examples and show in particular that the magnetic monopole field strength yields a fuzzy sphere.</description>

      <title>Spectator Composes a Gravitational Canon: Spectator-field-triggered Phase Transition During Inflation and its Anisotropic Gravitational Wave Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework in which a phase transition is triggered during cosmic inflation by the slow-roll dynamics of a spectator field. The topological defects formed at the transition are inflated outside the horizon, reenter it after inflation, and can subsequently generate characteristic gravitational-wave (GW) signals. Quantum fluctuations of the spectator field modulate the timing of the transition, imprinting large-scale anisotropies in the resulting GW background. As an explicit realization, the spectator field may be identified with the Higgs field in a supersymmetric Standard Model. More generally, our framework applies to a wide class of spectator-modulated phenomena, providing a generic mechanism for producing anisotropic GW signals.</description>

      <title>Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new tension is emerging between the tight cosmological upper bounds on the total neutrino mass ($\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.06 \, \rm{eV}$) and the lower limits from oscillation experiments, with potentially far-reaching implications for cosmology and particle physics. Neutrinos decaying into massless BSM particles with lifetimes $\tau_\nu \sim 0.01-1\, \rm{Gyr}$ represent a theoretically well-motivated mechanism to reconcile such measurements. Using DESI DR2 and CMB datasets, we show that such decays relax the bound on the total neutrino mass up to $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.23 \, \rm{eV}$ (95%), restoring full agreement with oscillation data. We also present the first late-time cosmological analysis of neutrino decays into lighter neutrinos in a manner consistent with the measured mass splittings. In contrast to the decays into massless BSM particles, we find that this scenario only marginally alleviates - or even tightens - the cosmological neutrino mass bounds, depending on the mass ordering.</description>

      <title>Future Rip Scenarios in Fractional Holographic Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the occurrence of late-time cosmological singularities, namely, the rip scenarios within the framework of interacting Fractional Holographic Dark Energy (FHDE). We start our investigation with the Granda-Oliveros (GO) cutoff, i.e., $L=(\gamma H^{2}+\delta\dot{H})^{-\frac{1}{2}}$, and highlight the range of allowed $\alpha$ (L\'evy's index) values for which big, little and pseudo rip can occur. In particular, we highlight the occurrence of a big rip for fractional values of the L\'evy's index in the allowed range $1&lt;\alpha\leq2$. Moreover, we conclude that the occurrence of a pseudo-rip requires L\'evy's index to be $\alpha&gt;2$. Therefore, we reject the possibility of pseudo-rip within the GO cutoff. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the occurrence of the little rip in FHDE equipped with a GO cutoff is rather contrived and requires a specific functional form of the IR cutoff $L\sim(\gamma H^{2}+g(H))^{-\frac{1}{2}}$, which belongs to a larger class of Nojiri-Odintsov (NO) cutoffs. To extend our perspective beyond the GO cutoff, we investigate the interacting FHDE framework equipped with the Hubble cutoff, i.e., $L=H^{-1}$, in developing an ansatz-based approach to the little and pseudo-rip singularities as they fail to appear in the GO cutoff. Within this approach, we invoke the expression of the Hubble parameter, $H(t)$, which corresponds to the little and pseudo-rip, into the cosmological parameters such as the Equation of State (EoS) and Squared Sound Speed (SSS) as a function of cosmic time $t$. We produce numerical plots of these parameters in both linear and non-linear $Q$ regimes, which supplement our theoretical findings. In summary, our results highlight the occurrence of little and pseudo-rip singularities within a Hubble cutoff for a non-linear $Q$ term within the FHDE framework.</description>

      <title>$S^\prime_4$ Quark Flavour Model in the Vicinity of the Fixed Point $\tau = i\infty$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study in the bottom-up framework the possibility to generate the quark mass hierarchies without fine-tuning, the quark mixing and CP-violation (CPV) in a flavour model with $S^\prime_4$ modular symmetry having minimal number of parameters. The model is considered in the vicinity of the fixed point $\tau_\text{T}= i\infty$, $\tau_\text{vev} \sim \tau_\text{T}$, $\tau_\text{vev}$ being the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the modulus $\tau$, which allows to explain the hierarchies of the quark masses. The ten quark observables are described by nine real parameters. The CP-symmetry is broken explicitly since, as is well known, reproducing the observed CPV in the quark sector in the case of spontaneous breaking of CP-symmetry by $\tau_\text{vev}$ is highly problematic in the class of minimal modular quark flavour models (explaining the quark mass hierarchies without fine-tuning) of the type we consider. We perform a statistical analysis of the model and show that it is phenomenologically viable and consistent, in particular, with the ``inclusive'' decay data on the $|V_{ub}|$ and $|V_{cb}|$ elements of the CKM matrix and, in the case of a very high scale of supersymmetry breaking, with the current ``average'' experimental values of $|V_{ub}|$ and $|V_{cb}|$.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Dynamics and Perturbations in Fractal Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study inflationary dynamics within the framework of fractal cosmology, where spacetime exhibits a non-integer effective dimension, sourced through a relaxation of the cosmological principle. Using Friedmann and continuity equations, modified by an effective fractal dimension $D$; we derive generalized slow-roll parameters and examine their evolution for cubic, Starobinsky and Natural inflationary potentials. We then formulate a fractal extension of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation by introducing an effective momentum term $k_{\text{eff}}$, arising from the fractal decomposition of the spatial Laplacian, that captures the geometric influence of fractal cosmology on scalar perturbations. This leads to corrections in the power spectrum and a scalar spectral index $n_s$ that depends explicitly on both the fractal dimension $D$ and a fractional scale $L$, which controls the strength of the fractal deformation. Comparison with the Planck 2018 data ($n_s=0.9649\pm 0.0042$) constrains the allowed range of $D$ ($2.7\lesssim D\lesssim3$) depending on the cosmological and inflationary model assumed.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Primoridal Black Hole Abundance with Space-Based Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Overdense regions can collapse into primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early universe, which are a compelling candidate for dark matter. Current constraints leave the asteroid-mass window the only possible one for PBH to account for all the dark matter, which can only be probed indirectly by the scalar-induced gravitational waves (GWs) sourced by the curvature perturbation which forms PBH. In this work, we explore the capabilities of future space-based gravitational wave detectors, including LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, to constrain such induced GWs as well as the PBH abundance. We systematically account for the width of the primordial curvature power spectrum, and find that the asteroid-mass window can be fully probed by all three space-based interferometers. If PBHs constitute the majority of dark matter, the induced GW leaves a strong signal in the mHz band with a signal-to-noise ratio of $10^3\sim10^4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boson stars have been extensively studied in classical gravity, but their quantum properties remain comparatively unexplored. In this paper, we compute the quantum scalar fields and stress tensor in boson star spacetimes within the framework of semiclassical gravity. Divergences are regularized using Pauli-Villars fields, and accurate numerical results are obtained through spectral methods. Employing coherent states enables a direct comparison between the classical part of the stress tensor and the quantum fluctuation. Our results indicate that strong spacetime curvature is the primary source of large quantum effects. The renormalized quantum energy density is mostly positive but the radial pressure is negative, suggesting that classical boson star solutions require modification once quantum effects are included. Moreover, in regimes of large curvature, the quantum fluctuations can constitute a significant fraction of the total stress tensor. The methods developed here can be generalized to other compact objects and used to study their response to quantum corrections.</description>

      <title>Non-Thermal Leptogenesis in the BLSM with Inverse Seesaw Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the viability of non-thermal leptogenesis in the gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the Standard Model (BLSM) with an inverse seesaw (ISS) mechanism for neutrino mass generation. In this framework, right-handed neutrinos typically have $\mathcal{O}(1)$ Yukawa couplings, which induce strong washout effects and render conventional thermal leptogenesis ineffective. We demonstrate that a successful baryogenesis scenario can nevertheless be realized through non-thermal leptogenesis, where right-handed neutrinos are produced from the decay of the heavy $B\!-\!L$ Higgs boson $\chi$. We explicitly analyze the interplay between the dilution factor $T_R/M_\chi$ and the washout parameter characteristic of the ISS, highlighting the tension between suppressing washout effects and maintaining sufficient reheating. We show that a viable lepton asymmetry can be generated provided the scalar mass spectrum is appropriately tuned, allowing for a reduced reheating temperature while keeping washout under control. The resulting lepton asymmetry is efficiently converted into the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe via sphaleron processes. Our results establish that the inverse-seesaw $B\!-\!L$ model remains a predictive and robust framework for non-thermal leptogenesis and baryogenesis.</description>

      <title>Towards a unified quantum field theory of dark energy and inflation: unstable de Sitter vacuum and running vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflation is a necessary cosmic mechanism to cure basic inconsistencies of the standard model of cosmology. These problems are usually `fixed' by postulating the existence of a scalar field (called the ``inflaton''). However, other less ad hoc options are possible. In the running vacuum model (RVM) framework, the vacuum energy density (VED) is a function of the Hubble rate $H$ and its time derivatives: $\rho_{\rm vac}=\rho_{\rm vac}(H, \dot{H},\ddot{H},\dots)$. In this context, the VED is dynamical (there is no rigid cosmological constant $\Lambda$). In the FLRW epoch, $\rho_{\rm vac}$ evolves very slowly with expansion, as befits the observed $\Lambda\simeq$const. behavior. In contrast, in the very early universe the vacuum fluctuations induce higher powers $H^N$ capable of unleashing fast inflation in a short period in which $H\simeq$ const. We call this mechanism `RVM-inflation'. It does not require an inflaton field since inflation is brought about by pure quantum field theory (QFT) effects on the dynamical background. It is different from Starobinsky's inflation, in which $H$ is never constant. In this work, we study a closely related scenario: the decay of the exact de Sitter vacuum into FLRW spacetime in its radiation epoch and the subsequent impact on the current universe, and compare with the RVM. We find that in both cases inflation is driven by $H^4$ powers together with subleading contributions of order $H^2$ that ease a graceful-exit transition into the radiation-dominated epoch, where the FLRW regime starts and ultimately develops a mildly evolving VED in the late universe: $\delta\rho_{\rm vac}\sim {\cal O}(m_{\rm Pl} ^2 H^2)$. The outcome is an unified QFT approach to inflation and dark energy (conceived as dynamical vacuum energy) with potentially measurable phenomenological consequences in the present universe which can help to cure the cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>Robust Reasoning as a Symmetry-Protected Topological Phase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models suffer from "hallucinations"-logical inconsistencies induced by semantic noise. We propose that current architectures operate in a "Metric Phase," where causal order is vulnerable to spontaneous symmetry breaking. Here, we identify robust inference as an effective Symmetry-Protected Topological phase, where logical operations are formally isomorphic to non-Abelian anyon braiding, replacing fragile geometric interpolation with robust topological invariants. Empirically, we demonstrate a sharp topological phase transition: while Transformers and RNNs exhibit gapless decay, our Holonomic Network reveals a macroscopic "mass gap," maintaining invariant fidelity below a critical noise threshold. Furthermore, in a variable-binding task on $S_{10}$ ($3.6 \times 10^6$ states) representing symbolic manipulation, we demonstrate holonomic generalization: the topological model maintains perfect fidelity extrapolating $100\times$ beyond training ($L=50 \to 5000$), consistent with a theoretically indefinite causal horizon, whereas Transformers lose logical coherence. Ablation studies indicate this protection emerges strictly from non-Abelian gauge symmetry. This provides strong evidence for a new universality class for logical reasoning, linking causal stability to the topology of the semantic manifold.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Operators and Their Algebraic Structures: A $3D$ Field-Theoretic System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10852v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the discrete as well as the continuous symmetry transformations for a three $(2+1)$-dimensional $(3D)$ combined system of the free Abelian 1-form and 2-form gauge theories within the framework of Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism and establish their relevance in the context of the algebraic structures that are obeyed by the de Rham cohomological operators of differential geometry. In fact, our present field-theoretic system respects six continuous symmetry transformations and a couple of very useful discrete duality symmetry transformations. Out of the above six continuous symmetry transformations four are off-shell nilpotent (i.e. fermionic) in nature and two are bosonic. The algebraic structures, obeyed by the symmetry operators, are reminiscent of the algebra satisfied by the de Rham cohomological operators. Hence, our present $3D$ field-theoretic system provides a perfect example for Hodge theory where there is convergence of ideas from the physical aspects of the BRST formalism and mathematical ingredients that are connected with the cohomological operators of differential geometry at the algebraic level. One of the highlights of our present investigation is the appearance of a pseudo-scalar field in our theory (on the symmetry ground alone) which carries the negative kinetic term. Thus, it is one of the possible candidates for the ``phantom" fields of the cyclic, bouncing and self-accelerated cosmological models of the Universe.</description>

In particular, we construct such a formulation for the $N=1$, $D=4$ supergravity by taking as a target space the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex of the super-Poincar\'e algebra which, as we demonstrate, admits an invariant presymplectic structure of degree $3$. This data encodes a full-scale Batalin-Vilkovisky formulation of the system, including a concise form of the BV master action. The important feature of (presymplectic) AKSZ models is that, at least at the level of equations of motion, they can be equivalently reformulated in the spacetime obtained by adding or eliminating contractible dimensions. For instance, the presymplectic AKSZ formulation of gravity can be lifted to the respective ``group manifold'', endowing it with the structure of a principle bundle and the Cartan connection therein, at least locally. In particular, the so-called rheonomy conditions emerge as a part of the presymplectic AKSZ equations of motion. The analogous considerations apply to supergravity and its uplift to superspace. We also study general presymplectic BV-AKSZ models related by adding or removing contractible spacetime dimensions in order to systematically relate the spacetime and superspace formulations of the same system within the AKSZ-like framework. These relations are then illustrated using the supersymmetric particle as a toy model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the building blocks of open and closed string amplitudes on $AdS$. These are given by two infinite towers of world-sheet integrals generalising the Euler and complex beta functions respectively. We show that the open and closed building blocks are related by an $AdS$ version of the KLT relations, whose Kernel can be computed exactly. We furthermore show that the building blocks for open string amplitudes are given by Aomoto-Gelfand hypergeometric functions, and give their closed form expression up to weight four.</description>

      <title>On the Asymptotic Nature of Cosmological Effective Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Much of our intuition about Effective Field Theories (EFTs) stems from their formulation in flat spacetime, yet EFTs have become indispensable tools in cosmology, where time-dependent backgrounds are the norm. In this work, we demonstrate that in spacetimes undergoing significant expansion-such as accelerated FLRW and de Sitter backgrounds-the contributions of operators with mass dimension $\Delta$ to physical observables grow factorially with $\Delta$ at fixed couplings. This behavior stands in stark contrast to static flat spacetime. As a result, the cosmological EFT expansion is generally asymptotic rather than convergent, even at tree level. To illustrate this phenomenon, we analyze simple toy models involving a massless or conformally coupled scalar field interacting with a heavy scalar with zero or infinite sound speed. We demonstrate that meaningful EFT predictions can still be extracted via appropriate resummation techniques, performed in both Fourier and Mellin-momentum space. In the infinite sound speed limit, where the heavy field is effectively non-dynamical, the resummed EFT reproduces the exact result of the full theory. In other cases, the EFT captures only the local part of the dynamics, omitting nonlocal terms, which are exponentially suppressed in the large-mass limit for the Bunch-Davies state. Our results provide detailed and quantitative expectations for more general cosmological EFTs.</description>

      <title>Redundancy Channels in the Conformal Bootstrap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05338v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A method for obstructing symmetry enhancement in numerical conformal bootstrap calculations is proposed. Symmetry enhancement refers to situations where bootstrap studies initialised with a certain symmetry end up allowing theories with higher symmetry. In such cases, it is shown that redundant operators in the less symmetric theory can descend from primary scaling operators of the more symmetric one, motivating the imposition of spectral gaps that are justified in the former but not the latter. The same mechanism can also be used to differentiate between decoupled and fully coupled theories which otherwise have the same global symmetry. A systematic understanding of this mechanism is developed and applied to distinguish the cubic from the $O(3)$ model in three dimensions, where a strip of disallowed parameter space, referred to as the cubic redundancy channel, emerges once a gap associated with a redundant operator of the cubic theory is imposed. The channel corresponds precisely to the region of parameter space where the assumed cubic symmetry would be enhanced to $O(3)$.</description>

Abstract: We obtain a three-dimensional bi-vector-tensor theory of the generalized Proca class by regularizing the Gauss-Bonnet invariant within the Weyl geometry. We show that the theory admits a regular AdS$_3$ black hole solution with primary hairs. Introducing a deformation in the theory, a different regular AdS$_3$ black hole solution is obtained. Charged generalizations of these solutions are given by coupling to Born-Infeld electrodynamics.</description>

Abstract: We compute the effective action for covariantly constant gauge fields that are solutions of the sourceless Yang-Mills equation and have the form of magnetic flux tubes. They represent a superposition of infinite many alternating monopole/ani-monopole pairs situated at infinity, with each pair having a structure similar to the Nielsen-Olesen magnetic flux tube. The chromomagnetic flux tubes condensation is stable and indicates that the Yang-Mills vacuum state is highly degenerate.</description>

Abstract: We adapt the diffusion method employed in fundamentally nonlocal field theories to determine the number of initial conditions for the classicized dynamics of unitary field theories with fakeons, characterized by inverse powers of the d'Alembertian operator $\Box$. We show that this number is two and we recover all the results obtained with a direct calculation elsewhere, including explicit solutions of linear toy models. Possible applications to nonlocal gravity are discussed.</description>

      <title>Anomaly-induced vanishing of brane partition functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the presence of 't Hooft anomalies, backgrounds for the symmetries of a quantum field theory can lead to non-conservation of Noether currents, or more generally, to the presence of charged insertions in the path integral. When there is a net background charge, the partition function evaluated on closed manifolds will vanish. For anomalous symmetries, this statement can also be understood as the anomaly theory giving rise to a non-trivial anomalous phase for the partition function even for "rigid" transformations which leave all background fields unchanged. We use the generalisation of this second viewpoint to the setting of anomalous higher-form symmetries in order to show vanishing of the partition function for a number of examples, both with and without a Lagrangian description. In particular, we show how to derive from these considerations the analogue of the Freed-Witten anomaly cancellation condition for the M5-brane, and also that for the D3-brane in S-fold backgrounds.</description>

Abstract: In this note we introduce some concepts of Species Quantum Mechanics. Specifically, we consider quantum operators that correspond to the species number $N_s$ and the tower mass scale $m_t$ in the context of the swampland distance conjecture. We discuss the commutation relations, a possible wave function, and symplectic duality transformations on the conjugate variables. Furthermore, we argue that the Castellano-Ruiz-Valenzuela (CRV) pattern is a consequence of the canonical commutation rules of moduli space quantum mechanics. We also connect the canonical quantization to the periods of ${\cal N}=2$ Calabi-Yau compactifications to explore other aspects of the CRV pattern, including its possible connection to the Ooguri-Vafa-Verlinde black hole quantization procedure.</description>

      <title>Peierls instability for systems with several Fermi surfaces: an example from the chiral Gross-Neveu model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As is well known, the chiral Gross-Neveu model at finite density can be solved semi-classically with the help of the chiral spiral mean field. The fermion spectrum has a single gap right at the Fermi energy, a reflection of the Peierls instability. Here, we divide the N fermion flavors up into two subsets to which we attribute two different densities. The Hartree-Fock ground state of such a system can again be found analytically, using as mean field the ``twisted kink crystal" of Basar and Dunne. Its spectrum displays two gaps with lower edges coinciding with the two Fermi energies. This solution is favored over the homogeneous one, providing us with an explicit example of a multiple Peierls instability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves propagating across gravitational potentials undergo lensing effects that, in the wave-optics regime, manifest as frequency-dependent amplitude and phase modulations. In this work, we revisit the diffraction integral formalism of gravitational lensing and demonstrate that it admits a natural and transparent interpretation within the framework of scattering theory. We establish a direct correspondence between the lensing amplification factor and the scattering amplitude of waves propagating in curved spacetime, clarifying how familiar lensing limits map onto distinct scattering regimes. In particular, we show that the diffraction integral matches exactly the eikonal limit of the scattering amplitude at lowest post-Minkowskian order, after a change in coordinates and the inclusion of finite-distance effects. We further extend the standard formalism by including subleading corrections to the post-Minkowskian and eikonal approximations. Our results provide a unified theoretical framework for the interpretation of lensed gravitational-wave signals and open the way to more accurate waveform modeling for future lensed observations.</description>

      <title>SL(2N,C) Yang-Mills Theories: Direct Internal Forces and Emerging Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19210v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a four-dimensional gauge-gravity unification based on the \(SL(2N,\mathbb C)\) gauge theory taken in a universal Yang--Mills type setting. The accompanying tetrads are promoted to dynamical fields whose contracted invertibility condition is interpreted as a nonlinear sigma-model type length constraint. This triggers tetrad condensation and spontaneously breaks $\mathrm{SL}(2N, \mathbb{C})\to \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})\times\mathrm{SU}(N)$, lifting all noncompact directions. A special ghost-free curvature-squared Lagrangian provides a consistent quadratic sector, while an Einstein--Cartan linear curvature term is induced radiatively from fermion loops. Below the breaking scale, only a neutral tetrad associated with graviton and $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ vector fields remain massless, whereas axial-vector and tensor fields of the entire gauge multiplet acquire heavy masses. The matter sector clearly points to a deeper elementarity of \(SL(2N,\mathbb C)\) spinors, which can be identified with preon constituents whose bound states form the observed quarks and leptons. Anomaly matching between preons and composites singles out $N=8$. The chain $\mathrm{SL}(16,\mathbb{C})\to \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})\times\mathrm{SU}(8)$ then naturally yields three composite quark--lepton families, while filtering out extraneous heavy states.</description>

Abstract: In this work we investigate holographic spacelike and timelike entanglement entropy using the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription, for slab-shaped and ball-shaped entangling regions. We work with an infinite family of 10-dimensional Type IIB supergravity solutions, which are gravity duals to an infinite set of linear quiver theories, with the backgrounds defined using the electrostatic potential formalism for brane configurations. The dual theories are 4-dimensional confining theories at low energy, but decompactify and flow to 5-dimensional SCFTs in the UV. We find that the entanglement entropy exhibits phase transition behaviour, and we use our results to investigate proposed c-functions constructed from the entanglement entropy. Comparing with the flow central charge, another proposed c-function, we find that each displays good behaviour, and reflects both UV and IR features of the dual theory.</description>

Abstract: It has recently been realised that strings with time-dependent tensions exhibit interesting dynamics; in particular, when the tension decreases loops of string can grow and possibly percolate. We extend previous analytic studies of strings with time-dependent tensions to numerical studies of non-circular loops. We show that the dynamics of a varying-tension string in expanding universe is mathematically equivalent to the evolution of a fixed-tension string in a universe with a modified scale factor. We use numerical solvers and machine learning techniques to explore the dynamics of non-circular string loops with radii close to the Hubble scale.</description>

Abstract: We compare different limits of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model of $N$ complex fermion with $p$-fermion interactions. First, we compute the fermion Green's function and free energy in the limit of large $N$ followed subsequently by the limit of large $p$. Next, we examine the `double-scaling' limit in which the large $N,p$ limits are taken at fixed $\lambda = p^2/N$. Earlier results on the latter limit are resummed for small $\lambda$, and shown to match our results for the first limit. We also describe the holographic match of our results to two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with an additional $U(1)$ gauge field.</description>

      <title>The ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with extra $SU(2)_{L_2/R_2}$ gauge symmetry from intersecting D6-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09057v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By introducing an extra stack of D6-branes to standard ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models, we extend the landscape of its complete search. In this construction, the $d$-stack of D6-branes is introduced besides the standard $a,~b,~c$-stacks. More intersections from the extra stacks of D6-branes appear, and thus Higgs/Higgs-like particles arise from more origins. Among these models, we find eight new classes of ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with gauge symmetries $SU(4)_C\times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_{R_1}\times SU(2)_{R_2}$ and $SU(4)_C\times SU(2)_{L_1}\times SU(2)_{R}\times SU(2)_{L_2}$, where $d$-stack of D6-branes carries the gauge symmetries $SU(2)_{R_2}$ and $SU(2)_{L_2}$, respectively. The $SU(2)_{L_1/R_1} \times SU(2)_{L_2/R_2}$ can be broken down to the diagonal $SU(2)_{L/R}$ gauge symmetry via bifundamental Higgs fields. In such a way, we for the first time successfully constructed three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from non-rigid D6-branes with extra $d$-stacks of D6-branes as visible sectors. Interestingly, by introducing extra stack of D6-branes to the standard supersymmetric Pati-Salam models, the number of filler brane reduces in general, and eventually the models without any $USp(N)$ gauge symmetry present. This reduces the exotic particles from filler brane intersection yet provides more vector-like particles from ${\cal N}=2$ subsector that are useful in renormalization group equation evolution as an advantage. Moreover, interesting degeneracy behavior with the same gauge coupling ratio exists in certain class of models.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a compact analytic formula for a complete basis of conformally invariant tensor structures for three-point functions of conserved operators in arbitrary 4D Lorentz representations. The construction follows directly from a novel constraint equivalent to applying conservation conditions at each point: the leading terms in all OPE limits appear as symmetric traceless tensors. We derive this by lifting to a unified $\mathrm{SU}(m,m|2n)$ analytic superspace framework, where the conservation conditions are automatically solved and then reducing back to 4D CFT. The same method is also used for cases involving one non-conserved operator. This formalism further reveals a map of the counting of CFT tensor structures to that of finite-dimensional $\mathrm{SU}(2n)$ representations, solved by Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. All results can be directly re-interpreted as three-point $\mathcal{N}=2$ and $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal tensor structures via the unified analytic superspace.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find a dual description of the supersymmetric $SL(2, \mathbb{C})/SU(2)$ WZW model as a super-winding condensate CFT, which follows simply from the bosonic AdS$_3$ duality found in [arXiv:2104.07233]. This duality can be seen as a dimensional uplift of the mirror symmetry between the $H_3^+/U(1)$ supercoset and $\mathcal{N}=2$ super-Liouville theory.</description>

      <title>Helping observers in closed universes reach their full potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work by Engelhardt, Gesteau, and Harlow applies proposals for incorporating observers into holographic maps to study the Antonini-Rath puzzle for closed universes. In a new form of ``observer complementarity,'' they find that an AdS bulk observer measures a SWAP test to determine that there is no closed universe in the bulk, contrary to the (limited) description given by an observer inside the closed universe. In this work, we improve the predictions of both observers by using the holographic maps to define new operators to perform this same SWAP test. With these, we show that the AdS observer cannot rule out a baby universe in the bulk, and the closed universe observer can improve the accuracy of their description.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a black hole state in a spin chain by studying thermal correlators in holography. Focusing on the Heisenberg model we investigate the thermal and complexity properties of the black hole state by evaluating its entanglement entropy, emptiness formation probability and Krylov complexity. The entanglement entropy grows logarithmically with effective central charge c=5.2. We find evidence for thermalization at infinite temperature.</description>

      <title>Spin-operator form factors of the critical Ising chain and their finite volume scaling limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a self-contained derivation of the spin-operator matrix elements in the fermionic basis, for the critical Ising chain at a generic system length $N\in 2Z_{\ge 2}$. The approach relies on the near-Cauchy property of certain matrices formed by the Toeplitz symbol in the critical model, and leads to simpler product formulas for the dressing functions in terms of square root functions. These square root products allow fully dis-singularized integral representations. In the finite volume scaling limit, they further reduce to the Binet's second integral for the gamma function logarithm and its Hermite's generalization. As such, all the matrix elements in the scaling limit allow simple product formulas in terms of the gamma function at integer and half-integer arguments, and are rational numbers up to $\sqrt{2}$. They are exactly the spin-operator form factors of the Ising CFT in the fermionic basis, whose explicit forms are much less well known in comparison to the finite-volume form factors in the massive theory. We also fully determine the normalization factor of the spin-operator and show explicitly how the coefficient $G(\frac{1}{2})G(\frac{3}{2})$ appear through a ground state overlap.</description>

      <title>The point insertion technique and open $r$-spin theories I: moduli and orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13185v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The papers [3,1,4,10] constructed an intersection theory on the moduli space of $r$-spin disks, and proved it satisfies mirror symmetry and relations with integrable hierarchies. That theory considered only disks with a single boundary state. In this work, we initiate the study of more general $r$-spin surfaces. We define graded $r$-spin surfaces with multiple internal and boundary states, together with their moduli spaces.
  In genus zero, the disk case, we define the associated open Witten bundle and prove that it is canonically oriented relative to the moduli space. We also describe a gluing construction for moduli spaces along boundaries, show that it lifts to the Witten bundle and relative cotangent line bundles, and that the result remains canonically relatively oriented.
  We then study the genus-one cylinder case. Here foundational difficulties arise because the Witten "bundle" is no longer an orbifold vector bundle. We resolve this by removing strata with incorrect fibre dimension, obtaining an orbibundle on the complement. The gluing method extends to genus one, and we prove that the Witten bundle again admits a canonical relative orientation.
  In the sequel [20], we construct a family of $\lfloor r/2\rfloor$ intersection theories in genus-zero indexed by $\mathfrak h\in\{0,\ldots,\lfloor r/2\rfloor-1\}$, where the $\mathfrak h$-th theory has $\mathfrak h+1$ boundary states, and compute their intersection numbers. The case $\mathfrak h=0$ recovers the theory of [3,1].
  In the sequel [21], restricting to the $\mathfrak h=0$ case, we construct an intersection theory on the moduli space of $r$-spin cylinders and show that its potential yields, after a change of variables, the genus-one part of the $r$th Gelfand-Dikii wave function, proving the genus-one case of the main conjecture of [4].</description>

      <title>The Fate of Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06677v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement manifests itself in non-local correlations between the constituents of a system. In its simplest realization, a measurement on one subsystem is affected by a prior measurement on its partner, irrespective of their separation. For multiple parties, purely collective types of entanglement exist but their detection, even theoretically, remains an outstanding open question. Here, we argue that all forms of multipartite entanglement entirely disappear during the typical evolution of a physical state as it heats up, evolves in time in a large family of dynamical protocols, or as its parts become separated. We focus on the generic case where the system interacts with an environment. These results mainly follow from the geometry of the entanglement-free continent in the space of physical states, and hold in great generality. We illustrate these phenomena with a frustrated molecular quantum magnet in and out of equilibrium, and a quantum spin chain. In contrast, if the particles are fermions, such as electrons, another notion of entanglement exists that protects bipartite quantum correlations. However, genuinely collective fermionic entanglement disappears during typical evolution, thus sharing the same fate as in bosonic systems. These findings provide fundamental knowledge about the structure of entanglement in quantum matter and architectures, paving the way for its manipulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The individual fermion generations of the Standard Model fit neatly into a representation of a simple Grand Unified Theory gauge algebra. If Grand Unification is not realized in nature, this would appear to be a coincidence. We attempt to quantify how frequently this coincidence occurs among theories with group structure and fermion content similar to the Standard Model. While many of the completely chiral, anomaly-free fermion representations of the Standard Model gauge algebra that are no larger than the single generation Standard Model are unifiable, we find that unifiability quickly becomes rare when the analysis is extended to include other gauge algebras or larger representations. This purely group-theoretical analysis may be taken as a bottom-up indication for Grand Unification, conceptually similar to a naturalness argument.</description>

      <title>Deflection angle in the strong deflection limit: a perspective from local geometrical invariants and matter distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In static, spherically symmetric spacetimes, the deflection angle of photons in the strong deflection limit exhibits a logarithmic divergence. We introduce an analytical framework that clarifies the physical origin of this divergence by employing local, coordinate-invariant geometric quantities alongside the properties of the matter distribution. In contrast to conventional formulations -- where the divergence rate $\bar{a}$ is expressed via coordinate-dependent metric functions -- our approach relates $\bar{a}$ to the components of the Einstein tensor in an orthonormal basis adapted to the spacetime symmetry. By applying the Einstein equations, we derive the expression \begin{align*} \bar{a}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-8\pi R_{\mathrm{m}}^2\left(\rho_{\mathrm{m}}+\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}\right)}}, \end{align*} where $\rho_{\mathrm{m}}$ and $\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}$ denote the local energy density and tangential pressure evaluated at the photon sphere of areal radius $R_{\mathrm{m}}$. This result reveals that $\bar{a}$ is intrinsically governed by the local matter distribution, with the universal value $\bar{a}=1$ emerging when $\rho_{\mathrm{m}}+\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}=0$. Notably, this finding resolves the long-standing puzzle of obtaining $\bar{a}=1$ in a class of spacetimes supported by a massless scalar field. Furthermore, these local properties are reflected in the frequencies of quasinormal modes, suggesting a profound connection between strong gravitational lensing and the dynamical response of gravitational wave signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21078v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $U(1)$ CP-violating phase which arises below chiral symmetry breaking in a non-Abelian gauge theory is ``secretly" the magnetic dual of the flux of a $U(1)$ $4$-form gauge field. Thus the discharge of this $4$-form flux by Schwinger production of charged membranes reduces the total CP-violating phase toward zero. This can safely restore CP symmetry to within the observational limits, $\theta_{\cancel{\tt CP}} \la 10^{-10}$, while also satisfying all limits from cosmology, when the charge and the tension of the gauge field sources are in the $\la keV$ range.</description>

Abstract: Quasinormal modes for bosonic (scalar, electromagnetic, and axial gravitational) and fermionic field perturbations, radiated from black holes that carry quantum gravitational corrections at third order in the curvature to the Schwarzschild solution, are scrutinized from the propagation of analog transonic sound waves across a de Laval nozzle. The thermodynamic variables, the nozzle geometry, the Mach number, and the thrust coefficient are computed as functions of the parameter driving the effective action for quantum gravity containing a dimension-six local operator beyond general relativity. The quasinormal modes for quantum gravitational corrected analog black holes are also determined for higher overtones, yielding a more precise description of the quantum-corrected ringdown process and the gravitational waveform way before the fundamental mode sets in.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a `QCD dilaton' field, whose vacuum expectation value sets the strong coupling, can render the Quantum Chromodynamic (QCD) confinement transition first-order. The QCD dilaton is cosmologically attracted to a false vacuum at weak coupling in the early universe. Quantum tunnelling towards the true vacuum triggers prompt chiral symmetry breaking and confinement of QCD, leading to detonating bubbles of the hadronic phase. We find that plasma sound waves produced by this dilaton-induced, first-order QCD phase transition generate a stochastic gravitational wave signal strikingly similar to the recently detected gravitational wave background from Pulsar Timing Arrays. We briefly comment on how this theory can be probed through collider experiments and cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a three variable series invariant $F_K (y,z,q)$ for plumbed knot complements associated with a Lie superalgebra $sl(2|1)$. The invariant is a generalization of the $sl(2|1)$-series invariant $\hat{Z}(q)$ for closed 3-manifolds introduced by Ferrari and Putrov and an extension of the two variable series invariant defined by Gukov and Manolescu (GM) to the Lie superalgebra. We derive a surgery formula relating $F_K (y,z,q)$ to $\hat{Z}(q)$ invariant. We find appropriate expansion chambers for certain infinite families of torus knots and compute explicit examples. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a non semisimple $Spin^c$ decorated TQFT from the three variable series. We observe that the super $F_K (y,z,q)$ itself and its results exhibit distinctive features compared to the GM series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the physical properties of an analytical, nonsingular quantum-corrected black hole solution recently derived in a minisuperspace model for unimodular gravity under the assumption of unitarity in unimodular time. We show that the metric corrections compared to the classical Schwarzschild solutions only depend on a single new parameter, corresponding to a minimal radius where a black hole-white hole transition occurs. While these corrections substantially alter the structure of the spacetime near this minimal radius, they fall off rapidly towards infinity, and we show in various examples how physical properties of the exterior spacetime are very close to those of the Schwarzschild solution. We derive the maximal analytic extension of the initial solution, which corresponds to an infinite sequence of Kruskal spacetimes connected via black-to-white hole transitions, and compare with some other proposals for non-singular black hole metrics. The metric violates the achronal averaged null energy condition, which indicates that we are capturing physics beyond the semiclassical approximation. Finally, we include some thoughts on how to go beyond the simple eternal black hole-white hole model presented here.</description>

Abstract: The Gravity from Entropy (GfE) action posits that the fundamental nature of gravity is information encoded in the metric degrees of freedom. This statistical mechanics theory is associated with the GfE Lagrangian given by the Geometric Quantum Relative Entropy (GQRE) between the true metric and the metric induced by the matter fields and the curvature. The GfE action leads to the GfE modified gravity equations displaying an emergent dynamical cosmological constant. Interestingly, the GfE equations of motion reduce to the Einstein equations in the limit of low energy and small curvature. Here we embrace a thermodynamic point of view and we associate the energy density of the GfE to the emergent dynamical cosmological constant of the theory. Focusing on homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes, we reveal that the GfE universes associated with the FRW metrics are thermal. Indeed they are associated with the $k$-temperatures and the $k$-pressures which are related to their local GQRE and their local energy by the first law of GfE thermodynamics. The thermodynamics of the GfE theory is illustrated in the low energy, small curvature limit with matter content modelled as perfect fluid, where the solutions of the GfE equations of motion are well approximated by the Friedmann universes. We show that while the total GQRE per unit volume is not increasing, coherently with its relative entropy nature, the total entropy of GfE universes is not decreasing in time. These results provide a natural thermodynamic interpretation of GfE cosmologies and a framework for reconciling local complexity with the global increase in entropy of the universe.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Lyapunov exponents of classical chaos of spinning particles orbiting a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole and examine whether the values of the exponents exceed the chaos bound. For the neutral particle, when its spin magnitude surpasses a specific threshold, the value of the exponent exceeds the surface gravity, resulting in a violation. Given a fixed total angular momentum of the particle, its spin direction opposite to the angular momentum direction leads to a greater exponent value than when the two directions are aligned. For the charged particle, taking into account the influence of the electromagnetic force, we find that, for relatively large angular momenta, although the electromagnetic force does not change the trend of the exponent's variation with respect to spin and angular momentum and only modifies the specific values of the exponent, it still leads to violations of the bound. Therefore, the chaos bound is violated in the spinor field.</description>
