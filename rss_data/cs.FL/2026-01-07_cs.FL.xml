      <title>Formal Modeling and Verification of Grover's Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grover's algorithm relies on the superposition and interference of quantum mechanics, which is more efficient than classical computing in specific tasks such as searching an unsorted database. Due to the high complexity of quantum mechanics, the correctness of quantum algorithms is difficult to guarantee through traditional simulation methods. By contrast, the fundamental concepts and mathematical structure of Grover's algorithm can be formalized into logical expressions and verified by higher-order logical reasoning. In this paper, we formally model and verify Grover's algorithm in the HOL Light theorem prover. We focus on proving key properties such as the unitarity of its oracle and diffusion operators, the monotonicity of the success probability with respect to the number of iterations, and an exact expression for the optimal iteration count. By analyzing a concrete application to integer factorization, we demonstrate the practicality and prospects of our work.</description>

      <title>Hardness of Regular Expression Matching with Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The regular expression matching problem asks whether a given regular expression of length $m$ matches a given string of length $n$. As is well known, the problem can be solved in $O(nm)$ time using Thompson's algorithm. Moreover, recent studies have shown that the matching problem for regular expressions extended with a practical extension called lookaround can be solved in the same time complexity. In this work, we consider three well-known extensions to regular expressions called backreference, intersection and complement, and we show that, unlike in the case of lookaround, the matching problem for regular expressions extended with any of the three (for backreference, even when restricted to one capturing group) cannot be solved in $O(n^{2-\varepsilon} \mathrm{poly}(m))$ time for any constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ under the Orthogonal Vectors Conjecture. Moreover, we study the matching problem for regular expressions extended with complement in more detail, which is also known as extended regular expression (ERE) matching. We show that there is no ERE matching algorithm that runs in $O(n^{\omega-\varepsilon} \mathrm{poly}(m))$ time ($2 \le \omega &lt; 2.3716$ is the exponent of square matrix multiplication) for any constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ under the $k$-Clique Hypothesis, and there is no combinatorial ERE matching algorithm that runs in $O(n^{3-\varepsilon} \mathrm{poly}(m))$ time for any constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ under the Combinatorial $k$-Clique Hypothesis. This shows that the $O(n^3 m)$-time algorithm introduced by Hopcroft and Ullman in 1979 and recently improved by Bille et al. to run in $O(n^\omega m)$ time using fast matrix multiplication was already optimal in a sense, and sheds light on why the theoretical computer science community has struggled to improve the time complexity of ERE matching with respect to $n$ and $m$ for more than 45 years.</description>

      <title>Proceedings 16th International Workshop on Graph Computation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This volume contains the post-proceedings of the Sixteenth International Workshop on Graph Computation Models (GCM 2025). The workshops took place in Koblenz, Germany on June 10 as part of STAF (Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations).  
  Graphs are common mathematical structures that are visual and intuitive. They constitute a natural and seamless way for system modeling in science, engineering, and beyond, including computer science, biology, and business process modeling. Graph computation models constitute a class of very high-level models where graphs are first-class citizens. The aim of the International GCM Workshop series is to bring together researchers interested in all aspects of computation models based on graphs and graph transformation. It promotes the cross-fertilizing exchange of ideas and experiences among senior and young researchers from the different communities interested in the foundations, applications, and implementations of graph computation models and related areas. </description>

      <title>The structure of polynomial growth for tree automata/transducers and MSO set queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10270v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an $\mathbb{N}$-weighted tree automaton, we give a decision procedure for exponential vs polynomial growth (with respect to the input size) in quadratic time, and an algorithm that computes the exact polynomial degree of growth in cubic time. As a special case, they apply to the growth of the ambiguity of a nondeterministic tree automaton, i.e. the number of distinct accepting runs over a given input.
  We deduce analogous decidability results (ignoring complexity) for the growth of the number of results of set queries in Monadic Second-Order logic (MSO) over ranked trees. In the case of polynomial growth of degree $k$, we also prove a reparameterization theorem for such queries: their results can be mapped to $k$-tuples of input nodes in a finite-to-one and MSO-definable fashion.
  We then apply these tools to study growth rates and subclass membership problems for tree-to-tree functions. Using new proof strategies, we recover and generalize known results concerning polyregular functions, total deterministic macro tree transducers, and partial nondeterministic top-down tree transducers. In particular, we give a procedure to decide polynomial size-to-height increase for both macro tree transducers and MSO set interpretations, and compute the degree.
  The paper concludes with a survey of a wide range of related work.</description>

      <title>Deciding Serializability in Network Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the SER modeling language for automatically verifying serializability of concurrent programs, i.e., whether every concurrent execution of the program is equivalent to some serial execution. SER programs are suitably restricted to make this problem decidable, while still allowing for an unbounded number of concurrent threads of execution, each potentially running for an unbounded number of steps. Building on prior theoretical results, we give the first automated end-to-end decision procedure that either proves serializability by producing a checkable certificate, or refutes it by producing a counterexample trace. We also present a network-system abstraction to which SER programs compile. Our decision procedure then reduces serializability in this setting to a Petri net reachability query. Furthermore, in order to scale, we curtail the search space via multiple optimizations, including Petri net slicing, semilinear-set compression, and Presburger-formula manipulation. We extensively evaluate our framework and show that, despite the theoretical hardness of the problem, it can successfully handle various models of real-world programs, including stateful firewalls, BGP routers, and more.</description>

      <title>Model-checking real-time systems: revisiting the alternating automaton route</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alternating timed automata (ATA) are an extension of timed automata, that are closed under complementation and hence amenable to logic-to-automata translations. Several timed logics, including Metric Temporal Logic (MTL), can be converted to equivalent 1-clock ATAs (1-ATAs). Satisfiability of an MTL formula reduces to checking emptiness of a 1-ATA. A straightforward modification of the 1-ATA emptiness algorithm can be applied for model-checking timed automata models against 1-ATA specifications. However, existing emptiness algorithms for 1-ATA proceed by an extended region construction, and are not suitable for implementations. Our goal in this work is to initiate the study of zone-based methods directly for 1-ATAs. We first introduce a deactivation operation on the 1-ATA syntax to allow an explicit deactivation of the clock in transitions. Using the deactivation operation, we improve the existing MTL-to-1-ATA conversion and present a fragment of MTL for which the equivalent 1-ATA generate a bounded number of variables. Secondly, we develop the idea of zones for 1-ATA and present an emptiness algorithm which explores a corresponding zone graph. For termination, a special entailment check between zones is necessary. Our main technical contributions are: (1) an algorithm for the entailment check using simple zone operations and (2) an NP-hardness for the entailment check in the general case. Finally, we adapt our methods to the problem of model-checking timed automata models against 1-ATA specifications. We observe that when the timed automaton is strongly non-Zeno or when the 1-ATA generates a bounded number of variables, a modified entailment check with quadratic complexity can be applied.</description>
