      <title>Achieving AoI Fairness in Spatially Distributed Wireless Networks: From Theory to Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design and implement two variants of a practical random access protocol called WiFair, based on IEEE 802.11 and designed to mitigate spatial unfairness in Age of Information (AoI). Drawing on previous theoretical work, we modify the mechanics of 802.11 to fairly minimize AoI in a wireless network consisting of several update nodes and a single base station. We implement this protocol on a testbed of software defined radios (SDRs) and measure its performance under a variety of settings compared to standard 802.11. We observe a 32% reduction in network average AoI and an 89% reduction in peak AoI in a last come first served (LCFS) single-packet queue setting, as well as a 76% reduction in network average AoI and an 82% reduction in peak AoI in a first come first served (FCFS) queue setting when the network is congested. We further show that when the network is uncongested, WiFair achieves the same performance as 802.11, and we demonstrate its robustness to more bursty traffic by streaming live video.</description>

      <title>Double-decker: Productive Backscatter Communication Using a Single Commodity Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backscatter communication has attracted significant attention for Internet-of-Things applications due to its ultra-low-power consumption. The state-of-the-art backscatter systems no longer require dedicated carrier generators and leverage ambient signals as carriers. However, there is an emerging challenge: most prior systems need dual receivers to capture the original and backscattered signals at the same time for tag data demodulation. This is not conducive to the widespread deployment of backscatter communication. To address this problem, we present double-decker, a novel backscatter system that only requires a single commercial device for backscatter communication. The key technology of double-decker is to divide the carrier OFDM symbols into two parts, which are pilot symbols and data symbols. Pilot symbols can be used as reference signals for tag data demodulation, thus getting rid of the dependence on the dual receiver structure. We have built an FPGA prototype and conducted extensive experiments. Empirical results show that when the excitation signal is 802.11g, double-decker achieves a tag data rate of 35.2kbps and a productive data rate of 38kbps, respectively. The communication range of double-decker is up to 28m in LOS deployment and 24m in NLOS deployment.</description>

      <title>Toward Time-Continuous Data Inference in Sparse Urban CrowdSensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) is a promising paradigm that leverages mobile users and their smart portable devices to perform various real-world tasks. However, due to budget constraints and the inaccessibility of certain areas, Sparse MCS has emerged as a more practical alternative, collecting data from a limited number of target subareas and utilizing inference algorithms to complete the full sensing map. While existing approaches typically assume a time-discrete setting with data remaining constant within each sensing cycle, this simplification can introduce significant errors, especially when dealing with long cycles, as real-world sensing data often changes continuously. In this paper, we go from fine-grained completion, i.e., the subdivision of sensing cycles into minimal time units, towards a more accurate, time-continuous completion. We first introduce Deep Matrix Factorization (DMF) as a neural network-enabled framework and enhance it with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN-DMF) to capture temporal correlations in these finer time slices. To further deal with the continuous data, we propose TIME-DMF, which captures temporal information across unequal intervals, enabling time-continuous completion. Additionally, we present the Query-Generate (Q-G) strategy within TIME-DMF to model the infinite states of continuous data. Extensive experiments across five types of sensing tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our models and the advantages of time-continuous completion.</description>

      <title>Content Provider Contributions to Capacity Expansion of a Neutral ISP: Effect of Private Option</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasing content consumption by users and the expectation of a better Internet experience requires Internet service providers (ISPs) to expand the capacity of the access network continually. The ISPs have been demanding the participation of the content providers (CPs) in sharing the cost of upgrading the infrastructure. From CPs' perspective, investing in the ISP infrastructure, termed as \emph{public investment}, seems rational as it will boost their profit. However, the CPs can alternatively invest in making content delivery more efficient, termed as \emph{private investment}, as it also boosts their profit. Thus, in this work, we investigate this trade-off between public and private investment of the CPs for a net-neutral ISP. Specifically, we consider centralized decision and non-cooperative forms of interaction between CPs and an ISP and determine the optimum public and private investments of the CPs for each model. In the non-cooperative interaction, we find that at most one CP contributes to the public infrastructure, whereas all invest in their private infrastructure.</description>
