      <title>Analysing air transport connectivity in Africa through airline decisions: a choice modelling approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research tries to understand how seat capacity on routes connecting 267 African cities is distributed across airlines by analysing supply decisions between 2016 and 2022. The paper compiles an Africa-specific database on seat capacity by origin-destination pair and year, using revealed preference data for one week in November each year extracted from the Official Aviation Guide (OAG). Supplemented with socio-economic and historical data such as GDP per capita, market size, predominant language, and colonial ties, the research applies the extended Multiple Discrete-Continuous (eMDC) choice model. The model results show that African carriers are, indeed, the ones offering the best connectivity for intra-African travel, but they also show less flexibility in their route networks. As expected, there is significant preferential treatment for national carriers regarding serving their home countries. The study highlights the structural and regulatory barriers that continue to constrain intra-African air connectivity, despite policies such as the Yamoussoukro Decision, designed to liberalise the sector. The dominance of airlines in serving only their home markets suggests a lack of cross-border cooperation and competition, limiting the potential for an integrated, efficient African aviation market. This not only restricts mobility across the continent but also hampers broader economic growth. The model estimates are statistically significant at a 95\% confidence level, supporting the use of these findings for informed policy and strategic decision-making. This paper represents the first application of discrete-continuous modelling using capacity-supply data within the African aviation context and offers policy-relevant insights into improving air connectivity.</description>

      <title>Deterministic construction of typical networks in network models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is often desirable to assess how well a given dataset is described by a given model. In network science, for instance, one often wants to say that a given real-world network appears to come from a particular network model. In statistical physics, the corresponding problem is about how typical a given state, representing real-world data, is in a particular statistical ensemble. One way to address this problem is to measure the distance between the data and the most typical state in the ensemble. Here, we identify the conditions that allow us to define this most typical state. These conditions hold in a wide class of grand canonical ensembles and their random mixtures. Our main contribution is a deterministic construction of a state that converges to this most typical state in the thermodynamic limit. This construction involves rounds of derandomization procedures, some of which deal with derandomizing point processes, an uncharted territory. We illustrate the construction on one particular network model, deterministic hyperbolic graphs, and its application to real-world networks, many of which we find are close to the most typical network in the model. While our main focus is on network models, our results are very general and apply to any grand canonical ensembles and their random mixtures satisfying certain niceness requirements.</description>

      <title>The Peaks of Eternal Light: a Near-term Property Issue on the Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01989</link>
      <description>arXiv:1608.01989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Outer Space Treaty makes it clear that the Moon is the province of all mankind, with the latter ordinarily understood to exclude state or private appropriation of any portion of its surface. However, there are indeterminacies in the Treaty and in space law generally over the issue of appropriation. These indeterminacies might permit a close approximation to a property claim or some manner of quasi-property. The recently revealed highly inhomogeneous distribution of lunar resources changes the context of these issues. We illustrate this altered situation by considering the Peaks of Eternal Light. They occupy about one square kilometer of the lunar surface. We consider a thought experiment in which a Solar telescope is placed on one of the Peaks of Eternal Light at the lunar South pole for scientific research. Its operation would require nondisturbance, and hence that the Peak remain unvisited by others, effectively establishing a claim of protective exclusion and de facto appropriation. Such a telescope would be relatively easy to emplace with todays technology and so poses a near-term property issue on the Moon. While effective appropriation of a Peak might proceed without raising some of the familiar problems associated with commercial development (especially lunar mining), the possibility of such appropriation nonetheless raises some significant issues concerning justice and the safeguarding of scientific practice on the lunar surface. We consider this issue from scientific, technical, ethical and policy viewpoints.</description>

      <title>Towers on the Peaks of Eternal Light: Quantifying the Available Solar Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.11766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Peaks of Eternal Light (PELs), that are largely unshaded regions mostly at the lunar south pole, have been suggested as a source of solar power for mining the water and other volatiles in the nearby permanently dark regions. As mining is a power-intensive activity, it is interesting to estimate the maximum solar power that could be generated at the PELs. Here we use average percentage illumination maps for a range of heights above the local topography from 2 m to 2 km to determine the total power available as a function of time of lunar day. Overshadowing of highly illuminated areas by towers placed in sunward locations (at a given time of day) limits the total power to much smaller values than the highly illuminated area would suggest. We find that for near-term realizable towers (up to 20 m), the upper limit to the time-averaged power available is ~55 MW at &gt;70% illumination, and ~6 MW at &gt;90% illumination. For the more distant future a maximum time-averaged power of order 21000 MW at &gt;70% illumination could be realizable for towers up to 2 km in height, and ~5270 MW, respectively, at 90% illumination. Towers 1 km high provide about a factor 2.7 times less power. The variation with lunar time of day ranges from a factor of 1.1 to ~ 3.</description>

      <title>Space science &amp; the space economy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20922v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Will it be possible in the future to realize large, complex space missions dedicated to basic science like HST, Chandra and JWST? Or will their cost be too great? Today's space scene is completely different from that of even five years ago, and certainly from that of the time when HST, Chandra and JWST were conceived and built. Space-related investments have grown exponentially in recent years, with a monetary investment exceeding half a trillion dollars per year since 2023. This boom is greatly aided by the rise of the so-called 'new space' economy driven by private commercial funding, which for the first time last year surpassed public investments in space. The establishment of a market logic to space activities results in more competition and a resulting dramatic cost and schedule reduction. Can space science take advantage of the benefits of the new space economy to reduce cost and development time and at the same time succeed in producing powerful missions in basic science? The prospects for Europe and the United States are considered here. We argue that this goal would be achievable if the scientific community could take advantage of the three pillars underlying the innovation of the new space economy: (1) technology innovation proceeding through both incremental innovation and disruptive innovation, (2) business innovation, through vertical integration, scale production, and service-oriented business model, and (3) cultural innovation, through openness to risk and iterative development.</description>

      <title>Projective limits of probabilistic symmetries and their applications to random graph limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We couple projective limits of probability measures to direct limits of their symmetry groups. We show that the direct limit group is the group of symmetries of the projective limit probability measure. If projective systems of probability measures represent point processes in increasingly larger finite regions of the same infinite space, then we show that under some additional niceness and consistency assumptions, an extension of the direct limit group is the symmetry group of the projective limit point process in the whole infinite space. The application of these results to random graph limits provides ``shortest paths'' to graphons and graphexes as it recovers these random graph limits as trivial corollaries. Another application example encompasses a broad class of limits of random graphs with bounded average degrees. This class includes a representative collection of paradigmatic random graph models that have attracted significant research attention in diverse areas of science. Our approach thus provides a general unified framework to study limits of very different types of random graphs.</description>

      <title>Mean First Passage Time of the Symmetric Noisy Voter Model with Arbitrary Initial and Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models of imitation and herding behavior often underestimate the role of individualistic actions and assume symmetric boundary conditions. However, real-world systems (e.g., electoral processes) frequently involve asymmetric boundaries. In this study, we explore how arbitrarily placed boundary conditions influence the mean first passage time in the symmetric noisy voter model, and how individualistic behavior amplifies this asymmetry. We derive exact analytical expressions for mean first passage time that accommodate any initial condition and two types of boundary configurations: (i) both boundaries absorbing, and (ii) one absorbing and one reflective. In both scenarios, mean first passage time exhibits a clear asymmetry with respect to the initial condition, shaped by the boundary placement and the rate of independent transitions. Symmetry in mean first passage time emerges only when absorbing boundaries are equidistant from the midpoint. Additionally, we show that Kramers' law holds in both configurations when the rate of independent transitions is large. Our analytical results are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations, reinforcing the robustness of our findings.</description>

      <title>A review of mechanistic and data-driven models of terrorism and radicalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08485</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.08485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid spread of radical ideologies in recent years has led to a worldwide string of terrorist attacks. Understanding how extremist tendencies germinate, develop, and drive individuals to action is important from a cultural standpoint, but also to help formulate response and prevention strategies. Demographic studies, interviews with radicalized subjects, analysis of terrorist databases, reveal that the path to radicalization occurs along progressive steps, where age, social context and peer-to-peer exchange of extremist ideas play major roles. Furthermore, the advent of social media has offered new channels of communication, facilitated recruitment, and hastened the leap from mild discontent to unbridled fanaticism. While a complete sociological understanding of the processes and circumstances that lead to full-fledged extremism is still lacking, quantitative approaches, using modeling and data analyses, can offer useful insight. We review some approaches from statistical mechanics, applied mathematics, data science, that can help describe and understand radicalization and terrorist activity. Specifically, we focus on compartment models of populations harboring extremist views, continuous time models for age-structured radical populations, radicalization as social contagion processes on lattices and social networks, adversarial evolutionary games coupling terrorists and counter-terrorism agents, and point processes to study the spatiotemporal clustering of terrorist events. We also present recent applications of machine learning methods on open-source terrorism databases. Finally, we discuss the role of institutional intervention and the stages at which de-radicalization strategies might be most effective.</description>

      <title>Autocratic strategies in Cournot oligopoly game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An oligopoly is a market in which the price of goods is controlled by a few firms. Cournot introduced the simplest game-theoretic model of oligopoly, where profit-maximizing behavior of each firm results in market failure. Furthermore, when the Cournot oligopoly game is infinitely repeated, firms can tacitly collude to monopolize the market. Such tacit collusion is realized by the same mechanism as direct reciprocity in the repeated prisoner's dilemma game, where mutual cooperation can be realized whereas defection is favorable for both prisoners in a one-shot game. Recently, in the repeated prisoner's dilemma game, a class of strategies called zero-determinant strategies attracts much attention in the context of direct reciprocity. Zero-determinant strategies are autocratic strategies which unilaterally control payoffs of players by enforcing linear relationships between payoffs. There were many attempts to find zero-determinant strategies in other games and to extend them so as to apply them to broader situations. In this paper, first, we show that zero-determinant strategies exist even in the repeated Cournot oligopoly game, and that they are quite different from those in the repeated prisoner's dilemma game. Especially, we prove that a fair zero-determinant strategy exists, which is guaranteed to obtain the average payoff of the opponents. Second, we numerically show that the fair zero-determinant strategy can be used to promote collusion when it is used against an adaptively learning player, whereas it cannot promote collusion when it is used against two adaptively learning players. Our findings elucidate some negative impact of zero-determinant strategies in the oligopoly market.</description>
