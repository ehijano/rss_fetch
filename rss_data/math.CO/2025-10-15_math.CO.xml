      <title>The maximum product of sizes of cross-\(t\)-intersecting families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two families of sets \(\mathcal{A}\) and \(\mathcal{B}\) are called \emph{cross-\(t\)-intersecting} if \(|A \cap B| \geq t\) for all \(A \in \mathcal{A}\) and \(B \in \mathcal{B}\). Determining the maximum product of sizes for such cross-\(t\)-intersecting families is an active problem in extremal set theory. In this paper, we verify the following cross-\(t\)-intersecting version of the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem: For \(k\geq l \geq t \geq 3\) and \(\min\{m,n\} \geq (t+1)(k-t+1)\), the maximun value of \(|\mathcal{A}||\mathcal{B}|\) for two cross-\(t\)-intersecting families \(\mathcal{A}\subseteq \binom{[n]}{k}\) and \(\mathcal{B} \subseteq \binom{[m]}{l}\) is \( \binom{n-t}{k-t}\binom{m-t}{l-t}\). Moreover, we characterize the extremal families attaining the upper bound. Our result confirms a conjecture of Tokushige for \(t \geq 3\), and actually proves a more general result.</description>

      <title>A Variant of Wythoff's Game Defined by Hofstadter's G-Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a variant of the classical Wythoff's game. The classical form is played with two piles of stones, from which two players take turns to remove stones from one or both piles. When removing stones from both piles, an equal number must be removed from each. The player who removes the last stone or stones is the winner. Equivalently, we consider a single chess queen placed somewhere on a large grid of squares. Each player can move the queen toward the upper-left corner of the grid, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, in any number of steps. The winner is the player who moves the queen into the upper-left corner, the position (0,0) in our coordinate system. We call (0,0) the terminal position of Wythoff's game. In our variant of Wythoff's game, we have a set of positions {(0,0),(1,0),(0,1),(1,1),(2,0),(0,2)} as the terminal set. If a player moves the queen into this terminal set, that player is the winner of the game. The P-positions of this variant are described by the P-positions of Wythoff's game and
  Hofstadter's G-Sequence. This variant has two remarkable properties. For a position (x,y) with x &gt;= 8 or y &gt;= 8, the Grundy number of the position (x,y) is 1 in this variant if and only if (x,y) is a P-position of Wythoff's game. There is another remarkable property.For a position (x,y) with x &gt;= 8 or y &gt;= 8, (x,y) is a P-position of of the misere version of this variant if and only if (x,y) is a P-position of of Wythoff's game.</description>

      <title>Discrete Curvatures and Convex Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Forman--Ricci and effective resistance curvatures on the skeleta of convex polytopes. Our guiding questions are: how frequently do polytopal graphs exhibit everywhere positive curvature, and what structural constraints does positivity impose? For Forman--Ricci curvature we derive an exact identity for the average edge curvature in terms of flag $f$-numbers and establish the existence of infinite families of Forman--Ricci-positive polytopes in every fixed dimension $d\ge 6$. We prove finiteness results in low dimension: there are only finitely many Forman--Ricci-positive $3$- and $4$-polytopes; for $d=5$ we show finiteness in the simplicial case, and conjecture its extension to $5$-polytopes more generally. For the resistance curvature $\kappa(v)$ we establish the existence of infinite families for all $d\ge 3$, and we provide a quantitative lower bound for $\kappa(v)$ in a simple $3$-polytope in terms of the lengths of the three $2$-faces incident to $v$. This bound leads to constructions of non-vertex-transitive, resistance-positive $3$-polytopes via $\Delta$-operations, and a degree-based obstruction showing that if each neighbor of $v$ has degree at most $d_v-2$, then $\kappa(v)\le 0$. Our results suggest that positive curvature on polytopal skeletons is rare and constrained.</description>

      <title>On the Combinatorics of Pseudo-Latin Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of combinatorial objects called consecutive pseudo-Latin squares (CPLSs), a variant of Latin squares in which at least one row or column is in consecutive or reverse-consecutive order, but every element may not appear in every row or column. We derive exact and asymptotic formulas for the number of CPLSs of order $n$, showing that their proportion among all pseudo-Latin squares (PLSs) rapidly approaches zero as $n\to\infty$. We also analyze the distribution of CPLSs under uniform random sampling, and explore connections to algebraic structures, interpreting CPLSs as Cayley tables related to those of unital magmas. Finally, we supplement our theoretical results with Monte Carlo simulations for small values of $n$.</description>

      <title>On the Walsh spectra of quadratic APN functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: APN functions play a central role as building blocks in the design of many block ciphers, serving as optimal functions to resist differential attacks. One of the most important properties of APN functions is their linearity, which is directly related to the Walsh spectrum of the function. In this paper, we establish two novel connections that allow us to derive strong conditions on the Walsh spectra of quadratic APN functions. We prove that the Walsh transform of a quadratic APN function $F$ operating on $n=2k$ bits is uniquely associated with a vector space partition of $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ and a specific blocking set in the corresponding projective space $PG(n-1,2)$. These connections allow us to prove a variety of results on the Walsh spectrum of $F$. We prove for instance that $F$ can have at most one component function of amplitude larger than $2^{\frac{3}{4}n}$. We also find the first nontrivial upper bound on the number of bent component functions of a quadratic APN function, and and provide conditions for a function to be CCZ-equivalent to a permutation, based on its number of bent components.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial equivalence of separable elements in types $A$ and $B$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the combinatorial equivalence of separable elements in types $A$ and $B$. A bijection is constructed from the set of separable permutations in the symmetric group $S_{n+1}$ to the set of separable signed permutations in the hyperoctahedral group $B_n$. This bijection preserves descent statistics and induces a poset isomorphism under the left weak order. As a consequence, separable signed permutations are enumerated by the large Schr\"oder numbers, and their descent polynomials are shown to be $\gamma$-positive. Building on a recursive characterization of separable signed permutations via direct sum and skew sum operations, we derive explicit product formulas for the rank generating functions of the principal upper and lower ideals of separable signed permutations under the left weak order.</description>

      <title>Metric Dimension of Generalized Theta Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A vertex $w$ in a graph $G$ is said to resolve two vertices $u$ and $v$ if $d(w,u)\neq d(w, v)$. A set $W$ of vertices is a resolving set for $G$ if every pair of distinct vertices is resolved by some vertex in $W$. The metric dimension of $G$ is the minimum cardinality of such a set. In this paper, we investigate the metric dimension of generalized theta graphs, providing exact values and structural insights for several subclasses.</description>

      <title>A note on the number of non-cycle components in a pseudo 2-factor of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pseudo 2-factor of a graph is a spanning subgraph such that each component is $K_1$, $K_2$, or a cycle. This notion was introduced by Bekkai and Kouider in 2009, where they showed that every graph $G$ has a pseudo 2-factor with at most $\alpha(G)-\delta(G)+1$ components that are not cycles. For a graph $G$ and a set of vertices $S$, let $\delta_G(S)$ denote the minimum degree of vertices in $S$. In this note, we show that every graph $G$ has a pseudo 2-factor with at most $f(G)$ components that are not cycles, where $f(G)$ is the maximum value of $|I|-\delta_G(I)+1$ among all independent sets $I$ of $G$. This result is a common generalization of a result by Bekkai and Kouider and a previous result by the author on the existence of a 2-factor.</description>

      <title>Expansion of trivariate polynomials using proximity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the proximity technique of Solymosi and Zahl [J. Combin. Theory, Ser. A (2024)] to the setting of trivariate polynomials. In particular, we prove the following result: Let $f(x,y,z)=(x-y)^2+(\varphi(x)-z)^2$, where $\varphi(x)\in \mathbb{R}[x]$ has degree at least 3. Then, for every finite $A,B,C\subset \mathbb{R}$ each of size $n$, one has $|f(A,B,C)|=\Omega(n^{5/3-\varepsilon})$, for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$, where the constant of proportionality depends on $\varepsilon$ and on ${\rm deg}(\varphi)$. This improves the previous exponent $3/2$, due to Raz, Sharir, and De Zeeuw [Israel J. Math. (2018)]. To the best of our knowledge, prior to this work no trivariate polynomial was known to have expansion exceeding $\Omega(n^{3/2})$.</description>

      <title>Cocycle weighted infinitesimal bialgebras and pre-Lie algebras on rooted trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of weighted infinitesimal bialgebras provides an algebraic framework for understanding the non-homogeneous associative Yang-Baxter equation. In this paper, we endow the space of decorated planar rooted forests with a two-parameters family of coproducts, making it into a weighted infinitesimal bialgebra. A combinatorial characterization of the coproducts is given via the notion of forest biideals. Furthermore, by constructing a bilinear symmetric form and introducing a new grafting operation on rooted forests, we describe the associated dual products. We also introduce the notion of the pair-weight 1-cocycle condition and investigate the universal properties of decorated planar rooted forests satisfying this condition. This leads to the definition of a weighted $\Omega$-cocycle infinitesimal unitary bialgebra. As applications, we identify the initial object in the category of free cocycle infinitesimal unitary bialgebras on undecorated planar rooted forests, corresponding to the well-known noncommutative Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra. In addition, we establish isomorphisms between different coproduct structures and construct a pre-Lie algebra structure on decorated planar rooted forests.</description>

      <title>Completions of pairwise comparison data that minimize the triad measure of inconsistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider incomplete pairwise comparison matrices and determine exactly when they have a consistent completion and, if not, when they have a nearly consistent completion. We use the maximum 3-cycle product as a measure of inconsistency and show that, when the graph of the specified entries is chordal, a completion in which this measure is not increased is always possible. Methodology to produce such completions is developed. Such methodology may also be used to reduce inconsistency with few changes of comparisons.</description>

      <title>Exact bounds for efficient consistent matrices obtained from a reciprocal matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given reciprocal matrix A, we give a union of matrix intervals in which any consistent matrix obtained from an efficient vector for A lies, and, conversely, any consistent matrix in this union comes from an efficient vector for A. The maximal sets of entries in the lower and upper bound matrices of each interval that are attainable by some consistent matrix in the interval are described. This allows us to understand which subsets of the alternatives lie above which other subsets in all efficient orders for each interval. As a result, the partial order on the alternatives dictated by the efficient vectors follows. Then, we use the tools developed to also show that, when the n-by-n reciprocal matrices A,B are simple perturbed consistent matrices, or n=4, the sets of efficient vectors for A and B coincide only if A=B.</description>

      <title>Dominating Hadwiger's Conjecture for graphs $G$ with $\alpha(G)=2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hadwiger's Conjecture from 1943 states that every graph with chromatic number $t$ contains a $K_t$ minor. Illingworth and Wood [arXiv:2405.14299] introduced the concept of a ``dominating $K_t$ minor'' and asked whether every graph with chromatic number $t$ contains a dominating $K_t$ minor. This question is a substantial strengthening of Hadwiger's Conjecture. Norin referred to it as the ``Dominating Hadwiger's Conjecture'' and believes it is likely false. In this paper we first observe that a $t$-chromatic $G$ on $n$ vertices with independence number $\alpha(G)\le2$ contains a dominating $K_t$ minor if and only if $G$ contains a dominating $K_{\lceil n/2\rceil}$ minor. Building on this and using a deep result of Chudnovsky and Seymour on packing seagulls, we prove that every graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with $\alpha(G)\le 2$ and $2\omega(G)\ge \lceil n/2\rceil+1$ satisfies the Dominating Hadwiger's Conjecture, where $\omega(G)$ denotes the clique number of $G$. We further prove that every $H$-free graph $G$ with $\alpha(G)\le 2$ satisfies the Dominating Hadwiger's Conjecture, where $H\in\{2K_1+P_4, K_2+2K_2, K_2+(K_1\cup K_3), K_1+(K_1\cup K_5), W_5^&lt;, W_5^-, W_5, K_7^&lt;, K_7^-, K_7\}$, or $H\ne K_2\cup K_3$ is any graph on at most five vertices such that $\alpha(H)\le2$.</description>

Abstract: A dominating $K_t$ minor in a graph $G$ is a sequence $(T_1,\dots,T_t)$ of pairwise disjoint non-empty connected subgraphs of $G$, such that for $1 \leq i&lt;j\leq t$, every vertex in $T_j$ has a neighbor in $T_i$. Replacing ``every vertex in $T_j$'' by ``some vertex in $T_j$'' retrieves the standard definition of a $K_t$ minor. The strengthened notion was introduced by Illingworth and Wood [arXiv:2405.14299], who asked whether every graph with chromatic number $t$ contains a dominating $K_t$ minor. This is a substantial strengthening of the celebrated Hadwiger's Conjecture, which asserts that every graph with chromatic number $t$ contains a $K_t$ minor. At the ``New Perspectives in Colouring and Structure'' workshop held at the Banff International Research Station from September 29 - October 4, 2024, Norin referred to this question as the ``Dominating Hadwiger's Conjecture'' and believes it is likely false. In this paper we prove that the Dominating Hadwiger's Conjecture holds for all $2K_2$-free graphs. A key component of our proof is the clever use of the existence of an induced banner, obtained by adding a vertex adjacent to exactly one vertex on a cycle of length four.</description>

      <title>Decomposing Conditional Independence Ideals with Hidden Variables: A Matroid-Theoretic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of determinantal ideals arising from conditional independence (CI) statements with hidden variables. Such CI statements translate into determinantal conditions on a matrix whose entries represent the probabilities of events involving the observed random variables. Our main objective is to determine the irreducible components of the corresponding varieties and to provide a combinatorial or geometric interpretation of each. We achieve this by introducing a new approach rooted in matroid theory. In particular, we introduce a new class of matroids, which we term quasi-paving matroids, and show that the components of these determinantal varieties are precisely matroid varieties of quasi-paving matroids. Moreover, we derive generating functions that encode the number of irreducible components of these CI ideals.</description>

      <title>Tur\'an densities of stars in uniformly dense hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $3$-uniform hypergraph (or $3$-graph) $H=(V,E)$ is $(d,\mu, \text{dot})$-dense if for any subsets $X, Y, Z\subseteq V$, the number of triples $(x,y,z)\in X\times Y\times Y$ with $\{x,y,z\}$ being an edge of $H$ is at least $d|X||Y||Z|-\mu |V|^3$. Similarly, we say that $H$ is $(d,\mu, \text{dot-edge})$-dense if for any subset $X\subseteq V$ and every pair set $P\subseteq V\times V$, the number of pairs $(x,(y,z))\in X\times P$ with $\{x,y,z\}$ being an edge of $H$ is at least $d|X||P|-\mu|V|^3$. Restricting to $\text{dot}$-dense $3$-graphs and $\text{dot-edge}$-dense $3$-graphs, determining the $\text{dot}$-uniform Tur\'an density $\pi_{\text{dot}}(S_k)$ and the $\text{dot-edge}$-uniform Tur\'an density $\pi_{\text{dot-edge}}(S_k)$ of the $k$-star $S_k$ for $k\ge 4$ was proposed by Schacht in ICM 2022. In particular, Reiher, R\"odl and Schacht presented that $\pi_{\text{dot}}(S_k)\ge \pi_{\text{dot-edge}}(S_k)\ge \frac{k^2-5k+7}{(k-1)^2}$ for $k\ge 3$ and $\pi_{\text{dot}}(S_3)= \pi_{\text{dot-edge}}(S_3)=1/4$. Last year, Lamaison and Wu shown that $\pi_{\text{dot}}(S_k)=\frac{k^2-5k+7}{(k-1)^2}$ for $k\ge 48$.
  In this paper, we show that $\pi_{\text{dot}}(S_k)=\frac{k^2-5k+7}{(k-1)^2}$ for $k\ge 11$. Moreover, we determine the $\text{dot-edge}$-uniform Tur\'an density for all $S_k$ except for $k=4$.</description>

      <title>Boosted second moment method in random regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the asymptotic independence ratio of random regular graphs is a key challenge in the area of sparse random graphs. Due to the interpolation method, very good upper bounds are known, which are actually known to be sharp for sufficiently large degrees.
  This paper provides explicit lower bounds for given degrees $d$, beating the previous best bounds for $d \geq 10$. The starting point is a second moment argument that we can boost by arguing that the obtained independent set has a certain spatial Markov property. One can then exploit this property by making local modifications to the independent set, resulting in substantial improvements.
  Our approach can also be used to prove the existence of other objects in random regular graphs. To demonstrate this, we consider the problem of decomposing random regular graphs into stars.</description>

      <title>Transition Matrices between Plethystic Bases of Polysymmetric Functions via Bijective Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many identities involving symmetric functions can be proved through bijective manipulations of tableaux. In this paper, we prove identities involving polysymmetric functions through bijections and sign-reversing involutions. In their paper titled "Polysymmetric functions and motivic measures of configuration spaces", Asvin G and Andrew O'Desky introduced the algebra of polysymmetric functions (PSym) which can be defined as the tensor product of copies of the symmetric functions algebra (Sym) where the $i$th tensor factor is scaled by $i$. On one hand, we can obtain bases of this algebra by taking tensor products of the bases of Sym. On the other hand, the Asvin G and Andrew O'Desky paper introduces non-pure tensor bases families $H$, $E$, $E^+$, and $P$ that we call plethystic bases. In this paper, we present combinatorial interpretations of the entries of the transition matrices between all twelve pairs of distinct plethystic bases. We also provide new interpretations for six OEIS sequences that turn up in this context.</description>

      <title>On the quadratic complexity of subsets of $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ of bounded $\mathrm{VC_{2}}$-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In prior work, we showed that subsets of $\mathbb{F}_{p}^{n}$ of $\mathrm{VC_{2}}$-dimension at most $k$ are well approximated by a union of atoms of a quadratic factor of complexity $(\ell,q)$, where the complexity $\ell$ of the linear part and the complexity $q$ of the quadratic part are both bounded in terms of $k$, $p$, and the desired level of approximation $\mu$. A key tool in the proof of this result was an arithmetic regularity lemma for the Gowers $U^3$-norm by Green and Tao, which resulted in tower-type bounds (in terms of $\mu^{-1}$) on both $\ell$ and $q$.
  In the present paper we show that for sets of bounded $\mathrm{VC}_2$-dimension, the bound on $q$ can be substantially improved. Specifically, we will prove that any set $A\subseteq G=\mathbb{F}_p^n$ of $\mathrm{VC}_2$-dimension at most $k$ is approximately equal (up to error $\mu |G|$) to a union of atoms of a quadratic factor whose quadratic complexity is at most $\log_p(\mu^{-k-o(1)})$, implying that the purely quadratic component of the factor partitions the group into $\mu^{-k-o(1)}$ many parts.
  We achieve this by using our earlier result to obtain an initial quadratic factor $\mathcal{B}$, and then applying a generalization of an argument of Alon, Fox and Zhao for subsets of $\mathbb{F}_{p}^{n}$ of bounded $\mathrm{VC}$-dimension to the label space (also known as "configuration space") of $\mathcal{B}$. A related strategy was employed in earlier work of the authors on $\mathrm{NFOP}_2$ subsets of $\mathbb{F}_p^n$, and in work of the first author in the context of 3-uniform hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>A Normality Conjecture on Rational Base Number Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rational base number system, introduced by Akiyama, Frougny, and Sakarovitch in 2008, is a generalization of the classical integer base number system. Within this framework two interesting families of infinite words emerge, called minimal and maximal words. We conjecture that every minimal and maximal word is normal over an appropriate subalphabet. To support this conjecture, we present extensive numerical experiments that examine the richness threshold and the discrepancy of these words. We also discuss the implications that the validity of our conjecture would have for several long-standing open problems, including the existence of $Z$-numbers (Mahler, 1968) and $Z_{p/q}$-numbers (Flatto, 1992), the existence of triple expansions in rational base $p/q$ (Akiyama, 2008), and the Collatz-inspired `4/3 problem' (Dubickas and Mossinghoff, 2009).</description>

      <title>Improved Bounds for the Index Conjecture in Zero-Sum Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Index Conjecture in zero-sum theory states that when $n$ is coprime to $6$ and $k$ equals $4$, every minimal zero-sum sequence of length $k$ modulo $n$ has index $1$. While other values of $(k,n)$ have been studied thoroughly in the last 30 years, it is only recently that the conjecture has been proven for $n&gt;10^{20}$. In this paper, we prove that said upper bound can be reduced to $4.6\cdot10^{13}$, and lower under certain coprimality conditions. Further, we verify the conjecture for $n&lt;1.8\cdot10^6$ through the application of High Performance Computing (HPC).</description>

      <title>Stranding $\mathfrak{sl}_n$ webs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12035v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Webs are a kind of planar, directed, edge-labeled graph that encode invariant vectors for quantum representations of $\mathfrak{sl}_n$. The theory of webs developed organically for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$, where they are also known as noncrossing matchings and the Temperley-Lieb algebra, before being formalized by Kuperberg for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ as the morphisms in a diagrammatic categorification of quantum representations called the spider category. Various models extend webs to $n \geq 4$. Only Cautis-Kamnitzer-Morrison prove a full set of relations for their webs, though Fontaine's webs are better adapted to computations, more graph-theoretically natural, and directly generalize webs for $n=2$ and $n=3$.
  This paper formalizes the theory of Fontaine's webs, proving the existence of a deep and powerful global structure on these webs called strandings. We do three key things: 1) give a state-sum formula to construct ($U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_n)$-invariant) web vectors from the orientation of strandings on Fontaine's webs; 2) list and prove a complete set of relations, connecting strandings to the local data of binary labelings that are well-established in the literature; and 3) provide applications and examples of how strandings facilitate computations.</description>

      <title>Thin Trees via $k$-Respecting Cut Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thin spanning trees lie at the intersection of graph theory, approximation algorithms, and combinatorial optimization. They are central to the long-standing \emph{thin tree conjecture}, which asks whether every $k$-edge-connected graph contains an $O(1/k)$-thin tree, and they underpin algorithmic breakthroughs such as the $O(\log n/\log\log n)$-approximation for ATSP. Yet even the basic algorithmic task of \emph{verifying} that a given tree is thin has remained elusive: checking thinness requires reasoning about exponentially many cuts, and no efficient certificates have been known.
  We introduce a new machinery of \emph{$k$-respecting cut identities}, which express the weight of every cut that crosses a spanning tree in at most $k$ edges as a simple function of pairwise ($2$-respecting) cuts. This yields a tree-local oracle that, after $O(n^2)$ preprocessing, evaluates such cuts in $O_k(1)$ time. Building on this oracle, we give the first procedure to compute the exact $k$-thinness certificate $\Theta_k(T)$ of any spanning tree for fixed $k$ in time $\tilde O(n^2+n^k)$, outputting both the certificate value and a witnessing cut.
  Beyond general graphs, our framework yields sharper guarantees in structured settings. In planar graphs, duality with cycles and dual girth imply that every spanning tree admits a verifiable certificate $\Theta_k(T)\le k/\lambda$ (hence $O(1/\lambda)$ for constant $k$). In graphs embedded on a surface of genus $\gamma$, refined counting gives certified (per-cut) bounds $O((\log n+\gamma)/\lambda)$ via the same ensemble coverage.</description>

Abstract: A family of random matrices is said to converge strongly to a limiting family of operators if the operator norm of every noncommutative polynomial of the matrices converges to that of the limiting operators. Recent developments surrounding the strong convergence phenomenon have led to new progress on important problems in random graphs, geometry, operator algebras, and applied mathematics. We review classical and recent results in this area, and their applications to various areas of mathematics.</description>

      <title>Performance of Gaussian Boson Sampling on Planted Bipartite Clique Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) can provide a computational advantage for solving the planted biclique problem, which is a graph problem widely believed to be classically hard when the planted structure is small. Although GBS has been heuristically and experimentally observed to favor sampling dense subgraphs, its theoretical performance on this classically hard problem remains largely unexplored. We focus on a natural statistic derived from GBS output: the frequency with which a node appears in GBS samples, referred to as the node weight. We rigorously analyze whether this signal is strong enough to distinguish planted biclique nodes from background nodes. Our analysis characterizes the distribution of node weights under GBS and quantifies the bias introduced by the planted structure. The results reveal a sharp limitation: when the planted biclique size falls within the conjectured hard regime, the natural fluctuations in node weights dominate the bias signal, making detection unreliable using simple ranking strategies. These findings provide the first rigorous evidence that planted biclique detection may remain computationally hard even under GBS-based quantum computing, and they motivate further investigation into more advanced GBS-based algorithms or other quantum approaches for this problem.</description>

      <title>Skew RSK and the switching on ballot tableau pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:1808.06095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In arXiv:1808.06095 we have introduced the Knuth class of the word recording a sequence of locations for repeated internal insertion operations in the Sagan-Stanley skew RSK correspondence, with no prescribed external insertion of new cells, to be a preserver for the $P$-tableau. As a consequence the Benkart-Sottile-Stroomer switching involution on ballot tableau pairs allows a realization as a recursive internal insertion procedure. This amounts to explain the various presentations of Littlewood-Richardson (LR) commuters and their coincidence predicted by Pak and Vallejo with contributions by Danilov and Koshevoi. In particular, the aforesaid presentation provides internal insertion as an alternative to Sch\"utzenberger- Lusztig involution (or evacuation) to constructing the Gelfand-Tsetlin pair in the Henriques-Kamnitzer $\mathfrak{gl}_n$-crystal commuter. In addition, the coincidence of LR commuters solves the Lecouvey-Lenart conjecture, recently further developed by Kumar-Torres, on bijections between the Kwon and Sundaram branching models.</description>

      <title>Higher-order generalizations of stability and arithmetic regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.01739v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a natural notion of higher order stability and show that subsets of $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ that are tame in this sense can be approximately described by a union of low-complexity quadratic varieties, up to linear error. This generalizes the arithmetic regularity lemma for stable subsets of $\mathbb{F}_p^n$, proved in earlier work of the authors, to the realm of higher-order Fourier analysis.
  This result is strictly stronger than the structure theorem for sets of bounded $\mathrm{VC}_2$-dimension, first proved by the authors in earlier versions of this paper and now available as a separate manuscript. Taken together, these results provide group theoretic analogues of results obtained for 3-uniform hypergraphs in arXiv:2111.01737.</description>

      <title>Palindromicity of the numerator of a statistical generating function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02652v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Bourn and Willenbring (2020) regarding the palindromicity and unimodality of a certain family of polynomials $N_n(t)$. These recursively defined polynomials arise as the numerators of generating functions in the context of the discrete one-dimensional earth mover's distance (EMD). The key to our proof is showing that the defining recursion can be viewed as describing sums of symmetric differences of pairs of Young diagrams; in this setting, palindromicity is equivalent to the preservation of the symmetric difference under the transposition of diagrams. We also observe a connection to recent work by Defant et al. (2024) on the Wiener index of minuscule lattices, which we reinterpret combinatorially to obtain explicit formulas for the coefficients of $N_n(t)$ and for the expected value of the discrete EMD.</description>

      <title>Clique packings in random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the question of how many edge-disjoint near-maximal cliques may be found in the dense Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n,p)$. Recently Acan and Kahn showed that the largest such family contains only $O(n^2/(\log{n})^3)$ cliques, with high probability, which disproved a conjecture of Alon and Spencer. We prove the corresponding lower bound, $\Omega(n^2/(\log{n})^3)$, by considering a random graph process which sequentially selects and deletes near-maximal cliques. To analyse this process we use the Differential Equation Method. We also give a new proof of the upper bound $O(n^2/(\log{n})^3)$ and discuss the problem of the precise size of the largest such clique packing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the Tits building B(G) of a finite group of Lie type G(Fq), we study the edge zeta function, which enumerates edge-geodesic cycles in the 1-skeleton. We show that every nonzero edge eigenvalue becomes a power of q after raising to a bounded exponent k depending on the type of G. The proof is uniform across types using a Hecke algebra approach. This extends previous results for type A and for oppositeness graphs to the full edge-geodesic setting and all finite groups of Lie type.</description>

      <title>An NP-hardness result for the colored constrained maximum 2-edge-colorable subgraph problem in bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the maximum $k$-edge-colorable subgraph problem. In this problem we are given a graph $G$ and a positive integer $k$, the goal is to take $k$ matchings of $G$ such that their union contains maximum number of edges. This problem is NP-hard in cubic graphs, and polynomial-time solvable in bipartite graphs as we observe in our paper. We present an NP-hardness result for a version of this problem where we have color constraints on vertices. In fact, we show that this version is NP-hard already in bipartite graphs of maximum degree three. In order to achieve the result, we establish a connection between our problem and the problem of construction of special maximum matchings considered in the Master thesis of the author and defended back in 2003.</description>

      <title>Independent Bondage Number in Graphs under Girth Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finite, simple graph $G$, the independent bondage number of $G$ is the minimum size of an edge set such that its deletion results in a graph with strictly larger independent domination number than that of $G$. While the bondage number of graphs under girth constraints has been studied, very few results have yet been established for the independent bondage number. In this study, we establish upper bounds on the independent bondage number of planar graphs under given girth constraints, extending results on the bondage number by Fischermann, Rautenbach, and Volkmann and on the structures of planar graphs by Borodin and Ivanova. In particular, we identify additional structures and establish bounds on the independent bondage number for planar graphs with $\delta (G) \geq 2$ and $g(G)\geq 5$, $\delta(G)\geq 3$ and $g(G)\geq 4$, and $\delta (G) \geq 2$ and $g(G)\geq 10$.</description>

      <title>Bounding the Chromatic Number via High Dimensional Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A geometrization method that transforms a $(d+1)$-connected graph $G$ into a $(d-1)$-dimensional manifold $U^{d-1}(G)$ is first established through adding some $i$-balls with $2\le i \le d-1$ into $G$ such that the $j$-th homotopy group is trivial for $j=0, 1, \dots, d-2$. On this basis, we establish a sufficient condition for $U^{d-1}(G)$ to be embedded into $\mathbb{R}^d$ and an upper bound for $\chi(G)$, the chromatic number of $G$. To be more specific, we prove that if $G$ contains neither $K_{d+3}$ nor $K_{3,d+1}$ as a minor, then $U^{d-1}(G)$ embeds into $\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\chi(G) \leq d(d+1)$. Furthermore, based on the above theorem, we extend the Discharging method, originally developed for the study of the four color theorem, to $\mathbb{R}^d$. This generalized approach can be applied to investigate the coloring problems in $\mathbb{R}^d$.</description>

      <title>$\lambda$-matchability in cubic graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12823v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A vertex $v$ of a 2-connected cubic graph $G$ is $\lambda$-matchable if $G$ has a spanning subgraph in which $v$ has degree three whereas every other vertex has degree one, and we let $\lambda(G)$ denote the number of such vertices. Clearly, $\lambda=0$ for bipartite graphs; ergo, we define $\lambda$-matchable pairs analogously, and we let $\rho(G)$ denote the number of such pairs.
  We improve the constant lower bounds on both $\lambda$ and $\rho$ established recently by Chen, Lu and Zhang [Discrete Math., 2025] using matching-theoretic parameters arising from the seminal work of Lov\'asz [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 1987], and we characterize all of the tight examples. We also solve the problem posed by Chen, Lu and Zhang: characterize 2-connected cubic graphs that satisfy $\lambda=n$.</description>

      <title>Totally positive Toeplitz matrices: classical and modern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By a theorem of Edrei, an infinite, normalised totally nonnegative upper-triangular Toeplitz matrix is determined by a pair of nonnegative parameter sequences, the `Schoenberg parameters', where nonzero parameters correspond to the roots and poles of a naturally associated generating function. These totally nonnegative Toeplitz matrices and their parameters also arise in the classification of characters of the infinite symmetric group by later work of Thoma. Moreover the Schoenberg parameters have an asymptotic interpretation in terms of irreducible representations of S_n and their Young diagrams by Vershik-Kerov. In this article we consider infinite totally positive Toeplitz matrices as limits of finite ones, and we obtain two further asymptotic descriptions of the Schoenberg parameters that are now related to quantum cohomology of the flag variety as n goes to infinity. One is related to asymptotics of normalised quantum parameters, and the other to asymptotics of the Chern classes of the tautological line bundles. We also describe the asymptotics of (quantum) Schubert classes in terms of the Schoenberg parameters. Our limit formulas relate to and were motivated by a tropical analogue of this theory that we survey. In the tropical setting one finds an asymptotic relationship between the `tropical Schoenberg parameters' and the weight map from Lusztig's parametrisation of the canonical basis.</description>

      <title>A High-Dimensional Extension of Wagner's Theorem and the Geometrization of Hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a geometric representation of hypergraphs by representing hyperedges as simplices. Building on this framework, we employ homotopy groups to analyze the topological structure of hypergraphs embedded in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Leveraging this foundation, we extend Wagner's theorem to $\mathbb{R}^d$. Specifically, we establish that a triangulated $d$-uniform topological hypergraph embeds into $\mathbb{R}^d$ if and only if it contains neither $K_{d+3}^d$ nor $K_{3,d+1}^d$ as a minor. Here, a triangulated $d$-uniform topological hypergraph constitutes a geometrized form of a $d$-uniform hypergraph, while $K_{d+3}^d$ and $K_{3,d+1}^d$ are the high-dimensional generalizations of the complete graph $K_5$ and the complete bipartite graph $K_{3,3}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Canonical Ramsey: triangles, rectangles and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a seminal work, Cheng and Xu showed that if $S$ is a square or a triangle with a certain property, then for every positive integer $r$ there exists $n_0(S)$ independent of $r$ such that every $r$-coloring of $\mathbb{E}^n$ with $n\ge n_0(S)$ contains a monochromatic or a rainbow congruent copy of $S$. Geh\'{e}r, Sagdeev, and T\'{o}th formalized this dimension independence as the canonical Ramsey property and proved it for all hypercubes, thereby covering rectangles whose squared aspect ratio $(a/b)^2$ is rational. They asked whether this property holds for all triangles and for all rectangles.
  (1) We resolve both questions. More precisely, for triangles we confirm the property in $\mathbb{E}^4$ by developing a novel rotation-sphereical chaining argument. For rectangles, we introduce a structural reduction to product configurations of bounded color complexity, enabling the use of the simplex Ramsey theorem together with product Ramsey theorem.
  (2) Beyond this, we develop a concise perturbation framework based on an iterative embedding coupled with the Frankl-R\"{o}dl simplex super-Ramsey theorem, which yields the canonical Ramsey property for a natural class of 3-dimensional simplices and also furnishes an alternative proof for triangles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.05751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a compact Polish group of finite topological dimension. For a countably infinite subset $S\subseteq \Gamma$, a domatic $\aleph_0$-partition (for its Schreier graph on $\Gamma$) is a partial function $f:\Gamma\rightharpoonup\mathbb{N}$ such that for every $x\in \Gamma$, one has $f[S\cdot x]=\mathbb{N}$. We show that a continuous domatic $\aleph_0$-partition exists, if and only if a Baire measurable domatic $\aleph_0$-partition exists, if and only if the topological closure of $S$ is uncountable. A Haar measurable domatic $\aleph_0$-partition exists for all choices of $S$. We also investigate domatic partitions in the general descriptive graph combinatorial setting.</description>

      <title>Menger's Theorem for Temporal Paths (Not Walks)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.15251v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A (directed) temporal graph is a (directed) graph whose edges are available only at specific times during its (discretized) lifetime $\tau$. In this setting, we ask that walks respect the temporal aspect by defining $\textit{temporal walks}$ as sequences of adjacent edges whose appearing times are either strictly increasing or non-decreasing (here called non-strict), depending on the scenario. The notion of disjointness between walks is also not unique: two walks are $\textit{vertex-disjoint}$ if they do not share a vertex, and are $\textit{temporal vertex-disjoint}$ if they do not share a vertex at the same time. Thus a $\textit{temporal path}$ is a temporal walk where no repetition of vertices, at any time, is allowed. This is an important distinction that separates the interpretation of our results from those of previous works on the topic. In this paper we focus on various questions regarding connectivity (maximum number of disjoint paths) and robustness (minimum size of a cut) between a given pair of vertices. Such problems are related to the well-known Menger's Theorem on static graphs. We explore all possible interpretations of such problems, according to vertex and temporal vertex-disjointness, strict and non-strict temporal paths, and directed and undirected temporal graphs. We present a number of new results, the main of which states that Menger's Theorem holds when the maximum number of temporal vertex-disjoint temporal paths is equal to 1.</description>

      <title>First Order Logic and Twin-Width in Tournaments and Dense Oriented Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.07683v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterise the classes of tournaments with tractable first-order model checking. For every hereditary class of tournaments $\mathcal T$, first-order model checking is either fixed parameter tractable or $\textrm{AW}[*]$-hard. This dichotomy coincides with the fact that $\mathcal T$ has either bounded or unbounded twin-width, and that the growth of $\mathcal T$ is either at most exponential or at least factorial. From the model-theoretic point of view, we show that NIP classes of tournaments coincide with bounded twin-width. Twin-width is also characterised by three infinite families of obstructions: $\mathcal T$ has bounded twin-width if and only if it excludes at least one tournament from each family. This generalises results of Bonnet et al.\ on ordered graphs.
  The key for these results is a polynomial time algorithm that takes as input a tournament $T$ and computes a linear order $&lt;$ on $V(T)$ such that the twin-width of the birelation $(T,&lt;)$ is at most some function of the twin-width of $T$. Since approximating twin-width can be done in polynomial time for an ordered structure $(T,&lt;)$, this provides a polynomial time approximation of twin-width for tournaments.
  Our results extend to oriented graphs with stable sets of bounded size, which may also be augmented by arbitrary binary relations.</description>

This allows us to generalize the in-degree polynomial invariant of links to linkoids. Additionally, we introduce a new linkoid invariant, which we call the in-degree quiver polynomial matrix. Lastly, we study the pointed quandle coloring quivers of linkoids of $(p,2)$-torus type with respect to pointed dihedral quandles.</description>

      <title>Chern Classes of Open Projected Richardson Varieties and of Affine Schubert Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The open projected Richardson varieties form a stratification for the partial flag variety $G/P$. We compare the Segre--MacPherson classes of open projected Richardson varieties with those of the corresponding affine Schubert cells by pushing or pulling these classes to the affine Grassmannian. In the case of the Grassmannian $G/P=\operatorname{Gr}_k(\mathbb{C}^n)$, the open projected Richardson varieties are known as open positroid varieties. We obtain symmetric functions that represent the Segre--MacPherson classes of these open positroid varieties, constructed explicitly in terms of pipe dreams for affine permutations.</description>

      <title>Thomason-Type Model Structures on Simplicial Complexes and Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the Matsushita model structure on loop graphs, which is right-transferred from the Kan-Quillen model structure on simplicial sets, factors through two other right-transferred model structures on simplicial complexes and reflexive graphs. We show that each Quillen adjunction between these right-transferred model categories is a Quillen equivalence. These model structures are analogous to the Thomason model structure on small categories, and we prove that they are all cofibrantly generated and proper. Furthermore we show that all cofibrant simplicial complexes are flag complexes, and all forests are cofibrant.</description>

      <title>Metric Poincar\'e inequalities for graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article considers embeddings of bounded degree graphs into general metric spaces. Our first main result is a metric analogue of Matou\v{s}ek's extrapolation that relates the Poincar\'e constants $\gamma(G,\varrho^p)$ and $\gamma(G,\varrho^q)$ for any pair of exponents $0 &lt; p,q &lt; \infty$, any bounded degree expander graph $G$, and any metric space $\mathcal{M}=(M,\varrho)$. Our second main result provides a sharp estimate of the Poincar\'e constant $\gamma(G,\varrho)$ in terms of the cardinalities of the vertex set of $G$ and the target metric space $\mathcal{M}=(M,\varrho)$, in the setting of \textit{random} graphs. Both theorems utilize a novel structural dichotomy for metric embeddings of graphs.
  These results lead to the resolution of several problems within the theory of metric embeddings. Among the applications are estimates on the nonlinear spectral gap of metric snowflakes, optimal estimates on the minimum cardinality of (bi-Lipschitz) universal metric spaces for graphs, and sharp lower bounds on the bi-Lipschitz distortion of random regular graphs into arbitrary metric spaces of large cardinality.</description>

      <title>Balanced Fibonacci word rectangles, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following a recent paper of Anselmo et al., we consider $m \times n$ rectangular matrices formed from the Fibonacci word, and we show that their balance properties can be solved with a finite automaton. We also generalize the result to every Sturmian characteristic word corresponding to a quadratic irrational. Finally, we also examine the analogous question for the Tribonacci word.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of the Gaussian measure under Banaszczyk transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the proof of his famous 5K-theorem, W. Banaszczyk introduced a transformation of convex bodies for which the Gaussian measure is monotone. In this note, we present a simplified proof of this monotonicity by slightly modifying Banaszczyk's transform, so that it interacts smoothly with Ehrhard symmetrizations, thereby yielding a somewhat easier proof of the 5K-theorem.</description>

      <title>Approximating the coefficients of the Bessel functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the type A, BC, and D root systems, we determine equivalent conditions between the coefficients of an exponential holomorphic function and the asymptotic values taken by the Dunkl bilinear form when one of its entries is the function. We establish these conditions over the $|\theta N| \rightarrow\infty$ regime for the type A and D root systems and over the $|\theta_0 N|\rightarrow \infty, \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0 N}\rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type BC root system. We also generalize existing equivalent conditions over the $\theta N \rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type A root system and over the $\theta_0 N\rightarrow c_0\in\mathbb{C}, \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0 N}\rightarrow c_1\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type BC root system and prove new equivalent conditions over the $\theta N \rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type D root system. Furthermore, we determine the asymptotics of the coefficients of the Bessel functions over the regimes that we have mentioned.</description>
