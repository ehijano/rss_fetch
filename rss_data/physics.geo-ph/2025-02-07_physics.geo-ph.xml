      <title>Pre-stack and post-stack seismic inversion using quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers. Quantum annealing, a specialized approach within quantum computing, is particularly effective for optimization tasks, as it leverages quantum tunneling to escape local minima and efficiently explore complex energy landscapes. In geosciences, many problems are framed as high-dimensional optimization problems, including seismic inversion, which aims to estimate subsurface impedances from seismic data for accurate geological interpretation and resource exploration. This study presents a novel application of quantum computing for seismic inversion, marking the first instance of inverting seismic data to estimate both P-wave and S-wave impedances using a quantum annealer. Building upon our prior work, which demonstrated the estimation of acoustic impedances from post-stack data using a two-step framework, we propose an enhanced workflow capable of inverting both post-stack and pre-stack seismic data in a single step. This advancement significantly reduces the number of qubits per model parameter (from 20 to 5) while improving computational speed (from 20 seconds to 6.3 seconds). The seismic inversion is implemented using the D-Wave Leap hybrid solver, achieving impedance estimation within 4-9 seconds, with the quantum processing unit (QPU) contributing just 0.043-0.085 seconds. Comparative analysis with simulated annealing reveals that quantum annealing produces impedance models closely matching true values in a single epoch, whereas simulated annealing requires 10 epochs for improved accuracy. These findings underscore the transformative potential of quantum computing for real-time, high-precision seismic inversion, marking a crucial step toward fully quantum-driven geophysical solutions.</description>

      <title>Differentiating frictionally locked asperities from kinematically coupled zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seismogenic areas on plate-boundary faults resist slipping until earthquakes are incurred. Therefore, slip deficit, also called coupling, is an interseismic proxy of seismic potential. However, when a part of a frictional interface sticks together (locked), its sliding surroundings are braked and slowed (coupled), so the coupled zone is an overestimate of the locked zone. Several indicators collectively termed mechanical coupling have been proposed to capture locked zones, but their relationship with true frictional locking is unclear. This study investigates the frictional physics that locked and unlocked zones should observe, elucidating the physical foundation of inference on frictionally locked segments, known as asperities in fault mechanics. We assemble the definitions of locking in various frictional failures and arrive at its unified expression. (I) In any friction law, locking means zero slip rate (pre-yield), and unlocking means stress at strength (post-yield). (II) Intersesismically, while locking keeps denoting a stationary state with constant slip, unlocking becomes synonymous with a quasi-steady state of constant stress. Then, we parametrize locked zones as distributed circular asperities on unlocked interfaces to develop a transdimensional slip-deficit inversion that incorporates the physical constraints of locking-unlocking. Our method with geodetic data detects five primary asperities in the Nankai subduction zone in southwestern Japan. Detected asperities spatially correlate with seafloor topography. Their locations are also consistent with slip zones of historical megathrust earthquakes but mostly non-overlapping with slow-earthquake occurrence zones at depth, supporting the hypothesis that the areas hosting slow earthquakes are normally in long-term and long-wavelength scales coupled but unlocked.</description>

      <title>Biogeochemistry-Informed Neural Network (BINN) for Improving Accuracy of Model Prediction and Scientific Understanding of Soil Organic Carbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00672</link>

Abstract: Big data and the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) provide unprecedented opportunities to enhance our understanding of the global carbon cycle and other biogeochemical processes. However, retrieving mechanistic knowledge from big data remains a challenge. Here, we develop a Biogeochemistry-Informed Neural Network (BINN) that seamlessly integrates a vectorized process-based soil carbon cycle model (i.e., Community Land Model version 5, CLM5) into a neural network (NN) structure to examine mechanisms governing soil organic carbon (SOC) storage from big data. BINN demonstrates high accuracy in retrieving biogeochemical parameter values from synthetic data in a parameter recovery experiment. We use BINN to predict six major processes regulating the soil carbon cycle (or components in process-based models) from 25,925 observed SOC profiles across the conterminous US and compared them with the same processes previously retrieved by a Bayesian inference-based PROcess-guided deep learning and DAta-driven modeling (PRODA) approach (Tao et al. 2020; 2023). The high agreement between the spatial patterns of the retrieved processes using the two approaches with an average correlation coefficient of 0.81 confirms BINN's ability in retrieving mechanistic knowledge from big data. Additionally, the integration of neural networks and process-based models in BINN improves computational efficiency by more than 50 times over PRODA. We conclude that BINN is a transformative tool that harnesses the power of both AI and process-based modeling, facilitating new scientific discoveries while improving interpretability and accuracy of Earth system models.</description>

      <title>Rapid hydrofracture of icy moon shells: insights from glaciology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09888v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Europa's surface exhibits many regions of complex topography termed 'chaos terrains'. One set of hypotheses for chaos terrain formation requires upward migration of liquid water from perched water bodies within the icy shell formed by convection and tidal heating. However, consideration of the behavior of terrestrial ice sheets suggests the upwards movement of water from englacial water bodies is uncommon. Instead, rapid downwards hydrofracture from supraglacial lakes - unbounded given a sufficient volume of water - can occur in relatively low tensile stress states given a sufficiently deep initial fracture due to the negative relative buoyancy of water. I suggest that downwards, not upwards, fracture may be more reasonable for perched water bodies but show that full hydrofracture is unlikely if the perched water body is located beneath a mechanically strong icy lid. However, full hydrofracture is possible in the event of lid break up over a perched water body and likely in the event of a meteor impact that generates sufficient meltwater and a tensile shock. This provides a possible mechanism for the transfer of biologically important nutrients to the subsurface ocean and the formation of chaos terrains.</description>
