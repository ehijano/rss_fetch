      <title>Harmful Traits of AI Companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amid the growing prevalence of human -- AI interaction, large language models and other AI-based entities increasingly provide forms of companionship to human users. Such AI companionship -- i.e., bonded relationships between humans and AI systems that resemble the relationships people have with family members, friends, and romantic partners -- might substantially benefit humans. Yet such relationships can also do profound harm. We propose a framework for analyzing potential negative impacts of AI companionship by identifying specific harmful traits of AI companions and speculatively mapping causal pathways back from these traits to possible causes and forward to potential harmful effects. We provide detailed, structured analysis of four potentially harmful traits -- the absence of natural endpoints for relationships, vulnerability to product sunsetting, high attachment anxiety, and propensity to engender protectiveness -- and briefly discuss fourteen others. For each trait, we propose hypotheses connecting causes -- such as misaligned optimization objectives and the digital nature of AI companions -- to fundamental harms -- including reduced autonomy, diminished quality of human relationships, and deception. Each hypothesized causal connection identifies a target for potential empirical evaluation. Our analysis examines harms at three levels: to human partners directly, to their relationships with other humans, and to society broadly. We examine how existing law struggles to address these emerging harms, discuss potential benefits of AI companions, and conclude with design recommendations for mitigating risks. This analysis offers immediate suggestions for reducing risks while laying a foundation for deeper investigation of this critical but understudied topic.</description>

      <title>A Quantitative Framework for Assessing Sleep Quality from EEG Time Series in Complex Dynamic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern lifestyles contribute to insufficient sleep, impairing cognitive function and weakening the immune system. Sleep quality (SQ) is vital for physiological and mental health, making its understanding and accurate assessment critical. However, its multifaceted nature, shaped by neurological and environmental factors, makes precise quantification challenging. Here, we address this challenge by utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) for phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) analysis to elucidate the neurological basis of SQ, examining both states of sleep and wakefulness, including resting state (RS) and working memory. Our results revealed distinct patterns in beta power and delta connectivity in sleep and RS, together with the reaction time of working memory. A notable finding was the pronounced delta-beta PAC, a feature markedly stronger in individuals with good SQ. We further observed that SQ was positively correlated with increased delta-beta PAC. Leveraging these insights, we applied machine learning models to classify SQ at an individual level, demonstrating that the delta-beta PAC outperformed other EEG characteristics. These findings establish delta-beta PAC as a robust electrophysiological marker to quantify SQ and elucidate its neurological determinants.</description>

      <title>Personalized targeted memory reactivation enhances consolidation of challenging memories via slow wave and spindle dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sleep is crucial for memory consolidation, underpinning effective learning. Targeted memory reactivation (TMR) can strengthen neural representations by re-engaging learning circuits during sleep. However, TMR protocols overlook individual differences in learning capacity and memory trace strength, limiting efficacy for difficult-to-recall memories. Here, we present a personalized TMR protocol that adjusts stimulation frequency based on individual retrieval performance and task difficulty during a word-pair memory task. In an experiment comparing personalized TMR, TMR, and control groups, the personalized protocol significantly reduced memory decay and improved error correction under challenging recall. Electroencephalogram (EEG) analyses revealed enhanced synchronization of slow waves and spindles, with a significant positive correlation between behavioral and EEG features for challenging memories. Multivariate classification identified distinct neural signatures linked to the personalized approach, highlighting its ability to target memory-specific circuits. These findings provide novel insights into sleep-dependent memory consolidation and support personalized TMR interventions to optimize learning outcomes.</description>

      <title>SWR-Viz: AI-assisted Interactive Visual Analytics Framework for Ship Weather Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and sustainable maritime transport increasingly depends on reliable forecasting and adaptive routing, yet operational adoption remains difficult due to forecast latencies and the need for human judgment in rapid decision-making under changing ocean conditions. We introduce SWR-Viz, an AI-assisted visual analytics framework that combines a physics-informed Fourier Neural Operator wave forecast model with SIMROUTE-based routing and interactive emissions analytics. The framework generates near-term forecasts directly from current conditions, supports data assimilation with sparse observations, and enables rapid exploration of what-if routing scenarios. We evaluate the forecast models and SWR-Viz framework along key shipping corridors in the Japan Coast and Gulf of Mexico, showing both improved forecast stability and realistic routing outcomes comparable to ground-truth reanalysis wave products. Expert feedback highlights the usability of SWR-Viz, its ability to isolate voyage segments with high emission reduction potential, and its value as a practical decision-support system. More broadly, this work illustrates how lightweight AI forecasting can be integrated with interactive visual analytics to support human-centered decision-making in complex geospatial and environmental domains.</description>

      <title>Efficient Transformer-Integrated Deep Neural Architectures for Robust EEG Decoding of Complex Visual Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a pioneering approach in brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, featuring our novel concept of complex visual imagery for non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG)-based communication. Complex visual imagery, as proposed in our work, involves the user engaging in the mental visualization of complex upper limb movements. This innovative approach significantly enhances the BCI system, facilitating the extension of its applications to more sophisticated tasks such as EEG-based robotic arm control. By leveraging this advanced form of visual imagery, our study opens new horizons for intricate and intuitive mind-controlled interfaces. We developed an advanced deep learning architecture that integrates functional connectivity metrics with a convolutional neural network-image transformer. This framework is adept at decoding subtle user intentions, addressing the spatial variability in complex visual tasks, and effectively translating these into precise commands for robotic arm control. Our comprehensive offline and pseudo-online evaluations demonstrate the framework's efficacy in real-time applications, including the nuanced control of robotic arms. The robustness of our approach is further validated through leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, marking a significant step towards versatile, subject-independent BCI applications. This research highlights the transformative impact of advanced visual imagery and deep learning in enhancing the usability and adaptability of BCI systems, particularly in robotic arm manipulation.</description>

      <title>PresentCoach: Dual-Agent Presentation Coaching through Exemplars and Interactive Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective presentation skills are essential in education, professional communication, and public speaking, yet learners often lack access to high-quality exemplars or personalized coaching. Existing AI tools typically provide isolated functionalities such as speech scoring or script generation without integrating reference modeling and interactive feedback into a cohesive learning experience. We introduce a dual-agent system that supports presentation practice through two complementary roles: the Ideal Presentation Agent and the Coach Agent. The Ideal Presentation Agent converts user-provided slides into model presentation videos by combining slide processing, visual-language analysis, narration script generation, personalized voice synthesis, and synchronized video assembly. The Coach Agent then evaluates user-recorded presentations against these exemplars, conducting multimodal speech analysis and delivering structured feedback in an Observation-Impact-Suggestion (OIS) format. To enhance the authenticity of the learning experience, the Coach Agent incorporates an Audience Agent, which simulates the perspective of a human listener and provides humanized feedback reflecting audience reactions and engagement. Together, these agents form a closed loop of observation, practice, and feedback. Implemented on a robust backend with multi-model integration, voice cloning, and error handling mechanisms, the system demonstrates how AI-driven agents can provide engaging, human-centered, and scalable support for presentation skill development in both educational and professional contexts.</description>

      <title>DesignerlyLoop: Bridging the Cognitive Gap through Visual Node-Based Reasoning in Human-AI Collaborative Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer powerful support for design tasks, yet their goal-oriented, single-turn responses often misalign with the nonlinear, exploratory nature of design processes. This mismatch creates a cognitive gap, limiting designers' ability to articulate evolving intentions, critically evaluate outputs, and maintain creative agency. To address these challenges, we developed DesignerlyLoop, a visual node-based system that embeds LLM reasoning chains into the design workflow. The system enables designers to externalize and curate reasoning structures, iteratively organize intentions, and interact with LLMs as dynamic cognitive engines rather than static answer providers. We conducted a within-subject study with 20 designers, combining qualitative and quantitative methods, and found that DesignerlyLoop enhanced creative reflection, design quality, and interaction experience by supporting systematic engagement with both human and machine reasoning. These findings highlight the potential of structured, interactive visualization to transform human-AI co-creation into a reflective and iterative design process.</description>

      <title>Reflexive Evidence-Based Multimodal Learning for Clean Energy Transitions: Causal Insights on Cooking Fuel Access, Urbanization, and Carbon Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) requires not only technological innovation but also a deeper understanding of the socioeconomic factors influencing energy access and carbon emissions. While these factors are gaining attention, critical questions remain, particularly regarding how to quantify their impacts on energy systems, model their cross-domain interactions, and capture feedback dynamics in the broader context of energy transitions. To address these gaps, this study introduces ClimateAgents, an AI-based framework that combines large language models with domain-specialized agents to support hypothesis generation and scenario exploration. Leveraging 20 years of socioeconomic and emissions data from 265 economies, countries and regions, and 98 indicators drawn from the World Bank database, the framework applies a machine learning based causal inference approach to identify key determinants of carbon emissions in an evidence-based, data driven manner. The analysis highlights three primary drivers: access to clean cooking fuels in rural areas, access to clean cooking fuels in urban areas, and the percentage of population living in urban areas. These findings underscore the critical role of clean cooking technologies and urbanization patterns in shaping emission outcomes. In line with growing calls for evidence-based AI policy, ClimateAgents offers a modular and reflexive learning system that supports the generation of credible and actionable insights for policy. By integrating heterogeneous data modalities, including structured indicators, policy documents, and semantic reasoning, the framework contributes to adaptive policymaking infrastructures that can evolve with complex socio-technical challenges. This approach aims to support a shift from siloed modeling to reflexive, modular systems designed for dynamic, context-aware climate action.</description>

      <title>People readily follow personal advice from AI but it does not improve their well-being</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People increasingly seek personal advice from large language models (LLMs), yet whether humans follow their advice, and its consequences for their well-being, remains unknown. In a longitudinal randomised controlled trial with a representative UK sample (N = 2,302), 75% of participants who had a 20-minute discussion with GPT-4o about health, careers or relationships subsequently reported following its advice. Based on autograder evaluations of chat transcripts, LLM advice rarely violated safety best practice. When queried 2-3 weeks later, participants who had interacted with personalised AI (with access to detailed user information) followed its advice more often in the real world and reported higher well-being than those advised by non-personalised AI. However, while receiving personal advice from AI temporarily reduced well-being, no differential long-term effects compared to a control emerged. Our results suggest that humans readily follow LLM advice about personal issues but doing so shows no additional well-being benefit over casual conversations.</description>

      <title>Game Master LLM: Task-Based Role-Playing for Natural Slang Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural and idiomatic expressions are essential for fluent, everyday communication, yet many second-language learners struggle to acquire and spontaneously use casual slang despite strong formal proficiency. To address this gap, we designed and evaluated an LLM-powered, task-based role-playing game in which a GPT-4o-based Game Master guides learners through an immersive, three-phase spoken narrative. After selecting five unfamiliar slang phrases to practice, participants engage in open-ended dialogue with non-player characters; the Game Master naturally incorporates the target phrases in rich semantic contexts (implicit input enhancement) while a dedicated Practice Box provides real-time explicit tracking and encouragement. Post-session, learners receive multi-level formative feedback analyzing the entire interaction.
  We evaluated the system in a between-subjects study with 14 international graduate students, randomly assigned to either the RPG condition or a control condition consisting of a traditional AI-led virtual classroom. Results from an immediate post-test show that the RPG group achieved greater gains in both comprehension of the target phrases and their accurate, contextual use in sentences. Quantitative analysis of in-activity word-usage frequency, combined with qualitative survey responses, further indicates that the game-based approach provided more practice opportunities and higher perceived engagement, resulting in a more natural learning experience. These findings highlight the potential of narrative-driven LLM interactions in vocabulary acquisition.</description>

      <title>DuoZone: A User-Centric, LLM-Guided Mixed-Initiative XR Window Management System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed reality (XR) environments offer vast spatial possibilities, but current window management systems require users to manually place, resize, and organize multiple applications across large 3D spaces. This creates cognitive and interaction burdens that limit productivity. We introduce DuoZone, a mixed-initiative XR window management system that combines user-defined spatial layouts with LLM-guided automation. DuoZone separates window management into two complementary zones. The Recommendation Zone enables fast setup by providing spatial layout templates and automatically recommending relevant applications based on user tasks and high-level goals expressed through voice or text. The Arrangement Zone supports precise refinement through direct manipulation, allowing users to adjust windows using natural spatial actions such as dragging, resizing, and snapping. Through this dual-zone approach, DuoZone promotes efficient organization while reducing user cognitive load. We conducted a user study comparing DuoZone with a baseline manual XR window manager. Results show that DuoZone improves task completion speed, reduces mental effort, and increases sense of control when working with multiple applications in XR. We discuss design implications for future mixed-initiative systems and outline opportunities for integrating adaptive, goal-aware intelligence into spatial computing workflows.</description>

      <title>Infrastructuring Pop-Up Cities with "Social Layer": Designing Serendipitous Co-Livings for Temporary Intentional Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After the pandemic, a new form of "pop-up city" has emerged -- co-living gatherings of 100-200 people for 4-8 weeks that differ from conferences and hack houses. These temporary intentional communities leverages existing urban infrastructure, blending daily life (housing, meals, care) with self-organized activities like learning, creating, and socializing. They coordinate bottom-up programming through an "unconference" system for identity, calendaring, RSVP, and social discovery that fosters spontaneous, serendipitous, enduring ties. This paper examines the design of "Social Layer," an unconferencing system for pop-up cities. We studied its real-world deployment in ShanHaiWoo (Jilin, China, 2023), muChiangmai (Chiangmai, Thailand, 2023), Edge Esmeralda, Edge Esmeralda (Healdsburg, CA, USA, 2024), Aleph (Buenos Aires, Argentina, 2024), and Gathering of Tribe (Lisbon, Portugal, 2024). Our findings distill: (1) the strong concept "scaffolded spontaneity" -- infrastructural affordances that balance structure with openness, amplifying participant agency while maintaining privacy and lightweight governance; (2) design implications for design researchers working on pop-up cities.</description>

      <title>How Should the Law Treat Future AI Systems? Fictional Legal Personhood versus Legal Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The law draws a sharp distinction between objects and persons, and between two kinds of persons, the ''fictional'' kind (i.e. corporations), and the ''non-fictional'' kind (individual or ''natural'' persons). This paper will assess whether we maximize overall long-term legal coherence by (A) maintaining an object classification for all future AI systems, (B) creating fictional legal persons associated with suitably advanced, individuated AI systems (giving these fictional legal persons derogable rights and duties associated with certified groups of existing persons, potentially including free speech, contract rights, and standing to sue ''on behalf of'' the AI system), or (C) recognizing non-fictional legal personhood through legal identity for suitably advanced, individuated AI systems (recognizing them as entities meriting legal standing with non-derogable rights which for the human case include life, due process, habeas corpus, freedom from slavery, and freedom of conscience). We will clarify the meaning and implications of each option along the way, considering liability, copyright, family law, fundamental rights, civil rights, citizenship, and AI safety regulation. We will tentatively find that the non-fictional personhood approach may be best from a coherence perspective, for at least some advanced AI systems. An object approach may prove untenable for sufficiently humanoid advanced systems, though we suggest that it is adequate for currently existing systems as of 2025. While fictional personhood would resolve some coherence issues for future systems, it would create others and provide solutions that are neither durable nor fit for purpose. Finally, our review will suggest that ''hybrid'' approaches are likely to fail and lead to further incoherence: the choice between object, fictional person and non-fictional person is unavoidable.</description>

      <title>Simulated Human Learning in a Dynamic, Partially-Observed, Time-Series Environment</title>

Abstract: While intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) can use information from past students to personalize instruction, each new student is unique. Moreover, the education problem is inherently difficult because the learning process is only partially observable. We therefore develop a dynamic, time-series environment to simulate a classroom setting, with student-teacher interventions - including tutoring sessions, lectures, and exams. In particular, we design the simulated environment to allow for varying levels of probing interventions that can gather more information. Then, we develop reinforcement learning ITSs that combine learning the individual state of students while pulling from population information through the use of probing interventions. These interventions can reduce the difficulty of student estimation, but also introduce a cost-benefit decision to find a balance between probing enough to get accurate estimates and probing so often that it becomes disruptive to the student. We compare the efficacy of standard RL algorithms with several greedy rules-based heuristic approaches to find that they provide different solutions, but with similar results. We also highlight the difficulty of the problem with increasing levels of hidden information, and the boost that we get if we allow for probing interventions. We show the flexibility of both heuristic and RL policies with regards to changing student population distributions, finding that both are flexible, but RL policies struggle to help harder classes. Finally, we test different course structures with non-probing policies and we find that our policies are able to boost the performance of quiz and midterm structures more than we can in a finals-only structure, highlighting the benefit of having additional information.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal Consistency-Guided Active Learning for Affective BCI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models perform best with abundant, high-quality labels, yet such conditions are rarely achievable in EEG-based emotion recognition. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are easily corrupted by artifacts and individual variability, while emotional labels often stem from subjective and inconsistent reports-making robust affective decoding particularly difficult. We propose an uncertainty-aware active learning framework that enhances robustness to label noise by jointly leveraging model uncertainty and cross-modal consistency. Instead of relying solely on EEG-based uncertainty estimates, the method evaluates cross-modal alignment to determine whether uncertainty originates from cognitive ambiguity or sensor noise. A representation alignment module embeds EEG and face features into a shared latent space, enforcing semantic coherence between modalities. Residual discrepancies are treated as noise-induced inconsistencies, and these samples are selectively queried for oracle feedback during active learning. This feedback-driven process guides the network toward reliable, informative samples and reduces the impact of noisy labels. Experiments on the ASCERTAIN dataset examine the efficiency and robustness of ours, highlighting its potential as a data-efficient and noise-tolerant approach for EEG-based affective decoding in brain-computer interface systems.</description>

      <title>Teaching According to Students' Aptitude: Personalized Mathematics Tutoring via Persona-, Memory-, and Forgetting-Aware LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into intelligent tutoring systems to provide human-like and adaptive instruction. However, most existing approaches fail to capture how students' knowledge evolves dynamically across their proficiencies, conceptual gaps, and forgetting patterns. This challenge is particularly acute in mathematics tutoring, where effective instruction requires fine-grained scaffolding precisely calibrated to each student's mastery level and cognitive retention. To address this issue, we propose TASA (Teaching According to Students' Aptitude), a student-aware tutoring framework that integrates persona, memory, and forgetting dynamics for personalized mathematics learning. Specifically, TASA maintains a structured student persona capturing proficiency profiles and an event memory recording prior learning interactions. By incorporating a continuous forgetting curve with knowledge tracing, TASA dynamically updates each student's mastery state and generates contextually appropriate, difficulty-calibrated questions and explanations. Empirical results demonstrate that TASA achieves superior learning outcomes and more adaptive tutoring behavior compared to representative baselines, underscoring the importance of modeling temporal forgetting and learner profiles in LLM-based tutoring systems.</description>

      <title>Opinion Dynamics Models for Sentiment Evolution in Weibo Blogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online social media platforms enable influencers to distribute content and quickly capture audience reactions, significantly shaping their promotional strategies and advertising agreements. Understanding how sentiment dynamics and emotional contagion unfold among followers is vital for influencers and marketers, as these processes shape engagement, brand perception, and purchasing behavior. While sentiment analysis tools effectively track sentiment fluctuations, dynamical models explaining their evolution remain limited, often neglecting network structures and interactions both among blogs and between their topic-focused follower groups. In this study, we tracked influential tech-focused Weibo bloggers over six months, quantifying follower sentiment from text-mined feedback. By treating each blogger's audience as a single "macro-agent", we find that sentiment trajectories follow the principle of iterative averaging -- a foundational mechanism in many dynamical models of opinion formation, a theoretical framework at the intersection of social network analysis and dynamical systems theory. The sentiment evolution aligns closely with opinion-dynamics models, particularly modified versions of the classical French-DeGroot model that incorporate delayed perception and distinguish between expressed and private opinions. The inferred influence structures reveal interdependencies among blogs that may arise from homophily, whereby emotionally similar users subscribe to the same blogs and collectively shape the shared sentiment expressed within these communities.</description>

      <title>Computer-Use Agents as Judges for Generative User Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUA) are becoming increasingly capable of autonomously operating digital environments through Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). Yet, most GUI remain designed primarily for humans--prioritizing aesthetics and usability--forcing agents to adopt human-oriented behaviors that are unnecessary for efficient task execution. At the same time, rapid advances in coding-oriented language models (Coder) have transformed automatic GUI design. This raises a fundamental question: Can CUA as judges to assist Coder for automatic GUI design? To investigate, we introduce AUI-Gym, a benchmark for Automatic GUI development spanning 52 applications across diverse domains. Using language models, we synthesize 1560 tasks that simulate real-world scenarios. To ensure task reliability, we further develop a verifier that programmatically checks whether each task is executable within its environment. Building on this, we propose a Coder-CUA in Collaboration framework: the Coder acts as Designer, generating and revising websites, while the CUA serves as Judge, evaluating functionality and refining designs. Success is measured not by visual appearance, but by task solvability and CUA navigation success rate. To turn CUA feedback into usable guidance, we design a CUA Dashboard that compresses multi-step navigation histories into concise visual summaries, offering interpretable guidance for iterative redesign. By positioning agents as both designers and judges, our framework shifts interface design toward agent-native efficiency and reliability. Our work takes a step toward shifting agents from passive use toward active participation in digital environments. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/showlab/AUI.</description>

      <title>A Decade of Systems for Human Data Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-data interaction (HDI) presents fundamentally different challenges from traditional data management. HDI systems must meet latency, correctness, and consistency needs that stem from usability rather than query semantics; failing to meet these expectations breaks the user experience. Moreover, interfaces and systems are tightly coupled; neither can easily be optimized in isolation, and effective solutions demand their co-design. This dependence also presents a research opportunity: rather than adapt systems to interface demands, systems innovations and database theory can also inspire new interaction and visualization designs. We survey a decade of our lab's work that embraces this coupling and argue that HDI systems are the foundation for reliable, interactive, AI-driven applications.</description>

      <title>MarkupLens: Balancing Computer Vision Assistance and Control in Professional Video Annotation for Video-Based Design Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video-Based Design (VBD) uses video as a primary medium for analyzing user interactions, prototyping, and generating design insights. However, current VBD workflows are constrained by labor-intensive, inconsistent manual annotations that fragment attention and delay insights. Computer Vision (CV)-powered automatic annotation offers opportunities to reduce manual effort while supporting higher-level interpretation. This paper investigates human-AI collaboration in video analysis by examining how different levels of automated support shape user experience in VBD. We developed MarkupLens, a CV-assisted annotation platform, and conducted a between-subjects eye-tracking study with 36 designers in an urban VBD case. We compared three levels of automation: no support, partial support, and full support, and found that higher levels improved annotation quality, reduced cognitive load, and interestingly, enriched reflection. Our insights on automation levels inform adjustable autonomy and mixed-initiative system design beyond VBD tasks.</description>

      <title>Challenges and Opportunities for Visual Analytics in Jurisprudence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06543v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Legal exploration, analysis, and interpretation remain complex and demanding tasks, even for experienced legal scholars, due to the domain-specific language, tacit legal concepts, and intentional ambiguities embedded in legal texts. In related, text-based domains, Visual Analytics (VA) has become an indispensable tool for navigating documents, representing knowledge, and supporting analytical reasoning. However, legal scholarship presents distinct challenges: it requires managing formal legal structure, drawing on tacit domain knowledge, and documenting intricate and accurate reasoning processes - needs that current VA system designs for law fail to address adequately. We identify and describe key challenges and underexplored opportunities in applying VA to law, exploring how these technologies might better serve the legal domain. Interviews with nine legal experts reveal that current legal information retrieval interfaces do not adequately support the navigational complexity of law, often forcing users to rely on internalized legal expertise instead. To address this gap, we identify a three-phase workflow for legal experts, which highlights opportunities for VA to support legal reasoning through knowledge externalization and provenance tracking, leveraging tree-, graph-, and hierarchy-based visualizations. Through this contribution, our work establishes a user-centered VA workflow for the legal domain, recognizing tacit legal knowledge as a critical element of sense-making and insight generation, and situates these contributions within a broader research agenda for VA in law and other text-based disciplines.</description>

      <title>IMUFace: Towards Always-On 3D Facial Reconstruction via Earphone Inertial Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02177v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The potential of facial expression reconstruction technology is significant, with applications in various fields such as human-computer interaction, affective computing, and virtual reality. Recent studies have proposed using ear-worn devices for facial expression reconstruction to address the environmental limitations and privacy concerns associated with traditional camera-based methods. However, these approaches still require improvements in terms of aesthetics and power consumption. This paper introduces a system called IMUFace. It uses inertial measurement units (IMUs) embedded in wireless earphones to detect subtle ear movements caused by facial muscle activities, allowing for covert and low-power facial reconstruction. A user study involving 12 participants was conducted, and a deep learning model named IMUTwinTrans was proposed. The results show that IMUFace can accurately predict users' facial landmarks with a precision of 2.21 mm, using only five minutes of training data. The predicted landmarks can be utilized to reconstruct a three-dimensional facial model. IMUFace operates at a sampling rate of 30 Hz with a relatively low power consumption of 58 mW. The findings presented in this study demonstrate the real-world applicability of IMUFace and highlight potential directions for further research to facilitate its practical adoption.</description>

      <title>The Trust Calibration Maturity Model for Characterizing and Communicating Trustworthiness of AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent proliferation of powerful AI systems has created a strong need for capabilities that help users to calibrate trust in those systems. As AI systems grow in scale, information required to evaluate their trustworthiness becomes less accessible, presenting a growing risk of using these systems inappropriately. We propose the Trust Calibration Maturity Model (TCMM) to characterize and communicate information about AI system trustworthiness. The TCMM incorporates five dimensions of analytic maturity: Performance Characterization, Bias &amp; Robustness Quantification, Transparency, Safety &amp; Security, and Usability. The TCMM can be presented along with system performance information to (1) help a user to appropriately calibrate trust, (2) establish requirements and track progress, and (3) identify research needs. Here, we discuss the TCMM and demonstrate it on two target tasks: using ChatGPT for high consequence nuclear science determinations, and using PhaseNet (an ensemble of seismic models) for categorizing sources of seismic events.</description>

      <title>Human-AI Collaboration and Explainability for 2D/3D Registration Quality Assurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: As surgery increasingly integrates advanced imaging, algorithms, and robotics to automate complex tasks, human judgment of system correctness remains a vital safeguard for patient safety. A critical example is 2D/3D registration, where small registration misalignments can lead to surgical errors. Current visualization strategies alone are insufficient to reliably enable humans to detect these misalignments, highlighting the need for enhanced decision-support tools.
  Methods: We propose the first artificial intelligence (AI) model tailored to 2D/3D registration quality assessment, augmented with explainable AI (XAI) mechanisms to clarify the model's predictions. Using both objective measures (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity, precision, specificity) and subjective evaluations (e.g., workload, trust, and understanding), we systematically compare decision-making across four conditions: AI-only, Human-only, Human+AI, and Human+XAI.
  Results: The AI-only condition achieved the highest accuracy, whereas collaborative paradigms (Human+AI and Human+XAI) improved sensitivity, precision, and specificity compared to standalone approaches. Participants experienced significantly lower workload in collaborative conditions relative to the Human-only condition. Moreover, participants reported a greater understanding of AI predictions in the Human+XAI condition than in Human+AI, although no significant differences were observed between the two collaborative paradigms in perceived trust or workload.
  Conclusion: Human-AI collaboration can enhance 2D/3D registration quality assurance, with explainability mechanisms improving user understanding. Future work should refine XAI designs to optimize decision-making performance and efficiency. Extending both the algorithmic design and human-XAI collaboration elements holds promise for more robust quality assurance of 2D/3D registration.</description>

      <title>Between Filters and Feeds: Investigating Douyin and WeChat's Influence on Chinese Adolescent Body Image</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the digital era, social media platforms play a pivotal role in shaping adolescents' body image perceptions. This study examines how Douyin and WeChat, two contrasting Chinese social media platforms, influence body image among Chinese male adolescents. Employing a platformization perspective, we surveyed 395 male adolescents aged 10 to 24 using the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire-Appearance Scales (MBSRQ-AS) to assess self-evaluation and body satisfaction. Our findings reveal that Douyin usage is significantly correlated with appearance evaluation and body area satisfaction, while WeChat usage shows no significant correlation with any body image dimensions. These results suggest that Douyin's algorithm-driven, video-centric environment intensifies exposure to idealized body standards, impacting users at a cognitive level. This study underscores the importance of considering platform-specific characteristics in understanding social media's impact on body image. It contributes to the broader discourse on how technological design and content modalities mediate psychological outcomes, offering insights for addressing body image concerns among male adolescents in China.</description>

      <title>What Makes a Visualization Image Complex?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08332v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the perceived visual complexity (VC) in data visualizations using objective image-based metrics. We collected VC scores through a large-scale crowdsourcing experiment involving 349 participants and 1,800 visualization images. We then examined how these scores align with 12 image-based metrics spanning information-theoretic, clutter, color, and our two object-based metrics. Our results show that both low-level image properties and the high-level elements affect perceived VC in visualization images; The number of corners and distinct colors are robust metrics across visualizations. Second, feature congestion, an information-theoretic metric capturing statistical patterns in color and texture, is the strongest predictor of perceived complexity in visualizations rich in the same stimuli; edge density effectively explains VC in node-link diagrams. Additionally, we observe a bell-curve effect for text annotations: increasing text-to-ink ratio (TiR) initially reduces complexity, reaching an optimal point, beyond which further text increases perceived complexity. Our quantification pipeline is also interpretable, enabling metric-based explanations, grounded in the VisComplexity2K dataset, bridging computational metrics with human perceptual responses. osf.io/5xe8a has the preregistration and osf.io/bdet6 has the VisComplexity2K dataset, source code, and all Apdx. and figures.</description>

      <title>MedBuild AI: An Agent-Based Hybrid Intelligence Framework for Reshaping Agency in Healthcare Infrastructure Planning through Generative Design for Medical Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11587v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Globally, disparities in healthcare infrastructure remain stark, leaving countless communities without access to even basic services. Traditional infrastructure planning is often slow and inaccessible, and although many architects are actively delivering humanitarian and aid-driven hospital projects worldwide, these vital efforts still fall far short of the sheer scale and urgency of demand. This paper introduces MedBuild AI, a hybrid-intelligence framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with deterministic expert systems to rebalance the early design and conceptual planning stages. As a web-based platform, it enables any region with satellite internet access to obtain guidance on modular, low-tech, low-cost medical building designs. The system operates through three agents: the first gathers local health intelligence via conversational interaction; the second translates this input into an architectural functional program through rule-based computation; and the third generates layouts and 3D models. By embedding computational negotiation into the design process, MedBuild AI fosters a reciprocal, inclusive, and equitable approach to healthcare planning, empowering communities and redefining agency in global healthcare architecture.</description>

      <title>SweeperBot: Making 3D Browsing Accessible through View Analysis and Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14567</link>

Abstract: Accessing 3D models remains challenging for Screen Reader (SR) users. While some existing 3D viewers allow creators to provide alternative text, they often lack sufficient detail about the 3D models. Grounded on a formative study, this paper introduces SweeperBot, a system that enables SR users to leverage visual question answering to explore and compare 3D models. SweeperBot answers SR users' visual questions by combining an optimal view selection technique with the strength of generative- and recognition-based foundation models. An expert review with 10 Blind and Low-Vision (BLV) users with SR experience demonstrated the feasibility of using SweeperBot to assist BLV users in exploring and comparing 3D models. The quality of the descriptions generated by SweeperBot was validated by a second survey study with 30 sighted participants.</description>

      <title>Streaming Generation of Co-Speech Gestures via Accelerated Rolling Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10488v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating co-speech gestures in real time requires both temporal coherence and efficient sampling. We introduce a novel framework for streaming gesture generation that extends Rolling Diffusion models with structured progressive noise scheduling, enabling seamless long-sequence motion synthesis while preserving realism and diversity. Our framework is universally compatible with existing diffusion-based gesture generation model, transforming them into streaming methods capable of continuous generation without requiring post-processing. We evaluate our framework on ZEGGS and BEAT, strong benchmarks for real-world applicability. Applied to state-of-the-art baselines on both datasets, it consistently outperforms them, demonstrating its effectiveness as a generalizable and efficient solution for real-time co-speech gesture synthesis. We further propose Rolling Diffusion Ladder Acceleration (RDLA), a new approach that employs a ladder-based noise scheduling strategy to simultaneously denoise multiple frames. This significantly improves sampling efficiency while maintaining motion consistency, achieving up to a 4x speedup with high visual fidelity and temporal coherence in our experiments. Comprehensive user studies further validate our framework ability to generate realistic, diverse gestures closely synchronized with the audio input.</description>

      <title>Inference of Human-derived Specifications of Object Placement via Demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As robots' manipulation capabilities improve for pick-and-place tasks (e.g., object packing, sorting, and kitting), methods focused on understanding human-acceptable object configurations remain limited expressively with regard to capturing spatial relationships important to humans. To advance robotic understanding of human rules for object arrangement, we introduce positionally-augmented RCC (PARCC), a formal logic framework based on region connection calculus (RCC) for describing the relative position of objects in space. Additionally, we introduce an inference algorithm for learning PARCC specifications via demonstrations. Finally, we present the results from a human study, which demonstrate our framework's ability to capture a human's intended specification and the benefits of learning from demonstration approaches over human-provided specifications.</description>

      <title>Spot The Ball: A Benchmark for Visual Social Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans excel at visual social inference, the ability to infer hidden elements of a scene from subtle behavioral cues such as other people's gaze, pose, and orientation. This ability drives everyday social reasoning in humans and is critical for developing more human-like AI agents. We introduce Spot The Ball, a challenging benchmark for evaluating visual social inference in vision-language models (VLMs) using sports as a test domain. The task is to localize a removed sports ball from soccer, basketball, and volleyball images. We present a curated evaluation set with human baselines and a scalable pipeline for generating additional test items. We evaluate four state-of-the-art VLMs (Gemini, GPT, LLaMA, Qwen) using three prompting strategies, finding that humans are consistently two to three times more accurate (20-34%) than models ($\leq$ 17%) across all sports. Our analyses show that models rely on superficial spatial heuristics--such as guessing near the image center or nearby players--while humans leverage social cues like gaze direction and body pose. These findings reveal a persistent human-model gap in visual social reasoning and underscore the need for architectures that explicitly encode structured behavioral cues to achieve robust, human-like inference.</description>

      <title>Step-Audio-EditX Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Step-Audio-EditX, the first open-source LLM-based audio model excelling at expressive and iterative audio editing encompassing emotion, speaking style, and paralinguistics alongside robust zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities. Our core innovation lies in leveraging only large-margin synthetic data, which circumvents the need for embedding-based priors or auxiliary modules. This large-margin learning approach enables both iterative control and high expressivity across voices, and represents a fundamental pivot from the conventional focus on representation-level disentanglement. Evaluation results demonstrate that Step-Audio-EditX surpasses both MiniMax-2.6-hd and Doubao-Seed-TTS-2.0 in emotion editing and other fine-grained control tasks.</description>

      <title>Critical or Compliant? The Double-Edged Sword of Reasoning in Chain-of-Thought Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explanations are often promoted as tools for transparency, but they can also foster confirmation bias; users may assume reasoning is correct whenever outputs appear acceptable. We study this double-edged role of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations in multimodal moral scenarios by systematically perturbing reasoning chains and manipulating delivery tones. Specifically, we analyze reasoning errors in vision language models (VLMs) and how they impact user trust and the ability to detect errors. Our findings reveal two key effects: (1) users often equate trust with outcome agreement, sustaining reliance even when reasoning is flawed, and (2) the confident tone suppresses error detection while maintaining reliance, showing that delivery styles can override correctness. These results highlight how CoT explanations can simultaneously clarify and mislead, underscoring the need for NLP systems to provide explanations that encourage scrutiny and critical thinking rather than blind trust. All code will be released publicly.</description>
