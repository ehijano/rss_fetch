      <title>Qiskit Quantum Circuits Posit Singlet state in Radical Pair-based Magnetoreception of Migratory Birds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing applications in diverse domains are emerging rapidly. Given the limitations of classical computing techniques, the peculiarity of quantum circuits, which can observe quantum phenomena such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum coherence, is remarkable. This capability enables them to achieve measurement sensitivities far beyond classical limits. Research on radical pair-based magnetoreception in migratory birds has been a focus area for quite some time. A quantum mechanics-based computing approach, thus unsurprisingly, identifies a scope of application. In this study, to observe the phenomenon, electron-nucleus spin quantum circuits for different geomagnetic fluxes have been simulated and run through IBM Qiskit quantum processing units with error mitigation techniques. The results of different quantum states are consistent, suggesting singlet-triplet mechanisms that can be emulated, resembling the environment-enabling flights of migratory birds through generations of the avian species. The four-qubit model emulating electron-nucleus systems mimicking the environmental complexity outcome shows the sensitiveness to change of magnetic flux index, high probability of singlet-triplet dynamics, and upholding radical pair model states by the purity of the sub-system and full system outcome of coherence, the hallmark of singlet state dominance. The work involved performing fifty quantum circuits for different magnetic field values, each with one thousand and twenty-four shots for measurement, either in the simulator or on real quantum hardware, and for two error mitigation techniques, preceded by a noise model of a simulator run.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Characterization of Brain Tissue: Experimental Techniques, Human Testing Considerations, and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12346</link>

Abstract: Understanding the mechanical behavior of brain tissue is crucial for advancing both fundamental neuroscience and clinical applications. Yet, accurately measuring these properties remains challenging due to the brain unique mechanical attributes and complex anatomical structures. This review provides a comprehensive overview of commonly used techniques for characterizing brain tissue mechanical properties, covering both invasive methods such as atomic force microscopy, indentation, axial mechanical testing, and oscillatory shear testing and noninvasive approaches like magnetic resonance elastography and ultrasound elastography. Each technique is evaluated in terms of working principles, applicability, representative studies, and experimental limitations. We further summarize existing publications that have used these techniques to measure human brain tissue mechanical properties. With a primary focus on invasive studies, we systematically compare their sample preparation, testing conditions, reported mechanical parameters, and modeling strategies. Key sensitivity factors influencing testing outcomes (e.g., sample size, anatomical location, strain rate, temperature, conditioning, and post-mortem interval) are also discussed. Additionally, selected noninvasive studies are reviewed to assess their potential for in vivo characterization. A comparative discussion between invasive and noninvasive methods, as well as in vivo versus ex vivo testing, is included. This review aims to offer practical guidance for researchers and clinicians in selecting appropriate mechanical testing approaches and contributes a curated dataset to support constitutive modeling of human brain tissue.</description>

      <title>Boundary Effects and Oxygen Deficiency-Driven Pattern Transitions in Algal Bioconvection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suspensions of motile microorganisms can spontaneously give rise to large scale fluid motion, known as bioconvection, which is characterized by dense, cell-rich downwelling plumes interspersed with broad upwelling regions. In this study, we investigate bioconvection in shallow suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells confined within spiral-shaped boundaries, combining detailed experimental observations with 3D simulations. Under open liquid-air interface conditions, cells accumulate near the surface due to negative gravitaxis, forming spiral shaped density patterns that subsequently fragment into lattice-like structures and give rise to downwelling plumes. Space-time analyses reveal coherent rotational dynamics, with inward-moving patterns near the spiral core and bidirectional motion farther from the center. Introducing confinement by sealing the top boundary with an air-impermeable transparent wall triggers striking transitions in the bioconvection patterns, driven by oxygen depletion: initially stable structures reorganize into new patterns with reduced characteristic wavelengths. Complementary 3D simulations, based on the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and incorporating negative buoyancy and active stress from swimming cells, capture the initial pattern formation and its subsequent instability, reproducing the fragmentation of spiral-shaped accumulations into downwelling plumes and the emergence of strong vortical flows, nearly an order of magnitude faster than individual cell swimming speeds. However, these models do not capture the oxygen-driven pattern transitions observed experimentally. Our findings reveal that confinement geometry, oxygen dynamics, and metabolic transitions critically govern bioconvection pattern evolution, offering new strategies to control microbial self-organization and flow through environmental and geometric design.</description>

      <title>Physics Informed Constrained Learning of Dynamics from Static Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A physics-informed neural network (PINN) models the dynamics of a system by integrating the governing physical laws into the architecture of a neural network. By enforcing physical laws as constraints, PINN overcomes challenges with data scarsity and potentially high dimensionality. Existing PINN frameworks rely on fully observed time-course data, the acquisition of which could be prohibitive for many systems. In this study, we developed a new PINN learning paradigm, namely Constrained Learning, that enables the approximation of first-order derivatives or motions using non-time course or partially observed data. Computational principles and a general mathematical formulation of Constrained Learning were developed. We further introduced MPOCtrL (Message Passing Optimization-based Constrained Learning) an optimization approach tailored for the Constrained Learning framework that strives to balance the fitting of physical models and observed data. Its code is available at github link: https://github.com/ptdang1001/MPOCtrL Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrated that MPOCtrL can effectively detect the nonlinear dependency between observed data and the underlying physical properties of the system. In particular, on the task of metabolic flux analysis, MPOCtrL outperforms all existing data-driven flux estimators.</description>

      <title>The Dissipation Theory of Aging: A Quantitative Analysis Using a Cellular Aging Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new theory for aging based on dynamical systems and provide a data-driven computational method to quantify the changes at the cellular level. We use ergodic theory to decompose the dynamics of changes during aging and show that aging is fundamentally a dissipative process within biological systems, akin to dynamical systems where dissipation occurs due to non-conservative forces. To quantify the dissipation dynamics, we employ a transformer-based machine learning algorithm to analyze gene expression data, incorporating age as a token to assess how age-related dissipation is reflected in the embedding space. By evaluating the dynamics of gene and age embeddings, we provide a cellular aging map (CAM) and identify patterns indicative of divergence in gene embedding space, nonlinear transitions, and entropy variations during aging for various tissues and cell types. Our results provide a novel perspective on aging as a dissipative process and introduce a computational framework that enables measuring age-related changes with molecular resolution.</description>
