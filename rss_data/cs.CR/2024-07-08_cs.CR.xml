      <title>Soft Begging: Modular and Efficient Shielding of LLMs against Prompt Injection and Jailbreaking based on Prompt Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt injection (both direct and indirect) and jailbreaking are now recognized as significant issues for large language models (LLMs), particularly due to their potential for harm in application-integrated contexts. This extended abstract explores a novel approach to protecting LLMs from such attacks, termed "soft begging." This method involves training soft prompts to counteract the effects of corrupted prompts on the LLM's output. We provide an overview of prompt injections and jailbreaking, introduce the theoretical basis of the "soft begging" technique, and discuss an evaluation of its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>The Role of Privacy Guarantees in Voluntary Donation of Private Data for Altruistic Goals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voluntary donation of private information for altruistic purposes, such as advancing research, is common. However, concerns about data misuse and leakage may deter individuals from donating their information. While prior research has indicated that Privacy Enhancement Technologies (PETs) can alleviate these concerns, the extent to which these techniques influence willingness to donate data remains unclear.
  This study conducts a vignette survey (N=485) to examine people's willingness to donate medical data for developing new treatments under four privacy guarantees: data expiration, anonymization, use restriction, and access control. The study explores two mechanisms for verifying these guarantees: self-auditing and expert auditing, and evaluates the impact on two types of data recipient entities: for-profit and non-profit institutions.
  Our findings reveal that the type of entity collecting data strongly influences respondents' privacy expectations, which in part influence their willingness to donate data. Respondents have such high expectations of the privacy provided by non-profit entities that explicitly stating the privacy protections provided makes little adjustment to those expectations. In contrast, statements about privacy bring respondents' expectations of the privacy provided by for-profit entities nearly in-line with non-profit expectations. We highlight the risks of these respective results as well as the need for future research to better align technical community and end-user perceptions about the effectiveness of auditing PETs and to effectively set expectations about the efficacy of PETs in the face of end-user concerns about data breaches.</description>

      <title>On Large Language Models in National Security Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The overwhelming success of GPT-4 in early 2023 highlighted the transformative potential of large language models (LLMs) across various sectors, including national security. This article explores the implications of LLM integration within national security contexts, analyzing their potential to revolutionize information processing, decision-making, and operational efficiency. Whereas LLMs offer substantial benefits, such as automating tasks and enhancing data analysis, they also pose significant risks, including hallucinations, data privacy concerns, and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Through their coupling with decision-theoretic principles and Bayesian reasoning, LLMs can significantly improve decision-making processes within national security organizations. Namely, LLMs can facilitate the transition from data to actionable decisions, enabling decision-makers to quickly receive and distill available information with less manpower. Current applications within the US Department of Defense and beyond are explored, e.g., the USAF's use of LLMs for wargaming and automatic summarization, that illustrate their potential to streamline operations and support decision-making. However, these applications necessitate rigorous safeguards to ensure accuracy and reliability. The broader implications of LLM integration extend to strategic planning, international relations, and the broader geopolitical landscape, with adversarial nations leveraging LLMs for disinformation and cyber operations, emphasizing the need for robust countermeasures. Despite exhibiting "sparks" of artificial general intelligence, LLMs are best suited for supporting roles rather than leading strategic decisions. Their use in training and wargaming can provide valuable insights and personalized learning experiences for military personnel, thereby improving operational readiness.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) relies on resource-constrained devices deployed in unprotected environments. Different types of risks may be faced during data transmission in single-hop and multi-hop scenarios. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial. A systematic literature review of data provenance in IoT is presented, exploring existing techniques, practical implementations, security requirements, and performance metrics. Respective contributions and shortcomings are compared. A taxonomy related to the development of data provenance in IoT is proposed. Open issues are identified, and future research directions are presented, providing useful insights for the evolution of data provenance research in the context of the IoT.</description>

      <title>Releasing Large-Scale Human Mobility Histograms with Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environmental Insights Explorer (EIE) is a Google product that reports aggregate statistics about human mobility, including various methods of transit used by people across roughly 50,000 regions globally. These statistics are used to estimate carbon emissions and provided to policymakers to inform their decisions on transportation policy and infrastructure. Due to the inherent sensitivity of this type of user data, it is crucial that the statistics derived and released from it are computed with appropriate privacy protections. In this work, we use a combination of federated analytics and differential privacy to release these required statistics, while operating under strict error constraints to ensure utility for downstream stakeholders. In this work, we propose a new mechanism that achieves $ \epsilon \approx 2 $-DP while satisfying these strict utility constraints, greatly improving over natural baselines. We believe this mechanism may be of more general interest for the broad class of group-by-sum workloads.</description>

      <title>AntibotV: A Multilevel Behaviour-based Framework for Botnets Detection in Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connected cars offer safety and efficiency for both individuals and fleets of private vehicles and public transportation companies. However, equipping vehicles with information and communication technologies raises privacy and security concerns, which significantly threaten the user's data and life. Using bot malware, a hacker may compromise a vehicle and control it remotely, for instance, he can disable breaks or start the engine remotely. In this paper, besides in-vehicle attacks existing in the literature, we consider new zeroday bot malware attacks specific to the vehicular context, WSMP-Flood, and Geo-WSMP Flood. Then, we propose AntibotV, a multilevel behaviour-based framework for vehicular botnets detection in vehicular networks. The proposed framework combines two main modules for attack detection, the first one monitors the vehicle's activity at the network level, whereas the second one monitors the in-vehicle activity. The two intrusion detection modules have been trained on a historical network and in-vehicle communication using decision tree algorithms. The experimental results showed that the proposed framework outperforms existing solutions, it achieves a detection rate higher than 97% and a false positive rate lower than 0.14%.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Approach to S-box Generation: Optimizing Nonlinear Substitutions in Symmetric Ciphers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the application of genetic algorithms in generating highly nonlinear substitution boxes (S-boxes) for symmetric key cryptography. We present a novel implementation that combines a genetic algorithm with the Walsh-Hadamard Spectrum (WHS) cost function to produce 8x8 S-boxes with a nonlinearity of 104. Our approach achieves performance parity with the best-known methods, requiring an average of 49,399 iterations with a 100% success rate. The study demonstrates significant improvements over earlier genetic algorithm implementations in this field, reducing iteration counts by orders of magnitude. By achieving equivalent performance through a different algorithmic approach, our work expands the toolkit available to cryptographers and highlights the potential of genetic methods in cryptographic primitive generation. The adaptability and parallelization potential of genetic algorithms suggest promising avenues for future research in S-box generation, potentially leading to more robust, efficient, and innovative cryptographic systems. Our findings contribute to the ongoing evolution of symmetric key cryptography, offering new perspectives on optimizing critical components of secure communication systems.</description>

      <title>Scalable Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Verifying Cryptographic Hashing in Blockchain Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) have emerged as a promising solution to address the scalability challenges in modern blockchain systems. This study proposes a methodology for generating and verifying ZKPs to ensure the computational integrity of cryptographic hashing, specifically focusing on the SHA-256 algorithm. By leveraging the Plonky2 framework, which implements the PLONK protocol with FRI commitment scheme, we demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our approach for both random data and real data blocks from the NEAR blockchain. The experimental results show consistent performance across different data sizes and types, with the time required for proof generation and verification remaining within acceptable limits. The generated circuits and proofs maintain manageable sizes, even for real-world data blocks with a large number of transactions. The proposed methodology contributes to the development of secure and trustworthy blockchain systems, where the integrity of computations can be verified without revealing the underlying data. Further research is needed to assess the applicability of the approach to other cryptographic primitives and to evaluate its performance in more complex real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>PEDDiM: Formal Definitions and Provably Secure Designs for Pre-Execution DoS Defense in Mempools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mempool plays a crucial role in blockchain systems as a buffer zone for pending transactions before they are executed and included in a block. However, existing works primarily focus on mitigating defenses against already identified real-world attacks. This paper introduces secure blockchain-mempool designs capable of defending against any form of asymmetric eviction DoS attacks. We establish formal security definitions for mempools under the eviction-based attack vector. Our proposed secure transaction admission algorithm, named \textsc{saferAd-PR}, ensures eviction-security by providing a provable lower bound on the cost of executing eviction DoS attacks. Through evaluation with real transaction trace replays, \textsc{saferAd-PR} demonstrates negligible latency and significantly high lower bounds against any eviction attack, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness in securing blockchain mempools.</description>

      <title>Charging Ahead: A Hierarchical Adversarial Framework for Counteracting Advanced Cyber Threats in EV Charging Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates robust defenses against sophisticated cyber threats. A significant challenge arises when EVs intentionally provide false information to gain higher charging priority, potentially causing grid instability. While various approaches have been proposed in existing literature to address this issue, they often overlook the possibility of attackers using advanced techniques like deep reinforcement learning (DRL) or other complex deep learning methods to achieve such attacks. In response to this, this paper introduces a hierarchical adversarial framework using DRL (HADRL), which effectively detects stealthy cyberattacks on EV charging stations, especially those leading to denial of charging. Our approach includes a dual approach, where the first scheme leverages DRL to develop advanced and stealthy attack methods that can bypass basic intrusion detection systems (IDS). Second, we implement a DRL-based scheme within the IDS at EV charging stations, aiming to detect and counter these sophisticated attacks. This scheme is trained with datasets created from the first scheme, resulting in a robust and efficient IDS. We evaluated the effectiveness of our framework against the recent literature approaches, and the results show that our IDS can accurately detect deceptive EVs with a low false alarm rate, even when confronted with attacks not represented in the training dataset.</description>

      <title>Collection, usage and privacy of mobility data in the enterprise and public administrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human mobility data is a crucial resource for urban mobility management, but it does not come without personal reference. The implementation of security measures such as anonymization is thus needed to protect individuals' privacy. Often, a trade-off arises as such techniques potentially decrease the utility of the data and limit its use. While much research on anonymization techniques exists, there is little information on the actual implementations by practitioners, especially outside the big tech context. Within our study, we conducted expert interviews to gain insights into practices in the field. We categorize purposes, data sources, analysis, and modeling tasks to provide a profound understanding of the context such data is used in. We survey privacy-enhancing methods in use, which generally do not comply with state-of-the-art standards of differential privacy. We provide groundwork for further research on practice-oriented research by identifying privacy needs of practitioners and extracting relevant mobility characteristics for future standardized evaluations of privacy-enhancing methods.</description>

      <title>SRAS: Self-governed Remote Attestation Scheme for Multi-party Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), such as Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), ensure the confidentiality and integrity of user applications when using cloud computing resources. However, in the multi-party cloud computing scenario, how to select a Relying Party to verify the TEE of each party and avoid leaking sensitive data to each other remains an open question. In this paper, we propose SRAS, an open self-governed remote attestation scheme with attestation and verification functions for verifying the trustworthiness of TEEs and computing assets, achieving decentralized unified trusted attestation and verification platform for multi-party cloud users. In SRAS, we design a Relying Party enclave, which can form a virtual verifiable network, capable of local verification on behalf of other participants relying parties without leaking sensitive data to others. We provide an open-source prototype implementation of SRAS to facilitate the adoption of this technology by cloud users or developers.</description>

      <title>DART: Deep Adversarial Automated Red Teaming for LLM Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manual Red teaming is a commonly-used method to identify vulnerabilities in large language models (LLMs), which, is costly and unscalable. In contrast, automated red teaming uses a Red LLM to automatically generate adversarial prompts to the Target LLM, offering a scalable way for safety vulnerability detection. However, the difficulty of building a powerful automated Red LLM lies in the fact that the safety vulnerabilities of the Target LLM are dynamically changing with the evolution of the Target LLM. To mitigate this issue, we propose a Deep Adversarial Automated Red Teaming (DART) framework in which the Red LLM and Target LLM are deeply and dynamically interacting with each other in an iterative manner. In each iteration, in order to generate successful attacks as many as possible, the Red LLM not only takes into account the responses from the Target LLM, but also adversarially adjust its attacking directions by monitoring the global diversity of generated attacks across multiple iterations. Simultaneously, to explore dynamically changing safety vulnerabilities of the Target LLM, we allow the Target LLM to enhance its safety via an active learning based data selection mechanism. Experimential results demonstrate that DART significantly reduces the safety risk of the target LLM. For human evaluation on Anthropic Harmless dataset, compared to the instruction-tuning target LLM, DART eliminates the violation risks by 53.4\%. We will release the datasets and codes of DART soon.</description>

      <title>Protecting Deep Learning Model Copyrights with Adversarial Example-Free Reuse Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model reuse techniques can reduce the resource requirements for training high-performance deep neural networks (DNNs) by leveraging existing models. However, unauthorized reuse and replication of DNNs can lead to copyright infringement and economic loss to the model owner. This underscores the need to analyze the reuse relation between DNNs and develop copyright protection techniques to safeguard intellectual property rights. Existing white-box testing-based approaches cannot address the common heterogeneous reuse case where the model architecture is changed, and DNN fingerprinting approaches heavily rely on generating adversarial examples with good transferability, which is known to be challenging in the black-box setting. To bridge the gap, we propose NFARD, a Neuron Functionality Analysis-based Reuse Detector, which only requires normal test samples to detect reuse relations by measuring the models' differences on a newly proposed model characterization, i.e., neuron functionality (NF). A set of NF-based distance metrics is designed to make NFARD applicable to both white-box and black-box settings. Moreover, we devise a linear transformation method to handle heterogeneous reuse cases by constructing the optimal projection matrix for dimension consistency, significantly extending the application scope of NFARD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first adversarial example-free method that exploits neuron functionality for DNN copyright protection. As a side contribution, we constructed a reuse detection benchmark named Reuse Zoo that covers various practical reuse techniques and popular datasets. Extensive evaluations on this comprehensive benchmark show that NFARD achieves F1 scores of 0.984 and 1.0 for detecting reuse relationships in black-box and white-box settings, respectively, while generating test suites 2 ~ 99 times faster than previous methods.</description>

      <title>A Critical Assessment of Interpretable and Explainable Machine Learning for Intrusion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a large number of studies in interpretable and explainable ML for cybersecurity, in particular, for intrusion detection. Many of these studies have significant amount of overlapping and repeated evaluations and analysis. At the same time, these studies overlook crucial model, data, learning process, and utility related issues and many times completely disregard them. These issues include the use of overly complex and opaque ML models, unaccounted data imbalances and correlated features, inconsistent influential features across different explanation methods, the inconsistencies stemming from the constituents of a learning process, and the implausible utility of explanations. In this work, we empirically demonstrate these issues, analyze them and propose practical solutions in the context of feature-based model explanations. Specifically, we advise avoiding complex opaque models such as Deep Neural Networks and instead using interpretable ML models such as Decision Trees as the available intrusion datasets are not difficult for such interpretable models to classify successfully. Then, we bring attention to the binary classification metrics such as Matthews Correlation Coefficient (which are well-suited for imbalanced datasets. Moreover, we find that feature-based model explanations are most often inconsistent across different settings. In this respect, to further gauge the extent of inconsistencies, we introduce the notion of cross explanations which corroborates that the features that are determined to be impactful by one explanation method most often differ from those by another method. Furthermore, we show that strongly correlated data features and the constituents of a learning process, such as hyper-parameters and the optimization routine, become yet another source of inconsistent explanations. Finally, we discuss the utility of feature-based explanations.</description>

      <title>Real-time Cyberattack Detection with Collaborative Learning for Blockchain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the ever-increasing popularity of blockchain applications, securing blockchain networks plays a critical role in these cyber systems. In this paper, we first study cyberattacks (e.g., flooding of transactions, brute pass) in blockchain networks and then propose an efficient collaborative cyberattack detection model to protect blockchain networks. Specifically, we deploy a blockchain network in our laboratory to build a new dataset including both normal and attack traffic data. The main aim of this dataset is to generate actual attack data from different nodes in the blockchain network that can be used to train and test blockchain attack detection models. We then propose a real-time collaborative learning model that enables nodes in the network to share learning knowledge without disclosing their private data, thereby significantly enhancing system performance for the whole network. The extensive simulation and real-time experimental results show that our proposed detection model can detect attacks in the blockchain network with an accuracy of up to 97%.</description>

      <title>An applied Perspective: Estimating the Differential Identifiability Risk of an Exemplary SOEP Data Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using real-world study data usually requires contractual agreements where research results may only be published in anonymized form. Requiring formal privacy guarantees, such as differential privacy, could be helpful for data-driven projects to comply with data protection. However, deploying differential privacy in consumer use cases raises the need to explain its underlying mechanisms and the resulting privacy guarantees. In this paper, we thoroughly review and extend an existing privacy metric. We show how to compute this risk metric efficiently for a set of basic statistical queries. Our empirical analysis based on an extensive, real-world scientific data set expands the knowledge on how to compute risks under realistic conditions, while presenting more challenges than solutions.</description>

      <title>Certifiably Robust Image Watermark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI raises many societal concerns such as boosting disinformation and propaganda campaigns. Watermarking AI-generated content is a key technology to address these concerns and has been widely deployed in industry. However, watermarking is vulnerable to removal attacks and forgery attacks. In this work, we propose the first image watermarks with certified robustness guarantees against removal and forgery attacks. Our method leverages randomized smoothing, a popular technique to build certifiably robust classifiers and regression models. Our major technical contributions include extending randomized smoothing to watermarking by considering its unique characteristics, deriving the certified robustness guarantees, and designing algorithms to estimate them. Moreover, we extensively evaluate our image watermarks in terms of both certified and empirical robustness. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/zhengyuan-jiang/Watermark-Library}.</description>

      <title>Future Events as Backdoor Triggers: Investigating Temporal Vulnerabilities in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backdoors are hidden behaviors that are only triggered once an AI system has been deployed. Bad actors looking to create successful backdoors must design them to avoid activation during training and evaluation. Since data used in these stages often only contains information about events that have already occurred, a component of a simple backdoor trigger could be a model recognizing data that is in the future relative to when it was trained. Through prompting experiments and by probing internal activations, we show that current large language models (LLMs) can distinguish past from future events, with probes on model activations achieving $90\%$ accuracy. We train models with backdoors triggered by a temporal distributional shift; they activate when the model is exposed to news headlines beyond their training cut-off dates. Fine-tuning on helpful, harmless and honest (HHH) data does not work well for removing simpler backdoor triggers but is effective on our backdoored models, although this distinction is smaller for the larger-scale model we tested. We also find that an activation-steering vector representing a model's internal representation of the date influences the rate of backdoor activation. We take these results as initial evidence that, at least for models at the modest scale we test, standard safety measures are enough to remove these backdoors. We publicly release all relevant code (https://github.com/sbp354/Future_triggered_backdoors), datasets (https://tinyurl.com/future-backdoor-datasets), and models (https://huggingface.co/saraprice).</description>

      <title>Pathfinder: Exploring Path Diversity for Assessing Internet Censorship Inconsistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet censorship is typically enforced by authorities to achieve information control for a certain group of Internet users. So far existing censorship studies have primarily focused on country-level characterization because (1) in many cases, censorship is enabled by governments with nationwide policies and (2) it is usually hard to control how the probing packets are routed to trigger censorship in different networks inside a country. However, the deployment and implementation of censorship could be highly diverse at the ISP level. In this paper, we investigate Internet censorship from a different perspective by scrutinizing the diverse censorship deployment inside a country. Specifically, by leveraging an end-to-end measurement framework, we deploy multiple geo-distributed back-end control servers to explore various paths from one single vantage point. The generated traffic with the same domain but different control servers' IPs could be forced to traverse different transit networks, thereby being examined by different censorship devices if present. Through our large-scale experiments and in-depth investigation, we reveal that the diversity of Internet censorship caused by different routing paths inside a country is prevalent, implying that (1) the implementations of centralized censorship are commonly incomplete or flawed and (2) decentralized censorship is also common. Moreover, we identify that different hosting platforms also result in inconsistent censorship activities due to different peering relationships with the ISPs in a country. Finally, we present extensive case studies in detail to illustrate the configurations that lead to censorship inconsistency and explore the causes.</description>

      <title>SQLaser: Detecting DBMS Logic Bugs with Clause-Guided Fuzzing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Database Management Systems (DBMSs) are vital components in modern data-driven systems. Their complexity often leads to logic bugs, which are implementation errors within the DBMSs that can lead to incorrect query results, data exposure, unauthorized access, etc., without necessarily causing visible system failures. Existing detection employs two strategies: rule-based bug detection and coverage-guided fuzzing. In general, rule specification itself is challenging; as a result, rule-based detection is limited to specific and simple rules. Coverage-guided fuzzing blindly explores code paths or blocks, many of which are unlikely to contain logic bugs; therefore, this strategy is cost-ineffective. In this paper, we design SQLaser, a SQL-clause-guided fuzzer for detecting logic bugs in DBMSs. Through a comprehensive examination of most existing logic bugs across four distinct DBMSs, excluding those causing system crashes, we have identified 35 logic bug patterns. These patterns manifest as certain SQL clause combinations that commonly result in logic bugs, and behind these clause combinations are a sequence of functions. We therefore model logic bug patterns as error-prone function chains (ie, sequences of functions). We further develop a directed fuzzer with a new path-to-path distance-calculation mechanism for effectively testing these chains and discovering additional logic bugs. This mechanism enables SQLaser to swiftly navigate to target sites and uncover potential bugs emerging from these paths. Our evaluation, conducted on SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and TiDB, demonstrates that SQLaser significantly accelerates bug discovery compared to other fuzzing approaches, reducing detection time by approximately 60%.</description>

      <title>Jailbreak Attacks and Defenses Against Large Language Models: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have performed exceptionally in various text-generative tasks, including question answering, translation, code completion, etc. However, the over-assistance of LLMs has raised the challenge of "jailbreaking", which induces the model to generate malicious responses against the usage policy and society by designing adversarial prompts. With the emergence of jailbreak attack methods exploiting different vulnerabilities in LLMs, the corresponding safety alignment measures are also evolving. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive and detailed taxonomy of jailbreak attack and defense methods. For instance, the attack methods are divided into black-box and white-box attacks based on the transparency of the target model. Meanwhile, we classify defense methods into prompt-level and model-level defenses. Additionally, we further subdivide these attack and defense methods into distinct sub-classes and present a coherent diagram illustrating their relationships. We also conduct an investigation into the current evaluation methods and compare them from different perspectives. Our findings aim to inspire future research and practical implementations in safeguarding LLMs against adversarial attacks. Above all, although jailbreak remains a significant concern within the community, we believe that our work enhances the understanding of this domain and provides a foundation for developing more secure LLMs.</description>

      <title>HuntFUZZ: Enhancing Error Handling Testing through Clustering Based Fuzzing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Testing a program's capability to effectively handling errors is a significant challenge, given that program errors are relatively uncommon. To solve this, Software Fault Injection (SFI)-based fuzzing integrates SFI and traditional fuzzing, injecting and triggering errors for testing (error handling) code. However, we observe that current SFI-based fuzzing approaches have overlooked the correlation between paths housing error points. In fact, the execution paths of error points often share common paths. Nonetheless, Fuzzers usually generate test cases repeatedly to test error points on commonly traversed paths. This practice can compromise the efficiency of the fuzzer(s). Thus, this paper introduces HuntFUZZ, a novel SFI-based fuzzing framework that addresses the issue of redundant testing of error points with correlated paths. Specifically, HuntFUZZ clusters these correlated error points and utilizes concolic execution to compute constraints only for common paths within each cluster. By doing so, we provide the fuzzer with efficient test cases to explore related error points with minimal redundancy. We evaluate HuntFUZZ on a diverse set of 42 applications, and HuntFUZZ successfully reveals 162 known bugs, with 62 of them being related to error handling. Additionally, due to its efficient error point detection method, HuntFUZZ discovers 7 unique zero-day bugs, which are all missed by existing fuzzers. Furthermore, we compare HuntFUZZ with 4 existing fuzzing approaches, including AFL, AFL++, AFLGo, and EH-FUZZ. Our evaluation confirms that HuntFUZZ can cover a broader range of error points, and it exhibits better performance in terms of bug finding speed.</description>

      <title>Temporal fingerprints: Identity matching across fully encrypted domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technological advancements have significantly transformed communication patterns, introducing a diverse array of online platforms, thereby prompting individuals to use multiple profiles for different domains and objectives. Enhancing the understanding of cross domain identity matching capabilities is essential, not only for practical applications such as commercial strategies and cybersecurity measures, but also for theoretical insights into the privacy implications of data disclosure. In this study, we demonstrate that individual temporal data, in the form of inter-event times distribution, constitutes an individual temporal fingerprint, allowing for matching profiles across different domains back to their associated real-world entity. We evaluate our methodology on encrypted digital trading platforms within the Ethereum Blockchain and present impressing results in matching identities across these privacy-preserving domains, while outperforming previously suggested models. Our findings indicate that simply knowing when an individual is active, even if information about who they talk to and what they discuss is lacking, poses risks to users' privacy, highlighting the inherent challenges in preserving privacy in today's digital landscape.</description>

      <title>Waterfall: Framework for Robust and Scalable Text Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protecting intellectual property (IP) of text such as articles and code is increasingly important, especially as sophisticated attacks become possible, such as paraphrasing by large language models (LLMs) or even unauthorized training of LLMs on copyrighted text to infringe such IP. However, existing text watermarking methods are not robust enough against such attacks nor scalable to millions of users for practical implementation. In this paper, we propose Waterfall, the first training-free framework for robust and scalable text watermarking applicable across multiple text types (e.g., articles, code) and languages supportable by LLMs, for general text and LLM data provenance. Waterfall comprises several key innovations, such as being the first to use LLM as paraphrasers for watermarking along with a novel combination of techniques that are surprisingly effective in achieving robust verifiability and scalability. We empirically demonstrate that Waterfall achieves significantly better scalability, robust verifiability, and computational efficiency compared to SOTA article-text watermarking methods, and also showed how it could be directly applied to the watermarking of code.</description>

      <title>GoSurf: Identifying Software Supply Chain Attack Vectors in Go</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Go, the widespread adoption of open-source software has led to a flourishing ecosystem of third-party dependencies, which are often integrated into critical systems. However, the reuse of dependencies introduces significant supply chain security risks, as a single compromised package can have cascading impacts. Existing supply chain attack taxonomies overlook language-specific features that can be exploited by attackers to hide malicious code. In this paper, we propose a novel taxonomy of 12 distinct attack vectors tailored for the Go language and its package lifecycle. Our taxonomy identifies patterns in which language-specific Go features, intended for benign purposes, can be misused to propagate malicious code stealthily through supply chains. Additionally, we introduce GoSurf, a static analysis tool that analyzes the attack surface of Go packages according to our proposed taxonomy. We evaluate GoSurf on a corpus of widely used, real-world Go packages. Our work provides preliminary insights for securing the open-source software supply chain within the Go ecosystem, allowing developers and security analysts to prioritize code audit efforts and uncover hidden malicious behaviors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research investigates the potential use of a blockchain-based Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) within an organization and compares it to conventional PKI systems. The goal is to assess the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches in order to determine the feasibility of employing blockchain technology for a decentralized PKI. The study will also evaluate the impact of current legal frameworks, such as the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and NIS-2 Directive. The study will examine various implementations of blockchain PKIs based on factors such as security, performance, and platform. The results indicate that blockchain-based PKIs can overcome the limitations of conventional PKIs by decentralizing the trust anchor, providing greater security. Blockchain technology allows for the immutable and transparent management of certificates, making tampering significantly more challenging. Additionally, blockchain-based PKIs offer enhanced mechanisms for identifying and addressing certificate misconduct.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Inductive Miner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protecting personal data about individuals, such as event traces in process mining, is an inherently difficult task: an event trace leaks information about the path in a process model that an individual has triggered. Yet, prior anonymization methods of event traces like k-anonymity or event log sanitization struggled to protect against such leakage, in particular against adversaries with sufficient background knowledge. In this work, we provide a method that tackles the challenge of summarizing sensitive event traces by learning the underlying process tree in a privacy-preserving manner. We prove via the so-called Differential Privacy (DP) property that from the resulting summaries no useful inference can be drawn about any personal data in an event trace. On the technical side, we introduce a differentially private approximation (DPIM) of the Inductive Miner. Experimentally, we compare our DPIM with the Inductive Miner on 8 real-world event traces by evaluating well-known metrics: fitness, precision, simplicity, and generalization. The experiments show that our DPIM not only protects personal data but also generates faithful process trees that exhibit little utility loss above the Inductive Miner.</description>

      <title>Prosody-Driven Privacy-Preserving Dementia Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speaker embeddings extracted from voice recordings have been proven valuable for dementia detection. However, by their nature, these embeddings contain identifiable information which raises privacy concerns. In this work, we aim to anonymize embeddings while preserving the diagnostic utility for dementia detection. Previous studies rely on adversarial learning and models trained on the target attribute and struggle in limited-resource settings. We propose a novel approach that leverages domain knowledge to disentangle prosody features relevant to dementia from speaker embeddings without relying on a dementia classifier. Our experiments show the effectiveness of our approach in preserving speaker privacy (speaker recognition F1-score .01%) while maintaining high dementia detection score F1-score of 74% on the ADReSS dataset. Our results are also on par with a more constrained classifier-dependent system on ADReSSo (.01% and .66%), and have no impact on synthesized speech naturalness.</description>

      <title>Securing Multi-turn Conversational Language Models Against Distributed Backdoor Triggers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The security of multi-turn conversational large language models (LLMs) is understudied despite it being one of the most popular LLM utilization. Specifically, LLMs are vulnerable to data poisoning backdoor attacks, where an adversary manipulates the training data to cause the model to output malicious responses to predefined triggers. Specific to the multi-turn dialogue setting, LLMs are at the risk of even more harmful and stealthy backdoor attacks where the backdoor triggers may span across multiple utterances, giving lee-way to context-driven attacks. In this paper, we explore a novel distributed backdoor trigger attack that serves to be an extra tool in an adversary's toolbox that can interface with other single-turn attack strategies in a plug and play manner. Results on two representative defense mechanisms indicate that distributed backdoor triggers are robust against existing defense strategies which are designed for single-turn user-model interactions, motivating us to propose a new defense strategy for the multi-turn dialogue setting that is more challenging. To this end, we also explore a novel contrastive decoding based defense that is able to mitigate the backdoor with a low computational tradeoff.</description>

      <title>Solutions to Deepfakes: Can Camera Hardware, Cryptography, and Deep Learning Verify Real Images?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponential progress in generative AI poses serious implications for the credibility of all real images and videos. There will exist a point in the future where 1) digital content produced by generative AI will be indistinguishable from those created by cameras, 2) high-quality generative algorithms will be accessible to anyone, and 3) the ratio of all synthetic to real images will be large. It is imperative to establish methods that can separate real data from synthetic data with high confidence. We define real images as those that were produced by the camera hardware, capturing a real-world scene. Any synthetic generation of an image or alteration of a real image through generative AI or computer graphics techniques is labeled as a synthetic image. To this end, this document aims to: present known strategies in detection and cryptography that can be employed to verify which images are real, weight the strengths and weaknesses of these strategies, and suggest additional improvements to alleviate shortcomings.</description>

      <title>Smooth Lower Bounds for Differentially Private Algorithms via Padding-and-Permuting Fingerprinting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07604v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fingerprinting arguments, first introduced by Bun, Ullman, and Vadhan (STOC 2014), are the most widely used method for establishing lower bounds on the sample complexity or error of approximately differentially private (DP) algorithms. Still, there are many problems in differential privacy for which we don't know suitable lower bounds, and even for problems that we do, the lower bounds are not smooth, and usually become vacuous when the error is larger than some threshold.
  We present a new framework and tools to generate smooth lower bounds on the sample complexity of differentially private algorithms satisfying very weak accuracy. We illustrate the applicability of our method by providing new lower bounds in various settings:
  1. A tight lower bound for DP averaging in the low-accuracy regime, which in particular implies a lower bound for the private 1-cluster problem introduced by Nissim, Stemmer, and Vadhan (PODS 2016).
  2. A lower bound on the additive error of DP algorithms for approximate k-means clustering and general (k,z)-clustering, as a function of the multiplicative error, which is tight for a constant multiplication error.
  3. A lower bound for estimating the top singular vector of a matrix under DP in low-accuracy regimes, which is a special case of DP subspace estimation studied by Singhal and Steinke (NeurIPS 2021).
  Our main technique is to apply a padding-and-permuting transformation to a fingerprinting code. However, rather than proving our results using a black-box access to an existing fingerprinting code (e.g., Tardos' code), we develop a new fingerprinting lemma that is stronger than those of Dwork et al. (FOCS 2015) and Bun et al. (SODA 2017), and prove our lower bounds directly from the lemma. Our lemma, in particular, gives a simpler fingerprinting code construction with optimal rate (up to polylogarithmic factors) that is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>FlowMur: A Stealthy and Practical Audio Backdoor Attack with Limited Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech recognition systems driven by DNNs have revolutionized human-computer interaction through voice interfaces, which significantly facilitate our daily lives. However, the growing popularity of these systems also raises special concerns on their security, particularly regarding backdoor attacks. A backdoor attack inserts one or more hidden backdoors into a DNN model during its training process, such that it does not affect the model's performance on benign inputs, but forces the model to produce an adversary-desired output if a specific trigger is present in the model input. Despite the initial success of current audio backdoor attacks, they suffer from the following limitations: (i) Most of them require sufficient knowledge, which limits their widespread adoption. (ii) They are not stealthy enough, thus easy to be detected by humans. (iii) Most of them cannot attack live speech, reducing their practicality. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose FlowMur, a stealthy and practical audio backdoor attack that can be launched with limited knowledge. FlowMur constructs an auxiliary dataset and a surrogate model to augment adversary knowledge. To achieve dynamicity, it formulates trigger generation as an optimization problem and optimizes the trigger over different attachment positions. To enhance stealthiness, we propose an adaptive data poisoning method according to Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Furthermore, ambient noise is incorporated into the process of trigger generation and data poisoning to make FlowMur robust to ambient noise and improve its practicality. Extensive experiments conducted on two datasets demonstrate that FlowMur achieves high attack performance in both digital and physical settings while remaining resilient to state-of-the-art defenses. In particular, a human study confirms that triggers generated by FlowMur are not easily detected by participants.</description>

Abstract: The underground exploitation of large language models (LLMs) for malicious services (i.e., Malla) is witnessing an uptick, amplifying the cyber threat landscape and posing questions about the trustworthiness of LLM technologies. However, there has been little effort to understand this new cybercrime, in terms of its magnitude, impact, and techniques. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study on 212 real-world Mallas, uncovering their proliferation in underground marketplaces and exposing their operational modalities. Our study discloses the Malla ecosystem, revealing its significant growth and impact on today's public LLM services. Through examining 212 Mallas, we uncovered eight backend LLMs used by Mallas, along with 182 prompts that circumvent the protective measures of public LLM APIs. We further demystify the tactics employed by Mallas, including the abuse of uncensored LLMs and the exploitation of public LLM APIs through jailbreak prompts. Our findings enable a better understanding of the real-world exploitation of LLMs by cybercriminals, offering insights into strategies to counteract this cybercrime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning approach that protects user data privacy by training models locally on clients and aggregating them on a parameter server. While effective at preserving privacy, FL systems face limitations such as single points of failure, lack of incentives, and inadequate security. To address these challenges, blockchain technology is integrated into FL systems to provide stronger security, fairness, and scalability. However, blockchain-empowered FL (BC-FL) systems introduce additional demands on network, computing, and storage resources. This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent research on BC-FL systems, analyzing the benefits and challenges associated with blockchain integration. We explore why blockchain is applicable to FL, how it can be implemented, and the challenges and existing solutions for its integration. Additionally, we offer insights on future research directions for the BC-FL system.</description>

      <title>JailBreakV-28K: A Benchmark for Assessing the Robustness of MultiModal Large Language Models against Jailbreak Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), securing these models against malicious inputs while aligning them with human values has emerged as a critical challenge. In this paper, we investigate an important and unexplored question of whether techniques that successfully jailbreak Large Language Models (LLMs) can be equally effective in jailbreaking MLLMs. To explore this issue, we introduce JailBreakV-28K, a pioneering benchmark designed to assess the transferability of LLM jailbreak techniques to MLLMs, thereby evaluating the robustness of MLLMs against diverse jailbreak attacks. Utilizing a dataset of 2, 000 malicious queries that is also proposed in this paper, we generate 20, 000 text-based jailbreak prompts using advanced jailbreak attacks on LLMs, alongside 8, 000 image-based jailbreak inputs from recent MLLMs jailbreak attacks, our comprehensive dataset includes 28, 000 test cases across a spectrum of adversarial scenarios. Our evaluation of 10 open-source MLLMs reveals a notably high Attack Success Rate (ASR) for attacks transferred from LLMs, highlighting a critical vulnerability in MLLMs that stems from their text-processing capabilities. Our findings underscore the urgent need for future research to address alignment vulnerabilities in MLLMs from both textual and visual inputs.</description>

      <title>Position Paper: Think Globally, React Locally -- Bringing Real-time Reference-based Website Phishing Detection on macOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background. The recent surge in phishing attacks keeps undermining the effectiveness of the traditional anti-phishing blacklist approaches. On-device anti-phishing solutions are gaining popularity as they offer faster phishing detection locally. Aim. We aim to eliminate the delay in recognizing and recording phishing campaigns in databases via on-device solutions that identify phishing sites immediately when encountered by the user rather than waiting for a web crawler's scan to finish. Additionally, utilizing operating system-specific resources and frameworks, we aim to minimize the impact on system performance and depend on local processing to protect user privacy. Method. We propose a phishing detection solution that uses a combination of computer vision and on-device machine learning models to analyze websites in real time. Our reference-based approach analyzes the visual content of webpages, identifying phishing attempts through layout analysis, credential input areas detection, and brand impersonation criteria combination. Results. Our case study shows it's feasible to perform background processing on-device continuously, for the case of the web browser requiring the resource use of 16% of a single CPU core and less than 84MB of RAM on Apple M1 while maintaining the accuracy of brand logo detection at 46.6% (comparable with baselines), and of Credential Requiring Page detection at 98.1% (improving the baseline by 3.1%), within the test dataset. Conclusions. Our results demonstrate the potential of on-device, real-time phishing detection systems to enhance cybersecurity defensive technologies and extend the scope of phishing detection to more similar regions of interest, e.g., email clients and messenger windows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is of critical importance to design digital identity systems that ensure the privacy of citizens as well as protecting them from issuer corruption. We aim to solve this issue and propose a method for selective disclosure and privacy preserving revocation of digital credentials, using the unique homomorphic characteristics of second order Elliptic Curves and Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) signatures. Our approach ensures that users can selectively reveal credentials signed by a certain issuer, which can be interactively revoked by a quorum of other agreeing issuers without revealing the identity of users. Our goal is to protect users from issuer corruption by requiring collective agreement among multiple revocation issuers.</description>

      <title>Certifiable Black-Box Attacks with Randomized Adversarial Examples: Breaking Defenses with Provable Confidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black-box adversarial attacks have shown strong potential to subvert machine learning models. Existing black-box attacks craft adversarial examples by iteratively querying the target model and/or leveraging the transferability of a local surrogate model. Recently, such attacks can be effectively mitigated by state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses, e.g., detection via the pattern of sequential queries, or injecting noise into the model. To our best knowledge, we take the first step to study a new paradigm of black-box attacks with provable guarantees -- certifiable black-box attacks that can guarantee the attack success probability (ASP) of adversarial examples before querying over the target model. This new black-box attack unveils significant vulnerabilities of machine learning models, compared to traditional empirical black-box attacks, e.g., breaking strong SOTA defenses with provable confidence, constructing a space of (infinite) adversarial examples with high ASP, and the ASP of the generated adversarial examples is theoretically guaranteed without verification/queries over the target model. Specifically, we establish a novel theoretical foundation for ensuring the ASP of the black-box attack with randomized adversarial examples (AEs). Then, we propose several novel techniques to craft the randomized AEs while reducing the perturbation size for better imperceptibility. Finally, we have comprehensively evaluated the certifiable black-box attacks on the CIFAR10/100, ImageNet, and LibriSpeech datasets, while benchmarking with 16 SOTA empirical black-box attacks, against various SOTA defenses in the domains of computer vision and speech recognition. Both theoretical and experimental results have validated the significance of the proposed attack.</description>

      <title>Addressing Membership Inference Attack in Federated Learning with Model Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has been proposed as a privacy-preserving solution for machine learning. However, recent works have reported that FL can leak private client data through membership inference attacks. In this paper, we show that the effectiveness of these attacks on the clients negatively correlates with the size of the client's datasets and model complexity. Based on this finding, we study the capabilities of model-agnostic Federated Learning to preserve privacy, as it enables the use of models of varying complexity in the clients. To systematically study this topic, we first propose a taxonomy of model-agnostic FL methods according to the strategies adopted by the clients to select the sub-models from the server's model. This taxonomy provides a framework for existing model-agnostic FL approaches and leads to the proposal of new FL methods to fill the gaps in the taxonomy. Next, we analyze the privacy-performance trade-off of all the model-agnostic FL architectures as per the proposed taxonomy when subjected to 3 different membership inference attacks on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 vision datasets. In our experiments, we find that randomness in the strategy used to select the server's sub-model to train the clients' models can control the clients' privacy while keeping competitive performance on the server's side.</description>

      <title>Artwork Protection Against Neural Style Transfer Using Locally Adaptive Adversarial Color Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09673v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural style transfer (NST) generates new images by combining the style of one image with the content of another. However, unauthorized NST can exploit artwork, raising concerns about artists' rights and motivating the development of proactive protection methods. We propose Locally Adaptive Adversarial Color Attack (LAACA), empowering artists to protect their artwork from unauthorized style transfer by processing before public release. By delving into the intricacies of human visual perception and the role of different frequency components, our method strategically introduces frequency-adaptive perturbations in the image. These perturbations significantly degrade the generation quality of NST while maintaining an acceptable level of visual change in the original image, ensuring that potential infringers are discouraged from using the protected artworks, because of its bad NST generation quality. Additionally, existing metrics often overlook the importance of color fidelity in evaluating color-mattered tasks, such as the quality of NST-generated images, which is crucial in the context of artistic works. To comprehensively assess the color-mattered tasks, we propose the Adversarial Color Distance Metric (ACDM), designed to quantify the color difference of images pre- and post-manipulations. Experimental results confirm that attacking NST using LAACA results in visually inferior style transfer, and the ACDM can efficiently measure color-mattered tasks. By providing artists with a tool to safeguard their intellectual property, our work relieves the socio-technical challenges posed by the misuse of NST in the art community.</description>

      <title>Defending Jailbreak Prompts via In-Context Adversarial Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities across diverse applications. However, concerns regarding their security, particularly the vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, persist. Drawing inspiration from adversarial training in deep learning and LLM agent learning processes, we introduce the In-Context Adversarial Game (ICAG) for defending against jailbreaks without the need for fine-tuning. ICAG leverages agent learning to conduct an adversarial game, aiming to dynamically extend knowledge to defend against jailbreaks. Unlike traditional methods that rely on static datasets, ICAG employs an iterative process to enhance both the defense and attack agents. This continuous improvement process strengthens defenses against newly generated jailbreak prompts. Our empirical studies affirm ICAG's efficacy, where LLMs safeguarded by ICAG exhibit significantly reduced jailbreak success rates across various attack scenarios. Moreover, ICAG demonstrates remarkable transferability to other LLMs, indicating its potential as a versatile defense mechanism.</description>

      <title>Pseudorandom Permutations from Random Reversible Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study pseudorandomness properties of permutations on $\{0,1\}^n$ computed by random circuits made from reversible $3$-bit gates (permutations on $\{0,1\}^3$). Our main result is that a random circuit of depth $n \cdot \tilde{O}(k^2)$, with each layer consisting of $\approx n/3$ random gates in a fixed nearest-neighbor architecture, yields almost $k$-wise independent permutations. The main technical component is showing that the Markov chain on $k$-tuples of $n$-bit strings induced by a single random $3$-bit nearest-neighbor gate has spectral gap at least $1/n \cdot \tilde{O}(k)$. This improves on the original work of Gowers [Gowers96], who showed a gap of $1/\mathrm{poly}(n,k)$ for one random gate (with non-neighboring inputs); and, on subsequent work [HMMR05,BH08] improving the gap to $\Omega(1/n^2k)$ in the same setting.
  From the perspective of cryptography, our result can be seen as a particularly simple/practical block cipher construction that gives provable statistical security against attackers with access to $k$~input-output pairs within few rounds. We also show that the Luby--Rackoff construction of pseudorandom permutations from pseudorandom functions can be implemented with reversible circuits. From this, we make progress on the complexity of the Minimum Reversible Circuit Size Problem (MRCSP), showing that block ciphers of fixed polynomial size are computationally secure against arbitrary polynomial-time adversaries, assuming the existence of one-way functions (OWFs).</description>

      <title>Age Aware Scheduling for Differentially-Private Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores differentially-private federated learning (FL) across time-varying databases, delving into a nuanced three-way tradeoff involving age, accuracy, and differential privacy (DP). Emphasizing the potential advantages of scheduling, we propose an optimization problem aimed at meeting DP requirements while minimizing the loss difference between the aggregated model and the model obtained without DP constraints. To harness the benefits of scheduling, we introduce an age-dependent upper bound on the loss, leading to the development of an age-aware scheduling design. Simulation results underscore the superior performance of our proposed scheme compared to FL with classic DP, which does not consider scheduling as a design factor. This research contributes insights into the interplay of age, accuracy, and DP in federated learning, with practical implications for scheduling strategies.</description>

Abstract: In the realm of healthcare where decentralized facilities are prevalent, machine learning faces two major challenges concerning the protection of data and models. The data-level challenge concerns the data privacy leakage when centralizing data with sensitive personal information. While the model-level challenge arises from the heterogeneity of local models, which need to be collaboratively trained while ensuring their confidentiality to address intellectual property concerns. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new framework termed Abstention-Aware Federated Voting (AAFV) that can collaboratively and confidentially train heterogeneous local models while simultaneously protecting the data privacy. This is achieved by integrating a novel abstention-aware voting mechanism and a differential privacy mechanism onto local models' predictions. In particular, the proposed abstention-aware voting mechanism exploits a threshold-based abstention method to select high-confidence votes from heterogeneous local models, which not only enhances the learning utility but also protects model confidentiality. Furthermore, we implement AAFV on two practical prediction tasks of diabetes and in-hospital patient mortality. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and confidentiality of AAFV in testing accuracy and privacy protection.</description>
