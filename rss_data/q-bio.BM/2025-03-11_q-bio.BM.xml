      <title>The standard coil or globule phases cannot describe the denatured state of structured proteins and intrinsically disordered proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concepts of globule and random coil were developed to describe the phases of homopolymers and then used to characterize the denatured state of structured cytosolic proteins and intrinsically disordered proteins. Using multi-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we were able to explore the conformational space of the disordered conformations of both types of protein under biological conditions in an affordable amount of computational time. By studying the size of the protein and the density correlations in space, we conclude that the standard phases of homopolymers and the tools to detect them cannot be applied straightforwardly to proteins.</description>

      <title>ProTeX: Structure-In-Context Reasoning and Editing of Proteins with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have made remarkable progress in the field of molecular science, particularly in understanding and generating functional small molecules. This success is largely attributed to the effectiveness of molecular tokenization strategies. In protein science, the amino acid sequence serves as the sole tokenizer for LLMs. However, many fundamental challenges in protein science are inherently structure-dependent. The absence of structure-aware tokens significantly limits the capabilities of LLMs for comprehensive biomolecular comprehension and multimodal generation. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, ProTeX, which tokenizes the protein sequences, structures, and textual information into a unified discrete space. This innovative approach enables joint training of the LLM exclusively through the Next-Token Prediction paradigm, facilitating multimodal protein reasoning and generation. ProTeX enables general LLMs to perceive and process protein structures through sequential text input, leverage structural information as intermediate reasoning components, and generate or manipulate structures via sequential text output. Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements in protein function prediction, outperforming the state-of-the-art domain expert model with a twofold increase in accuracy. Our framework enables high-quality conformational generation and customizable protein design. For the first time, we demonstrate that by adopting the standard training and inference pipelines from the LLM domain, ProTeX empowers decoder-only LLMs to effectively address diverse spectrum of protein-related tasks.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Mitigating Distribution Shifts For Machine Learning Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) are a promising alternative to expensive ab initio quantum mechanical molecular simulations. Given the diversity of chemical spaces that are of interest and the cost of generating new data, it is important to understand how MLFFs generalize beyond their training distributions. In order to characterize and better understand distribution shifts in MLFFs, we conduct diagnostic experiments on chemical datasets, revealing common shifts that pose significant challenges, even for large foundation models trained on extensive data. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that current supervised training methods inadequately regularize MLFFs, resulting in overfitting and learning poor representations of out-of-distribution systems. We then propose two new methods as initial steps for mitigating distribution shifts for MLFFs. Our methods focus on test-time refinement strategies that incur minimal computational cost and do not use expensive ab initio reference labels. The first strategy, based on spectral graph theory, modifies the edges of test graphs to align with graph structures seen during training. Our second strategy improves representations for out-of-distribution systems at test-time by taking gradient steps using an auxiliary objective, such as a cheap physical prior. Our test-time refinement strategies significantly reduce errors on out-of-distribution systems, suggesting that MLFFs are capable of and can move towards modeling diverse chemical spaces, but are not being effectively trained to do so. Our experiments establish clear benchmarks for evaluating the generalization capabilities of the next generation of MLFFs.

      <title>An RNA condensate model for the origin of life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The RNA World hypothesis predicts that self-replicating RNAs evolved before DNA genomes and coded proteins. Despite widespread support for the RNA World, self-replicating RNAs have yet to be identified in a natural context, leaving a key 'missing link' for this explanation of the origin of life. Inspired by recent work showing that condensates of charged polymers are capable of catalyzing chemical reactions, we consider a catalytic RNA condensate as a candidate for the self-replicating RNA. Specifically, we propose that short, low-complexity RNA polymers formed catalytic condensates capable of templated RNA polymerization. Because the condensate properties depend on the RNA sequences, RNAs that formed condensates with improved polymerization and demixing capacity would be amplified, leading to a 'condensate chain reaction' and evolution by natural selection. Many of the needed properties of this self-replicating RNA condensate have been realized experimentally in recent studies and our predictions could be tested with current experimental and theoretical tools. Our theory addresses central problems in the origins of life: (i) the origin of compartmentalization, (ii) the error threshold for the accuracy of templated replication, (iii) the free energy cost of maintaining an information-rich population of replicating RNA polymers. Furthermore, we note that the extant nucleolus appears to satisfy many of the requirements of an evolutionary relic for the model we propose. More generally, we suggest that future work on the origin of life would benefit from condensate-centric biophysical models of RNA evolution.</description>
