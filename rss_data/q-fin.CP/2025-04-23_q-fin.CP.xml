      <title>A Line Graph-Based Framework for Identifying Optimal Routing Paths in Decentralized Exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized exchanges, such as those employing constant product market makers (CPMMs) like Uniswap V2, play a crucial role in the blockchain ecosystem by enabling peer-to-peer token swaps without intermediaries. Despite the increasing volume of transactions, there remains limited research on identifying optimal trading paths across multiple DEXs. This paper presents a novel line-graph-based algorithm (LG) designed to efficiently discover profitable trading routes within DEX environments. We benchmark LG against the widely adopted Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm under a linear routing scenario, encompassing platforms such as Uniswap, SushiSwap, and PancakeSwap. Experimental results demonstrate that LG consistently identifies trading paths that are as profitable as, or more profitable than, those found by DFS, while incurring comparable gas costs. Evaluations on Uniswap V2 token graphs across two temporal snapshots further validate LG's performance. Although LG exhibits exponential runtime growth with respect to graph size in empirical tests, it remains viable for practical, real-world use cases. Our findings underscore the potential of the LG algorithm for industrial adoption, offering tangible benefits to traders and market participants in the DeFi space.</description>

      <title>Realized Local Volatility Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For quantitative trading risk management purposes, we present a novel idea: the realized local volatility surface. Concisely, it stands for the conditional expected volatility when sudden market behaviors of the underlying occur. One is able to explore risk management usages by following the orthotical Delta-Gamma dynamic hedging framework. The realized local volatility surface is, mathematically, a generalized Wiener measure from historical prices. It is reconstructed via employing high-frequency trading market data. A Stick-Breaking Gaussian Mixture Model is fitted via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, producing a local volatility surface with 95% credible intervals. A practically validated Bayesian nonparametric estimation workflow. Empirical results on TSLA high-frequency data illustrate its ability to capture counterfactual volatility. We also discuss its application in improving volatility-based risk management.</description>

      <title>The Quadratic Local Variance Gamma Model: an arbitrage-free interpolation of class C3 for option prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper generalizes the local variance gamma model of Carr and Nadtochiy, to a piecewise quadratic local variance function. The formulation encompasses the piecewise linear Bachelier and piecewise linear Black local variance gamma models. The quadratic local variance function results in an arbitrage-free interpolation of class C3. The increased smoothness over the piecewise-constant and piecewise-linear representation allows to reduce the number of knots when interpolating raw market quotes, thus providing an interesting alternative to regularization while reducing the computational cost.</description>

      <title>Boundary conditions at infinity for Black-Scholes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05549v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a numerical procedure for computing the prices of European options, in which the underlying asset price is a Markovian strict local martingale. If the underlying process is a strict local martingale and the payoff is of linear growth, multiple solutions exist for the corresponding Black-Scholes equations. When numerical schemes such as finite difference methods are applied, a boundary condition at infinity must be specified, which determines a solution among the candidates. The minimal solution, which is considered as the derivative price, is obtained by our boundary condition. The stability of our procedure is supported by the fact that our numerical solution satisfies a discrete maximum principle. In addition, its accuracy is demonstrated through numerical experiments in comparison with the methods proposed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Dimensional Barrier: A Pontryagin-Guided Direct Policy Optimization for Continuous-Time Multi-Asset Portfolio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving large-scale, continuous-time portfolio optimization problems involving numerous assets and state-dependent dynamics has long been challenged by the curse of dimensionality. Traditional dynamic programming and PDE-based methods, while rigorous, typically become computationally intractable beyond few state variables (3~6 limit in prior studies). To overcome this critical barrier, we introduce the Pontryagin-Guided Direct Policy Optimization (PG-DPO) framework. PG-DPO leverages Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP) and backpropagation-through-time (BPTT) to guide neural network policies, handling exogenous states without dense grids. This PMP-guided approach holds potential for a broad class of sufficiently regular continuous-time control problems. Crucially, our computationally efficient "Two-Stage" variant exploits rapidly stabilizing BPTT costate estimates, converting them into near-optimal Pontryagin controls after only a short warm-up, significantly reducing training overhead. This enables a breakthrough in scalability: numerical experiments show PG-DPO successfully tackles problems with dimensions previously considered far out of reach (up to 50 assets and 10 state variables). The framework delivers near-optimal policies, offering a practical and powerful alternative for high-dimensional continuous-time portfolio choice.</description>
