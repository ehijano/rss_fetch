      <title>A Small Collusion is All You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transaction Fee Mechanisms (TFMs) study auction design in the Blockchain context, and emphasize robustness against miner and user collusion, moreso than traditional auction theory. \cite{chung2023foundations} introduce the notion of a mechanism being $c$-Side-Contract-Proof ($c$-SCP), i.e., robust to a collusion of the miner and $c$ users. Later work \cite{chung2024collusion,welfareIncreasingCollusion} shows a gap between the $1$-SCP and $2$-SCP classes. We show that the class of $2$-SCP mechanisms equals that of any $c$-SCP with $c\geq 2$, under a relatively minor assumption of consistent tie-breaking. In essence, this implies that any mechanism vulnerable to collusion, is also vulnerable to a small collusion.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Trustworthiness of the Online Reviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00815v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In electronic commerce (e-commerce)markets, a decision-maker faces a sequential choice problem. Third-party intervention is essential in making purchase decisions in this choice process. For instance, while purchasing products/services online, a buyer's choice or behavior is often affected by the overall reviewers' ratings, feedback, etc. Moreover, the reviewer is also a decision-maker. The question that arises is how trustworthy these review reports and ratings are. The trustworthiness of these review reports and ratings is based on whether the reviewer is rational or irrational. Indexing the reviewer's rationality could be a way to quantify a reviewer's rationality, but it needs to communicate the history of their behavior. In this article, the researcher aims to derive a rationality pattern function formally and, thereby, the degree of rationality of the decision-maker or the reviewer in the sequential choice problem in the e-commerce markets. Applying such a rationality pattern function could make quantifying the rational behavior of an agent participating in the digital markets easier. This, in turn, is expected to minimize the information asymmetry within the decision-making process and identify the paid reviewers or manipulative reviews.</description>

      <title>Invariant Modeling for Joint Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common theme underlying many problems in statistics and economics involves the determination of a systematic method of selecting a joint distribution consistent with a specified list of categorical marginals, some of which have an ordinal structure. We propose guidance in narrowing down the set of possible methods by introducing Invariant Aggregation (IA), a natural property that requires merging adjacent categories in one marginal not to alter the joint distribution over unaffected values. We prove that a model satisfies IA if and only if it is a copula model. This characterization ensures i) robustness against data manipulation and survey design, and ii) allows seamless incorporation of new variables. Our results provide both theoretical clarity and practical safeguards for inference under marginal constraints.</description>
