      <title>UAV-Assisted MEC for Disaster Response: Stackelberg Game-Based Resource Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unmanned aerial vehicle assisted multi-access edge computing (UAV-MEC) technology has been widely applied in the sixth-generation era. However, due to the limitations of energy and computing resources in disaster areas, how to efficiently offload the tasks of damaged user equipments (UEs) to UAVs is a key issue. In this work, we consider a multiple UAVMECs assisted task offloading scenario, which is deployed inside the three-dimensional corridors and provide computation services for UEs. In detail, a ground UAV controller acts as the central decision-making unit for deploying the UAV-MECs and allocates the computational resources. Then, we model the relationship between the UAV controller and UEs based on the Stackelberg game. The problem is formulated to maximize the utility of both the UAV controller and UEs. To tackle the problem, we design a K-means based UAV localization and availability response mechanism to pre-deploy the UAV-MECs. Then, a chess-like particle swarm optimization probability based strategy selection learning optimization algorithm is proposed to deal with the resource allocation. Finally, extensive simulation results verify that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the utility of the UAV controller and UEs in various scenarios compared with baseline schemes.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Augmented Complex Maximum Total Correntropy Algorithm for Power System Frequency Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, adaptive filtering algorithms have been widely applied in frequency estimation for power systems. However, research on diffusion tasks remains insufficient. Existing diffusion adaptive frequency estimation algorithms exhibit certain limitations in handling input noise and lack robustness against impulsive noise. Moreover, traditional adaptive filtering algorithms designed based on the strictly-linear (SL) model fail to effectively address frequency estimation challenges in unbalanced three-phase power systems. To address these issues, this letter proposes an improved diffusion augmented complex maximum total correntropy (DAMTCC) algorithm based on the widely linear (WL) model. The proposed algorithm not only significantly enhances the capability to handle input noise but also demonstrates superior robustness to impulsive noise. Furthermore, it successfully resolves the critical challenge of frequency estimation in unbalanced three-phase power systems, offering an efficient and reliable solution for diffusion power system frequency estimation. Finally, we analyze the stability of the algorithm and computer simulations verify the excellent performance of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>WK-Pnet: FM-Based Positioning via Wavelet Packet Decomposition and Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient positioning in complex environments is critical for applications where traditional satellite-based systems face limitations, such as indoors or urban canyons. This paper introduces WK-Pnet, an FM-based indoor positioning framework that combines wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) and knowledge distillation. WK-Pnet leverages WPD to extract rich time-frequency features from FM signals, which are then processed by a deep learning model for precise position estimation. To address computational demands, we employ knowledge distillation, transferring insights from a high-capacity model to a streamlined student model, achieving substantial reductions in complexity without sacrificing accuracy. Experimental results across diverse environments validate WK-Pnet's superior positioning accuracy and lower computational requirements, making it a viable solution for positioning in real-time resource-constraint applications.</description>

      <title>Secure Directional Modulation with Movable Antenna Array Aided by RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, to fully exploit the performance gains from moveable antennas (MAs) and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), a RIS-aided directional modulation \textcolor{blue}{(DM)} network with movable antenna at base station (BS) is established Based on the principle of DM, a BS equipped with MAs transmits legitimate information to a single-antenna user (Bob) while exploiting artificial noise (AN) to degrade signal reception at the eavesdropper (Eve). The combination of AN and transmission beamforming vectors is modeled as joint beamforming vector (JBV) to achieve optimal power allocation. The objective is to maximize the achievable secrecy rate (SR) by optimizing MAs antenna position, phase shift matrix (PSM) of RIS, and JBV. The limited movable range (MR) and discrete candidate positions of the MAs at the BS are considered, which renders the optimization problem non-convex. To address these challenges, an optimization method under perfect channel state information (CSI) is firstly designed, in which the MAs antenna positions are obtained using compressive sensing (CS) technology, and JBV and PSM are iteratively optimized. Then, the design method and SR performance under imperfect CSI is investigated. The proposed algorithms have fewer iterations and lower complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that MAs outperform fixed-position antennas in SR performance when there is an adequately large MR available.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Wideband Spectrum Sensing with Dual-Representation Inputs and Subband Shuffling Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of mobile communication technology has led to a severe shortage of spectrum resources, driving the development of cognitive radio technologies aimed at improving spectrum utilization, with spectrum sensing being the key enabler. This paper presents a novel deep learning-based wideband spectrum sensing framework that leverages multi-taper power spectral inputs to achieve high-precision and sample-efficient sensing. To enhance sensing accuracy, we incorporate a feature fusion strategy that combines multiple power spectrum representations. To tackle the challenge of limited sample sizes, we propose two data augmentation techniques designed to expand the training set and improve the network's detection probability. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio conditions, achieving higher detection probabilities and lower false alarm rates. The method also exhibits strong robustness across various scenarios, highlighting its significant potential for practical applications in wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>DS-Pnet: FM-Based Positioning via Downsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present DS-Pnet, a novel framework for FM signal-based positioning that addresses the challenges of high computational complexity and limited deployment in resource-constrained environments. Two downsampling methods-IQ signal downsampling and time-frequency representation downsampling-are proposed to reduce data dimensionality while preserving critical positioning features. By integrating with the lightweight MobileViT-XS neural network, the framework achieves high positioning accuracy with significantly reduced computational demands. Experiments on real-world FM signal datasets demonstrate that DS-Pnet achieves superior performance in both indoor and outdoor scenarios, with space and time complexity reductions of approximately 87% and 99.5%, respectively, compared to an existing method, FM-Pnet. Despite the high compression, DS-Pnet maintains robust positioning accuracy, offering an optimal balance between efficiency and precision.</description>

      <title>Improved AFSA-Based Beam Training Without CSI for RIS-Assisted ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider transmit beamforming and reflection patterns design in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where the dual-function base station (DFBS) lacks channel state information (CSI). To address the high overhead of cascaded channel estimation, we propose an improved artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) combined with a feedback-based joint active and passive beam training scheme. In this approach, we consider the interference caused by multipath user echo signals on target detection and propose a beamforming design method that balances both communication and sensing performance. Numerical simulations show that the proposed AFSA outperforms other optimization algorithms, particularly in its robustness against echo interference under different communication signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraints.</description>

      <title>RIS-Aided Integrated Sensing and Communication Waveform Design With Tunable PAPR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) transmission is an important and favorable requirement prevalent in radar and communication systems, especially in transmission links integrated with high power amplifiers. Meanwhile, motivated by the advantages of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) in mitigating multi-user interference (MUI) to enhance the communication rate, this paper investigates the design problem of joint waveform and passive beamforming with PAPR constraint for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where RIS is deployed for downlink communication. We first construct a trade-off optimization problem for the MUI and beampattern similarity under PAPR constraint. Then, in order to solve this multivariate problem, an iterative optimization algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and manifold optimization is proposed. Finally, the simulation results show that the designed waveforms can well satisfy the PAPR requirement of the ISAC systems and achieve a trade-off between radar and communication performance. Under high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, compared to systems without RIS, RIS-aided ISAC systems have a performance improvement of about 50\% in communication rate and at least 1 dB in beampatterning error.</description>

      <title>Quickest change detection for UAV-based sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of quickest change detection (QCD) at two spatially separated locations monitored by a single unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a sensor. At any location, the UAV observes i.i.d. data sequentially in discrete time instants. The distribution of the observation data changes at some unknown, arbitrary time and the UAV has to detect this change in the shortest possible time. Change can occur at most at one location over the entire infinite time horizon. The UAV switches between these two locations in order to quickly detect the change. To this end, we propose Location Switching and Change Detection (LS-CD) algorithm which uses a repeated one-sided sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) based mechanism for observation-driven location switching and change detection. The primary goal is to minimize the worst-case average detection delay (WADD) while meeting constraints on the average run length to false alarm (ARL2FA) and the UAV's time-averaged energy consumption. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of the algorithm's performance by using theory of random walk. Specifically, we derive tight upper and lower bounds to its ARL2FA and a tight upper bound to its WADD. In the special case of a symmetrical setting, our analysis leads to a new asymptotic upper bound to the ARL2FA of the standard CUSUM algorithm, a novel contribution not available in the literature, to our knowledge. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of LS-CD.</description>

      <title>Learning Joint Source-Channel Encoding in IRS-assisted Multi-User Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a joint source-channel encoding (JSCE) scheme in an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted multi-user semantic communication system. Semantic encoding not only compresses redundant information, but also enhances information orthogonality in a semantic feature space. Meanwhile, the IRS can adjust the spatial orthogonality, enabling concurrent multi-user semantic communication in densely deployed wireless networks to improve spectrum efficiency. We aim to maximize the users' semantic throughput by jointly optimizing the users' scheduling, the IRS's passive beamforming, and the semantic encoding strategies. To tackle this non-convex problem, we propose an explainable deep neural network-driven deep reinforcement learning (XD-DRL) framework. Specifically, we employ a deep neural network (DNN) to serve as a joint source-channel semantic encoder, enabling transmitters to extract semantic features from raw images. By leveraging structural similarity, we assign some DNN weight coefficients as the IRS's phase shifts, allowing simultaneous optimization of IRS's passive beamforming and DNN training. Given the IRS's passive beamforming and semantic encoding strategies, user scheduling is optimized using the DRL method. Numerical results validate that our JSCE scheme achieves superior semantic throughput compared to the conventional schemes and efficiently reduces the semantic encoder's mode size in multi-user scenarios.</description>

      <title>System Concept and Demonstration of Bistatic MIMO-OFDM-based ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In future sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks, radar sensing is expected to be offered as an additional service to its original purpose of communication. Merging these two functions results in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. In this context, bistatic ISAC appears as a possibility to exploit the distributed nature of cellular networks while avoiding highly demanding hardware requirements such as full-duplex operation. Recent studies have introduced strategies to perform required synchronization and data exchange between nodes for bistatic ISAC operation, based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), however, only for single-input single-output architectures. In this article, a system concept for a bistatic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-OFDM-based ISAC system with beamforming at both transmitter and receiver is proposed, and a distribution synchronization concept to ensure coherence among the different receive channels for direction-of-arrival estimation is presented. After a discussion on the ISAC processing chain, including relevant aspects for practical deployments such as transmitter digital pre-distortion and receiver calibration, a 4x8 MIMO measurement setup at 27.5 GHz and results are presented to validate the proposed system and distribution synchronization concepts.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing, Computing, and Semantic Communication with Fluid Antenna for Metaverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of sensing and communication (ISAC) is pivotal for the Metaverse but faces challenges like high data volume and privacy concerns. This paper proposes a novel integrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (ISCSC) framework, which uses semantic communication to transmit only contextual information, reducing data overhead and enhancing efficiency. To address the sensitivity of semantic communication to channel conditions, fluid antennas (FAs) are introduced, enabling dynamic adaptability. The FA-enabled ISCSC framework considers multiple users and extended targets composed of a series of scatterers, formulating a joint optimization problem to maximize the data rate while ensuring sensing accuracy and meeting computational and power constraints. An alternating optimization (AO) method decomposes the problem into subproblems for ISAC beamforming, FA positioning, and semantic extraction. Simulations confirm the framework's effectiveness in improving data rates and sensing performance.</description>

      <title>Cross-Laplacians Based Topological Signal Processing over Cell MultiComplexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the interactions among different types of interconnected systems in complex networks has attracted significant interest across many research fields. However, effective signal processing over layered networks requires topological descriptors of the intra- and cross-layers relationships that are able to disentangle the homologies of different domains, at different scales, according to the specific learning task. In this paper, we present Cell MultiComplex (CMC) spaces, which are novel topological domains for representing multiple higher-order relationships among interconnected complexes. We introduce cross-Laplacians matrices, which are algebraic descriptors of CMCs enabling the extraction of topological invariants at different scales, whether global or local, inter-layer or intra-layer. Using the eigenvectors of these cross-Laplacians as signal bases, we develop topological signal processing tools for CMC spaces. In this first study, we focus on the representation and filtering of noisy flows observed over cross-edges between different layers of CMCs to identify cross-layer hubs, i.e., key nodes on one layer controlling the others.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Optimization of Antenna Switching Schemes for Dynamic Channel Sounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding wireless channels is crucial for the design of wireless systems. For mobile communication, sounders and antenna arrays with short measurement times are required to simultaneously capture the dynamic and spatial channel characteristics. Switched antenna arrays are an attractive option that can overcome the high cost of real arrays and the long measurement times of virtual arrays. Optimization of the switching sequences is then essential to avoid aliasing and increase the accuracy of channel parameter estimates. This paper provides a novel and comprehensive analysis of the design of switching sequences. We first review the conventional spatio-temporal ambiguity function, extend it to dual-polarized antenna arrays, and analyze its prohibitive complexity when designing for ultra-massive antenna arrays. We thus propose a new method that uses the Fisher information matrix to tackle the estimation accuracy. We also propose to minimize the ambiguity by choosing a switching sequence that minimizes side lobes in its Fourier spectrum. In this sense, we divide the sequence design problem into Fourier-based ambiguity reduction and Fisher-based accuracy improvement, and coin the resulting design approach as Fourier-Fisher. Simulations and measurements show that the Fourier-Fisher approach achieves identical performance and significantly lower computational complexity than that of the conventional ambiguity-based approach.</description>

      <title>Learning Higher-Order Interactions in Brain Networks via Topological Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our goal in this paper is to leverage the potential of the topological signal processing (TSP) framework for analyzing brain networks. Representing brain data as signals over simplicial complexes allows us to capture higher-order relationships within brain regions of interest (ROIs). Here, we focus on learning the underlying brain topology from observed neural signals using two distinct inference strategies. The first method relies on higher-order statistical metrics to infer multiway relationships among ROIs. The second method jointly learns the brain topology and sparse signal representations, of both the solenoidal and harmonic components of the signals, by minimizing the total variation along triangles and the data-fitting errors. Leveraging the properties of solenoidal and irrotational signals, and their physical interpretations, we extract functional connectivity features from brain topologies and uncover new insights into functional organization patterns. This allows us to associate brain functional connectivity (FC) patterns of conservative signals with well-known functional segregation and integration properties. Our findings align with recent neuroscience research, suggesting that our approach may offer a promising pathway for characterizing the higher-order brain functional connectivities.</description>

      <title>Filtering through a topological lens: homology for point processes on the time-frequency plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a very general approach to the analysis of signals from their noisy measurements from the perspective of Topological Data Analysis (TDA). While TDA has emerged as a powerful analytical tool for data with pronounced topological structures, here we demonstrate its applicability for general problems of signal processing, without any a-priori geometric feature. Our methods are well-suited to a wide array of time-dependent signals in different scientific domains, with acoustic signals being a particularly important application. We invoke time-frequency representations of such signals, focusing on their zeros which are gaining salience as a signal processing tool in view of their stability properties. Leveraging state-of-the-art topological concepts, such as stable and minimal volumes, we develop a complete suite of TDA-based methods to explore the delicate stochastic geometry of these zeros, capturing signals based on the disruption they cause to this rigid, hyperuniform spatial structure. Unlike classical spatial data tools, TDA is able to capture the full spectrum of the stochastic geometry of the zeros, thereby leading to powerful inferential outcomes that are underpinned by a principled statistical foundation. This is reflected in the power and versatility of our applications, which include competitive performance in processing. a wide variety of audio signals (esp. in low SNR regimes), effective detection and reconstruction of gravitational wave signals (a reputed signal processing challenge with non-Gaussian noise), and medical time series data from EEGs, indicating a wide horizon for the approach and methods introduced in this paper.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Robust Unscented Kalman Filter for Dynamic State Estimation of Power System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Gaussian noise and the uncertainty of noise distribution are the common factors that reduce accuracy in dynamic state estimation of power systems (PS). In addition, the optimal value of the free coefficients in the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) based on information theoretic criteria is also an urgent problem. In this paper, a robust adaptive UKF (AUKF) under generalized minimum mixture error entropy with fiducial points (GMMEEF) over improve Snow Geese algorithm (ISGA) (ISGA-GMMEEF-AUKF) is proposed to overcome the above difficulties. The estimation process of the proposed algorithm is based on several key steps including augmented regression error model (AREM) construction, adaptive state estimation, and free coefficients optimization. Specifically, an AREM consisting of state prediction and measurement errors is established at the first step. Then, GMMEEF-AUKF is developed by solving the optimization problem based on GMMEEF, which uses a generalized Gaussian kernel combined with mixture correntropy to enhance the flexibility further and resolve the data problem with complex attributes and update the noise covariance matrix according to the AREM framework. Finally, the ISGA is designed to automatically calculate the optimal value of coefficients such as the shape coefficients of the kernel in the GMMEEF criterion, the coefficients selection sigma points in unscented transform, and the update coefficient of the noise covariance matrices fit with the PS model. Simulation results on the IEEE 14, 30, and 57-bus test systems in complex scenarios have confirmed that the proposed algorithm outperforms the MEEF-UKF and UKF by an average efficiency of 26% and 65%, respectively.</description>

      <title>On-Chip and Off-Chip TIA Amplifiers for Nanopore Signal Readout Design, Performance and Challenges: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in biomedical research have driven continuous innovations in sensing and diagnostic technologies. Among these, nanopore based single molecule sensing and sequencing is rapidly emerging as a powerful and versatile sensing methodology. Advancements in nanopore based approaches require concomitant improvements in the electronic readout methods employed, from the point of low noise, bandwidth and form factor. This article focuses on current sensing circuits designed and employed for ultra low noise nanopore signal readout, addressing the fundamental limitations of traditional off chip transimpedance amplifiers (TIAs), which suffer from high input parasitic capacitance, bandwidth constraints, and increased noise at high frequencies. This review explores the latest design schemes and circuit structures classified into on-chip and off-chip TIA designs, highlighting their design implementation, performance, respective challenges and explores the interplay between noise performance, capacitance, and bandwidth across diverse transimpedance amplifier (TIA) configurations. Emphasis is placed on characterizing noise response under varying parasitic capacitance and operational frequencies, a systematic evaluation not extensively addressed in prior literature while also considering the allowable input current compliance range limitations. The review also compares the widely used Axopatch 200B system to the designs reported in literature. The findings offer valuable insights into optimizing TIA designs for enhanced signal integrity in high speed and high sensitivity applications focusing on noise reduction, impedance matching, DC blocking, and offset cancellation techniques.</description>

      <title>Visual-Aware Speech Recognition for Noisy Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans have the ability to utilize visual cues, such as lip movements and visual scenes, to enhance auditory perception, particularly in noisy environments. However, current Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) models often struggle in noisy scenarios. To solve this task, we propose a model that improves transcription by correlating noise sources to visual cues. Unlike works that rely on lip motion and require the speaker's visibility, we exploit broader visual information from the environment. This allows our model to naturally filter speech from noise and improve transcription, much like humans do in noisy scenarios. Our method re-purposes pretrained speech and visual encoders, linking them with multi-headed attention. This approach enables the transcription of speech and the prediction of noise labels in video inputs. We introduce a scalable pipeline to develop audio-visual datasets, where visual cues correlate to noise in the audio. We show significant improvements over existing audio-only models in noisy scenarios. Results also highlight that visual cues play a vital role in improved transcription accuracy.</description>

      <title>Enabling Continuous 5G Connectivity in Aircraft through Low Earth Orbit Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As air travel demand increases, uninterrupted high-speed internet access becomes essential. However, current satellite-based systems face latency and connectivity challenges. While prior research has focused on terrestrial 5G and geostationary satellites, there is a gap in optimizing Low Earth Orbit (LEO)-based 5G systems for aircraft. This study evaluates the feasibility of deployment strategies and improving signal quality with LEO satellites for seamless in-flight 5G connectivity. Using Matlab and Simulink, we model satellite trajectories, aircraft movement, and handover mechanisms, complemented by ray-tracing techniques for in-cabin signal analysis. Results show that proposed LEO satellite configurations enhance coverage and reduce latency, with sequential handovers minimizing service interruptions. These findings contribute to advancing in-flight 5G networks, improving passenger experience, and supporting real-time global connectivity solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) play a pivotal role in modern autonomous air mobility, and the reliability of UAV avionics systems is critical to ensuring mission success, sustainability practices, and public safety. The success of UAV missions depends on effectively mitigating various aspects of electronic warfare, including non-destructive and destructive cyberattacks, transponder vulnerabilities, and jamming threats, while rigorously implementing countermeasures and defensive aids. This paper provides a comprehensive review of UAV cyberattacks, countermeasures, and defensive strategies. It explores UAV-to-UAV coordination attacks and their associated features, such as dispatch system attacks, Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) attacks, Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS)-induced collisions, and TCAS attacks. Additionally, the paper examines UAV-to-command center coordination attacks, as well as UAV functionality attacks. The review also covers various countermeasures and defensive aids designed for UAVs. Lastly, a comparison of common cyberattacks and countermeasure approaches is conducted, along with a discussion of future trends in the field. Keywords: Electronic warfare, UAVs, Avionics Systems, cyberattacks, coordination attacks, functionality attacks, countermeasure, defensive-aids.</description>

      <title>Enabling Gigantic MIMO Beamforming with Analog Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our previous work, we have introduced a microwave linear analog computer (MiLAC) as an analog computer that processes microwave signals linearly, demonstrating its potential to reduce the computational complexity of specific signal processing tasks. In this paper, we extend these benefits to wireless communications, showcasing how MiLAC enables gigantic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) beamforming entirely in the analog domain. MiLAC-aided beamforming can implement regularized zero-forcing beamforming (R-ZFBF) at the transmitter and minimum mean square error (MMSE) detection at the receiver, while significantly reducing hardware costs by minimizing the number of radio-frequency (RF) chains and only relying on low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs). In addition, it eliminates per-symbol operations by completely avoiding digital-domain processing and remarkably reduces the computational complexity of R-ZFBF, which scales quadratically with the number of antennas instead of cubically. Numerical results show that it can perform R-ZFBF with a computational complexity reduction of up to 7400 times compared to digital beamforming.</description>

      <title>Open Datasets for Grid Modeling and Visualization: An Alberta Power Network Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the power and energy industry, multiple entities in grid operational logs are frequently recorded and updated. Thanks to recent advances in IT facilities and smart metering services, a variety of datasets such as system load, generation mix, and grid connection are often publicly available. While these resources are valuable in evaluating power grid's operational conditions and system resilience, the lack of fine-grained, accurate locational information constrain the usage of current data, which further hinders the development of smart grid and renewables integration. For instance, electricity end users are not aware of nodal generation mix or carbon emissions, while the general public have limited understanding about the effect of demand response or renewables integration if only the whole system's demands and generations are available. In this work, we focus on recovering power grid topology and line flow directions from open public dataset. Taking the Alberta grid as a working example, we start from mapping multi-modal power system datasets to the grid topology integrated with geographical information. By designing a novel optimization-based scheme to recover line flow directions, we are able to analyze and visualize the interactions between generations and demand vectors in an efficient manner. Proposed research is fully open-sourced and highly generalizable, which can help model and visualize grid information, create synthetic dataset, and facilitate analytics and decision-making framework for clean energy transition.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-based Near-field Emitter Location Sensing via Grouped Hybrid Analog and Digital XL-MIMO Receive Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09695v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a green MIMO structure, the partially-connected hybrid analog and digital (PC-HAD) structure has been widely used in the far-field (FF) scenario for it can significantly reduce the hardware cost and complexity of large-scale or extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) array. Recently, near-field (NF) emitter localization including direction-of-arrival (DOA) and range estimations has drawn a lot of attention, but is rarely explored via PC-HAD structure. In this paper, we first analyze the impact of PC-HAD structure on the NF emitter localization and observe that the phase ambiguity (PA) problem caused by PC-HAD structure can be removed inherently with low-latency in the NF scenario. To obtain the exact NF DOA estimation results, we propose a grouped PC-HAD structure, which is capable of dividing the NF DOA estimation problem into multiple FF DOA estimation problems via partitioning the large-scale PC-HAD array into small-scale groups. An angle calibration method is developed to address the inconsistency among these FF DOA estimation problems. Then, to eliminate PA and improve the NF emitter localization performance, we develop three machine learning (ML)-based methods, i.e., two low-complexity data-driven clustering-based methods and one model-driven regression method, namely RegNet. Furthermore, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of NF emitter localization for the proposed grouped PC-HAD structure is derived and reveals that localization performance will decrease with the increasing of the number of groups. The simulation results show that the proposed methods can achieve CRLB at different SNR regions, the RegNet has great performance advantages at low SNR regions and the clustering-based methods have much lower computation complexity.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical View of Structured Sparsity in Kronecker Compressive Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kronecker compressed sensing refers to using Kronecker product matrices as sparsifying bases and measurement matrices in compressed sensing. This work focuses on the Kronecker compressed sensing problem, encompassing three sparsity structures: $(i)$ a standard sparsity model with arbitrarily positioned nonzero entries, $(ii)$ a hierarchical sparsity model where nonzero entries are concentrated in a few blocks, each with only a subset of nonzero entries, and $(iii)$ a Kronecker-supported sparsity model where the support vector is a Kronecker product of smaller vectors. We present a hierarchal view of Kronecker compressed sensing that explicitly reveals a multiple-level sparsity pattern. This framework allows us to utilize the Kronecker structure of dictionaries and design a two-stage sparse recovery algorithm for different sparsity models. Further, we analyze the restricted isometry property of Kronecker-structured matrices under different sparsity models. Simulations show that our algorithm offers comparable recovery performance to state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing runtime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the development of artificial intelligence integrated next-generation communication networks, mobile users (MUs) are increasingly demanding the efficient processing of computation-intensive and latency-sensitive tasks. However, existing mobile computing networks struggle to support the rapidly growing computational needs of the MUs. Fortunately, space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) supported mobile edge computing (MEC) is regarded as an effective solution, offering the MUs multi-tier and efficient computing services. In this paper, we consider an SAGIN supported MEC system, where a low Earth orbit satellite and multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are dispatched to provide computing services for MUs. An energy efficiency maximization problem is formulated, with the joint optimization of the MU-UAV association, the UAV trajectory, the task offloading decision, the computing frequency, and the transmission power control. Since the problem is non-convex, we decompose it into four subproblems, and propose an alternating optimization based algorithm to solve it. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Crowd Size Estimation for Non-Uniform Spatial Distributions with mmWave Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel methodology for crowd size estimation using monostatic mmWave radar. Our aim is to accurately count large crowds that follow a non-uniform spatial distribution. Our estimation approach relies on the rigorous derivation of occlusion probabilities, which are then used to mathematically characterize the probability distributions that describe the number of agents visible to the radar as a function of the crowd size. We then estimate the true crowd size by comparing these derived mathematical models to the empirical distribution of the number of visible agents detected by the radar. This method requires minimal sensing capabilities (e.g., angle-of-arrival information is not needed), thus being well suited for either a dedicated mmWave radar or an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. Extensive numerical simulations validate our methodology, demonstrating strong performance across diverse spatial distributions and for crowd sizes of up to (and including) 30 agents. We achieve a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.48 agents, significantly outperforming a baseline which assumes that the agents are uniformly distributed in the area. Overall, our approach holds significant promise for a variety of applications including network resource allocation, crowd management, and urban planning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work develops a physically consistent model for stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) using multiport network theory and transfer scattering parameters (T-parameters). Unlike the scattering parameters (S-parameters) model, the developed T-parameters model is simpler and more tractable. Moreover, the T-parameters constraints for lossless reciprocal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are derived. Additionally, a gradient descent algorithm (GDA) is introduced to maximize sum-rate in SIM-aided multiuser scenarios, demonstrating that mutual coupling and feedback between consecutive layers enhance performance. However, increasing SIM layers with a fixed total number of elements typically degrades sum-rate, unless the simplified channel model employing Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction coefficients is utilized.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a systematic literature review on deep generative models for physiological signals, particularly electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG), photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electromyogram (EMG). Compared to the existing review papers, we present the first review that summarizes the recent state-of-the-art deep generative models. By analyzing the state-of-the-art research related to deep generative models along with their main applications and challenges, this review contributes to the overall understanding of these models applied to physiological signals. Additionally, by highlighting the employed evaluation protocol and the most used physiological databases, this review facilitates the assessment and benchmarking of deep generative models.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the robust Hankel recovery problem, which simultaneously removes the sparse outliers and fulfills missing entries from the partial observation. We propose a novel non-convex algorithm, coined Hankel Structured Newton-Like Descent (HSNLD), to tackle the robust Hankel recovery problem. HSNLD is highly efficient with linear convergence, and its convergence rate is independent of the condition number of the underlying Hankel matrix. The recovery guarantee has been established under some mild conditions. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show the superior performance of HSNLD against state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Physical Layer Security: From Far-Field to Near-Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The secrecy performance in both near-field and far-field communications is analyzed using two fundamental metrics: the secrecy capacity under a power constraint and the minimum power requirement to achieve a specified secrecy rate target. 1) For the secrecy capacity, a closed-form expression is derived under a discrete-time memoryless setup. This expression is further analyzed under several far-field and near-field channel models, and the capacity scaling law is revealed by assuming an infinitely large transmit array and an infinitely high power. A novel concept of "depth of insecurity" is proposed to evaluate the secrecy performance achieved by near-field beamfocusing. It is demonstrated that increasing the number of transmit antennas reduces this depth and thus improves the secrecy performance. 2) Regarding the minimum required power, a closed-form expression is derived and analyzed within far-field and near-field scenarios. Asymptotic analyses are performed by setting the number of transmit antennas to infinity to unveil the power scaling law. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate that: i) compared to far-field communications, near-field communications expand the areas where secure transmission is feasible, specifically when the eavesdropper is located in the same direction as the intended receiver; ii) as the number of transmit antennas increases, neither the secrecy capacity nor the minimum required power scales or vanishes unboundedly, adhering to the principle of energy conservation.</description>
