      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Automated Stock Trading: An Ensemble Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stock trading strategies play a critical role in investment. However, it is challenging to design a profitable strategy in a complex and dynamic stock market. In this paper, we propose an ensemble strategy that employs deep reinforcement schemes to learn a stock trading strategy by maximizing investment return. We train a deep reinforcement learning agent and obtain an ensemble trading strategy using three actor-critic based algorithms: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Advantage Actor Critic (A2C), and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). The ensemble strategy inherits and integrates the best features of the three algorithms, thereby robustly adjusting to different market situations. In order to avoid the large memory consumption in training networks with continuous action space, we employ a load-on-demand technique for processing very large data. We test our algorithms on the 30 Dow Jones stocks that have adequate liquidity. The performance of the trading agent with different reinforcement learning algorithms is evaluated and compared with both the Dow Jones Industrial Average index and the traditional min-variance portfolio allocation strategy. The proposed deep ensemble strategy is shown to outperform the three individual algorithms and two baselines in terms of the risk-adjusted return measured by the Sharpe ratio.

      <title>A Practical Machine Learning Approach for Dynamic Stock Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stock recommendation is vital to investment companies and investors. However, no single stock selection strategy will always win while analysts may not have enough time to check all S&amp;P 500 stocks (the Standard &amp; Poor's 500). In this paper, we propose a practical scheme that recommends stocks from S&amp;P 500 using machine learning. Our basic idea is to buy and hold the top 20% stocks dynamically. First, we select representative stock indicators with good explanatory power. Secondly, we take five frequently used machine learning methods, including linear regression, ridge regression, stepwise regression, random forest and generalized boosted regression, to model stock indicators and quarterly log-return in a rolling window. Thirdly, we choose the model with the lowest Mean Square Error in each period to rank stocks. Finally, we test the selected stocks by conducting portfolio allocation methods such as equally weighted, mean-variance, and minimum-variance. Our empirical results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the long-only strategy on the S&amp;P 500 index in terms of Sharpe ratio and cumulative returns.

      <title>Discovery of a 13-Sharpe OOS Factor: Drift Regimes Unlock Hidden Cross-Sectional Predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We document a high-performing cross-sectional equity factor that achieves out-of-sample Sharpe ratios above 13 through regime-conditional signal activation. The strategy combines value and short-term reversal signals only during stock-specific drift regimes, defined as periods when individual stocks show more than 60 percent positive days in trailing 63-day windows. Under these conditions, the factor delivers annualized returns of 158.6 percent with 12.0 percent volatility and a maximum drawdown of minus 11.9 percent. Using rigorous walk-forward validation across 20 years of S&amp;P 500 data (2004 to 2024), we show performance roughly 13 times stronger than market benchmarks on a risk-adjusted basis, produced entirely out-of-sample with frozen parameters. The factor passes extensive robustness tests, including 1,000 randomization trials with p-values below 0.001, and maintains Sharpe ratios above 7 even under 30 percent parameter perturbations. Exposure to standard risk factors is negligible, with total R-squared values below 3 percent. We provide mechanistic evidence that drift regimes reshape market microstructure by amplifying behavioral biases, altering liquidity patterns, and creating conditions where cross-sectional price discovery becomes systematically exploitable. Conservative capacity estimates indicate deployable capital of 100 to 500 million dollars before noticeable performance degradation.</description>

      <title>Stationary Distributions of the Mode-switching Chiarella Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the stationary distribution in various regimes of the extended Chiarella model of financial markets. This model is a stochastic nonlinear dynamical system that encompasses dynamical competition between a (saturating) trending and a mean-reverting component. We find the so-called mispricing distribution and the trend distribution to be unimodal Gaussians in the small noise, small feedback limit. Slow trends yield Gaussian-cosh mispricing distributions that allow for a P-bifurcation: unimodality occurs when mean-reversion is fast, bimodality when it is slow. The critical point of this bifurcation is established and refutes previous ad-hoc reports and differs from the bifurcation condition of the dynamical system itself. For fast, weakly coupled trends, deploying the Furutsu-Novikov theorem reveals that the result is again unimodal Gaussian. For the same case with higher coupling we disprove another claim from the literature: bimodal trend distributions do not generally imply bimodal mispricing distributions. The latter becomes bimodal only for stronger trend feedback. The exact solution in this last regime remains unfortunately beyond our proficiency.</description>

      <title>Market-Dependent Communication in Multi-Agent Alpha Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-strategy hedge funds face a fundamental organizational choice: should analysts generating trading strategies communicate, and if so, how? We investigate this using 5-agent LLM-based trading systems across 450 experiments spanning 21 months, comparing five organizational structures from isolated baseline to collaborative and competitive conversation. We show that communication improves performance, but optimal communication design depends on market characteristics. Competitive conversation excels in volatile technology stocks, while collaborative conversation dominates stable general stocks. Finance stocks resist all communication interventions. Surprisingly, all structures, including isolated agents, converge to similar strategy alignments, challenging assumptions that transparency causes harmful diversity loss. Performance differences stem from behavioral mechanisms: competitive agents focus on stock-level allocation while collaborative agents develop technical frameworks. Conversation quality scores show zero correlation with returns. These findings demonstrate that optimal communication design must match market volatility characteristics, and sophisticated discussions don't guarantee better performance.</description>

      <title>Optimal Quoting under Adverse Selection and Price Reading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past decade, many dealers have implemented algorithmic models to automatically respond to RFQs and manage flows originating from their electronic platforms. In parallel, building on the foundational work of Ho and Stoll, and later Avellaneda and Stoikov, the academic literature on market making has expanded to address trade size distributions, client tiering, complex price dynamics, alpha signals, and the internalization versus externalization dilemma in markets with dealer-to-client and interdealer-broker segments. In this paper, we tackle two critical dimensions: adverse selection, arising from the presence of informed traders, and price reading, whereby the market maker's own quotes inadvertently reveal the direction of their inventory. These risks are well known to practitioners, who routinely face informed flows and algorithms capable of extracting signals from quoting behavior. Yet they have received limited attention in the quantitative finance literature, beyond stylized toy models with limited actionability. Extending the existing literature, we propose a tractable and implementable framework that enables market makers to adjust their quotes with greater awareness of informational risk.</description>

      <title>FinGPT: Open-Source Financial Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown the potential of revolutionizing natural language processing tasks in diverse domains, sparking great interest in finance. Accessing high-quality financial data is the first challenge for financial LLMs (FinLLMs). While proprietary models like BloombergGPT have taken advantage of their unique data accumulation, such privileged access calls for an open-source alternative to democratize Internet-scale financial data.
  In this paper, we present an open-source large language model, FinGPT, for the finance sector. Unlike proprietary models, FinGPT takes a data-centric approach, providing researchers and practitioners with accessible and transparent resources to develop their FinLLMs. We highlight the importance of an automatic data curation pipeline and the lightweight low-rank adaptation technique in building FinGPT. Furthermore, we showcase several potential applications as stepping stones for users, such as robo-advising, algorithmic trading, and low-code development. Through collaborative efforts within the open-source AI4Finance community, FinGPT aims to stimulate innovation, democratize FinLLMs, and unlock new opportunities in open finance.
