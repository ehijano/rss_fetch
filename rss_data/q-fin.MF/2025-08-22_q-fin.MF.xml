      <title>Option pricing under non-Markovian stochastic volatility models: A deep signature approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the pricing problem in which the underlying asset follows a non-Markovian stochastic volatility model. Classical partial differential equation methods face significant challenges in this context, as the option prices depend not only on the current state, but also on the entire historical path of the process. To overcome these difficulties, we reformulate the asset dynamics as a rough stochastic differential equation and then represent the rough paths via linear or non-linear combinations of time-extended Brownian motion signatures. This representation transforms a rough stochastic differential equation to a classical stochastic differential equation, allowing the application of standard analytical tools. We propose a deep signature approach for both linear and nonlinear representations and rigorously prove the convergence of the algorithm. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for both Markovian and non-Markovian volatility models, offering a theoretically grounded and computationally efficient framework for option pricing.</description>

      <title>Eigen Portfolios: From Single Component Models to Ensemble Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing integration of data science techniques into quantitative finance has enabled more systematic and data-driven approaches to portfolio construction. This paper investigates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in constructing eigen-portfolios - portfolios derived from the principal components of the asset return correlation matrix. We begin by formalizing the mathematical underpinnings of eigen-portfolios and demonstrate how PCA can reveal latent orthogonal factors driving market behavior. Using the 30 constituent stocks of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) from 2020 onward, we conduct an empirical analysis to evaluate the in-sample and out-of-sample performance of eigen-portfolios. Our results highlight that selecting a single eigen-portfolio based on in-sample Sharpe ratio often leads to significant overfitting and poor generalization. In response, we propose an ensemble strategy that combines multiple top-performing eigen-portfolios. This ensemble method substantially improves out-of-sample performance and exceeds benchmark returns in terms of Sharpe ratio, offering a practical and interpretable alternative to conventional portfolio construction methods.</description>

      <title>The Approach of Sliced Inference in Systems of Stochastic Differential Equations with Comments on the Heston Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic differential equations have been an important tool in modeling complex financial relations, equipped with the possibility of being multidimensional to better oversee complexities inherent in finance. This multidimensionality, however, comes with a larger parameter space to estimate. Therefore, via a dimension reduction method, Sliced Inverse Regression, we aim to reduce high-dimensional parameter space to a reduced feature space and aim to estimate the parameters on this new featured space rather than using full data structure to lower computational costs. For this study, we closely study the Heston model, and remark our methodology of inference on this chosen model.</description>

      <title>From constant to rough: A survey of continuous volatility modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01033v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of continuous stochastic volatility models, discussing their historical development and the key stylized facts that have driven the field. Special attention is dedicated to fractional and rough methods: we outline the motivation behind them and characterize some landmark models. In addition, we briefly touch the problem of VIX modeling and recent advances in the SPX-VIX joint calibration puzzle.</description>

      <title>Multi-period static hedging of European options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01104v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the hedging of European options when the price of the underlying asset follows a single-factor Markovian framework. By working in such a setting, Carr and Wu \cite{carr2014static} derived a spanning relation between a given option and a continuum of shorter-term options written on the same asset. In this paper, we have extended their approach to simultaneously include options over multiple short maturities. We then show a practical implementation of this with a finite set of shorter-term options to determine the hedging error using a Gaussian Quadrature method. We perform a wide range of experiments for both the \textit{Black-Scholes} and \textit{Merton Jump Diffusion} models, illustrating the comparative performance of the two methods.</description>

      <title>Optimal consumption under relaxed benchmark tracking and consumption drawdown constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16611v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies an optimal consumption problem with both relaxed benchmark tracking and consumption drawdown constraint, leading to a stochastic control problem with dynamic state-control constraints. In our relaxed tracking formulation, it is assumed that the fund manager can strategically inject capital to the fund account such that the total capital process always outperforms the benchmark process, which is described by a geometric Brownian motion. We first transform the original regular-singular control problem with state-control constraints into an equivalent regular control problem with a reflected state process and consumption drawdown constraint. By utilizing the dual transform and the optimal consumption behavior, we then turn to study the linear dual PDE with both Neumann boundary condition and free boundary condition in a piecewise manner across different regions. Using the smoothfit principle and the super-contact condition, we derive the closed-form solution of the dual PDE, and obtain the optimal investment and consumption in feedback form. We then prove the verification theorem on optimality by some novel arguments with the aid of an auxiliary reflected dual process and some technical estimations. Some numerical examples and financial insights are also presented.</description>
