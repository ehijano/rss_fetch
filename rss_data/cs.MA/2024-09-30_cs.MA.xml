      <title>Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Dispatching in Material Handling Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to learn dynamic dispatching strategies, which is crucial for optimizing throughput in material handling systems across diverse industries. To benchmark our method, we developed a material handling environment that reflects the complexities of an actual system, such as various activities at different locations, physical constraints, and inherent uncertainties. To enhance exploration during learning, we propose a method to integrate domain knowledge in the form of existing dynamic dispatching heuristics. Our experimental results show that our method can outperform heuristics by up to 7.4 percent in terms of median throughput. Additionally, we analyze the effect of different architectures on MARL performance when training multiple agents with different functions. We also demonstrate that the MARL agents performance can be further improved by using the first iteration of MARL agents as heuristics to train a second iteration of MARL agents. This work demonstrates the potential of applying MARL to learn effective dynamic dispatching strategies that may be deployed in real-world systems to improve business outcomes.</description>

      <title>Toward Universal and Interpretable World Models for Open-ended Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generic, compositional and interpretable class of generative world models that supports open-ended learning agents. This is a sparse class of Bayesian networks capable of approximating a broad range of stochastic processes, which provide agents with the ability to learn world models in a manner that may be both interpretable and computationally scalable. This approach integrating Bayesian structure learning and intrinsically motivated (model-based) planning enables agents to actively develop and refine their world models, which may lead to open-ended learning and more robust, adaptive behavior.</description>

      <title>Facility Location Problem with Aleatory Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study the Facility Location Problem with Aleatory Agents (FLPAA), where the facility accommodates n agents larger than the number of agents reporting their preferences, namely n_r. The spare capacity is used by n_u=n-n_r aleatory agents sampled from a probability distribution \mu. The goal of FLPAA is to find a location that minimizes the ex-ante social cost, which is the expected cost of the n_u agents sampled from \mu plus the cost incurred by the agents reporting their position. We investigate the mechanism design aspects of the FLPAA under the assumption that the Mechanism Designer (MD) lacks knowledge of the distribution $\mu$ but can query k quantiles of \mu. We explore the trade-off between acquiring more insights into the probability distribution and designing a better-performing mechanism, which we describe through the strong approximation ratio (SAR). The SAR of a mechanism measures the highest ratio between the cost of the mechanisms and the cost of the optimal solution on the worst-case input x and worst-case distribution \mu, offering a metric for efficiency that does not depend on \mu. We divide our study into four different information settings: the zero information case, in which the MD has access to no quantiles; the median information case, in which the MD has access to the median of \mu; the n_u-quantile information case, in which the MD has access to n_u quantiles of its choice, and the k-quantile information case, in which the MD has access to k&lt;n_u quantiles of its choice. For all frameworks, we propose a mechanism that is optimal or achieves a small constant SAR and pairs it with a lower bound on the SAR. In most cases, the lower bound matches the upper bound, thus no truthful mechanism can achieve a lower SAR. Lastly, we extend the FLPAA to include instances in which we must locate two facilities.</description>

      <title>Safe Decentralized Multi-Agent Control using Black-Box Predictors, Conformal Decision Policies, and Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of safe control in decentralized multi-agent robotic settings, where agents use uncertain black-box models to predict other agents' trajectories. We use the recently proposed conformal decision theory to adapt the restrictiveness of control barrier functions-based safety constraints based on observed prediction errors. We use these constraints to synthesize controllers that balance between the objectives of safety and task accomplishment, despite the prediction errors. We provide an upper bound on the average over time of the value of a monotonic function of the difference between the safety constraint based on the predicted trajectories and the constraint based on the ground truth ones. We validate our theory through experimental results showing the performance of our controllers when navigating a robot in the multi-agent scenes in the Stanford Drone Dataset.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quasi-Newton Method for Multi-Agent Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a distributed quasi-Newton (DQN) method, which enables a group of agents to compute an optimal solution of a separable multi-agent optimization problem locally using an approximation of the curvature of the aggregate objective function. Each agent computes a descent direction from its local estimate of the aggregate Hessian, obtained from quasi-Newton approximation schemes using the gradient of its local objective function. Moreover, we introduce a distributed quasi-Newton method for equality-constrained optimization (EC-DQN), where each agent takes Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-like update steps to compute an optimal solution. In our algorithms, each agent communicates with its one-hop neighbors over a peer-to-peer communication network to compute a common solution. We prove convergence of our algorithms to a stationary point of the optimization problem. In addition, we demonstrate the competitive empirical convergence of our algorithm in both well-conditioned and ill-conditioned optimization problems, in terms of the computation time and communication cost incurred by each agent for convergence, compared to existing distributed first-order and second-order methods. Particularly, in ill-conditioned problems, our algorithms achieve a faster computation time for convergence, while requiring a lower communication cost, across a range of communication networks with different degrees of connectedness.</description>

      <title>Plurals: A System for Guiding LLMs Via Simulated Social Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent debates raised concerns that language models may favor certain viewpoints. But what if the solution is not to aim for a 'view from nowhere' but rather to leverage different viewpoints? We introduce Plurals, a system and Python library for pluralistic AI deliberation. Plurals consists of Agents (LLMs, optionally with personas) which deliberate within customizable Structures, with Moderators overseeing deliberation. Plurals is a generator of simulated social ensembles. Plurals integrates with government datasets to create nationally representative personas, includes deliberation templates inspired by democratic deliberation theory, and allows users to customize both information-sharing structures and deliberation behavior within Structures. Six case studies demonstrate fidelity to theoretical constructs and efficacy. Three randomized experiments show simulated focus groups produced output resonant with an online sample of the relevant audiences (chosen over zero-shot generation in 75% of trials). Plurals is both a paradigm and a concrete system for pluralistic AI. The Plurals library is available at https://github.com/josh-ashkinaze/plurals and will be continually updated.</description>

      <title>Explaining Explaining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explanation is key to people having confidence in high-stakes AI systems. However, machine-learning-based systems -- which account for almost all current AI -- can't explain because they are usually black boxes. The explainable AI (XAI) movement hedges this problem by redefining "explanation". The human-centered explainable AI (HCXAI) movement identifies the explanation-oriented needs of users but can't fulfill them because of its commitment to machine learning. In order to achieve the kinds of explanations needed by real people operating in critical domains, we must rethink how to approach AI. We describe a hybrid approach to developing cognitive agents that uses a knowledge-based infrastructure supplemented by data obtained through machine learning when applicable. These agents will serve as assistants to humans who will bear ultimate responsibility for the decisions and actions of the human-robot team. We illustrate the explanatory potential of such agents using the under-the-hood panels of a demonstration system in which a team of simulated robots collaborate on a search task assigned by a human.</description>
