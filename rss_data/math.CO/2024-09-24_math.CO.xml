      <title>Ramanujan graphs with diameter at most three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a simple graph $G$, the complement and the line graph of $G$ are denoted by $G^c$ and $L(G)$, respectively. In this paper, we show that for every simple connected regular graph $G$ with at least $5$ vertices, the graph $\mathcal{R}(G):=L(L(G)^c)^c$ is a Ramanujan graph with diameter at most three.</description>

      <title>Detachable pairs in $3$-connected matroids and simple $3$-connected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a $3$-connected matroid. A pair $\{e,f\}$ in $M$ is detachable if $M \backslash e \backslash f$ or $M / e / f$ is $3$-connected. Williams (2015) proved that if $M$ has at least 13 elements, then at least one of the following holds: $M$ has a detachable pair, $M$ has a $3$-element circuit or cocircuit, or $M$ is a spike. We address the case where $M$ has a $3$-element circuit or cocircuit, to obtain a characterisation of when a matroid with at least 13 elements has a detachable pair. As a consequence, we characterise when a simple $3$-connected graph $G$ with $|E(G)| \ge 13$ has a pair of edges $\{e,f\}$ such that $G/e/f$ or $G \backslash e\backslash f$ is simple and $3$-connected.</description>

      <title>On the zero-free region for the chromatic polynomial of graphs with maximum degree $\Delta$ and girth $g$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of the present paper is to provide, for all pairs of integers $(\Delta,g)$ with $\D\ge 3$ and $g\ge 3$, a positive number $C(\Delta, g)$ such that chromatic polynomial $P_G(q)$ of a graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$ and finite girth $g$ is free of zero if $|q|\ge C(\Delta, g)$. Our bounds enlarge the zero-free region in the complex plane of $P_G(q)$ in comparison to previous bounds. In particular, for small values of $\D$ our estimates yield a sensible improvement on the bounds recently obtained by Jenssen, Patel and Regts in \cite{JPR}, while they coincide with those of \cite{JPR} when $\Delta\to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Maximal chains in lattices from graph associahedra: Tamari to the weak order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the maximal chains of lattices which generalizes both the weak order and the Tamari lattice: certain lattices of maximal tubings. A maximal tubing poset $\mathfrak{L}(G)$ is defined for any graph $G$, but for the graphs we consider in this paper, the poset is a lattice. Just as the weak order is an orientation of the $1$-skeleton of the permutahedron and the Tamari of the associahedron, each tubing lattice is an orientation of the $1$-skeleton of a graph associahedron. The partial order on $\mathfrak{L}(G)$ is given by a projection from $\mathfrak{S}_n$ to $\mathfrak{L}(G)$. In particular, when the graph is the complete graph, the graph associahedron is the the permutahedron, and when it is the path graph, it is the Stasheff associahedron.
  Our main results are for lollipop graphs, graphs that ``interpolate'' between the path and the complete graphs. For lollipop graphs, the lattices consist of permutations which satisfy a generalization of $312$-avoiding. The maximum length chains correspond to partially shiftable tableaux under the Edelman-Greene's Coxeter-Knuth bijection. We also consider functions defined analogously to Stanley's symmetric function for the maximum length chains and find their expansion in terms of Young quasisymmetric Schur functions.</description>

      <title>Linear independence over naturally-ordered semirings with applications to dimension arguments in extremal combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of subsets $\mathcal{F} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\})$ has the disparate union property if any two disjoint subfamilies $\mathcal{F}_1, \mathcal{F}_2 \subseteq \mathcal{F}$ have distinct unions $\bigcup \mathcal{F}_1 \neq \bigcup \mathcal{F}_2$; what is the maximal size of a family with the disparate union property? Is there a simple and efficiently computable characterization of size-maximal families? This paper highlights a class of partially-ordered semirings -- difference ordered semirings with a multiplicatively absorbing element -- and shows it is common and easily constructed. We prove that a suitably modified definition of linear independence for semimodules over such semirings enjoys the same maximality property as for vector spaces, and can furthermore be efficiently detected by the bideterminant. These properties allow us to extend dimension argument in extremal combinatorics and provide simple and direct solutions to the puzzles above.</description>

      <title>The vertex-pancyclicity of the simplified shuffle-cube and the vertex-bipancyclicity of the balanced shuffle-cube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ $=$ $(V,E)$ is vertex-pancyclic if for every vertex $u$ and any integer $l$ ranging from $3$ to $|V|$, $G$ contains a cycle $C$ of length $l$ such that $u$ is on $C$. A bipartite graph $G$ $=$ $(V,E)$ is vertex-bipancyclic if for every vertex $u$ and any even integer $l$ ranging from $4$ to $|V|$, $G$ contains a cycle $C$ of length $l$ such that $u$ is on $C$. The simplified shuffle-cube and the balanced shuffle-cube, which are two variants of the shuffle-cube and are superior to shuffle-cube in terms of vertex-transitivity. In this paper, we show that the $n$-dimensional simplified shuffle-cube is vertex-pancyclic for $n\geqslant 6$, and the $n$-dimensional balanced shuffle-cube is vertex-bipancyclic for $n\geqslant 2$.</description>

      <title>Total Domination Index in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of compliant vertices and compliant graphs, with a focus on the total domination degree (TDD) of a vertex in compliant graphs. The TDD is systematically calculated for various graph classes, including path graphs, cycles, book graphs, windmill graphs, wheel graphs, complete graphs, and complete bipartite graphs. The study explores inequalities involving TDD and defines total domination regular graphs. Furthermore, the TDD is analyzed in several graph operations such as union, join, composition, and corona, with a discussion on the property of the resulting graphs. The paper also examines the subdivision of complete graphs and degree splitting of path graphs. In the subsequent section, the total domination index (TDI) is introduced, and its values are calculated for different graph classes. The study concludes with bounds for the TDI across these graph classes.</description>

      <title>Distinct degrees and homogeneous sets II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an $n$-vertex graph $G$, let $\hom (G)$ denote the size of a largest homogeneous set in $G$ and let $f(G)$ denote the maximal number of distinct degrees appearing in an induced subgraph of $G$. The relationship between these parameters has been well studied by several researchers over the last 40 years, beginning with Erd\H{o}s, Faudree and S\'os in the Ramsey regime when $\hom (G) = O(\log n)$.
  Our main result here proves that any $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $\hom (G) \leq n^{1/2}$ satisfies
  \begin{align*}
  f(G) \geq \sqrt[3]{\frac {n^2}{\hom (G)} } \cdot n^{-o(1)}.
  \end{align*}
  This confirms a conjecture of the authors from a previous work, in which we addressed the $\hom (G) \geq n^{1/2}$ regime. Together, these provide the complete extremal relationship between these parameters (asymptotically), showing that any $n$-vertex graph $G$ satisfies
  \begin{align*}
  \max \Big ( f(G) \cdot \hom (G), \sqrt {f(G) ^3 \cdot \hom (G) } \Big ) \geq n^{1-o(1)}.
  \end{align*}
  This relationship is tight (up to the $n^{-o(1)}$ term) for all possible values of $\hom (G)$, from $\Omega (\log n )$ to $n$, as demonstrated by appropriately generated Erd\H{o}s $-$ Renyi random graphs.</description>

      <title>A Brualdi-Hoffman-Tur\'{a}n problem for friendship graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is said to be $H$-free if it does not contain $H$ as a subgraph. Brualdi-Hoffman-Tur\'{a}n type problem is to determine the maximum spectral radius of an $H$-free graph $G$ with give size $m$. The $F_k$ is the graph consisting of $k$ triangles that intersect in exactly one common vertex, which is known as the friendship graph. In this paper, we resolve a conjecture (the Brualdi-Hoffman-Tur\'{a}n-type problem for $F_k$) of Li, Lu and Peng [Discrete Math. 346 (2023) 113680] by using the $k$-core technique presented in Li, Zhai and Shu [European J. Combin, 120 (2024) 103966].</description>

      <title>Isolation game on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and a family of graphs $\cal F$, an $\cal F$-isolating set, as introduced by Caro and Hansberg, is any set $S\subset V(G)$ such that $G - N[S]$ contains no member of $\cal F$ as a subgraph. In this paper, we introduce a game in which two players with opposite goals are together building an $\cal F$-isolating set in $G$. Following the domination games, Dominator (Staller) wants that the resulting $\cal F$-isolating set obtained at the end of the game, is as small (as big) as possible, which leads to the graph invariant called the game $\cal F$-isolation number, denoted $\iota_{\rm g}(G,\cal F)$. We prove that the Continuation Principle holds in the $\cal F$-isolation game, and that the difference between the game $\cal F$-isolation numbers when either Dominator or Staller starts the game is at most $1$. Considering two arbitrary families of graphs $\cal F$ and $\cal F'$, we find relations between them that ensure $\iota_{\rm g}(G,{\cal{F}}') \leq \iota_{\rm g}(G,{\cal{F}})$ for any graph $G$. A special focus is given on the isolation game, which takes place when ${\cal F}=\{K_2\}$. We prove that $\iota_{\rm g}(G,\{K_2\})\le |V(G)|/2$ for any graph $G$, and conjecture that $\lceil 3|V(G)|/7\rceil$ is the actual (sharp) upper bound. We prove that the isolation game on a forest when Dominator has the first move never lasts longer than the one in which Staller starts the game. Finally, we prove good lower and upper bounds on the game isolation numbers of paths $P_n$, which lead to the exact values $\iota_{\rm g}(P_n,\{K_2\})=\left\lfloor\frac{2n+2}{5}\right\rfloor$ when $n \equiv i \pmod 5$ and $i \in \{1,2,3\}$.</description>

      <title>Avoiding secants of given size in finite projective planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $q$ be a prime power and $k$ be a natural number. What are the possible cardinalities of point sets ${S}$ in a projective plane of order $q$, which do not intersect any line at exactly $k$ points? This problem and its variants have been investigated before, in relation with blocking sets, untouchable sets or sets of even type, among others. In this paper we show a series of results which point out the existence of all or almost all possible values $m\in [0, q^2+q+1]$ for $|S|=m$, provided that $k$ is not close to the extremal values $0$ or $q+1$. Moreover, using polynomial techniques we show the existence of a point set $S$ with the following property: for every prescribed list of numbers $t_1, \ldots t_{q^2+q+1}$, $|S\cap \ell_i|\neq t_i$ holds for the $i$th line $\ell_i$, $\forall i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, q^2+q+1\}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tight $\ell$-cycle minus an edge $C_\ell^-$ is the $3$-graph on the vertex set $[\ell]$, where any three consecutive vertices in the string $123\ldots\ell 1$ form an edge. We show that for every $\ell\ge 5$, $\ell$ not divisible by $3$, the extremal number is
  $
  ex\left(C_\ell^-,n\right)=\tfrac1{24}n^3+O(n\ln n)=\left(\tfrac14+o(1)\right){n\choose 3}.
  $
  We determine the extremal graph up to $O(n)$ edge edits.</description>

      <title>A lower bound theorem for $d$-polytopes with $2d+2$ vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a lower bound theorem for the number of $k$-faces ($1\le k\le d-2$) in a $d$-dimensional polytope $P$ (abbreviated as a $d$-polytope) with $2d+2$ vertices, building on the known case for $k=1$. There are two distinct lower bounds depending on the number of facets in the $d$-polytope. We identify all minimisers for $d\le 5$. If $P$ has $d+2$ facets, the lower bound is tight when $d$ is odd. For $d\ge 5$ and $P$ with at least $d+3$ facets, the lower bound is always tight. Moreover, for $1\le k\le {d/3}-2$, minimisers among $d$-polytopes with $2d+2$ vertices are those with at least $d+3$ facets, while for ${0.4d}\le k\le d-1$, the lower bound arises from $d$-polytopes with $d+2$ facets. These results support Pineda-Villavicencio's lower bound conjecture for $d$-polytopes with at most $3d-1$ vertices.</description>

      <title>COVID on trees and infinite grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Hartnell's model for virus spread on a graph, also known as firefighting. For rooted trees, we propose an Unburning Algorithm, a type of greedy algorithm starting from the leaves and working back towards the root. We show that the algorithm saves at least half the vertices of the optimal solution and that this is bound is sharp. We confirm a conjecture of Hartke about integrality gaps when comparing linear and integer program solutions. For general graphs, we propose a Containment Protocol, which looks ahead two time steps to decide where to place vaccinations. We show that the protocol performs near optimally on four well-studied infinite grids. The protocol is available for any graph and we realize this flexibility by investigating an infinite pentagonal graph.</description>

      <title>Hadamard matrices in centraliser algebras of monomial representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Centraliser algebras of monomial representations of finite groups may be constructed and studied using methods similar to those employed in the study of permutation groups. Guided by results of D. G. Higman and others, we give an explicit construction for a basis of the centraliser algebra of a monomial representation. The character table of this algebra is then constructed via character sums over double cosets. We locate the theory of group-developed and cocyclic-developed Hadamard matrices within this framework. We apply Gr\"obner bases to produce a new classification of highly symmetric complex Hadamard matrices.</description>

      <title>A variation of the Morris constant term identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Morris constant term identity is important due to its equivalence with the well-known Selberg integral. We find a variation of the Morris constant term, denoted $h_n(t)$, in the study of the Ehrhart polynomial $H_n(t)$ of the $n$-th Birkhoff polytope, which consists of all doubly stochastic matrices of order $n$. The constant term $h_n(t)$ corresponds to a particular constant term in the study of $H_n(t)$. We give a characterization of $h_n(t)$ as a polynomial of degree $(n-1)^2$ with additional nice properties involving the Morris constant term identity. We also construct a recursion of $h_n(t)$ using a similar technique for the proof of the Morris constant term identity by Baldoni-Silva and Vergne, and by Xin. This method is applicable to any integer $n\geq 3$. We have produced explicit formulas of $h_n(t)$ for $3 \le n \le 29$ without difficulty.</description>

      <title>Minimum degree $k$ and $k$-connectedness usually arrive together</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14398v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $d,n\in \mathbb{N}$ be such that $d=\omega(1)$, and $d\le n^{1-a}$ for some constant $a&gt;0$. Consider a $d$-regular graph $G=(V, E)$ and the random graph process that starts with the empty graph $G(0)$ and at each step $G(i)$ is obtained from $G(i-1)$ by adding uniformly at random a new edge from $E$. We show that if $G$ satisfies some (very) mild global edge-expansion, and an almost optimal edge-expansion of sets up to order $O(d\log n)$, then for any constant $k\in \mathbb{N}$ in the random graph process on $G$, typically the hitting times of minimum degree at least $k$ and of $k$-connectedness are equal. This, in particular, covers both $d$-regular high dimensional product graphs and pseudo-random graphs, and confirms a conjecture of Joos from 2015. We further demonstrate that this result is tight in the sense that there are $d$-regular $n$-vertex graphs with optimal edge-expansion of sets up to order $\Omega(d)$, for which the probability threshold of minimum degree at least one is different than the probability threshold of connectivity.</description>

      <title>Some constructive results on Disjoint Golomb Rulers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set $\{a_i\:|\: 1\leq i \leq k\}$ of non-negative integers is a Golomb ruler if differences $a_i-a_j$, for any $i \neq j$, are all distinct.All finite Sidon sets are Golomb rulers, and vice versa. A set of $I$ disjoint Golomb rulers (DGR) each being a $J$-subset of $\{1,2,\cdots, n\}$ is called an $(I,J,n)$-DGR. Let $H(I, J)$ be the least positive integer $n$ such that there is an $(I,J,n)$-DGR. In this paper, we propose a series of conjectures on the constructions and structures of DGR. The main conjecture states that if $A$ is any set of positive integers such that $|A| = H(I, J)$, then there are $I$ disjoint Golomb rulers, each being a $J$-subset of $A$, which generalizes the conjecture proposed by Koml{\'o}s, Sulyok and Szemer{\'e}di in 1975 on the special case $I = 1$. This main conjecture implies some interesting conjectures on disjoint Golomb rulers. We also prove some constructive results on DGR, which improve or generalize some basic inequalities on DGR proved by Kl{\o}ve.</description>

      <title>A Further Investigation on Complete Complementary Codes from $q$-ary Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research focuses on constructing $q$-ary functions for complete complementary codes (CCCs) with flexible parameters. Most existing work has primarily identified sufficient conditions for $q$-ary functions related to $q$-ary CCCs. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to establish both the necessary and sufficient conditions for $q$-ary functions, encompassing most existing CCCs constructions as special cases. For $q$-ary CCCs with a length of $q^m$ and a set size of $q^{n+1}$, we begin by analyzing the necessary and sufficient conditions for $q$-ary functions defined over the domain $\mathbb{Z}_q^m$. Additionally, we construct CCCs with lengths given by $L = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{m_i}$, set sizes given by $K = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{n_i+1}$, and an alphabet size of $\nu = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i$, where $p_1 &lt; p_2 &lt; \cdots &lt; p_k$. To achieve these specific parameters, we examine the necessary and sufficient conditions for $\nu$-ary functions over the domain $\mathbf{Z}_{p_1}^{m_1} \times \cdots \times \mathbf{Z}_{p_k}^{m_k}$, which is a subset of $\mathbb{Z}_{\nu}^m$ and contains $\prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{m_i}$ vectors. In this context, $\mathbf{Z}_{p_i}^{m_i} = \{0, 1, \ldots, p_i - 1\}^{m_i}$, and $m$ is the sum of $m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_k$. The $q$-ary and $\nu$-ary functions allow us to cover all possible length sequences. However, we find that the proposed $\nu$-ary functions are more suitable for generating CCCs with a length of $L = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{m_i}$, particularly when $m_i$ is coprime to $m_j$ for some $1 \leq i \neq j \leq k$. While the proposed $q$-ary functions can also produce CCCs of the same length $L$, the set size and alphabet size become as large as $L$, since in this case, the only choice for $q$ is $L$. In contrast, the proposed $\nu$-ary functions yield CCCs with a more flexible set size $K\leq L$ and an alphabet size of $\nu&lt;L$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterise the digraphs for which the multipaths, that is disjoint unions of directed paths, yield a matroid. For such graphs, called MP-digraphs, we prove that the Tutte polynomial of the multipath matroid is related to counting certain digraph colourings. Finally, we prove that, for MP-forests, the decategorification of the multipath cohomology yields a specialisation of the Tutte polynomial.</description>

      <title>Maximum genus embeddings of dense eulerian graphs with specified faces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a density condition for when, subject to a necessary parity condition, an eulerian graph or digraph may be cellularly embedded in an orientable surface so that it has exactly two faces, each bounded by an euler circuit, one of which may be specified in advance. More generally, suppose that every vertex in an $n$-vertex eulerian digraph (loops and multiple arcs allowed) has at least $(4n+2)/5$ neighbors, and specify any decomposition of the arcs into disjoint directed circuits (closed trails). We show that such a digraph has an orientable embedding in which the given circuits are facial walks and there are exactly one or two other faces. This embedding then has maximum genus relative to the given circuits being facial walks. When there is only one other face, it is necessarily bounded by an euler circuit. Consequently, if the numbers of vertices and edges have the same parity, a sufficiently dense digraph $D$ with a given directed euler circuit $T$ has an orientable embedding with exactly two faces, each bounded by an euler circuit, one of which is $T$. These results for digraphs give analogous results for graphs as immediate corollaries. The main theorem encompasses several special cases in the literature, such as when the digraph is a tournament.</description>

      <title>A note on the alternating number of independent sets in a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The independence polynomial of a graph $G$ evaluated at $-1$, denoted here as $I(G;-1)$, has arisen in a variety of different areas of mathematics and theoretical physics as an object of interest. Engstr\"om used discrete Morse theory to prove that $\left|I(G;-1)\right|\leq 2^{\phi(G)}$ where $\phi(G)$ is the decycling number of $G$, i.e., the minimum number of vertices needed to be deleted from $G$ so that the remaining graph is acyclic. Here, we improve Engstr\"om's bound by showing $\left|I(G;-1)\right|\leq 2^{\phi_3(G)}$ where $\phi_3(G)$ is the minimum number of vertices needed to be deleted from $G$ so that the resulting graph contains no induced cycles whose length is divisible by $3$. We also note that this bound is not just sharp but that every value in the range given by the bound is attainable by some connected graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the second moment of the determinant of random symmetric, Wigner, and Hermitian matrices. Using analytic combinatorics techniques, we determine the second moment of the determinant of Hermitian matrices whose entries on the diagonal are i.i.d and whose entries above the diagonal are i.i.d. and have real expected values. Our results extend previous work analyzing the second moment of the determinant of symmetric and Wigner matrices, providing a unified approach for this analysis.</description>

      <title>New Upper Bounds on the Minimal Domination Numbers of High-Dimensional Hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We briefly review known results on upper bounds for the minimal domination number $\gamma_n$ of a hypercube of dimension $n$, then present a new method for constructing dominating sets.
  Write $n =2^{\hat{n}}-1 +{\check{n}}$ with $0\leq {\check{n}}&lt;2^{\hat{n}}$. Our construction applies to all $n$ lying within the expanding wedge $\theta({\hat{n}}) \leq {\check{n}} &lt; 2^{{\hat{n}}}$, where $\theta$ is a specific, easily computable function with the asymptotic property $\theta(a) \sim 2^{a/2}$. For all $n$ within the smaller wedge $\theta({\hat{n}}) \leq {\check{n}} &lt; 2^{{\hat{n}}-2}$, the resulting upper bound on $\gamma_n$ betters those previously known.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smooth Fano polytopes (SFP) play an important role in toric geometry and combinatorics. In this paper, we introduce a specific subcollection of them, i.e., the unimodular smooth Fano polytopes (USFP). In Section 2, they are verified to satisfy the three (weak, strong, star) Ewald conditions. Besides, a characterisation of USFP is provided as a corollary of the famous Seymour's decomposition theorem. Then, we briefly introduce the works by Luis Crespo on deeply monotone polytopes and give a proof of the claim that any deeply monotone polytope is in fact the dual polytope of some USFP. In other words, we extend Crespo's results on deeply monotone polytopes to the case of USFPs.</description>

      <title>The number of perfect matchings in a brick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 3-connected graph is a brick if the graph obtained from it by deleting any two distinct vertices has a perfect matching. The importance of bricks stems from the fact that they are building blocks of the matching decomposition procedure of Kotzig, and Lovasz and Plummer. Lucchesi and Murty conjectured that there exists a positive integer N such that for every n&gt;N, every brick on n vertices has at least n-1 perfect matchings. We present an infinite family of bricks such that for each even integer n (n &gt; 17), there exists a brick with n vertices in this family that contains [0:625n] perfect matchings, showing that this conjecture fails.</description>

These numbers have been studied from different aspects for some $a$'s. These numbers can also be considered as variations of the well known star numbers of the form $6n(n-1) + 1$. We also give closed form expressions of the Sylvester number (genus) for the triple of the $2$-step star numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalized numerical semigroup is a submonoid $S$ of $\mathbb{N}^d$ with finite complement in it. We characterize isomorphisms between these monoids in terms of permutation of coordinates. Considering the equivalence relation that identifies the monoids obtained by the action of a permutation and establishing a criterion to select a representative from each equivalence class, we define some procedures for generating the set of all generalized numerical semigroups of given genus up to isomorphism. Finally, we present computational data and explore properties related to the number of generalized numerical semigroups of a given genus up to isomorphism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite, simple, and undirected graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges, and largest eigenvalue $\lambda$, Nikiforov introduced the degree deviation of $G$ as $s=\sum_{u\in V(G)}\left|d_G(u)-\frac{2m}{n}\right|$. Contributing to a conjecture of Nikiforov, we show $\lambda-\frac{2m}{n}\leq \sqrt{\frac{2s}{3}}$. For our result, we show that the largest eigenvalue of a graph that arises from a bipartite graph with $m_{A,B}$ edges by adding $m_A$ edges within one of the two partite sets is at most $\sqrt{m_A+m_{A,B}+\sqrt{m_A^2+2m_Am_{A,B}}}$, which is a common generalization of results due to Stanley and Bhattacharya, Friedland, and Peled.</description>

      <title>On the Spectrum of Locally Linear Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a locally linear graph $G$, which is a graph built out of triangles, it is possible to construct another graph $G^*$ that would consist of triangles of $G$ as vertices, while sharing (or not sharing) a common vertex between a pair of triangles would define a binary relation for edges of $G^*$. In this paper we show that the spectrum of $G^*$ is uniquely defined by $G$. We will also show some structural similarities of these graphs; in particular, that the number of quadrilaterals and pentagons in both graphs are the same; that $G^*$ does not contain $K_4-e$ and $K_{1,4}$; and that $G$ can be reconstructed from $G^*$.</description>

Second, we prove a Quantitative Helly-type theorem with the optimal Helly number \(2d+1\) for the pointwise minimum of logarithmically concave functions. Finally, we present a colorful version of the latter result with Helly number (number of color classes) \(3d+1\); however, we have no reason to believe that this bound is sharp.</description>

      <title>A sumset version of a conjecture of Pilz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pilz's conjecture states that for any finite set $A=\{a_1,a_2,\dots,a_k\}$ of positive integers and positive integer $n$ in the union of the sets $\{a_1,2a_1,\dots,na_1\},\dots, \{a_k,2a_k,\dots,na_k\}$ (considered as a multiset) at least $n$ values appear an odd number of times. In this short note we consider a variant of this problem. Namely, we show that in the sumset $\{a_1,2a_1,\dots,na_1\}+\dots+\{a_k,2a_k,\dots,na_k\}$ (considered as a multiset) at least $n$ values appear an odd number of times.</description>

      <title>Bisection Width, Discrepancy, and Eigenvalues of Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A celebrated result of Alon from 1993 states that any $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices (where $d=O(n^{1/9})$) has a bisection with at most $\frac{dn}{2}(\frac{1}{2}-\Omega(\frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}))$ edges, and this is optimal. Recently, this result was greatly extended by R\"aty, Sudakov, and Tomon. We build on the ideas of the latter, and use a semidefinite programming inspired approach to prove the following variant for hypergraphs: every $r$-uniform $d$-regular hypergraph on $n$ vertices (where $d\ll n^{1/2}$) has a bisection of size at most $$\frac{dn}{r}\left(1-\frac{1}{2^{r-1}}-\frac{c}{\sqrt{d}}\right),$$ for some $c=c(r)&gt;0$. This bound is the best possible up to the precise value of $c$. Moreover, a bisection achieving this bound can be found by a polynomial-time randomized algorithm.
  The minimum bisection is closely related to discrepancy. We also prove sharp bounds on the discrepancy and so called positive discrepancy of hypergraphs, extending results of Bollob\'as and Scott. Furthermore, we discuss implications about Alon-Boppana type bounds. We show that if $H$ is an $r$-uniform $d$-regular hypergraph, then certain notions of second largest eigenvalue $\lambda_2$ associated with the adjacency tensor satisfy $\lambda_2\geq \Omega_r(\sqrt{d})$, improving results of Li and Mohar.</description>

      <title>Notes on embedding trees in graphs with O(|T|)-sized covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a companion paper to the paper "Hyperstability in the Erdos-Sos Conjecture". In that paper the following rough structure theorem was proved for graphs G containing no copy of a bounded degree tree T: from any such G, one can delete o(|G||T|) edges in order to get a subgraph all of whose connected components have a cover of order 3|T|.
  This theorem creates an incentive for studying graphs whose connected components have covers of order O(|T|) - and this is what will be explored here. It turns out that such graphs are amenable to regularity approaches which have been successful in studying dense T-free graphs. In this paper we will follow such an approach from the paper "On the Erdos-Sos conjecture for trees with bounded degree" by Besomi, Pavez-Signe, and Stein and show how it can be adapted from dense graphs to graphs with a small cover.</description>

Abstract: A rough structure theorem is proved for graphs $G$ containing no copy of a bounded degree tree $T$: from any such $G$, one can delete $o(|G||T|)$ edges in order to get a subgraph all of whose connected components have a cover of order $3|T|$.
  This theorem has the ability to turn questions about sparse $T$-free graphs (about which relatively little is known), into questions about dense $T$-free graphs (for which we have powerful techniques like regularity). There are various applications, the most notable being a proof of the Erd\H{o}s-S\'os Conjecture for large, bounded degree trees.</description>

      <title>Acyclotopes and Tocyclotopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a well-established dictionary between zonotopes, hyperplane arrangements, and their (oriented) matroids. Arguably one of the most famous examples is the class of graphical zonotopes, also called acyclotopes, which encode subzonotopes of the type-A root polytope, the permutahedron. Stanley (1991) gave a general interpretation of the coefficients of the Ehrhart polynomial (integer-point counting function for a polytope) of a zonotope via linearly independent subsets of its generators. Applying this to the graphical case shows that Ehrhart coefficients count induced forests of the graph of fixed sizes. Our first goal is to extend and popularize this story to other root systems, which on the combinatorial side is encoded by signed graphs analogously to the work by Greene and Zaslavsky (1983). We compute the Ehrhart polynomial of the acyclotope in the signed case, and we give a matroid-dual construction, giving rise to tocyclotopes, and compute their Ehrhart polynomials. Applying the same duality construction to a general integral matrix gives rise to a lattice Gale zonotope, whose face structure was studies by McMullen (1971) and whose duality nature is a special instance of D'Adderio--Moci's arithmetic matroids. We describe its Ehrhart polynomials in terms of the given matrix.</description>

      <title>Scattering diagrams, tight gradings, and generalized positivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2013, Lee, Li, and Zelevinsky introduced combinatorial objects called compatible pairs to construct the greedy bases for rank-2 cluster algebras, consisting of indecomposable positive elements including the cluster monomials. Subsequently, Rupel extended this construction to the setting of generalized rank-2 cluster algebras by defining compatible gradings. We discover a new class of combinatorial objects which we call tight gradings. Using this, we give a directly computable, manifestly positive, and elementary but highly nontrivial formula describing rank-2 consistent scattering diagrams. This allows us to show that the coefficients of the wall-functions on a generalized cluster scattering diagram of any rank are positive, which implies the Laurent positivity for generalized cluster algebras and the strong positivity of their theta bases.</description>

      <title>On the proper rainbow saturation numbers of cliques, paths, and odd cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $H$, we say a graph $G$ is properly rainbow $H$-saturated if there is a proper edge-coloring of $G$ which contains no rainbow copy of $H$, but adding any edge to $G$ makes such an edge-coloring impossible. The proper rainbow saturation number, denoted $\text{sat}^*(n,H)$, is the minimum number of edges in an $n$-vertex rainbow $H$-saturated graph. We determine the proper rainbow saturation number for paths up to an additive constant and asymptotically determine $\text{sat}^*(n,K_4)$. In addition, we bound $\text{sat}^*(n,H)$ when $H$ is a larger clique, tree of diameter at least 4, or odd cycle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $H$, we say that a graph $G$ is properly rainbow $H$-saturated if: (1) There is a proper edge colouring of $G$ containing no rainbow copy of $H$; (2) For every $e \notin E(G)$, every proper edge colouring of $G+e$ contains a rainbow copy of $H$. The proper rainbow saturation number $\text{prsat}(n,H)$ is the minimum number of edges in a properly rainbow $H$-saturated graph. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of the proper rainbow saturation number for trees. We obtain exact and asymptotic results on $\text{prsat}(n,T)$ for several infinite families of trees. Our proofs reveal connections to the classical saturation and semi-saturation numbers.</description>

      <title>Higher level $q$-multiple zeta values with applications to quasimodular forms and partitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the generalized sum-of-divisor functions of MacMahon have been unified into the algebraic framework of $q$-multiple zeta values. In particular, these results link partition theory, quasimodular forms, $q$-multiple zeta values, and quasi-shuffle algebras. In this paper, we complete this idea of unification for higher levels, demonstrating that any quasimodular form of weight $k \geq 2$ and level $N$ may be expressed in terms of the $q$-multiple zeta values of level $N$ studied algebraically by Yuan and Zhao. We also give results restricted to $q$-multiple zeta values with integer coefficients, and we construct completely additive generating sets for spaces of quasimodular forms and for quasimodular forms with integer coefficients. We also provide a variety of computational examples from number-theoretic perspectives that suggest many new applications of the algebraic structure of $q$-multiple zeta values to quasimodular forms and partitions.</description>

      <title>Hikita conjecture for classical Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13914v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be $Sp_{2n}$, $SO_{2n}$ or $SO_{2n+1}$ and let $G^\vee$ be its Langlands dual group. Barbash and Vogan based on earlier work of Lusztig and Spaltenstein, define a duality map $D$ that sends nilpotent orbits $\mathbb{O}_{e^\vee} \subset \mathfrak{g}^\vee$ to special nilpotent orbits $\mathbb{O}_e\subset \mathfrak{g}$. In a work by Losev, Mason-Brown and Matvieievskyi, an upgraded version $\tilde{D}$ of this duality is considered, called the refined BVLS duality. $\tilde{D}(\mathbb{O}_{e^\vee})$ is a $G$-equivariant cover $\tilde{\mathbb{O}}_e$ of $\mathbb{O}_e$. Let $S_{{e^\vee}}$ be the nilpotent Slodowy slice of the orbit $\mathbb{O}_{e^\vee}$. The two varieties $X^\vee= S_{e^\vee}$ and $X=$ Spec$(\mathbb{C}[\tilde{\mathbb{O}}_e])$ are expected to be symplectic dual to each other. In this context, a version of the Hikita conjecture predicts an isomorphism between the cohomology ring of the Springer fiber $\mathcal{B}_{e^\vee}$ and the ring of regular functions on the scheme-theoretic fixed point $X^T$ for some torus $T$. This paper verifies the isomorphism for certain pairs $e$ and $e^\vee$. These cases are expected to cover almost all instances in which the Hikita conjecture holds when $e^\vee$ regular in a Levi $\mathfrak{l}^\vee\subset \mathfrak{g}^\vee$. Our results in these cases follow from the relations of three different types of objects: generalized coinvariant algebras, equivariant cohomology rings, and functions on scheme-theoretic intersections. We also give evidence for the Hikita conjecture when $e^\vee$ is distinguished.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the uniform measure for the self-conjugate partitions. We derive the $q$-difference equation which is satisfied by the $n$-point correlation function related to the uniform measure. As applications, we give explicit formulas for the one-point and two-point functions, and study their quasimodularity. Motivated by this, we also prove the quasimodularity of the general $n$-point function using a combinatorial method. Finally, we derive the limit shape of self-conjugate partitions under the Gibbs uniform measure and compare it to the leading asymptotics of the one-point function.</description>

      <title>Characterizing graph-nonedge pairs with single interval Cayley configuration spaces in 3-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A linkage $(G,\ell)$ is a pair containing a finite simple undirected graph $G$ and a squared edge-length map $\ell$ that assigns squared Euclidean lengths to the edges of $G$. A $d$-realization of $(G,\ell)$ is an assignment of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to the vertices of $G$ for which pair-wise distances between points agree with $\ell$. For $d \leq 3$, we characterize pairs $(G,f)$, where $f$ is a nonedge of $G$, such that, for any squared edge-length map $\ell$, there is a single interval of attained distance values between the endpoints of $f$ over all $d$-realizations of $(G,\ell)$, answering a question posed in \cite{sitharam2010characterizing} a decade ago, which gave an equivalent characterization for $d\le 2$ that does not generalize to $d\ge 3$. Two notable byproducts of this characterization are a new tool for partial $3$-tree completion, a well-studied problem, and a deeper understanding of the realization space of partial $3$-tree linkages through the lens of Cayley realization spaces. Although related to the minor closed class of $3$-flattenable graphs, the class of pairs $(G,f)$ with the above property is not minor closed, has no obvious well quasi-ordering, and there are infinitely many minimal graphs-nonedge pairs - w.r.t. edge contractions - in the complement class. Our characterization overcomes these obstacles, is based on the forbidden minors of the class of $3$-flattenable graphs, and contributes to the theory of Cayley configurations used for analyzing distance-constrained configuration spaces in a range of application domains. Generalizations to higher dimensions and efficient algorithmic characterizations are conjectured.</description>

      <title>Minimal and Maximal Distances in Metric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14648v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given functions $f,g: [n] \rightarrow [n]$ do there exist $n$ points $A_1,A_2\ldots A_n$ in some metric space such that $A_{f(i)},A_{g(i)}$ are the points closest and farthest from point $A_i$? In this paper we characterize precisely which pairs of functions have this property. If the metric space is $\mathbb{R}^k$ we show that the maximal number $m(k)$ so that any pair of functions $f,g: [m(k)]\rightarrow [m(k)]$ realizable in some metric space is also realizable in $\mathbb{R}^k$ grows exponentially in $k$. In the final section of this paper we consider what happens when we look at minimal and maximal distances separately. We show that any function $g$ that can be a maximal distance function can also be a maximal distance function in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We also find an interesting family of functions that can be minimal distance functions but not in $\mathbb{R}^k$.</description>

      <title>Bounded indegree $k$-forests problem and a faster algorithm for directed graph augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider two problems for a directed graph $G$, which we show to be closely related. The first one is to find $k$ edge-disjoint forests in $G$ of maximal size such that the indegree of each vertex in these forests is at most $k$. We describe a min-max characterization for this problem and show that it can be solved in $O(k \delta m \log n)$ time, where $(n,m)$ is the size of $G$ and $\delta$ is the difference between $k$ and the edge connectivity of the graph. The second problem is the directed edge-connectivity augmentation problem, which has been extensively studied before: find a smallest set of directed edges whose addition to the graph makes it strongly $k$-connected. We improve the complexity for this problem from $O(k \delta (m+\delta n)\log n)$ [Gabow, STOC 1994] to $O(k \delta m \log n)$, by exploiting our solution for the first problem. A similar approach with the same complexity also works for the undirected version of the problem.</description>

      <title>On the periodic decompositions of multidimensional configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider $d$-dimensional configurations, that is, colorings of the $d$-dimensional integer grid $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with finitely many colors. Moreover, we interpret the colors as integers so that configurations are functions $\mathbb{Z}^d \to \mathbb{Z}$ of finite range. We say that such function is $k$-periodic if it is invariant under translations in $k$ linearly independent directions. It is known that if a configuration has a non-trivial annihilator, that is, if some non-trivial linear combination of its translations is the zero function, then it is a sum of finitely many periodic functions. This result is known as the periodic decomposition theorem. We prove two different improvements of it. The first improvement gives a characterization on annihilators of a configuration to guarantee the $k$-periodicity of the functions in its periodic decomposition -- for any $k$. The periodic decomposition theorem is then a special case of this result with $k=1$. The second improvement concerns so called sparse configurations for which the number of non-zero values in patterns grows at most linearly with respect to the diameter of the pattern. We prove that a sparse configuration with a non-trivial annihilator is a sum of finitely many periodic fibers where a fiber means a function whose non-zero values lie on a unique line.</description>

      <title>A character theoretic formula for base size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A base for a permutation group $G$ acting on a set $\Omega$ is a sequence $\mathcal{B}$ of points of $\Omega$ such that the pointwise stabiliser $G_{\mathcal{B}}$ is trivial. The base size of $G$ is the size of a smallest base for $G$. We derive a character theoretic formula for the base size of a class of groups admitting a certain kind of irreducible character. Moreover, we prove a formula for enumerating the non-equivalent bases for $G$ of size $l\in\mathbb{N}$. As a consequence of our results, we present a very short, entirely algebraic proof of the formula of Mecenero and Spiga~\cite{MeSp} for the base size of the symmetric group $\mathrm{S}_n$ acting on the $k$-element subsets of $\{1,2,3,\dots,n\}$. Our methods also provide a formula for the base size of many product-type permutation groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.02276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The graphs with all equal negative or positive eigenvalues are special kind in the spectral graph theory. In this article, several iterated line graphs $\mathcal{L}^k(G)$ with all equal negative eigenvalues $-2$ are characterized for $k\ge 1$ and their energy consequences are presented. Also, the spectra and the energy of complement of these graphs are obtained, interestingly they have exactly two positive eigenvalues with different multiplicities. Moreover, we characterize a large class of equienergetic graphs which generalize some of the existing results. There are two different quotient matrices defined for an equitable partition of $H$-join (generalized composition) of regular graphs to find the spectrum (partial) of adjacency matrix, Laplacian matrix and signless Laplacian matrix, it has been proved that these two quotient matrices give the same respective spectrum of graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09449v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce two coproducts on mixed graphs (that is to say graphs with both oriented and unoriented edges), the first one by separation of the vertices into two parts, and the second one given by contraction and extractions of subgraphs. We show that, with the disjoint union product, this gives a double bialgebra, that is to say that the first coproduct makes it a Hopf algebra in the category of right comodules over the second coproduct. This structure implies the existence of a unique polynomial invariant on mixed graphs compatible with the product and both coproducts: we prove that it is the (strong) chromatic polynomial of Beck, Bogart and Pham.Using the action of the monoid of characters, we relate it to the weak chromatic polynomial, as well to Ehrhart polynomials and to a polynomial invariants related to linear extensions. As applications, we give an algebraic proof of the link between the values of the strong chromatic polynomial at negative values and acyclic orientations (a result due to Beck, Blado, Crawford, Jean-Louis and Young) and obtain a combinatorial description of the antipode of the Hopf algebra of mixed graphs.</description>

Abstract: In the classic version of the game of firefighter, on the first turn a fire breaks out on a vertex in a graph $G$ and then $b$ firefighters protect $b$ vertices. On each subsequent turn, the fire spreads to the collective unburnt neighbourhood of all the burning vertices and the firefighters again protect $b$ vertices. Once a vertex has been burnt or protected it remains that way for the rest of the game. In $\textit{distance-restricted firefighting}$ the firefighters' movement is restricted so they can only move up to some fixed distance $d$ and they may or may not be permitted to move through burning vertices. In this paper we establish the NP-completeness of the distance-restricted versions of $b$-Firefighter even on bipartite graphs and present an integer program for computing the exact value. We also discuss some interesting properties of the $\textit{Expected Damage}$ function.</description>

Abstract: Recently there has been growing interest in discrete homotopies and homotopies of graphs beyond treating graphs as 1-dimensional simplicial spaces. One such type of homotopy is $\times$-homotopy. Recent work by Chih-Scull has developed a homotopy category, a fundamental group for graphs under this homotopy, and a way of computing covers of graphs that lift homotopy via this fundamental group. In this paper, we compute the fundamental groups of all Hamming graphs, show that they are direct products of cyclic groups, and use this result to describe some $\times$-homotopy covers of Hamming graphs.</description>

Furthermore, we characterize the trees in $\mathcal{T}_{\frac{n}{m}}$ in terms of their bipartition.</description>

      <title>From quasi-symmetric to Schur expansions with applications to symmetric chain decompositions and plethysm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is an important problem in algebraic combinatorics to deduce the Schur function expansion of a symmetric function whose expansion in terms of the fundamental quasisymmetric function is known. For example, formulas are known for the fundamental expansion of a Macdonald symmetric function and for the plethysm of two Schur functions, while the Schur expansions of these expressions are still elusive. Egge, Loehr and Warrington provided a method to obtain the Schur expansion from the fundamental expansion by replacing each quasisymmetric function by a Schur function (not necessarily indexed by a partition) and using straightening rules to obtain the Schur expansion. Here we provide a new method that only involves the coefficients of the quasisymmetric functions indexed by partitions and the quasi-Kostka matrix. As an application, we identify the lexicographically largest term in the Schur expansion of the plethysm of two Schur functions. We provide the Schur expansion of $s_w[s_h](x,y)$ for $w=2,3,4$ using novel symmetric chain decompositions of Young's lattice for partitions in a $w\times h$ box. For $w=4$, this is first known combinatorial expression for the coefficient of $s_{\lambda}$ in $s_{w}[s_{h}]$ for two-row partitions $\lambda$, and for $w=3$ the combinatorial expression is new.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the class of transversal matroids is not closed under contraction or duality. In particular, after contracting a set of elements from a transversal matroid, the resulting matroid may or may not be transversal, and the computational complexity of determining whether it is transversal is not well understood. As a step toward resolving this, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm for determining whether a single-element contraction of a transversal matroid is transversal. In the case that the single-element contraction is transversal, the algorithm also provides a transversal representation. We then discuss possible applications of our techniques toward finding a polynomial-time algorithm to determine if the dual of a transversal matroid is transversal.</description>

      <title>Multi-quasisymmetric functions with semigroup exponents, Hopf algebras and Rota-Baxter algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many years ago, G.-C.~Rota discovered a close connection between symmetric functions and Rota-Baxter algebras, and proposed to study generalizations of symmetric functions in the framework of Rota-Baxter algebras. Guided by this proposal, quasisymmetric functions from weak composition (instead of just compositions) were obtained from free Rota-Baxter algebras on one generator. This paper aims to generalize this approach to free Rota-Baxter algebras on multiple generators in order to obtain further generalizations of quasisymmetric functions. For this purpose and also for its independent interest, the space $\mathrm{MQSym}$ of quasisymmetric functions on multiple sequences of variables is defined, generalizing quasisymmetric functions and diagonally quasisymmetric functions of Aval, Bergeron and Bergeron. Linear bases of such multi-quasisymmetric functions are given by monomial multi-quasisymmetric functions and fundamental multi-quasisymmetric functions, the latter recover the fundamental $G^m$-quasisymmetric functions of Aval and Chapoton. Next introduced is the even more general notion of multi-quasisymmetric functions $\mathrm{MQSym}^E$ with exponents in a semigroup $E$, which also generalizes the quasisymmetric functions with semigroup exponents in a recent work. Through this approach, a natural Hopf algebraic structure is obtained on $\mathrm{MQSym}^E$. Finally, in support of Rota's proposal, the free commutative unitary Rota-Baxter algebra on a finite set is shown to be isomorphic to a scalar extension of $\mathrm{MQSym}^E$, a fact which in turn equips the free Rota-Baxter algebra with a Hopf algebra structure.</description>

      <title>Polynomials Counting Group Colorings in Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jaeger et al. in 1992 introduced group coloring as the dual concept to group connectivity in graphs. Let $\Gamma$ be an Abelian group, $ f: E(G)\to\Gamma$ and $D$ an orientation of a graph $G$. A vertex coloring $c:V(G)\to\Gamma$ is a $(\Gamma, f)$-coloring if $c(v)-c(u)\ne f(e)$ for each edge $e=uv$, where the corresponding arc $D(e)=(u,v)$ is directed from $u$ to $v$. We introduce the concept of $\alpha$-compatible graphs and define the cycle-assigning polynomial $P(G, \alpha; k)$ at $k$ in terms of $\alpha$-compatible spanning subgraphs, where $\alpha$ is an assigning of $G$ from its cycles to $\{0,1\}$. We prove that the cycle-assigning polynomial $P(G,\alpha;k)$ equals the number of $(\Gamma,f)$-colorings for any Abelian group $\Gamma$ of order $k$ and $f:E(G)\to\Gamma$ such that the assigning $\alpha_{D,f}$ induced by $f$ equals $\alpha$. In particular, $P(G,\alpha;k)$ is the classical chromatic polynomial if $\alpha$ is the zero function. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of $\alpha$-compatible broken cycles and interpret $P(G,\alpha;k)$ in terms of $\alpha$-compatible spanning subgraphs that do not contain $\alpha$-compatible broken cycles. This implies that the absolute value of the coefficient of $k^{r(G)-i}$ in $P(G,\alpha;k)$ equals the number of $\alpha$-compatible spanning subgraphs that have $i$ edges and contain no $\alpha$-compatible broken cycles, which generalizes the Whitney's Broken Cycle Theorem. Based on the combinatorial explanation, we establish a unified order-preserving relation from assignings to cycle-assigning polynomials. Finally, we show that for any loopless graph $G$, the coefficients of the cycle-assigning polynomial $P(G,\alpha;k)$ are nonzero and alternate in sign, and further conjecture that the sequence of absolute values of its coefficients is unimodal and log-concave.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.01091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a `Whitney' presentation, and a `Coulomb branch' presentation, for the torus equivariant quantum K theory of the Grassmann manifold $\mathrm{Gr}(k;n)$, inspired from physics, and stated in an earlier paper. The first presentation is obtained by quantum deforming the product of the Hirzebruch $\lambda_y$ classes of the tautological bundles. In physics, the $\lambda_y$ classes arise as certain Wilson line operators. The second presentation is obtained from the Coulomb branch equations involving the partial derivatives of a twisted superpotential from supersymmetric gauge theory. This is closest to a presentation obtained by Gorbounov and Korff, utilizing integrable systems techniques. Algebraically, we relate the Coulomb and Whitney presentations utilizing transition matrices from the (equivariant) Grothendieck polynomials to the (equivariant) complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials. Along the way, we calculate K-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants of wedge powers of the tautological bundles on $\mathrm{Gr}(k;n)$, using the `quantum=classical' statement.</description>

      <title>Inverse theorems for discretized sums and $L^q$ norms of convolutions in $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09846v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove inverse theorems for the size of sumsets and the $L^q$ norms of convolutions in the discretized setting, extending to arbitrary dimension an earlier result of the author in the line. These results have applications to the dimensions of dynamical self-similar sets and measures, and to the higher dimensional fractal uncertainty principle. The proofs are based on a structure theorem for the entropy of convolution powers due to M.~Hochman.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic Counts of Tropical Plane Curves and Their Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the first and third author proved a correspondence theorem which recovers the Levine-Welschinger invariants of toric del Pezzo surfaces as a count of tropical curves weighted with arithmetic multiplicities. In this paper, we study properties of the arithmetic count of plane tropical curves satisfying point conditions. We prove that this count is independent of the configuration of point conditions. Moreover, a Caporaso-Harris formula for the arithmetic count of plane tropical curves is obtained by moving one point to the very left. Repeating this process until all point conditions are stretched, we obtain an enriched count of floor diagrams which coincides with the tropical count. Finally, we prove polynomiality properties for the arithmetic counts using floor diagrams.</description>

      <title>Graph connectivity with fixed endpoints in the random-connection model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the count of subgraphs with an arbitrary configuration of endpoints in the random-connection model based on a Poisson point process on ${\Bbb R}^d$. We present combinatorial expressions for the computation of the cumulants and moments of all orders of such subgraph counts, which allow us to estimate the growth of cumulants as the intensity of the underlying Poisson point process goes to infinity. As a consequence, we obtain a central limit theorem with explicit convergence rates under the Kolmogorov distance, and connectivity bounds. Numerical examples are presented using a computer code in SageMath for the closed-form computation of cumulants of any order, for any type of connected subgraph and for any configuration of endpoints in any dimension $d\geq 1$. In particular, graph connectivity estimates, Gram-Charlier expansions for density estimation, and correlation estimates for joint subgraph counting are obtained.</description>

      <title>Double Dyck Path Algebra Representations From DAHA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The double Dyck path algebra $\mathbb{A}_{q,t}$ was introduced by Carlsson-Mellit in their proof of the Shuffle Theorem. A variant of this algebra, $\mathbb{B}_{q,t}$, was introduced by Carlsson-Gorsky-Mellit in their study of the parabolic flag Hilbert schemes of points in $\mathbb{C}^2$ showing that $\mathbb{B}_{q,t}$ acts naturally on the equivariant $K$-theory of these spaces. The algebraic relations defining $\mathbb{B}_{q,t}$ appear superficially similar to those of the positive double affine Hecke algebras (DAHA) in type $GL$, $\mathscr{D}_n^{+}$, introduced by Cherednik. In this paper we provide a general method for constructing $\mathbb{B}_{q,t}$ representations from DAHA representations. In particular, every $\mathscr{D}_n^{+}$ module yields a representation of a subalgebra $\mathbb{B}_{q,t}^{(n)}$ of $\mathbb{B}_{q,t}$ and special families of compatible DAHA representations give representations of $\mathbb{B}_{q,t}$. These constructions are functorial. Lastly, we will construct a large family of $\mathbb{B}_{q,t}$ representations indexed by partitions using this method related to the Murnaghan-type representations of the positive elliptic Hall algebra introduced previously by the author.</description>

      <title>Delta Operators on Almost Symmetric Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct $\Delta$-operators $F[\Delta]$ on the space of almost symmetric functions $\mathscr{P}_{as}^{+}$. These operators extend the usual $\Delta$-operators on the space of symmetric functions $\Lambda \subset \mathscr{P}_{as}^{+}$ central to Macdonald theory. The $F[\Delta]$ operators are constructed as certain limits of symmetric functions in the Cherednik operators $Y_i$ and act diagonally on the stable-limit non-symmetric Macdonald functions $\widetilde{E}_{(\mu|\lambda)}(x_1,x_2,\ldots;q,t).$ Using properties of Ion-Wu limits, we are able to compute commutation relations for the $\Delta$-operators $F[\Delta]$ and many of the other operators on $\mathscr{P}_{as}^{+}$ introduced by Ion-Wu. Using these relations we show that there is an action of $\mathbb{B}_{q,t}^{\text{ext}}$ on almost symmetric functions which we show is isomorphic to the polynomial representation of $\mathbb{B}_{q,t}^{\text{ext}}$ constructed by Gonz\'{a}lez-Gorsky-Simental.</description>

      <title>A Wild Sheep Chase Through an Orchard</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Orchards are a biologically relevant class of phylogenetic networks as they can describe treelike evolutionary histories augmented with horizontal transfer events. Moreover, the class has attractive mathematical characterizations that can be exploited algorithmically. On the other hand, undirected orchard networks have hardly been studied yet. Here, we prove that deciding whether an undirected, binary phylogenetic network is an orchard -- or equivalently, whether it has an orientation that makes it a rooted orchard -- is NP-hard. For this, we introduce a new characterization of undirected orchards which could be useful for proving positive results.</description>

      <title>Artin Symmetric Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct an algebraic invariant attached to Galois representations over number fields. This invariant, which we call an Artin symmetric function, lives in a certain ring we introduce called the ring of arithmetic symmetric functions. This ring is built from a family of symmetric functions rings indexed by prime ideals of the base field. We prove many necessary basic results for the ring of arithmetic symmetric functions as well as introduce the analogues of some standard number-theoretic objects in this setting. We prove that the Artin symmetric functions satisfy the same algebraic properties that the Artin L-functions do with respect to induction, inflation, and direct summation of representations. The expansion coefficients of these symmetric functions in different natural bases are shown to be character values of representations of a compact group related to the original Galois group. In the most interesting case, the expansion coefficients into a specialized Hall-Littlewood basis come from new representations built from the original Galois representation using polynomial functors corresponding to modified Hall-Littlewood polynomials. Using a special case of the Satake isomorphism in type GL, as formulated by Macdonald, we show that the Artin symmetric functions yield families of functions in the (finite) global spherical Hecke algebras in type GL which exhibit natural stability properties. We compute the Mellin transforms of these functions and relate them to infinite products of shifted Artin L-functions. We then prove some analytic properties of these Dirichlet series and give an explicit expansion of these series using the Hall-Littlewood polynomial functors.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative recurrence of M\"obius transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a necessary and sufficient condition under which the set defined by a M\"obius transformation of positive integers is a set of multiplicative recurrence. A Khinchin-type lower bound is also established. This not only answers a question of Donoso--Le--Moreira--Sun but also strengthens their result. The key input in our proof is Tao's logarithmically averaged correlations of non-pretentious multiplicative functions.</description>
