      <title>RAGO: Systematic Performance Optimization for Retrieval-Augmented Generation Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which combines large language models (LLMs) with retrievals from external knowledge databases, is emerging as a popular approach for reliable LLM serving. However, efficient RAG serving remains an open challenge due to the rapid emergence of many RAG variants and the substantial differences in workload characteristics across them. In this paper, we make three fundamental contributions to advancing RAG serving. First, we introduce RAGSchema, a structured abstraction that captures the wide range of RAG algorithms, serving as a foundation for performance optimization. Second, we analyze several representative RAG workloads with distinct RAGSchema, revealing significant performance variability across these workloads. Third, to address this variability and meet diverse performance requirements, we propose RAGO (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Optimizer), a system optimization framework for efficient RAG serving. Our evaluation shows that RAGO achieves up to a 2x increase in QPS per chip and a 55% reduction in time-to-first-token latency compared to RAG systems built on LLM-system extensions.</description>

      <title>Long Context Modeling with Ranked Memory-Augmented Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective long-term memory management is crucial for language models handling extended contexts. We introduce a novel framework that dynamically ranks memory entries based on relevance. Unlike previous works, our model introduces a novel relevance scoring and a pointwise re-ranking model for key-value embeddings, inspired by learning-to-rank techniques in information retrieval. Enhanced Ranked Memory Augmented Retrieval ERMAR achieves state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Re-ranking: Emerging Techniques, Limitations, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs have emerged to be promising datastore candidates for context augmentation during Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). As a result, techniques in graph representation learning have been simultaneously explored alongside principal neural information retrieval approaches, such as two-phased retrieval, also known as re-ranking. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been proposed to demonstrate proficiency in graph learning for re-ranking, there are ongoing limitations in modeling and evaluating input graph structures for training and evaluation for passage and document ranking tasks. In this survey, we review emerging GNN-based ranking model architectures along with their corresponding graph representation construction methodologies. We conclude by providing recommendations on future research based on community-wide challenges and opportunities.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Relevance Feedback Can Improve Zero-Shot LLM-Based Dense Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) refines queries by leveraging initially retrieved documents to improve retrieval effectiveness. In this paper, we investigate how large language models (LLMs) can facilitate PRF for zero-shot LLM-based dense retrieval, extending the recently proposed PromptReps method. Specifically, our approach uses LLMs to extract salient passage features-such as keywords and summaries-from top-ranked documents, which are then integrated into PromptReps to produce enhanced query representations. Experiments on passage retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that incorporating PRF significantly boosts retrieval performance. Notably, smaller rankers with PRF can match the effectiveness of larger rankers without PRF, highlighting PRF's potential to improve LLM-driven search while maintaining an efficient balance between effectiveness and resource usage.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Retrieval Strategies for Financial Question Answering Documents in Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising framework to mitigate hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs), yet its overall performance is dependent on the underlying retrieval system. In the finance domain, documents such as 10-K reports pose distinct challenges due to domain-specific vocabulary and multi-hierarchical tabular data. In this work, we introduce an efficient, end-to-end RAG pipeline that enhances retrieval for financial documents through a three-phase approach: pre-retrieval, retrieval, and post-retrieval. In the pre-retrieval phase, various query and corpus preprocessing techniques are employed to enrich input data. During the retrieval phase, we fine-tuned state-of-the-art (SOTA) embedding models with domain-specific knowledge and implemented a hybrid retrieval strategy that combines dense and sparse representations. Finally, the post-retrieval phase leverages Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training and document selection methods to further refine the results. Evaluations on seven financial question answering datasets-FinDER, FinQABench, FinanceBench, TATQA, FinQA, ConvFinQA, and MultiHiertt-demonstrate substantial improvements in retrieval performance, leading to more accurate and contextually appropriate generation. These findings highlight the critical role of tailored retrieval techniques in advancing the effectiveness of RAG systems for financial applications.

      <title>When Pigs Get Sick: Multi-Agent AI for Swine Disease Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Swine disease surveillance is critical to the sustainability of global agriculture, yet its effectiveness is frequently undermined by limited veterinary resources, delayed identification of cases, and variability in diagnostic accuracy. To overcome these barriers, we introduce a novel AI-powered, multi-agent diagnostic system that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver timely, evidence-based disease detection and clinical guidance. By automatically classifying user inputs into either Knowledge Retrieval Queries or Symptom-Based Diagnostic Queries, the system ensures targeted information retrieval and facilitates precise diagnostic reasoning. An adaptive questioning protocol systematically collects relevant clinical signs, while a confidence-weighted decision fusion mechanism integrates multiple diagnostic hypotheses to generate robust disease predictions and treatment recommendations. Comprehensive evaluations encompassing query classification, disease diagnosis, and knowledge retrieval demonstrate that the system achieves high accuracy, rapid response times, and consistent reliability. By providing a scalable, AI-driven diagnostic framework, this approach enhances veterinary decision-making, advances sustainable livestock management practices, and contributes substantively to the realization of global food security.</description>

      <title>Review-Based Hyperbolic Cross-Domain Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20298v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The issue of data sparsity poses a significant challenge to recommender systems. In response to this, algorithms that leverage side information such as review texts have been proposed. Furthermore, Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR), which captures domain-shareable knowledge and transfers it from a richer domain (source) to a sparser one (target), has received notable attention. Nevertheless, the majority of existing methodologies assume a Euclidean embedding space, encountering difficulties in accurately representing richer text information and managing complex interactions between users and items. This paper advocates a hyperbolic CDR approach based on review texts for modeling user-item relationships. We first emphasize that conventional distance-based domain alignment techniques may cause problems because small modifications in hyperbolic geometry result in magnified perturbations, ultimately leading to the collapse of hierarchical structures. To address this challenge, we propose hierarchy-aware embedding and domain alignment schemes that adjust the scale to extract domain-shareable information without disrupting structural forms. The process involves the initial embedding of review texts in hyperbolic space, followed by feature extraction incorporating degree-based normalization and structure alignment. We conducted extensive experiments to substantiate the efficiency, robustness, and scalability of our proposed model in comparison to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Coarse-to-Fine Lightweight Meta-Embedding for ID-Based Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The state-of-the-art recommendation systems have shifted the attention to efficient recommendation, e.g., on-device recommendation, under memory constraints. To this end, the existing methods either focused on the lightweight embeddings for both users and items, or involved on-device systems enjoying the compact embeddings to enhance reusability and reduces space complexity. However, they focus solely on the coarse granularity of embedding, while overlook the fine-grained semantic nuances, to adversarially downgrade the efficacy of meta-embeddings in capturing the intricate relationship over both user and item, consequently resulting into the suboptimal recommendations. In this paper, we aim to study how the meta-embedding can efficiently learn varied grained semantics, together with how the fine-grained meta-embedding can strengthen the representation of coarse-grained meta-embedding. To answer these questions, we develop a novel graph neural networks (GNNs) based recommender where each user and item serves as the node, linked directly to coarse-grained virtual nodes and indirectly to fine-grained virtual nodes, ensuring different grained semantic learning, while disclosing: 1) In contrast to coarse-grained semantics, fine-grained semantics are well captured through sparse meta-embeddings, which adaptively 2) balance the embedding uniqueness and memory constraint. Additionally, the initialization method come up upon SparsePCA, along with a soft thresholding activation function to render the sparseness of the meta-embeddings. We propose a weight bridging update strategy that focuses on matching each coarse-grained meta-embedding with several fine-grained meta-embeddings based on the users/items' semantics. Extensive experiments substantiate our method's superiority over existing baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/htyjers/C2F-MetaEmbed.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an approach for training o1-like RAG models that retrieve and reason over relevant information step by step before generating the final answer. Conventional RAG methods usually perform a single retrieval step before the generation process, which limits their effectiveness in addressing complex queries due to imperfect retrieval results. In contrast, our proposed method, CoRAG (Chain-of-Retrieval Augmented Generation), allows the model to dynamically reformulate the query based on the evolving state. To train CoRAG effectively, we utilize rejection sampling to automatically generate intermediate retrieval chains, thereby augmenting existing RAG datasets that only provide the correct final answer. At test time, we propose various decoding strategies to scale the model's test-time compute by controlling the length and number of sampled retrieval chains. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks validate the efficacy of CoRAG, particularly in multi-hop question answering tasks, where we observe more than 10 points improvement in EM score compared to strong baselines. On the KILT benchmark, CoRAG establishes a new state-of-the-art performance across a diverse range of knowledge-intensive tasks. Furthermore, we offer comprehensive analyses to understand the scaling behavior of CoRAG, laying the groundwork for future research aimed at developing factual and grounded foundation models.</description>

      <title>Recall Them All: Retrieval-Augmented Language Models for Long Object List Extraction from Long Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Methods for relation extraction from text mostly focus on high precision, at the cost of limited recall. High recall is crucial, though, to populate long lists of object entities that stand in a specific relation with a given subject. Cues for relevant objects can be spread across many passages in long texts. This poses the challenge of extracting long lists from long texts. We present the L3X method which tackles the problem in two stages: (1) recall-oriented generation using a large language model (LLM) with judicious techniques for retrieval augmentation, and (2) precision-oriented scrutinization to validate or prune candidates. Our L3X method outperforms LLM-only generations by a substantial margin.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap Your Own Context Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a bootstrapping approach to train long-context language models by exploiting their short-context capabilities only. Our method utilizes a simple agent workflow to synthesize diverse long-context instruction tuning data, thereby eliminating the necessity for manual data collection and annotation. The proposed data synthesis workflow requires only a short-context language model, a text retriever, and a document collection, all of which are readily accessible within the open-source ecosystem. Subsequently, language models are fine-tuned using the synthesized data to extend their context lengths. In this manner, we effectively transfer the short-context capabilities of language models to long-context scenarios through a bootstrapping process. We conduct experiments with the open-source Llama-3 family of models and demonstrate that our method can successfully extend the context length to up to 1M tokens, achieving superior performance across various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Crawling Algorithm Utilizing Noisy Change-Indicating Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Web refresh crawling is the problem of keeping a cache of web pages fresh, that is, having the most recent copy available when a page is requested, given a limited bandwidth available to the crawler. Under the assumption that the change and request events, resp., to each web page follow independent Poisson processes, the optimal scheduling policy was derived by Azar et al. 2018. In this paper, we study an extension of this problem where side information indicating content changes, such as various types of web pings, for example, signals from sitemaps, content delivery networks, etc., is available. Incorporating such side information into the crawling policy is challenging, because (i) the signals can be noisy with false positive events and with missing change events; and (ii) the crawler should achieve a fair performance over web pages regardless of the quality of the side information, which might differ from web page to web page. We propose a scalable crawling algorithm which (i) uses the noisy side information in an optimal way under mild assumptions; (ii) can be deployed without heavy centralized computation; (iii) is able to crawl web pages at a constant total rate without spikes in the total bandwidth usage over any time interval, and automatically adapt to the new optimal solution when the total bandwidth changes without centralized computation. Experiments clearly demonstrate the versatility of our approach.</description>
