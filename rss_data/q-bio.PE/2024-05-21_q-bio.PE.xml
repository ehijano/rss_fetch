      <title>Stochastic two-patch epidemic model with nonlinear recidivism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a stochastic two-patch epidemic model with nonlinear recidivism to investigate infectious disease dynamics in heterogeneous populations. Extending a deterministic framework, we introduce stochasticity to account for random transmission, recovery, and inter-patch movement fluctuations. We showcase the interplay between local dynamics and migration effects on disease persistence using Monte Carlo simulations and three stochastic approximations-discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC), Poisson, and stochastic differential equations (SDE). Our analysis shows that stochastic effects can cause extinction events and oscillations near critical thresholds like the basic reproduction number, R0, phenomena absent in deterministic models. Numerical simulations highlight source-sink dynamics, where one patch is a persistent infection source while the other experiences intermittent outbreaks.</description>

      <title>Extinctions as a vestige of instability: the geometry of stability and feasibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Species coexistence is a complex, multifaceted problem. At an equilibrium, coexistence requires two conditions: stability under small perturbations; and feasibility, meaning all species abundances are positive. Which of these two conditions is more restrictive has been debated for many years, with many works focusing on statistical arguments for systems with many species. Within the framework of the Lotka-Volterra equations, we examine the geometry of the region of coexistence in the space of interaction strengths, for symmetric competitive interactions and any finite number of species. We consider what happens when starting at a point within the coexistence region, and changing the interaction strengths continuously until one of the two conditions breaks. We find that coexistence generically breaks through the loss of feasibility, as the abundance of one species reaches zero. An exception to this rule - where stability breaks before feasibility - happens only at isolated points, or more generally on a lower dimensional subset of the boundary.
  The reason behind this is that as a stability boundary is approached, some of the abundances generally diverge towards minus infinity, and so go extinct at some earlier point, breaking the feasibility condition first. These results define a new sense in which feasibility is a more restrictive condition than stability, and show that these two requirements are closely interrelated. We then show how our results affect the changes in the set of coexisting species when interaction strengths are changed: a system of coexisting species loses a species by its abundance continuously going to zero, and this new fixed point is unique. As parameters are further changed, multiple alternative equilibria may be found. Finally, we discuss the extent to which our results apply to asymmetric interactions.</description>

      <title>Computation of random time-shift distributions for stochastic population models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Even in large systems, the effect of noise arising from when populations are initially small can persist to be measurable on the macroscale. A deterministic approximation to a stochastic model will fail to capture this effect, but it can be accurately approximated by including an additional random time-shift to the initial conditions. We present a efficient numerical method to compute this time-shift distribution for a large class of stochastic models. The method relies on differentiation of certain functional equations, which we show can be effectively automated by deriving rules for different types of model rates that arise commonly when mass-action mixing is assumed. Explicit computation of the time-shift distribution can be used to build a practical tool for the efficient generation of macroscopic trajectories of stochastic population models, without the need for costly stochastic simulations. Full code is provided to implement this and we demonstrate our method on an epidemic model and a model of within-host viral dynamics.</description>

      <title>XXAI: Towards eXplicitly eXplainable Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03093v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are concerns about the reliability and safety of artificial intelligence (AI) based on sub-symbolic neural networks because its decisions cannot be explained explicitly. This is the black box problem of modern AI. At the same time, symbolic AI has the nature of a white box and is able to ensure the reliability and safety of its decisions. However, several problems prevent the widespread use of symbolic AI: the opacity of mathematical models and natural language terms, the lack of a unified ontology, and the combinatorial explosion of search capabilities. To solve the black-box problem of AI, we propose eXplicitly eXplainable AI (XXAI) - a fully transparent white-box AI based on deterministic logical cellular automata whose rules are derived from the first principles of the general theory of the relevant domain. In this case, the general theory of the domain plays the role of a knowledge base for deriving the inferences of the cellular automata. A cellular automaton implements parallel multi-level logical inference at all levels of organization - from local interactions of the element base to the system as a whole. Our verification of several ecological hypotheses sets a precedent for the successful implementation of the proposed solution. XXAI is able to automatically verify the reliability, security and ethics of sub-symbolic neural network solutions in both the final and training phases. In this article, we present precedents for the successful implementation of XXAI, the theoretical and methodological foundations for its further development, and discuss prospects for the future.</description>
