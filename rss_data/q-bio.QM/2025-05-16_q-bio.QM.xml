      <title>Generative diffusion model surrogates for mechanistic agent-based biological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanistic, multicellular, agent-based models are commonly used to investigate tissue, organ, and organism-scale biology at single-cell resolution. The Cellular-Potts Model (CPM) is a powerful and popular framework for developing and interrogating these models. CPMs become computationally expensive at large space- and time- scales making application and investigation of developed models difficult. Surrogate models may allow for the accelerated evaluation of CPMs of complex biological systems. However, the stochastic nature of these models means each set of parameters may give rise to different model configurations, complicating surrogate model development. In this work, we leverage denoising diffusion probabilistic models to train a generative AI surrogate of a CPM used to investigate \textit{in vitro} vasculogenesis. We describe the use of an image classifier to learn the characteristics that define unique areas of a 2-dimensional parameter space. We then apply this classifier to aid in surrogate model selection and verification. Our CPM model surrogate generates model configurations 20,000 timesteps ahead of a reference configuration and demonstrates approximately a 22x reduction in computational time as compared to native code execution. Our work represents a step towards the implementation of DDPMs to develop digital twins of stochastic biological systems.</description>

      <title>VIGIL: Vision-Language Guided Multiple Instance Learning Framework for Ulcerative Colitis Histological Healing Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Ulcerative colitis (UC), characterized by chronic inflammation with alternating remission-relapse cycles, requires precise histological healing (HH) evaluation to improve clinical outcomes. To overcome the limitations of annotation-intensive deep learning methods and suboptimal multi-instance learning (MIL) in HH prediction, we propose VIGIL, the first vision-language guided MIL framework integrating white light endoscopy (WLE) and endocytoscopy (EC). Methods:VIGIL begins with a dual-branch MIL module KS-MIL based on top-K typical frames selection and similarity metric adaptive learning to learn relationships among frame features effectively. By integrating the diagnostic report text and specially designed multi-level alignment and supervision between image-text pairs, VIGIL establishes joint image-text guidance during training to capture richer disease-related semantic information. Furthermore, VIGIL employs a multi-modal masked relation fusion (MMRF) strategy to uncover the latent diagnostic correlations of two endoscopic image representations. Results:Comprehensive experiments on a real-world clinical dataset demonstrate VIGIL's superior performance, achieving 92.69\% accuracy and 94.79\% AUC, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Conclusion: The proposed VIGIL framework successfully establishes an effective vision-language guided MIL paradigm for UC HH prediction, reducing annotation burdens while improving prediction reliability. Significance: The research outcomes provide new insights for non-invasive UC diagnosis and hold theoretical significance and clinical value for advancing intelligent healthcare development.</description>

      <title>Contextual Phenotyping of Pediatric Sepsis Cohort Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering patient subgroups is essential for personalized care and efficient resource use. Traditional clustering methods struggle with high-dimensional, heterogeneous healthcare data and lack contextual understanding. This study evaluates Large Language Model (LLM) based clustering against classical methods using a pediatric sepsis dataset from a low-income country (LIC), containing 2,686 records with 28 numerical and 119 categorical variables. Patient records were serialized into text with and without a clustering objective. Embeddings were generated using quantized LLAMA 3.1 8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B with low-rank adaptation(LoRA), and Stella-En-400M-V5 models. K-means clustering was applied to these embeddings. Classical comparisons included K-Medoids clustering on UMAP and FAMD-reduced mixed data. Silhouette scores and statistical tests evaluated cluster quality and distinctiveness. Stella-En-400M-V5 achieved the highest Silhouette Score (0.86). LLAMA 3.1 8B with the clustering objective performed better with higher number of clusters, identifying subgroups with distinct nutritional, clinical, and socioeconomic profiles. LLM-based methods outperformed classical techniques by capturing richer context and prioritizing key features. These results highlight potential of LLMs for contextual phenotyping and informed decision-making in resource-limited settings.</description>

      <title>Data mining of public genomic repositories: harnessing off-target reads to expand microbial pathogen genomic resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As sequencing technologies become more affordable and genomic databases expand continuously, the reuse of publicly available sequencing data emerges as a powerful strategy for studying microbial pathogens. Indeed, raw sequencing reads generated for the study of a given organism often contain reads originating from the associated microbiota. This review explores how such off-target reads can be detected and used for the study of microbial pathogens. We present genomic data mining as a method to identify relevant sequencing runs from petabase-scale databases, highlighting recent methodological advances that allow efficient database querying. We then briefly outline methods designed to retrieve relevant data and associated metadata, and provide an overview of common downstream analysis pipelines. We discuss how such approaches have (i) expanded the known genetic diversity of microbial pathogens, (ii) enriched our understanding of their spatiotemporal distribution, and (iii) highlighted previously unrecognized ecological interactions involving microbial pathogens. However, these analyses often rely on the completeness and accuracy of accompanying metadata, which remain highly variable. We detail common pitfalls, including data contamination and metadata misannotations, and suggest strategies for result interpretation. Ultimately, while data mining cannot replace dedicated studies, it constitutes an essential and complementary tool for microbial pathogen research. Broader utility will depend on improved data standardization and systematic genomic monitoring across ecosystems.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on Structural Identifiability of Epidemic Models Using StructuralIdentifiability.jl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural identifiability -- the theoretical ability to uniquely recover model parameters from ideal, noise-free data -- is a prerequisite for reliable parameter estimation in epidemic modeling. Despite its importance, structural identifiability analysis remains underutilized in the infectious disease modeling literature. In this tutorial, we present a practical and reproducible workflow for conducting structural identifiability analysis of ordinary differential equation models using the Julia package \texttt{StructuralIdentifiability.jl}. We apply the tool to a range of epidemic models, including SEIR variants with asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission, vector-borne systems, and models incorporating hospitalization and disease-induced mortality. We compare results from StructuralIdentifiability.jl with those obtained using DAISY, a widely used differential algebra tool, and highlight cases where the Julia package succeeds in analyzing models that DAISY cannot handle. Our findings underscore how identifiability depends on model structure, the availability of initial conditions, and the choice of observed states. All code and diagrams are publicly available, making this tutorial a valuable reference for researchers and educators working with dynamic disease models.</description>

      <title>KINDLE: Knowledge-Guided Distillation for Prior-Free Gene Regulatory Network Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gene regulatory network (GRN) inference serves as a cornerstone for deciphering cellular decision-making processes. Early approaches rely exclusively on gene expression data, thus their predictive power remain fundamentally constrained by the vast combinatorial space of potential gene-gene interactions. Subsequent methods integrate prior knowledge to mitigate this challenge by restricting the solution space to biologically plausible interactions. However, we argue that the effectiveness of these approaches is contingent upon the precision of prior information and the reduction in the search space will circumscribe the models' potential for novel biological discoveries. To address these limitations, we introduce KINDLE, a three-stage framework that decouples GRN inference from prior knowledge dependencies. KINDLE trains a teacher model that integrates prior knowledge with temporal gene expression dynamics and subsequently distills this encoded knowledge to a student model, enabling accurate GRN inference solely from expression data without access to any prior. KINDLE achieves state-of-the-art performance across four benchmark datasets. Notably, it successfully identifies key transcription factors governing mouse embryonic development and precisely characterizes their functional roles. In mouse hematopoietic stem cell data, KINDLE accurately predicts fate transition outcomes following knockout of two critical regulators (Gata1 and Spi1). These biological validations demonstrate our framework's dual capability in maintaining topological inference precision while preserving discovery potential for novel biological mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Aligning Transformers with Continuous Feedback via Energy Rank Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Searching through chemical space is an exceptionally challenging problem because the number of possible molecules grows combinatorially with the number of atoms. Large, autoregressive models trained on databases of chemical compounds have yielded powerful generators, but we still lack robust strategies for generating molecules with desired properties. This molecular search problem closely resembles the "alignment" problem for large language models, though for many chemical tasks we have a specific and easily evaluable reward function. Here, we introduce an algorithm called energy rank alignment (ERA) that leverages an explicit reward function to produce a gradient-based objective that we use to optimize autoregressive policies. We show theoretically that this algorithm is closely related to proximal policy optimization (PPO) and direct preference optimization (DPO), but has a minimizer that converges to an ideal Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution with the reward playing the role of an energy function. Furthermore, this algorithm is highly scalable, does not require reinforcement learning, and performs well relative to DPO when the number of preference observations per pairing is small. We deploy this approach to align molecular transformers and protein language models to generate molecules and protein sequences, respectively, with externally specified properties and find that it does so robustly, searching through diverse parts of chemical space.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Tool to Analyse Spectroscopic Changes in High-Dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When nanoparticles (NPs) are introduced into a biological solution, layers of biomolecules form on their surface, creating a corona. Understanding how the structure of the protein evolves into the corona is essential for evaluating the safety and toxicity of nanotechnology. However, the influence of NP properties on protein conformation is not well understood. In this study, we propose a new method that addresses this issue by analyzing multi-component spectral data using Machine Learning (ML). We apply the method to fibrinogen, a crucial protein in human blood plasma, at physiological concentrations while interacting with hydrophobic carbon or hydrophilic silicon dioxide NPs, revealing striking differences in the temperature dependence of the protein structure between the two cases. Our unsupervised ML method a) does not suffer from the challenges associated with the curse of dimensionality, and b) simultaneously handles spectral data from various sources. The method offers a quantitative analysis of protein structural changes upon adsorption and enhances the understanding of the correlation between protein structure and NP interactions, which could support the development of nanomedical tools to treat various conditions.</description>
