      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we provide a complete English translation of Walter Gr\"obli's 1877 Ph.D. Thesis, together with some notes on the process. The work considers the dynamics of point vortices in a two-dimensional inviscid incompressible fluid and derives a number of exact solutions in the cases of three, four and $2n$ vortices with certain restriction on the vortices' circulation and the symmetry of the initial configuration.</description>

      <title>Percolation without trapping: how Ostwald ripening during two-phase displacement in porous media alters capillary pressure and relative permeability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional measurements of gas-liquid flow in subsurface gas storage and recovery do not allow for Ostwald ripening, significantly over-estimating the amount of trapping and hysteresis. When there is transport of dissolved species, local capillary equilibrium is achieved, and two-phase displacement in porous media needs to be modelled as percolation without trapping. A pore network model is used to demonstrate how to scale trapped saturation, capillary pressure and relative permeability to account for Ostwald ripening.</description>

      <title>VortexViz: Finding Vortex Boundaries by Learning from Particle Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortices are studied in various scientific disciplines, offering insights into fluid flow behavior. Visualizing the boundary of vortices is crucial for understanding flow phenomena and detecting flow irregularities. This paper addresses the challenge of accurately extracting vortex boundaries using deep learning techniques. While existing methods primarily train on velocity components, we propose a novel approach incorporating particle trajectories (streamlines or pathlines) into the learning process. By leveraging the regional/local characteristics of the flow field captured by streamlines or pathlines, our methodology aims to enhance the accuracy of vortex boundary extraction.</description>

      <title>Deep reinforcement learning of airfoil pitch control in a highly disturbed environment using partial observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the application of deep reinforcement learning (RL) to design an airfoil pitch controller capable of minimizing lift variations in randomly disturbed flows. The controller, treated as an agent in a partially observable Markov decision process, receives non-Markovian observations from the environment, simulating practical constraints where flow information is limited to force and pressure sensors. Deep RL, particularly the TD3 algorithm, is used to approximate an optimal control policy under such conditions. Testing is conducted for a flat plate airfoil in two environments: a classical unsteady environment with vertical acceleration disturbances (i.e., a Wagner setup) and a viscous flow model with pulsed point force disturbances. In both cases, augmenting observations of the lift, pitch angle, and angular velocity with extra wake information (e.g., from pressure sensors) and retaining memory of past observations enhances RL control performance. Results demonstrate the capability of RL control to match or exceed standard linear controllers in minimizing lift variations. Special attention is given to the choice of training data and the generalization to unseen disturbances.</description>

      <title>Hyperviscosity stabilisation of the RBF-FD solution to natural convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical stability of fluid flow is an important topic in computational fluid dynamics as fluid flow simulations usually become numerically unstable in the turbulent regime. Many mesh-based methods have already established numerical dissipation procedures that dampen the effects of the unstable advection term. When it comes to meshless methods, the prominent stabilisation scheme is hyperviscosity. It introduces numerical dissipation in the form of a higher-order Laplacian operator. Many papers have already discussed the general effects of hyperviscosity and its parameters. However, hyperviscosity in flow problems has not yet been analyzed in depth. In this paper, we discuss the effects of hyperviscosity on natural convection flow problems as we approach the turbulent regime.</description>

      <title>Singularity formation of vortex sheets in 2D Euler equations using the characteristic mapping method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this numerical study is to get insight into singular solutions of the two-dimensional (2D) Euler equations for non-smooth initial data, in particular for vortex sheets. To this end high resolution computations of vortex layers in 2D incompressible Euler flows are performed using the characteristic mapping method (CMM). This semi-Lagrangian method evolves the flow map using the gradient-augmented level set method (GALS). The semi-group structure of the flow map allows its decomposition into sub-maps (each over a finite time interval), and thus the precision can be controlled by choosing appropriate remapping times. Composing the flow map yields exponential resolution in linear time, a unique feature of CMM, and thus fine scale flow structures can be resolved in great detail. Here the roll-up process of vortex layers is studied varying the thickness of the layer showing its impact on the growth of palinstrophy and possible blow up of absolute vorticity. The curvature of the vortex sheet shows a singular-like behavior. The self-similar structure of the vortex core is investigated in the vanishing thickness limit. Conclusions on the non-uniqueness of weak solutions of 2D Euler for non-smooth initial data are drawn and the presence of flow singularities is revealed tracking them in the complex plane.</description>

      <title>Small-scale magnetohydrodynamic dynamos: from deterministic chaos to turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown, using results of numerical simulations, and geophysical and solar observations, that the transition from deterministic chaos to hard turbulence in the magnetic field generated by the small-scale MHD dynamos occurs through a randomization process. This randomization process has been described using the notion of distributed chaos and the main parameter of distributed chaos has been used for quantifying the degree of randomization. The dissipative (Loitsianskii and Birkhoff-Saffman integrals) and ideal (magnetic helicity) magnetohydrodynamic invariants control the randomization process and determine the degree of randomization in different MHD flows, directly or through the Kolmogorov-Iroshnikov phenomenology (the magneto-inertial range of scales as a precursor of hard turbulence). Despite the considerable differences in the scales and physical parameters, the results of numerical simulations are in quantitative agreement with the geophysical and solar observations in the frames of this approach. The Hall magnetohydrodynamic dynamo has been also briefly discussed in this context.</description>

      <title>Convergence Acceleration of Favre-Averaged Non-Linear Harmonic Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a numerical procedure to accelerate the convergence of the Favre-averaged Non-Linear Harmonic (FNLH) method. The scheme provides a unified mathematical framework for solving the sparse linear systems formed by the mean flow and the time-linearized harmonic flows of FNLH in an explicit or implicit fashion. The approach explores the similarity of the sparse linear systems of FNLH and leads to a memory efficient procedure, so that its memory consumption does not depend on the number of harmonics to compute. The proposed method has been implemented in the industrial CFD solver HYDRA. Two test cases are used to conduct a comparative study of explicit and implicit schemes in terms of convergence, computational efficiency, and memory consumption. Comparisons show that the implicit scheme yields better convergence than the explicit scheme and is also roughly 7 to 10 times more computationally efficient than the explicit scheme with 4 levels of multigrid. Furthermore, the implicit scheme consumes only approximately $50\%$ of the explicit scheme with four levels of multigrid. Compared with the full annulus unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations, the implicit scheme produces comparable results to URANS with computational time and memory consumption that are two orders of magnitude smaller.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulate phase separated fluids using the Cahn-Hillard fluctuating hydrodynamic (CH-FHD) model and measure the statistical properties of capillary waves generated by thermal fluctuations. Our measurements are in good agreement with stochastic lubrication theory and molecular dynamics simulations but differ significantly from recent CH-FHD results by Zhang et al. (Phys. Rev. E 109 024208 (2024)). Specifically, we find that capillary wave statistics at thermodynamic equilibrium are independent of transport properties, namely viscosity and species diffusion.</description>

      <title>Drop impact on wet granular beds: water-content effects on the cratering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drop impact events on wet granular bed show rich variety by changing the substrate composition. We observe the drop impact onto dry/wet granular substrates with different grain size (50-400 {\mu}m) and water content (0-22 vol %). Although the impactor condition is fixed (impact velocity: 4.0 m/s, water drop radius: 1.8 mm), the experiment reveals that the post-impact behaviors of both impactor and target are strongly affected by the substrate composition. We sort these behaviors into several phases regarding liquid splashing and crater shapes left after the event. As these phases show relevance each other, we measure the mechanical characteristics of the substrates and find that the onset of splashing and particle ejection are explained by a fracture of the substrate. Furthermore, we discuss several timescales of the event to understand more detailed phase separations. Consequently, we find that the splashing phase and the crater shape are determined by a competition of the timescales of impact, penetration, and contact.</description>

      <title>Enhancing wind field resolution in complex terrain through a knowledge-driven machine learning approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atmospheric flows are governed by a broad variety of spatio-temporal scales, thus making real-time numerical modeling of such turbulent flows in complex terrain at high resolution computationally intractable. In this study, we demonstrate a neural network approach motivated by Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks to upscale low-resolution wind fields to generate high-resolution wind fields in an actual wind farm in Bessaker, Norway. The neural network-based model is shown to successfully reconstruct fully resolved 3D velocity fields from a coarser scale while respecting the local terrain and that it easily outperforms trilinear interpolation. We also demonstrate that by using appropriate cost function based on domain knowledge, we can alleviate the use of adversarial training.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and Scaling of Internally Cooled Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our goal is to investigate fundamental properties of the system of internally cooled convection. The system consists of an upward thermal flux at the lower boundary, a mean temperature lapse-rate and a constant cooling term in the bulk with the bulk cooling in thermal equilibrium with the input heat flux. This simple model represents idealised dry convection in the atmospheric boundary layer, where the cooling mimics the radiative cooling to space notably through longwave radiation. We perform linear stability analysis of the model for different values of the mean stratification to derive the critical forcing above which the fluid is convectively unstable to small perturbations. The dynamic behaviour of the fluid system is described and the scaling of various important measured quantities such as the total vertical convective heat flux and the upward mass flux is measured. We introduce a lapse-rate dependent dimensionless Rayleigh-number $Ra_\gamma$ that determines the behaviour of the system, finding that the convective heat-flux and mass-flux scale scale approximately as $Ra_\gamma^{0.5}$ and $Ra_\gamma^{0.7}$ respectively. The area-fraction of the domain that is occupied by upward and downward moving fluid and the skewness of the vertical velocity are studied to understand the asymmetry inherent in the system. We conclude with a short discussion on the relevance to atmospheric convection and the scope for further investigations of atmospheric convection using similar simplified approaches.</description>

      <title>Feather-inspired flow control: The flow physics of spatially distributed covert flaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a novel spatially disrupted flow control system inspired by the covert feathers on bird wings. The system is a passive flow control system consisting of multiple feather-inspired flaps that dynamically interact with the surrounding flow to mitigate stall. Incorporating covert-inspired flaps on the suction side of the airfoil resulted in a substantial increase in lift (up to 50%) and a substantial reduction in drag (up to 30%) in post-stall conditions. Using wind tunnel experiments and time-resolved particle image velocimetry, the physical mechanisms responsible for post-stall lift improvements and drag reduction are identified as (1) shear layer interaction and (2) pressure dam effect. In the first mechanism, flap deployment reduces the geometric adverse pressure gradient that the flow encounters, reducing the degree of flow separation. In the second mechanism, the deployed flap acts as a barrier, preventing the relatively high pressure downstream from propagating upstream of the airfoil. The flow control mechanism employed was a function of the location of the flap. Flaps near the leading edge interacted mainly with the shear layer, while flaps near the trailing edge induced a pressure dam effect. Increasing the number of flaps along the chord increased the gain in lift and the reduction in drag. However, additive performance enhancements were sensitive to spatial distribution and flow control mechanisms. The shear layer interaction mechanism is found to be additive; that is, the deployment of additional flaps increases the lift gain, whereas the pressure dam effect is not.</description>

      <title>Capillary adhesion of stick insects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scientific progress within the last few decades has revealed the functional morphology of an insect's sticky footpads -- a soft, sponge-like pad that secretes a thin liquid film. However, the physico-chemical mechanisms underlying their adhesion remain elusive. Here, we explore these underlying mechanisms by simultaneously measuring adhesive force and contact geometry of the adhesive footpads of live, tethered Indian stick insects, \textit{Carausius morosus}, spanning more than two orders of magnitude in body mass. We find that the adhesive force we measure is similar to previous measurements that use a centrifuge. Our measurements afford use the opportunity to directly probe the adhesive stress \textit{in vivo}, and use existing theory on capillary adhesion to predict the surface tension of the secreted liquid and compare it to previous assumptions. From our predictions, we find that the surface tension required to generate the adhesive stresses we observed ranges between 0.68 mN/m and 12 mN/m. The low surface tension of the liquid would enhance the wetting of the stick insect's footpads and promote their ability to conform to various substrates. Our insights may inform the biomimetic design of capillary-based, reversible adhesives and motivate future studies on the capillary properties of the secreted liquid.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a millimeter size drop exposed to MHz-frequency surface acoustic wave in the underlying solid substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an experimental, theoretical, and computational study of the spreading of a millimetric silicon oil drop under the excitation of a surface acoustic wave (SAW), traveling in the underlying solid substrate. Our theoretical model, formulated within the long wave approach, dynamically captures the interplay between fluid dynamics and acoustic driving forces, emphasizing Eckart streaming as the dominant mechanism over Schlichting and Rayleigh streaming due to drop thickness. Following an initial deformation phase to accommodate acoustic stress, the drop accelerates to a sustained translation at nearly constant speed, leaving behind a thin wetting layer. This speed is sustained by the quasi-steady shape of the drop's main body, influenced by SAW attenuation. Notably, SAW attenuation becomes significant once the wave reaches the main body of the drop, with weaker effects observed under the air and the micron-thick liquid trail left behind the drop. The translating drop's speed is found to be dependent on the drop size, as well as on the SAW intensity. The drop's steady shape and speed are further informed by analytical consideration of a simplified traveling wave type model, that clarifies contributions from different physical effects. The theoretical results show qualitative and sometimes even quantitative agreement with the experiments, particularly regarding drop height and traveling speed.</description>

Abstract: The difficulty of determining the slope of the famed logarithmic law in the mean velocity profile in wall-bounded turbulent flows, the inverse of the Karman 'constant' $\kappa$, from direct numerical simulations (DNS) is discussed for channel flow. Unusual approaches, as well as the analysis of the standard log-indicator function are considered and analyzed, leading to the conclusion that a definitive determination of the channel flow $\kappa$ from DNS with an uncertainty of, say, 2-3% will require the residue of the mean stream-wise momentum equation in the simulations to be reduced by at least an order of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: The continental plates of Earth are known to drift over a geophysical timescale, and their interactions have lead to some of the most spectacular geoformations of our planet while also causing natural disasters such as earthquakes and volcanic activity. Understanding the dynamics of interacting continental plates is thus significant. In this work, we present a fluid mechanical investigation of the plate motion, interaction, and dynamics. Through numerical experiments, we examine the coupling between a convective fluid and plates floating on top of it. With physical modeling, we show the coupling is both mechanical and thermal, leading to the thermal blanket effect: the floating plate is not only transported by the fluid flow beneath, it also prevents the heat from leaving the fluid, leading to a convective flow that further affects the plate motion. By adding several plates to such a coupled fluid-structure interaction, we also investigate how floating plates interact with each other and show that, under proper conditions, small plates can converge into a supercontinent.</description>
