      <title>Weighted Garbling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and develop an information order for experiments based on a generalized notion of garbling called weighted garbling. An experiment is more informative than another in this order if the latter experiment is obtained by a weighted garbling of the former. This notion can be shown to be equivalent to a regular garbling conditional on some event for the former experiment. We also characterize this order in terms of posterior beliefs and show that it only depends on the support of posterior beliefs, not their distribution. Our main results are two characterizations of the weighted-garbling order based on some decision problems. For static Bayesian decision problems, one experiment is more informative than another in the weighted-garbling order if and only if a decision maker's value of information (i.e., the difference in the optimal expected payoffs with and without an experiment) from the former is guaranteed to be some fraction of the value of information from the latter for any decision problem. When the weighted garbling is a regular garbling, this lower bound reduces to the value of information itself as the fraction becomes one, thus generalizing the result in Blackwell (1951, 1953). We also consider a class of stopping time problems where the state of nature changes over time according to a hidden Markov process, and a patient decision maker can conduct the same experiment as many times as she wants without any cost before making a one-time decision. We show that an experiment is more informative than another in the weighted-garbling order if and only if the decision maker achieves a weakly higher expected payoff for any problem with a regular prior belief in this class.</description>

      <title>Markov Stochastic Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the effect of item arrangement on choices using a novel decision-making model based on the Markovian exploration of choice sets. This model is inspired by experimental evidence suggesting that the decision-making process involves sequential search through rapid stochastic pairwise comparisons. Our findings show that decision-makers following a reversible process are unaffected by item rearrangements, and further demonstrate that this property can be inferred from their choice behavior. Additionally, we provide a characterization of the class of Markovian models in which the agent makes all possible pairwise comparisons with positive probability. The intersection of reversible models and those allowing all pairwise comparisons is observationally equivalent to the well-known Luce model. Finally, we characterize the class of Markovian models for which the initial fixation does not impact the final choice and show that choice data reveals the existence and composition of consideration sets.</description>

      <title>The equilibrium properties of obvious strategy profiles in games with many players</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the equilibrium properties of the ``obvious strategy profile'' in large finite-player games. Each player in such a strategy profile simply adopts a randomized strategy as she would have used in a symmetric equilibrium of an idealized large game. We show that, under a continuity assumption, (i) obvious strategy profiles constitute a convergent sequence of approximate symmetric equilibria as the number of players tends to infinity, and (ii) realizations of such strategy profiles also form a convergent sequence of (pure strategy) approximate equilibria with probability approaching one. Our findings offer a solution that is easily implemented without coordination issues and is asymptotically optimal for players in large finite games. Additionally, we present a convergence result for approximate symmetric equilibria.</description>

      <title>Selling Multiple Complements with Packaging Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a package assignment problem with multiple units of indivisible items. The seller specifies preferences over partitions of their supply between buyers as packaging costs. To express these preferences, we propose incremental costs together with a graph that defines cost interdependence. This facilitates using linear programming to find anonymous and package-linear Walrasian equilibrium prices. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of Walrasian equilibria, as well as additional sufficient conditions. Furthermore, our cost framework ensures fair and transparent dual pricing and admits preferences over the concentration of allocated bundles in the market.</description>
