      <title>Optical coherent perfect absorption and amplification in a time-varying medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-invariant photonic structures amplify or absorb light based on their intrinsic material gain or loss. The coherent interference of multiple beams in space, e.g., in a resonator, can be exploited to tailor the wave interaction with material gain or loss, respectively maximizing lasing or coherent perfect absorption. By contrast, a time-varying system is not bound to conserve energy, even in the absence of material gain or loss, and can support amplification or absorption of a probe wave through parametric phenomena. Here, we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally how a subwavelength film of indium tin oxide, whose bulk permittivity is homogeneously and periodically modulated via optical pumping, can be dynamically tuned to act both as a non-resonant amplifier and a perfect absorber, by manipulating the relative phase of two counterpropagating probe beams. This extends the concept of coherent perfect absorption to the temporal domain. We interpret this result as selective switching between the gain and loss modes present in the momentum bandgap of a periodically modulated medium. By tailoring the relative intensity of the two probes, high-contrast modulation can be achieved with up to 80% absorption and 400% amplification. Our results demonstrate control of gain and loss in time-varying media at optical frequencies and pave the way towards coherent manipulation of light in Floquet-engineered complex photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced peak intensity fluctuations in class B laser systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random perturbations and noise can excite instabilities in population systems that result in large fluctuations. An interesting example involves class B lasers, where the dynamics is determined by the number of carriers and photons in a cavity with noise appearing in the electric-field dynamics. When such lasers are brought above threshold, the field intensity grows away from an unstable equilibrium, exhibiting transient relaxation oscillations with fluctuations due to noise. In this work, we focus on the first peak in the intensity during this transient phase in the presence of noise, and calculate its probability distribution using a Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation. In particular, we show how each value of the first peak is determined by a unique fluctuational-momentum, calculate the peak intensity distribution in the limit where the ratio of photon-to-carrier lifetimes is small, and analyze the behavior of small fluctuations with respect to deterministic theory. Our approach is easily extended to the analysis of transient, noise-induced large fluctuations in general population systems exhibiting relaxation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Structured Light\'s Applications: A perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the past few decades, structured light has been gaining popularity across various research fields. Its fascinating properties have been exploited for both previously unforeseen and established applications from new perspectives. Crucial to this is the several techniques that have been proposed for both their generation and characterisation. On one hand, the former has been boosted by the invention of computer-controlled devices, which combined with a few optical components allow flexible and complete control of the spatial and polarisation degrees of freedom on light, thus enabling a plethora of proof-of-principle experiments for novel and old applications. On the other hand, characterising light beams is important not only for gaining better insights into light's properties but also for potentially being used as metrics. In this perspective, we thus offer our take on a few key applied research fields where structured light is particularly promising, as well as some pivotal generation and characterisation techniques. In addition, we share our vision of where we believe structured light's applications are moving towards.</description>

      <title>Modal decomposition of localized plasmon on gold nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localized surface plasmons (LSPs) are collective oscillations of free electrons in metal nanoparticles that confine electromagnetic waves into subwavelength regions, making them an ideal platform for light-matter coupling. To design and understand plasmonic structures, numerical computations of Maxwell's equations are commonly used. However, obtaining physical insight from these numerical solutions can be challenging, especially for complex-shaped nanoparticles. To circumvent this, we introduce mode decomposition strategies within the boundary element method (BEM). By employing singular value decomposition (SVD) and quasi-normal mode (QNM) decomposition, we break down optical responses into elementary modes. QNMs offer deeper insights into frequency and damping, while SVD modes allow for more accurate spectral reconstruction with fast computation. These techniques provide a deeper understanding of LSPs and facilitates the design of metal nanoparticles for efficient light-matter interaction.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper the finite-difference time-domain general vector auxiliary differential equation method [Greene, J. H. and A. Taflove, Opt. Express 14, 8305 (2006)], nonlinear polarization vector is extended to include anisotropy, in nonlinear isotropic media at optical frequencies. The theory is presented for extending the method in 3D Cartesian coordinates, and then simulation results are presented for the simplified 2D transverse magnetic polarization case, revisiting the fused silica example introduced in the 2006 paper including the anisotropic part of the nonlinear polarization vector. The simulation results including the anisotropic part of the polarization vector were compared with isotropic polarization vector simulation results.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast control of braiding topology in non-Hermitian metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mathematical theory of braids, influential across scientific disciplines, has emerged as a compelling strategy for light manipulation. Existing approaches to creating braids in photonics, whether in momentum-space bandstructures or real-space fields, often face limitations associated with static nature of devices and lack of tunability. Here, we experimentally demonstrate ultrafast control of eigen-spectrum braids of Jones matrices within mere picoseconds, in reconfigurable non-Hermitian metasurfaces. The Jones matrices of the metasurface exhibit a complex eigen-spectrum that braids in the three-dimensional eigenvalue-frequency space, thereby creating arbitrary elements within the two-string braid group, B2. By exciting the photoconductive semiconductor terahertz metasurface with a femtosecond infrared pulse, we achieve ultrafast switching of the braids, transitioning from the Solomon link to either the Trefoil knot or Hopf link. Our approach serves as a pivotal tool for elucidating non-trivial topology of braids and studying ultrafast topological optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Active Physics Informed Deep Learning: Surrogate Modeling for Non Planar Wavefront Excitation of Topological Nanophotonic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological plasmonics offers new ways to manipulate light by combining concepts from topology and plasmonics, similar to topological edge states in photonics. However, designing such topological states remains challenging due to the complexity of the high dimensional design space. We present a novel method that uses supervised, physics informed deep learning and surrogate modeling to design topological devices for specific wavelengths. By embedding physical constrains in the neural network training, our model efficiently explores the design space, significantly reducing simulation time. Additionally, we use non planar wavefront excitations via electron beams to probe topologically protected plasmonic modes, making the design and training process nonlinear. Using this approach, we design a topological device with unidirectional edge modes in a ring resonator at specific operational frequencies. Our method reduces computational cost and time while maintaining high accuracy, highlighting the potential of combining machine learning and advanced techniques for photonic device innovation.</description>

      <title>Monolithic silicon nitride electro-optic modulator enabled by optically-assisted poling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electro-optic (EO) modulation is a key functionality to have on-chip. However, achieving a notable linear EO effect in stoichiometric silicon nitride has been a persistent challenge due to the material's intrinsic properties. Recent advancements revealed that the displacement of thermally excited charge carriers under a high electric field induces a second-order nonlinearity in silicon nitride, thus enabling the linear EO effect in this platform regardless of the material's inversion symmetry. In this work, we show for the first time optically-assisted poling of a silicon nitride microring resonator, removing the need for high-temperature processing of the device. The optical stimulation of charges avoids the technical constraints due to elevated temperature. By optimizing the poling process, we experimentally obtain a long-term effective second-order nonlinearity of 1.2 pm/V. Additionally, we measure the high-speed EO response of the modulator, showing a bandwidth of 4 GHz, only limited by the quality factor of the microring resonator. This work goes towards the implementation of monolithic, compact silicon nitride EO modulators, a necessary component for high-density integrated optical signal processing.</description>

      <title>Synthetic gain for electron-beam spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-beam microscopy and spectroscopy featuring atomic-scale spatial resolution have become essential tools used daily in almost all branches of nanoscale science and technology. As a natural supercontinuum source of light, free electrons couple with phonons, plasmons, electron-hole pairs, inter- and intra-band transitions, and inner-shell ionization. The multiple excitations, intertwined with the intricate nature of nanostructured samples, present significant challenges in isolating specific spectral characteristics amidst complex experimental backgrounds. Here we introduce the approach of synthetic complex frequency waves to mitigate these challenges in free-electron--light interaction. The complex frequency waves, created through causality-informed coherent superposition of real-frequency waves induced by free electrons, offer virtual gain to offset material losses. This amplifies and enhances spectral features, as confirmed by our electron energy loss and cathodoluminescence measurements on multi-layer membranes, suspended nanoparticles, and film-coupled nanostructures. Strikingly, we reveal that our approach can retrieve resonance excitation completed buried underneath the zero-loss peak, substantially enhance the quality of hyperspectral imaging, and resolve entangled multiple-photon--electron events in their quantum interaction. Our findings indicate the versatile utility of complex frequency waves in various electron-beam spectroscopy and their promising diagnostic capabilities in free-electron quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Broadband long-range thermal imaging via meta-correctors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range imaging in the thermal infrared band is critical for applications such as environmental monitoring, industrial inspections, and surveillance. To achieve high quality imaging, these systems typically require large apertures and many elements with complex shapes to correct aberrations, adding significant weight and cost. Large-area metasurface optics offer a promising solution for weight reduction; however, their substantial chromatic aberrations limit their effectiveness in the long-wave infrared (LWIR) band where broadband imaging is typically desired. In this work, we introduce a hybrid system comprising four refractive lenses and two all-silicon metasurface correctors (meta-correctors) to achieve high-quality, broadband thermal imaging at long range. Compared to a refractive-only assembly, our system demonstrates a three-fold contrast enhancement at the detector's half-Nyquist frequency. Testing outside the laboratory reveals noticeably sharper images, with human features clearly recognizable at distances of 250 meters. The assembly utilizes off-the-shelf refractive elements and avoids the use of germanium, which poses a supply chain risk. Our findings highlight the potential of hybrid meta-corrector systems to enable long-range, lightweight, and cost-effective LWIR imaging solutions.</description>

      <title>Competition between ponderomotive acceleration and attosecond chirps in optimizing attosecond pulse generation in solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A practical approach is proposed for efficiently generating ultrashort attosecond pulses (APs) from realistic solid-state materials, aiming to achieve pulse widths comparable to those generated in gases. This approach focuses on modulating the plateau region of the high harmonic spectrum by adjusting the peak vector potential of laser fields through changing photon energy, while maintaining a constant peak electric field. It initiates a competition between heightened ponderomotive acceleration and the attosecond chirp effect, leading to a non-monotonic variation in both intensity and duration of the generated APs. Using hexagonal boron nitride as a prototypical material, we demonstrate the generation of optimal ultrashort pulses with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 143 attoseconds, marking an updated record for the shortest pulse duration from solid-state sources. This strategy shows promise for application across a broad range of materials, offering new pathways to promote high harmonic performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing nonlinear interferometers for sensing with undetected light enables new sensing and imaging techniques in spectral ranges that are difficult to detect. To enhance this method for future applications, it is advantageous to extract both amplitude and phase information of an object. This study introduces two approaches for synthetic quantum holography with undetected light, which allows for obtaining an object's amplitude and phase information in a nonlinear interferometer by capturing only a single image. One method is based on quasi-phase-shifting holography using superpixel structures displayed on a spatial light modulator. The other method relies on synthetic off-axis holography implemented through a linear phase gradient on a spatial light modulator. Both approaches are experimentally analyzed for applicability and compared against available multi-acquisition methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple method of measuring the autocorrelation function of a spin noise based on multiplication and averaging two digitized signal traces, with one of them being a time-reversed copy of the other. This procedure allows one to obtain, with lower computational expenses, all the information usually derived in the Fourier transform spin-noise spectroscopy, retaining all the merits of the latter. We successfully applied this method to the measurements of spin noise in cesium vapors by using a digital oscilloscope in the capacity of the analog-to-digital converter. Specific opportunities of this experimental approach as applied to a more general problem of studying the nature of light-intensity noise are discussed.</description>

      <title>Bosonic Mpemba effect with non-classical states of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect refers to the surprising observation where, under certain conditions, a far-from-equilibrium state can relax toward equilibrium faster than a state closer to equilibrium. A paradigmatic example is provided by the curious fact that hot water can sometimes freeze faster than cold water. The Mpemba effect has intrigued scientists since long time and has been predicted and observed in a variety of classical and quantum systems. Recently, the search for Mpemba-like effects of purely quantum nature has raised a major interest. Here we predict the emergence of Mpemba effect in the quantum optics context exploiting non-classical states of light. By analyzing the decay dynamics of photon fields in a leaky optical resonator or waveguide, it is demonstrated that the Mpemba effect emerges in the context of the quantum nature of light. Specifically, the relaxation dynamics is strongly influenced by the photon statistics of the initially trapped light field. The Mpemba effect is observed when comparing the decay dynamics of classical light fields (coherent states) with certain non-classical states, such as squeezed states and Schr\"odinger cat states</description>

      <title>Stabilizing optical solitons by frequency-dependent linear gain-loss and the collisional Raman frequency shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study transmission stabilization of optical solitons against emission of radiation in nonlinear optical waveguides in the presence of weak linear gain-loss, cubic loss, and the collisional Raman frequency shift. We first show how the collisional Raman frequency shift perturbation arises in three different physical setups. We then show by numerical simulations with a perturbed nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) model that transmission in waveguides with weak frequency-independent linear gain is unstable. The radiative instability is stronger than the radiative instabilities that were observed in earlier studies for soliton transmission in the presence of weak linear gain, cubic loss, and various frequency-shifting physical mechanisms. In particular, the Fourier spectrum of the radiation is significantly more spiky and broadband than the radiation's Fourier spectra in earlier studies. Moreover, we demonstrate by numerical simulations with another perturbed NLS model that transmission in waveguides with weak frequency-dependent linear gain-loss, cubic loss, and the collisional Raman frequency shift is stable. Despite the stronger radiative instability in the corresponding waveguide setup with weak linear gain, stabilization occurs via the same generic mechanism that was suggested in earlier studies. More precisely, the collisional Raman frequency shift experienced by the soliton leads to the separation of the soliton's and the radiation's Fourier spectra, while the frequency-dependent linear gain-loss leads to efficient suppression of radiation emission. Thus, our study demonstrates the robustness of the proposed generic soliton stabilization method, which is based on the interplay between perturbation-induced shifting of the soliton's frequency and frequency-dependent linear gain-loss.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear semiclassical spectroscopy of ultrafast molecular polariton dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical framework that allows for the systematic and efficient description of the ultrafast nonlinear response of molecular polaritons, i.e., hybrid light-matter states, in the collective regime of large numbers of molecules $\mathcal N$ coupled to the cavity photon mode. Our approach is based on a semiclassical, mean-field evolution of the molecular Hamiltonian and the cavity field, which is complemented by a perturbative expansion of both light and matter counterparts in the input fields entering the cavity. In addition, expansion in terms of the pulse phases enables us to disentangle different excitation pathways in Liouville space, thereby distinguishing contributions to the nonlinear response. The formalism extends traditional free-space nonlinear spectroscopy by incorporating the feedback of matter onto the light field via the induced polarization. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to the calculation of pump-probe polariton spectra and show how, by storing the pulses, the cavity facilitates additional excitation pathways which are not possible in free space. Our method, which does not scale with $\mathcal N$, is broadly applicable and can be extended to a wide range of current experiments investigating the dynamical nonlinear response of hybrid light-matter states.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the Stability of a Two-Color, Two-Photon Rubidium Frequency Standard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rubidium two-photon frequency standards are emerging as powerful contenders for compact, durable devices with exceptional stability. The field has focused on single-color excitation to date. Here we demonstrate the key advantages of a two-color excitation of a two-photon optical frequency standard based on the $5S_{1/2}\,{\rightarrow}\,5D_{5/2}$ transition of rubidium-87 utilising driving fields at 780 nm and 776 nm. We show that utilising the $5P_{3/2}$ intermediate state to resonantly enhance the transition, we can for the first time attain frequency stabilities comparable to the rubidium single-color two-photon frequency standards, notably with approximately ten-fold less optical power and ten-fold lower rubidium vapor density. Optimisation of the detuning from the $5P_{3/2}$ intermediate state, and optical powers of driving lasers, has a dramatic effect on the frequency stability, achieving the best short-term stability of any two-photon rubidium frequency standard to date, of $6{\times}10^{-14}$ at $\tau$ = 1 s. We demonstrate this level of performance is compatible with a compact geometry, by fully self-referencing the frequency standard using an integrated fiber frequency comb to simultaneously stabilize the 780 nm laser's detuning from the $5P_{3/2}$ intermediate state, and produce a frequency-stable microwave output. A comprehensive noise characterization underpins our observations of this two-color frequency standard which explains the measured stability, showing this frequency standard is shot-noise limited initially before becoming limited by light shifts in the long-term. This work represents a major advance towards a low size, weight, and power frequency standard based on this two-color excitation method.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory for a minimal oscillator model of exciton-plasmon coupling in hybrids of 2d semiconductors and metal nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The common model to describe exciton-plasmon interaction phenomenologically is the coupled oscillator model. Originally developed for atomic systems rather than solid-state matter, this model treats both excitons and plasmons as single harmonic oscillators coupled via a constant which can be fitted to experiments. In this work, we present a modified coupled oscillator model specifically designed for exciton-plasmon interactions in hybrids composed of two-dimensional excitons, such as in a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers and metal nanoparticles while maintaining the simplicity of the commonly applied coupled oscillator models. Our approach is based on a microscopic perspective and Maxwell's equations, allowing to analytically derive an effective exciton-plasmon coupling constant. Our findings highlight the importance of the spatial dispersion, i.e., the delocalized nature of TMDC excitons, necessitating the distinction between bright and momentum-dark excitons. Both types of excitons occur at different resonance energies and exhibit a qualitatively different coupling with localized plasmons. We find a strong coupling between the plasmon and momentum-dark excitons, while a weakly coupled bright exciton manifests as an additional, third peak in the spectrum. Consequently, we propose a realistic modeling of the primary spectral features in experiments incorporating three harmonic oscillator equations instead of the conventional two. However, we also shed light on the limitations of the three coupled oscillator model in describing the line shape of extinction and scattering cross section spectra.</description>

      <title>Dynamical formulation of low-frequency scattering in two and three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transfer matrix of scattering theory in one dimension can be expressed in terms of the time-evolution operator for an effective non-unitary quantum system. In particular, it admits a Dyson series expansion which turns out to facilitate the construction of the low-frequency series expansion of the scattering data. In two and three dimensions, there is a similar formulation of stationary scattering where the scattering properties of the scatterer are extracted from the evolution operator for a corresponding effective quantum system. We explore the utility of this approach to scattering theory in the study of the scattering of low-frequency time-harmonic scalar waves, $e^{-i\omega t}\psi(\mathbf{r})$, with $\psi(\mathbf{r})$ satisfying the Helmholtz equation, $[\nabla^2+k^2\hat\varepsilon(\mathbf{r};k)]\psi(\mathbf{r})=0$, $\omega$ and $k$ being respectively the angular frequency and wavenumber of the incident wave, and $\hat\varepsilon(\mathbf{r};k)$ denoting the relative permittivity of the carrier medium which in general takes complex values. We obtain explicit formulas for low-frequency scattering amplitude, examine their effectiveness in the study of a class of exactly solvable scattering problems, and outline their application in devising a low-frequency cloaking scheme.</description>

      <title>Engineering Fault-tolerant Bosonic Codes with Quantum Lattice Gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bosonic codes enable the protection and correction of quantum information in a single continuous variable system. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework to engineer bosonic code states for fault-tolerant quantum computing based on Floquet Hamiltonian engineering. We construct the target Hamiltonian directly from the target state and engineer the codes states with an adiabatic ramp protocol. We introduce a new universal set of quantum lattice gate composed of only one type of gate element, and develop a systematic decomposition of complex code state preparation and transformation processes into sequences of quantum lattice gates. We apply our method to three basic code states engineering processes, including single code state preparation, code space embedding and transformation. We also discuss the automatic quantum error correction against photon loss with four-legged cat codes. Our proposal is particularly well-suited for superconducting circuit architectures with Josephson junctions, where the full nonlinearity of Josephson junction potential is harnessed as a quantum resource.</description>

      <title>Fringe Contrast characterization and optimization for Ring Laser Gyroscopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Top sensitivity Ring Laser Gyroscopes based on a simple mechanical scheme, so called heterolithic, have shown to operate on a continuous basis; since the mirror positions are not fixed, unwanted signals can occur, and data selection is necessary. For this purpose, Fringe Contrast is very useful. It depends on output beams intensity, alignment, and polarization; the model of the alignment and polarization contributions to Contrast has been implemented, and tested on the GP2 prototype. Polarization changes are corrected by acting on the output beams with plates, in order to recombine linearly polarized light. Using such model, the GP2 prototype was characterized as for polarization of the beams, inside the cavity and at their interference, and for non-planarity; as a result, the interfering beams off-axis has also been measured.</description>

      <title>Nanophotonic waveguide chip-to-free-space beam scanning at 68 Million Spots/(s$\cdot$mm$^{2}$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A seamless chip-to-world photonic interface enables wide-ranging advancements in optical ranging, display, communication, computation, imaging, and light-matter interaction. An optimal solution allows for 2D scanning of a diffraction-limited beam from anywhere on a photonic chip over a large number of beam-spots in free-space. Currently, devices with direct PIC integration rely on tiled apertures with poor mode qualities, large footprints, and complex control systems. Micro-mechanical beam scanners have good beam quality but lack direct PIC integration and are inertially-limited due to the use of bulk optical components or structures in which the optical aperture and actuator sizes are inextricably linked, resulting in trade-offs among resolution, speed, and footprint. Here, we overcome these limitations with the photonic "ski-jump": a nanoscale optical waveguide monolithically integrated atop a piezoelectrically actuated cantilever which passively curls ~90$^{\circ}$ out-of-plane in a footprint of &lt;0.1 mm$^{2}$, emits sub-micron diffraction-limited optical modes, and exhibits kHz-rate mechanical resonances with quality factors exceeding 10,000. This enables two-dimensional beam-scanning with footprint-adjusted spot-rates of 68.6 mega-spots/(s$\cdot$mm$^{2}$) at CMOS-level voltages, which is equivalent to a 1 megapixel display at 100 Hz from a 1.5 mm$^{2}$ footprint, and exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art MEMS mirrors by &gt;50$\times$. Using this device, we demonstrate image projection, video projection, and the initialization and readout of single photons from silicon vacancy centers in diamond waveguides. Based on current performance, we identify pathways for achieving &gt;1 giga-spots at kHz-rates in a ~1 cm$^{2}$ area to provide a seamless, scalable optical pipeline between integrated photonic processors and the free-space world.</description>

      <title>Response of a multi-wavelength laser to single-sideband optical injection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-mode semiconductor lasers subject to optical injection have been shown to trigger a wide range of dynamical behavior from injection locking to chaos. Multi-wavelength lasers add even more degrees of freedom and complexity to the dynamical repertoire potentially unlocking new functionalities for applications ranging from THz generation and processing to all-optical memories. In particular, leveraging the inherent mode coupling in multi-wavelength lasers, spectral multiplication over a THz range of an injected optical signal has been shown. While most of the research on optical injection has been focused on single-mode semiconductor lasers, the dynamical behavior of multi-wavelength lasers, particularly when subjected to injection of amplitude-modulated signals remains vastly unexplored. In this work, we numerically and experimentally investigate the response of an on-chip dual-wavelength laser subject to the optical injection of a single-sideband signal around one of the modes of the laser. Our findings show an asymmetric power evolution of the sidebands appearing around both the injected and un-injected modes with respect to the modulation frequency. The power and bandwidth of the sideband signals strongly depend on the resonance frequency produced by the interference between the cavity mode and the injection, which can be tailored by twerking the strength and the detuning of the injection. The outcomes of our numerical investigations, based on rate equations, align closely with the experimental results highlighting the influence of key injection and laser parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrafast optics is driven by a myriad of complex nonlinear dynamics. The ubiquitous presence of governing equations in the form of partial integro-differential equations (PIDE) necessitates the need for advanced computational tools to understand the underlying physical mechanisms. From the experimental perspective, signal-to-noise ratio and availability of measurable data, accounts for a bottle neck in numerical and data-driven modeling methods. In this paper we extend the application of the physics informed neural network (PINN) architecture to include prior knowledge in both the physical and Fourier domain. We demonstrate our Fourier Domain PINN (FD-PINN) in two distinct forms. The Continuous time FD-PINN is used to predict accurate solutions to the Generalized Pulse Propagation Equation, which includes the complete delayed nonlinear response, in the data-starved and noisy regime. We extend the architecture to the Discrete time FD-PINN to recover the delayed-response physics from spatially separated measurement points. We conducted the first systematic study of the effect of SNR on the spatiotemporal field prediction as well as physics discovery. Our architecture ensures high fidelity predictive modeling and hidden physics recovery for applications such as image reconstruction, pulse characterization and shaping, as well as hidden parameter discovery. The benefits of the FD-PINN for ultrafast nonlinear optics make it immediately experimentally deployable. FD-PINN represents the next generation of tools to study optical phenomena both through modeling and measurements for both forward and inverse problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical measurements enable non-contact and high-speed monitoring of physical processes, offering a non-invasive and versatile approach across a wide range of fields, from scientific research to industrial applications. This work presents an optical sensor capable of simultaneously measuring both the distance and thermal emission from surfaces, based on a simple laser diode probe. The principle of operation integrates triangulation with pyrometry in a single device, leveraging the monitor photodiode embedded within the probe module. By alternating the probe laser emission, the system can rapidly switch between dimensional and thermal measurements, resulting in combined data acquisition. The proposed method is compact, easy to integrate, and cost-effective. The hybrid sensor is demonstrated in a laser processing setup, where a metallic target is heated and melted by a high-power laser beam. Its inline operation allows for real-time dynamic measurements of melt pool distance and radiance, in a coaxial and self-aligning configuration. This innovative approach can be applied to various fields, such as remote environmental sensing and closed-loop control systems for stabilizing high-temperature processes, including laser welding and additive manufacturing.</description>

Abstract: Classical and wave properties of microlasers with the shape of a truncated pseudosphere are investigated through experiments and numerical simulations. These pseudosphere microlasers are surface-like organic microlasers with constant negative curvature, which were fabricated with high optical quality by direct laser writing. It is shown that they behave, in many ways, similar to two-dimensional flat disks, regardless of their different Gaussian curvature. Indeed, it is evidenced that, due to rotational symmetry, the pseudosphere is an integrable system with marginally stable dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exciton optomechanics, bridging cavity exciton polaritons and optomechanics, opens new opportunities for the study of light-matter strong interactions and nonlinearities, due to the rich nonlinear couplings among excitons, phonons, and photons. Here, we propose to entangle two exciton modes in an exciton-optomechanics system, which consists of a semiconductor microcavity integrated with two quantum wells. The quantum wells support two exciton modes, which simultaneously couple to an optical cavity mode via a linear dipole interaction and to a mechanical vibration mode via a nonlinear deformation potential interaction. We show that by strongly driving the microcavity with a red-detuned laser field and when the two exciton modes are respectively resonant with the Stokes and anti-Stokes sidebands scattered by the mechanical motion, stationary entanglement between the two exciton modes can be established under realistic parameters. The protocol is within reach of current technology and may become a promising approach for preparing excitonic entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tactile displays that lend tangible form to digital content could transform computing interactions. However, achieving the resolution, speed, and dynamic range needed for perceptual fidelity remains challenging. We present a tactile display that directly converts projected light into visible tactile patterns via a photomechanical surface populated with millimeter-scale optotactile pixels. The pixels transduce incident light into mechanical displacements through photostimulated thermal gas expansion, yielding millimeter scale displacements with response times of 2 to 100 milliseconds. Employing projected light for power transmission and addressing renders these displays highly scalable. We demonstrate devices with up to 1511 addressable pixels. Perceptual studies confirm that they can reproduce diverse spatiotemporal tactile patterns with high fidelity. This research establishes a foundation for practical, versatile high-resolution tactile displays driven by light.</description>
