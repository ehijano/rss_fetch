      <title>Band-Limited Equivalence of Convolution Operators and its Application to Filtered Vorticity Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we established a general theorem regarding the equivalence of convolution operators restricted to a finite spectral band. We demonstrated that two kernels with identical Fourier transforms over the resolved band act identically on all band-limited functions, even if their kernels differ outside the band. This property is significant in applied mathematics and computational physics, particularly in scenarios where measurements or simulations are spectrally truncated. As an application, we examine the proportionality relation $S(\boldsymbol {r}) \approx \zeta\,\omega(\boldsymbol{r})$ in filtered vorticity dynamics and clarify why real-space diagnostics can underestimate the spectral proportionality due to unobservable degrees of freedom. Our theoretical findings were supported by numerical illustrations using synthetic data.</description>

      <title>A High Performance GPU CountSketch Implementation and Its Application to Multisketching and Least Squares Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random sketching is a dimensionality reduction technique that approximately preserves norms and singular values up to some $O(1)$ distortion factor with high probability. The most popular sketches in literature are the Gaussian sketch and the subsampled randomized Hadamard transform, while the CountSketch has lower complexity. Combining two sketches, known as multisketching, offers an inexpensive means of quickly reducing the dimension of a matrix by combining a CountSketch and Gaussian sketch.
  However, there has been little investigation into high performance CountSketch implementations. In this work, we develop an efficient GPU implementation of the CountSketch, and demonstrate the performance of multisketching using this technique. We also demonstrate the potential for using this implementation within a multisketched least squares solver that is up to $77\%$ faster than the normal equations with significantly better numerical stability, at the cost of an $O(1)$ multiplicative factor introduced into the relative residual norm.</description>

      <title>A well-balanced gas-kinetic scheme with adaptive mesh refinement for shallow water equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is about the construction of a well-balanced gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) with space-time adaptive mesh refinement (STAMR) for the shallow water equations (SWE). While the well-balanced GKS has been established on Cartesian and triangular meshes, the present STAMR framework employs arbitrary quadrilateral meshes with hanging nodes, posing additional challenges for constructing well-balanced schemes. Complementing spatial adaptivity, temporal adaptivity is achieved by selecting adaptive time steps for cells of different refinement levels; the resulting STAMR further improves computational efficiency. Moreover, the numerical flux of the GKS adaptively makes transitions between equilibrium fluxes for smooth flows and non-equilibrium fluxes for discontinuities, endowing the proposed GKS-based AMR method with strong robustness, high accuracy, and high resolution. Standard benchmarks and realistic cases validate the GKS-based STAMR and highlight its potential for interface capturing and complex flow simulations.</description>

      <title>Basis Construction for Spline Spaces over Arbitrary Partitions from a Dimensional Stable Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for constructing $C^r$ basis functions for polynomial spline spaces of degree $d$ over arbitrary planar polygonal partitions, overturning the belief that basis functions cannot be constructed on dimensionally unstable meshes. We provide a comprehensive comparison of basis construction methods, classifying them as explicit, semi-explicit, and implicit. Our method, a semi-explicit construction using Extended Edge Elimination conditions, uniquely resolves all theoretical challenges in spline spaces by ensuring a complete basis. For the first time, we construct basis functions for the spline space over the Morgan-Scott partition, previously unachieved, and elucidate dimensional instability through this construction.</description>

      <title>Exact $\ell^\infty$-separation radius of Sobol' sequences in dimension 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-uniformity is a fundamental geometric property of point sets, crucial for applications such as kernel interpolation, Gaussian process regression, and space-filling experimental designs. While quasi-Monte Carlo methods are widely recognized for their low-discrepancy characteristics, understanding their quasi-uniformity remains important for practical applications. For the two-dimensional Sobol' sequence, Sobol' and Shukhman (2007) conjectured that the separation radius of the first $N$ points achieves the optimal rate $N^{-1/2}$, which would imply quasi-uniformity. This conjecture was disproved by Goda (2024), who computed exact values of the $\ell^2$-separation radius for a sparse subsequence $N = 2^{2^v-1}$. However, the general behavior of the Sobol' sequence for arbitrary $N$ remained unclear. In this paper, we derive exact expressions for the $\ell^\infty$-separation radius of the first $N = 2^m$ points of the two-dimensional Sobol' sequence for all $m \in \mathbb{N}$. As an immediate consequence, we show that the separation radius of Sobol' points is $O(N^{-3/4})$, which is strictly worse than the optimal rate $N^{-1/2}$, revealing that the two-dimensional Sobol' sequence has a suboptimal mesh ratio that grows at least as $N^{1/4}$.</description>

      <title>Deep BSDE Solver on Bounded Domains Part I: General Loss Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a ramification of the deep BSDE loss functional designed to apply for BSDEs on bounded domains, i.e. with random (unbounded) time horizons. We derive a general convergence rate of the loss functional; precisely for a class of (randomly) weighted modifications of the functional. The rate is expressed in terms of the underlying discrete-time stepsize and a universal approximation distance.</description>

      <title>Optimal Subspace Embeddings: Resolving Nelson-Nguyen Conjecture Up to Sub-Polylogarithmic Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a proof of the conjecture of Nelson and Nguyen [FOCS 2013] on the optimal dimension and sparsity of oblivious subspace embeddings, up to sub-polylogarithmic factors: For any $n\geq d$ and $\epsilon\geq d^{-O(1)}$, there is a random $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)\times n$ matrix $\Pi$ with $\tilde O(\log(d)/\epsilon)$ non-zeros per column such that for any $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$, with high probability, $(1-\epsilon)\|Ax\|\leq\|\Pi Ax\|\leq(1+\epsilon)\|Ax\|$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}^d$, where $\tilde O(\cdot)$ hides only sub-polylogarithmic factors in $d$. Our result in particular implies a new fastest sub-current matrix multiplication time reduction of size $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)$ for a broad class of $n\times d$ linear regression tasks.
  A key novelty in our analysis is a matrix concentration technique we call iterative decoupling, which we use to fine-tune the higher-order trace moment bounds attainable via existing random matrix universality tools [Brailovskaya and van Handel, GAFA 2024].</description>

      <title>A generalized Hurwitz stability criterion via rectangular block Hankel matrices for nonmonic matrix polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a Hurwitz stability criterion for nonmonic matrix polynomials via column reduction, generalizing existing approaches constrained by the monic assumption, as well as Gantmacher's classical stability criterion via Markov parameters. Starting from redefining the associated Markov parameters through a column-wise adaptive splitting method, our framework constructs two structured matrices whose rectangular Hankel blocks are obtained via the extraction of these parameters. We establish an explicit interrelation between the inertias of column reduced matrix polynomials and the derived structured matrices. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Hurwitz stability of column reduced matrix polynomials can be determined by the Hermitian positive definiteness of these rectangular block Hankel matrices.</description>

      <title>A framework for finite-strain viscoelasticity based on rheological representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a new constitutive and computational framework based on strain-like internal variables belonging to Sym(3) and two representative rheological configurations. The generalized Maxwell and generalized Kelvin-Voigt models are considered as prototypes for parallelly and serially connected rheological devices, respectively. For each configuration, distinct kinematic assumptions are introduced. The constitutive theory is derived based on thermomechanical principles, where the free energies capture recoverable elastic responses and dissipation potentials govern irreversible mechanisms. The evolution equations for the internal variables arise from the principle of maximum dissipation. A key insight is the structural distinction in the constitutive laws resulted from the two rheological architectures. In particular, the Kelvin-Voigt model leads to evolution equations with non-equilibrium processes coupled, which pose computational challenges for the constitutive integration. To address this, we exploit the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula and extend it to tensorial equations to design an efficient strategy during constitutive integration. With that strategy, the integration can be performed based on an explicit update formula, and the algorithmic complexity scales linearly with the number of non-equilibrium processes. This framework offers both modeling flexibility and computational feasibility for simulating materials with multiple non-equilibrium processes and complex rheological architectures under finite strain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.14163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an augmented Krylov subspace method with subspace recycling for computing a sequence of matrix function applications on a set of vectors. The matrix is either fixed or changes as the sequence progresses. We assume consecutive matrices are closely related, but make no assumptions on the relationship between the vectors. We present three versions of the method with different practical implementations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method using a range of numerical experiments with a selection of functions and matrices. We primarily focus our attention on the sign function arising in the overlap formalism of lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Fast randomized least-squares solvers can be just as accurate and stable as classical direct solvers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the greatest success stories of randomized algorithms for linear algebra has been the development of fast, randomized algorithms for highly overdetermined linear least-squares problems. However, none of the existing algorithms is backward stable, preventing them from being deployed as drop-in replacements for existing QR-based solvers. This paper introduces sketch-and-precondition with iterative refinement (SPIR) and FOSSILS, two provably backward stable randomized least-squares solvers. SPIR and FOSSILS combine iterative refinement with a preconditioned iterative method applied to the normal equations and converge at the same rate as existing randomized least-squares solvers. This work offers the promise of incorporating randomized least-squares solvers into existing software libraries while maintaining the same level of accuracy and stability as classical solvers.</description>

      <title>Regenerative Ulam-von Neumann Algorithm: An Innovative Markov chain Monte Carlo Method for Matrix Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16661v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a regenerative variant of the classical Ulam-von Neumann Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for the approximation of the matrix inverse. The algorithm presented in this paper, termed regenerative Ulam-von Neumann algorithm, utilizes the regenerative structure of classical, non-truncated Neumann series defined by a non-singular matrix and produces an estimator of the matrix inverse via ratios of unbiased estimators of the regenerative quantities. The accuracy of the proposed algorithm depends on a single parameter that controls the total number of simulated Markov transitions, thus avoiding the challenge of balancing between the total number of Markov chain replications and their length as in the classical Ulam-von Neumann algorithm. To efficiently utilize Markov chain transition samples in the calculation of the regenerative variables, the proposed algorithm automatically quantifies the contribution of each Markov transition to all regenerative quantities by a carefully designed updating scheme that utilized three separate matrices containing the current weights, total weights, and regenerative cycle count, respectively. A probabilistic analysis of the performance of the algorithm, including the variance of the estimator, is provided. Finally, numerical experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Applications of multiscale hierarchical decomposition to blind deconvolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08734v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The blind image deconvolution is a challenging, highly ill-posed nonlinear inverse problem. We introduce a Multiscale Hierarchical Decomposition Method (MHDM) that is iteratively solving variational problems with adaptive data and regularization parameters, towards obtaining finer and finer details of the unknown kernel and image. We establish convergence of the residual in the noise-free data case, and then in the noisy data case when the algorithm is stopped early by means of a discrepancy principle. Fractional Sobolev norms are employed as regularizers for both kernel and image, with the advantage of computing the minimizers explicitly in a pointwise manner. In order to break the notorious symmetry occurring during each minimization step, we enforce a positivity constraint on the Fourier transform of the kernels. Numerical comparisons with a single-step variational method and a non-blind MHDM show that our approach produces comparable results, while less laborious parameter tuning is necessary at the price of more computations. Additionally, the scale decomposition of both reconstructed kernel and image provides a meaningful interpretation of the involved iteration steps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Segre-Veronese manifolds are smooth submanifolds of tensors comprising the partially symmetric rank-1 tensors. We investigate a one-parameter family of warped geometries of Segre-Veronese manifolds, which includes the standard Euclidean geometry. This parameter controls by how much spherical tangent directions are weighted relative to radial tangent directions. We present closed expressions for the exponential map, the logarithmic map, and the intrinsic distance on these warped Segre-Veronese manifolds, which can be computed efficiently numerically. It is shown that Segre-Veronese manifolds are not geodesically connected in the Euclidean geometry, while they are for some values of the warping parameter. The benefits of connecting geodesics may outweigh using the Euclidean geometry in certain applications. One such application is presented: numerically computing the Riemannian center of mass for averaging rank-1 tensors.</description>

      <title>Projected Walk on Spheres: A Monte Carlo Closest Point Method for Surface PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present projected walk on spheres (PWoS), a novel pointwise and discretization-free Monte Carlo solver for surface PDEs with Dirichlet boundaries, as a generalization of the walk on spheres method (WoS) [Muller 1956; Sawhney and Crane 2020]. We adapt the recursive relationship of WoS designed for PDEs in volumetric domains to a volumetric neighborhood around the surface, and at the end of each recursion step, we project the sample point on the sphere back to the surface. We motivate this simple modification to WoS with the theory of the closest point extension used in the closest point method. To define the valid volumetric neighborhood domain for PWoS, we develop strategies to estimate the local feature size of the surface and to compute the distance to the Dirichlet boundaries on the surface extended in their normal directions. We also design a mean value filtering method for PWoS to improve the method's efficiency when the surface is represented as a polygonal mesh or a point cloud. Finally, we study the convergence of PWoS and demonstrate its application to graphics tasks, including diffusion curves, geodesic distance computation, and wave propagation animation. We show that our method works with various types of surfaces, including a surface of mixed codimension.</description>

      <title>Interpolatory dynamical low-rank approximation for the 3+3d Boltzmann-BGK equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce two novel interpolatory dynamical low-rank (DLR) approximation methods for the efficient time integration of the Boltzmann-BGK equation. Both methods overcome limitations of classic DLR schemes based on orthogonal projections for nonlinear equations. In particular, we demonstrate that the proposed methods can efficiently compute solutions to the full Boltzmann-BGK equation without restricting to e.g. weakly compressible or isothermal flow. The first method we propose directly applies the recently developed interpolatory projector-splitting scheme on low-rank matrix manifolds. The second method is a variant of the rank-adaptive basis update and Galerkin scheme, where the Galerkin step is replaced by a collocation step, resulting in a new scheme we call basis update and collocate (BUC). Numerical experiments in both fluid and kinetic regimes demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods. In particular we demonstrate that the methods can be used to efficiently compute low-rank solutions in the six-dimensional (three spatial and three velocity dimensions) setting on a standard laptop.</description>

      <title>A study on nodal and isogeometric formulations for nonlinear dynamics of shear- and torsion-free rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we compare the nodal and isogeometric spatial discretization schemes for the nonlinear formulation of shear- and torsion-free rods introduced in [1]. We investigate the resulting discrete solution space, the accuracy, and the computational cost of these spatial discretization schemes. To fulfill the required C1 continuity of the rod formulation, the nodal scheme discretizes the rod in terms of its nodal positions and directors using cubic Hermite splines. Isogeometric discretizations naturally fulfill this with smooth spline basis functions and discretize the rod only in terms of the positions of the control points [2], which leads to a discrete solution in multiple copies of the Euclidean space R3. They enable the employment of basis functions of one degree lower, i.e. quadratic C1 splines, and possibly reduce the number of degrees of freedom. When using the nodal scheme, since the defined director field is in the unit sphere S2, preserving this for the nodal director variable field requires an additional constraint of unit nodal directors. This leads to a discrete solution in multiple copies of the manifold R3xS2, however, results in zero nodal axial stress values. Allowing arbitrary length for the nodal directors, i.e. a nodal director field in R3 instead of S2 as within discrete rod elements, eliminates the constrained nodal axial stresses and leads to a discrete solution in multiple copies of R3. To enforce the unit nodal director constraint, we discuss two approaches using the Lagrange multiplier and penalty methods. We compare the resulting semi-discrete formulations and the computational cost of these discretization variants. We numerically demonstrate our findings via examples of a planar roll-up, a catenary, and a mooring line.</description>

      <title>Moment-based adaptive time integration for thermal radiation transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a framework for moment-based adaptive time integration of deterministic multifrequency thermal radiation transpot (TRT). We generalize our recent semi-implicit-explicit (IMEX) integration framework for gray TRT to multifrequency TRT, and also introduce a semi-implicit variation that facilitates higher-order integration of TRT, where each stage is implicit in all components except opacities. To appeal to the broad literature on adaptivity with Runge--Kutta methods, we derive new embedded methods for four asymptotic preserving IMEX Runge--Kutta schemes we have found to be robust in our previous work on TRT and radiation hydrodynamics. We then use a moment-based high-order-low-order representation of the transport equations. Due to the high dimensionality, memory is always a concern in simulating TRT. We form error estimates and adaptivity in time purely based on temperature and radiation energy, for a trivial overhead in computational cost and memory usage compared with the base second order integrators. We then test the adaptivity in time on the tophat and Larsen problem, demonstrating the ability of the adaptive algorithm to naturally vary the timestep across 4--5 orders of magnitude, ranging from the dynamical timescales of the streaming regime to the thick diffusion limit.</description>

      <title>A Cubed Sphere Fast Multipole Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work describes a new version of the Fast Multipole Method for summing pairwise particle interactions that arise from discretizing integral transforms and convolutions on the sphere. The kernel approximations use barycentric Lagrange interpolation on a quadtree composed of cubed sphere grid cells. The scheme is kernel-independent and requires kernel evaluations only at points on the sphere. Results are presented for the Poisson and biharmonic equations on the sphere, barotropic vorticity equation on a rotating sphere, and self-attraction and loading potential in tidal calculations. A tree code version is also described for comparison, and both schemes are tested in serial and parallel calculations.</description>

      <title>Extending DD-$\alpha$AMG on heterogeneous machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08092v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multigrid solvers are the standard in modern scientific computing simulations. Domain Decomposition Aggregation-Based Algebraic Multigrid, also known as the DD-$\alpha$AMG solver, is a successful realization of an algebraic multigrid solver for lattice quantum chromodynamics. Its CPU implementation has made it possible to construct, for some particular discretizations, simulations otherwise computationally unfeasible, and furthermore it has motivated the development and improvement of other algebraic multigrid solvers in the area. From an existing version of DD-$\alpha$AMG already partially ported via CUDA to run some finest-level operations of the multigrid solver on Nvidia GPUs, we translate the CUDA code here by using HIP to run on the ORISE supercomputer. We moreover extend the smoothers available in DD-$\alpha$AMG, paying particular attention to Richardson smoothing, which in our numerical experiments has led to a multigrid solver faster than smoothing with GCR and only 10% slower compared to SAP smoothing. Then we port the odd-even-preconditioned versions of GMRES and Richardson via CUDA. Finally, we extend some computationally intensive coarse-grid operations via advanced vectorization.</description>

      <title>A SIMPLE-Based Preconditioned Solver for the Direct-Forcing Immersed Boundary Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a robust and scalable solver for direct-forcing immersed boundary simulations, based on a preconditioned SIMPLE algorithm. The method applies block elimination to the pressure-force coupled system, and utilizes the discrete Laplacian operator as an efficient preconditioner for the resulting Schur complement. We rigorously demonstrate the spectral equivalence between the Schur complement and the discrete Laplacian, ensuring convergence behavior that is independent of grid resolution and physical parameters. This enables accurate, stable, and efficient two-way coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations with moving boundaries and significant added-mass effects. These simulations are all executable on standard computing platforms. Extensive validation and verification - including simulations of oscillating, sedimenting, and buoyant spheres, as well as configurations involving multiple immersed bodies - confirm the solver's accuracy and efficiency across a broad range of FSI scenarios. The proposed approach introduces a novel and accessible framework for immersed boundary simulations requiring strong pressure-force coupling.</description>

      <title>Learning to Solve Related Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving multiple parametrised related systems is an essential component of many numerical tasks, and learning from the already solved systems will make this process faster. In this work, we propose a novel probabilistic linear solver over the parameter space. This leverages information from the solved linear systems in a regression setting to provide an efficient posterior mean and covariance. We advocate using this as companion regression model for the preconditioned conjugate gradient method, and discuss the favourable properties of the posterior mean and covariance as the initial guess and preconditioner. We also provide several design choices for this companion solver. Numerical experiments showcase the benefits of using our novel solver in a hyperparameter optimisation problem.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Minnaert Resonances in High-contrast acoustic Structures and Applications to Invisibility Cloaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel quasi-Minnaert resonance phenomenon in acoustic wave propagation through high-contrast medium in both two and three dimensions, occurring in the sub-wavelength regime. These media are characterized by physical properties significantly distinct from those of a homogeneous background. The quasi-Minnaert resonance is defined by two primary features: boundary localization, where the $L^2$-norms of the internal total field and the external scattered field exhibit pronounced concentration near the boundary, and surface resonance, marked by highly oscillatory behavior of the fields near the boundary. In contrast to classical Minnaert resonances, which are associated with a discrete spectral spectrum tied to physical parameters, quasi-Minnaert resonances exhibit analogous physical phenomena but with a continuous spectral spectrum. Using layer potential theory and rigorous asymptotic analysis, we demonstrate that the coupling between a high-contrast material structure, particularly with radial geometries, and a carefully designed incident wave is critical for inducing quasi-Minnaert resonances. Extensive numerical experiments, involving radial geometries (e.g., unit disks and spheres) and general-shaped geometries (e.g., hearts, Cassini ovals, and clovers in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and spheres in $\mathbb{R}^3$), validate the occurrence of these resonances. Furthermore, we numerically demonstrate that quasi-Minnaert resonances induce an invisibility cloaking effect in the high-contrast medium. These findings have significant implications for mathematical material science and the development of acoustic cloaking technologies.</description>
