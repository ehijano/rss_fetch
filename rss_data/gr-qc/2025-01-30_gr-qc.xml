      <title>An Interior Solution for the Kerr Metric: A Novel Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for the construction of interior solutions for the Kerr metric, extending J. Ovalle's foundational work through ellipsoidal coordinate transformations. By deriving a physically plausible interior solution that smoothly matches the Kerr exterior metric, we analyze the energy conditions across various rotation parameters. Our findings reveal anisotropic fluid properties and energy condition behaviors in specific space-time regions, providing insights into the strong-field regime of rotating black holes. The proposed solution offers a more realistic description of rotating black hole interiors, with implications for understanding compact astrophysical objects.</description>

      <title>Unimodular JT gravity and de Sitter quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we show that a gauge-theoretic description of Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity naturally yields a Henneaux-Teitelboim (HT) unimodular gravity via a central extension of its isometry group, valid for both flat and curved two-dimensional spacetimes. HT gravity introduces a unimodular time canonically conjugate to the cosmological constant, serving as a physical time in quantum cosmology. By studying the mini-superspace reduction of $\text{HT}_2$ gravity, the Wheeler-DeWitt equation becomes a Schr\"odinger-like equation, giving a consistent and unitary quantum theory. Analysis of the wavefunction's probability density reveals a quantum distribution for the scale factor $a$, offering a quantum perspective on the expansion and contraction of the universe. In this perspective, the possibility of reaching the singular point $a=0$ signals that topology change could occur. Finally, we give a consistent quantum description of unimodular time that aligns seamlessly with Page-Wootters formulation of quantum mechanics, where quantum correlations between unimodular time and JT gravity are studied in $\text{HT}_2$ quantum cosmology.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Shortcomings in the Generalized SU(2) Proca Theory: Challenges for Cosmic Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Generalized SU(2) Proca (GSU2P) theory has recently garnered attention for its potential to describe key phases of cosmic evolution, including primordial inflation and late-time accelerated expansion. However, its full cosmological implications remain unexplored. In this work, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the dynamical properties of the GSU2P theory in a flat, homogeneous, and isotropic spacetime, through a dynamical-system approach. Our analysis reveals the presence of three pairs of fixed points, one of them corresponding to de-Sitter expansion which may represent either a stable or unstable phase in the evolution of the universe. These points, nonetheless, give rise to an indeterminate or infinite Hubble parameter, which renders them cosmologically unviable. Additionally, we find two key pseudostationary states: the ``attractor lines'', along which the system exhibits constant-roll dynamics, and the ``central zone'', characterized by oscillatory radiation-like behaviour of the field. The dynamics within the central zone could represent a graceful exit from the primordial inflationary phase to a radiation dominated phase, or a state of the dark energy component prior to the late-time cosmic acceleration. However, within the central zone, the dynamics of the vector field leads to recurrent instances of a nonphysical expansion rate. The absence of a limit cycle in the central zone further exacerbates the issue, as the system may follow unbounded phase-space trajectories, and the expansion rate becomes complex once it escapes the region. Collectively, these challenges undermine the viability of the GSU2P theory as a cosmological model for cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Innermost Stable Circular Orbits of a Kerr-like Metric with Quadrupole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents results for the innermost stable circular orbit in a Kerr-like spacetime. The metric employed is an approximation that combines the Kerr metric with the Erez-Rosen metric, expanded in a Taylor series. Consequently, this spacetime incorporates three relativistic multipole moments: mass, spin, and quadrupole moment. Our derivation builds upon the analysis conducted by Chandrasekhar for the Kerr metric. Utilizing the Euler-Lagrange method and Hamiltonian dynamics, we define an effective potential for the radial coordinate. This equation can be used to measure the mass quadrupole through observational methods, as it yields a quadratic polynomial for the quadrupole moment. As anticipated, the limiting cases of this equation correspond to the established cases of Kerr and Schwarzschild spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Euclidean gravity is hot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behavior of Ising spins on Euclidean spacetime backgrounds to determine which properties of the background - curvature, the presence of a horizon, or temperature - play a role in phase transitions. We construct Ising-like models on Euclidean Schwarzschild, Rindler, extremal Reissner-N\"{o}rdstrom (ERN), Anti deSitter (AdS), and deSitter (dS) backgrounds. Among these, Rindler is flat, AdS does not have a horizon, and both AdS and ERN have zero temperatures. We find second-order phase transitions as the metric parameter is varied in all cases except for Rindler. Specifically, we find that the transition from order to disorder occurs as the curvature - or Euclidean gravity - increases. This supports our conjecture that Euclidean gravity is an essential ingredient for these phase transitions, as opposed to the presence of a horizon or temperature.</description>

      <title>Calculating the Hawking Temperature of Black Holes in $f(Q)$ Gravity Using the RVB Method: A Residue-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the computation of Hawking temperatures for black holes within various $f(Q)$ gravity models using the RVB method. This topological approach uncovers an additional term in the temperature calculation, which we propose originates from the residue of a specific contour integral related to the metric or curvature. By examining several specific $f(Q)$ models including quadratic, logarithmic, square root, and power law modifications as well as well known black hole solutions such as RN, Kerr, and KN black holes, we demonstrate that the correction term can consistently be interpreted as this residue. Our findings provide new insights into black hole thermodynamics within modified gravity frameworks.</description>

      <title>Gravity from (A)dS Yang-Mills: a natural reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relation between a one-parameter family of (anti)-de Sitter Yang-Mills models and Einstein-Palatini gravity in the absence of matter, realized via a In\"o\"nu-Wigner contraction of the (A)-dS algebra. The Yang-Mills action is shown to reproduce the Einstein equations of General Relativity when the parameter labelling the gauge group is set to zero. In this limit the components of the gauge connection consistently reduce to tetrads and spin connection, transforming in the standard way under the local Lorentz group. Moreover, the full gauge symmetry of the Yang-Mills action gives rise to the invariance under diffeomorphisms and local Lorentz transformations of General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Inverse logarithmic correction in the HBAR entropy of an atom falling into a renormalization group improved charged black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have considered a spherically symmetric non-rotating charged black hole geometry where both the Newton's gravitational constant and the charge of the black hole flows with the energy scale. We have used the Kretschmann scale identification to write down the finite cutoff for the momentum scale in terms of the proper distance. Introducing the flow of running couplings, the event horizon radius of the black hole using quantum improved Reissner-Nordstrom metric was found in \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.066016}{Phys. Rev. D 104 (2021) 066016}. We have, in this work, explored the thought experiment of a two-level atom freely falling into the event horizon of a quantum improved charged black hole and have computed the transition probability of the atom for going from its ground state to the excited state via emission of a virtual photon. We find that the probability deviates slightly from the pure Planckian spectrum. We have showed that this deviation is due to the presence of incomplete lower gamma function in the distribution function. We have then computed the horizon brightened acceleration radiation entropy and found that it is identical to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy followed by the renormalization group correction terms including an inverse logarithmic and a square root of the area term due to emitting photons.</description>

      <title>A Two-Step Procedure to Detect Cosmological Gravitational Wave Backgrounds with Next-Generation Terrestrial Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological gravitational-wave backgrounds are an exciting science target for next-generation ground-based detectors, as they encode invaluable information about the primordial Universe. However, any such background is expected to be obscured by the astrophysical foreground from compact-binary coalescences. We propose a novel framework to detect a cosmological gravitational-wave background in the presence of binary black holes and binary neutron star signals with next-generation ground-based detectors, including Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. Our procedure involves first removing all the individually resolved binary black hole signals by notching them out in the time-frequency domain. Then, we perform joint Bayesian inference on the individually resolved binary neutron star signals, the unresolved binary neutron star foreground, and the cosmological background. For a flat cosmological background, we find that we can claim detection at $5\,\sigma$ level when $\Omega_\mathrm{ref}\geqslant 2.7\times 10^{-12}/\sqrt{T_\mathrm{obs}/\mathrm{yr}}$, where $T_\mathrm{obs}$ is the observation time (in years), which is within a factor of $\lesssim2$ from the sensitivity reached in absence of these astrophysical foregrounds.</description>

      <title>Test particles in Kaluza-Klein models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09503v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geodesics in general relativity describe the behaviour of test particles in a gravitational field. In 5D Kaluza-Klein, geodesics reproduce the Lorentz force motion of particles in an electromagnetic field. This paper studies geodesic motion on a higher-dimensional $M_4 \times K$ with background metrics encoding general 4D gauge fields and Higgs-like scalars. It shows that the classical mass and charge of a test particle become variable quantities when the geodesic traverses regions of spacetime with massive gauge fields, such as the weak force field, or with non-constant Higgs scalars. This agrees with the physical fact that interactions mediated by massive bosons can change the mass and charge of particles. The variation rates of mass and charge along a geodesic are given by natural geometric formulae. In regions where mass is preserved, there are additional constants of motion, one for every abelian or simple summand in the Killing algebra of $K$. The last part of the paper discusses traditional difficulties of Kaluza-Klein models, such as the low $q / m$ ratios in the 5D model. It suggests possible ways to circumvent them. It also remarks the naturalness of a model in which elementary particles always travel at the speed of light in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Critical String Theory in a $D=4$ Robertson-Walker Background and the Large Scale Structure of Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that $4$-dimensional Robertson-Walker spacetimes can be constructed for which all of the beta functions vanish to leading order, yielding consistent string theory without extra dimensions. We find that there is a unique static solution, which we refer to as an anti-Einstein static universe. The associated stress energy tensor can be interpreted as a perfect fluid with a negative energy density. Interestingly, a fluid with a negative energy density was proposed in [2] as an ad hoc hypothesis to serve as a possible explanation for dark energy and dark matter. Here, such a fluid spontaneously appears by trying to fit string theory into only $4$ dimensions. We can look at perturbations away from the anti-Einstein static universe. This has to be done numerically and we only do it for a few choices of initial conditions. We find that these solutions are very sensitive to the initial conditions and yield a variety of behaviors. We hope that this behavior is rich enough to match cosmological observations by appropriately choosing the initial conditions. One of these solutions that we found is particularly interesting. It has a hubble parameter which is negative in the past (meaning a contracting universe), then a point at which the hubble parameter changes sign, so the universe starts expanding which could be identified with a big bang, after which the hubble parameter continues growing. Throughout all of this time, the acceleration is positive since the Hubble parameter is increasing. Finally, we comment that our result does not contradict [1] as it seems that the authors overlooked the possibility of a purely complex axion field which allows for the Robertson-Walker metrics to make a contribution $c_{RW}\geq 4$ to the central charge. Thus, we can interpret dark matter and dark energy as being parts of a mechanism needed to keep $4$-dimensional string theory consistent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that primordial adiabatic curvature fluctuations generate an instability of the scalar field sourcing a kination era. We demonstrate that the generated higher Fourier modes constitute a radiation-like component dominating over the kination background after about $11$ e-folds of cosmic expansion. Current constraints on the extra number of neutrino flavors $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ thus imply the observational bound of approximately 10 e-folds, representing the most stringent bound to date on the stiffness of the equation of state of the pre-Big-Bang-Nucleosynthesis universe.</description>

      <title>Quantum induced superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superradiance, the phenomenon enabling energy extraction through radiation amplification, is not universal to all black holes. We show that semi-classical backreaction can induce superradiance, even when absent at the classical level. Specifically, we compute the quasinormal modes of a massless scalar field probing a family of rotating `quantum' black holes in three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space, accounting for all orders of backreaction due to quantum conformal matter. A subset of these modes is identified as superradiant, leading to the formation of quantum black hole `bombs'. All such quantum black holes have curvature singularities shrouded by horizons. Thus, while backreaction enforces cosmic censorship, it also renders the black holes dynamically unstable. Further, we find all thermally unstable black holes are dynamically unstable, though the converse does not hold generally. Our findings thus suggest a semiclassical version of the Gubser-Mitra conjecture on black hole stability. This motivates us to propose a stability criterion for quantum black holes.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing parametric gravitational-wave population fits from non-parametric results without refitting the data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining multiple events into population analyses is a cornerstone of gravitational-wave astronomy. A critical component of such studies is the assumed population model, which can range from astrophysically motivated functional forms to non-parametric treatments that are flexible but difficult to interpret. In practice, the current approach is to fit the data multiple times with different population models to identify robust features. We propose an alternative strategy: assuming the data have already been fit with a flexible model, we present a practical recipe to reconstruct the population distribution of a different model. As our procedure postprocesses existing results, it avoids the need to access the underlying gravitational-wave data again and handle selection effects. Additionally, our reconstruction metric provides a goodness-of-fit measure to compare multiple models. We apply this method to the mass distribution of black-hole binaries detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. Our work paves the way for streamlined gravitational-wave population analyses by fitting the data once and for all with advanced non-parametric methods and careful handling of selection effects, while the astrophysical interpretation is then made accessible using our reconstruction procedure on targeted models. The key principle is that of conceptually separating data description from data interpretation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study null hypersurfaces approaching null infinity in asymptotically flat spacetimes within the Bondi-Sachs gauge. The null Raychaudhuri constraint is shown to asymptote to the Bondi mass-loss formula, interpreted as a stress tensor conservation law. This stress tensor, the null Brown-York tensor, yields a Carrollian stress tensor at null infinity from the bulk. Furthermore, we establish that the canonical phase space on finite-distance null hypersurfaces asymptotes to the Ashtekar-Streubel phase space. This connection between finite-distance null physics and null infinity unveils promising insights.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cross-section of Near-extremal Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore how to detect the large quantum fluctuations in the throat of a near-extremal black hole, where the dynamics are governed by the Schwarzian theory. To this end, we scatter a low-frequency wave of a massless, minimal scalar off the black hole and calculate the absorption cross-section. In the semiclassical regime, where the Schwarzian is weakly coupled, we recover the universal result that the cross-section equals the horizon area. However, in the strongly coupled regime, where quantum fluctuations dominate, we find that the absorption cross-section exceeds the semiclassical prediction. This result may seem counterintuitive, given that the density of black hole states is suppressed in this regime. Nevertheless, two effects outweigh this suppression. First, quantum fluctuations enhance absorption transitions between individual states, with the effect becoming stronger closer to the ground state. Second, these fluctuations significantly reduce stimulated emission. We conclude that a measurement showing an enhanced absorption cross-section serves as a clear signature of the large quantum fluctuations in the geometry.</description>

      <title>Single versus multifield scalar potentials from string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the properties of string effective theories with scalar field(s) and a scalar potential. We first claim that in most examples known, such theories are multifield, with at least 2 non-compact field directions; the few counter-examples appear to be very specific and isolated. Such a systematic multifield situation has important implications for cosmology. Characterising properties of the scalar potential $V$ is also more delicate in a multifield setting. We provide several examples of string effective theories with $V&gt;0$, where the latter admits an asymptotically flat direction along an off-shell field trajectory: in other words, there exists a limit $\varphi \rightarrow \infty$ for which $\frac{|\partial_{\varphi} V|}{V} \rightarrow 0$. It is thus meaningless to look for a lower bound to this single field quantity in a multifield setting; the complete gradient $\nabla V$ is then better suited. Restricting to on-shell trajectories, this question remains open, especially when following the steepest descent or more generally a gradient flow evolution. Interestingly, single field statements in multifield theories seem less problematic for $V&lt;0$.</description>

      <title>Inequivalence between the Euclidean and Lorentzian versions of the type IIB matrix model from Lefschetz thimble calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The type IIB matrix model is conjectured to describe superstring theory nonperturbatively in terms of ten $N \times N$ bosonic traceless Hermitian matrices $A_\mu$ ($\mu=0, \ldots , 9$), whose eigenvalues correspond to $(9+1)$-dimensional space-time. Quite often, this model has been investigated in its Euclidean version, which is well defined although the ${\rm SO}(9,1)$ Lorentz symmetry of the original model is replaced by the ${\rm SO}(10)$ rotational symmetry. Recently, a well-defined model respecting the Lorentz symmetry has been proposed by gauge-fixing the Lorentz symmetry nonperturbatively using the Faddeev-Popov procedure. Here we investigate the two models by Monte Carlo simulations, overcoming the severe sign problem by the Lefschetz thimble method, in the case of matrix size $N=2$ omitting fermionic contributions. We add a quadratic term $\gamma \, \mathrm{tr} (A_\mu A^\mu)$ in the action and calculate the expectation values of rotationally symmetric (or Lorentz symmetric) observables as a function of the coefficient $\gamma$. Our results exhibit striking differences between the two models around $\gamma=0$ and in the $\gamma&gt;0$ region, associated with the appearance of different saddle points, clearly demonstrating their inequivalence against naive expectations from quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Gleaning gravitational amplitudes -- a double copy for canceling dilatons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scattering amplitudes in general relativity can be conveniently computed using the double copy, which relates them to Yang-Mills amplitudes. However, unwanted dilatons are sourced by massive scalar matter, which must be removed from the double copy in order to match the long range gravitational interactions. In this paper, we study how to automatically cancel out the dilatons by finding a suitable double-copy prescription in terms of gauge-theory fields, effectively treating the new contributions as ghosts that subtract out the unwanted states. At tree level, we find that an asymmetric double copy can reproduce the dilaton graphs in general dimension, which we explicitly verify up to six external massive scalars. Considering a one-loop four-point example, the same asymmetric double copy needs to be supplemented by the subtraction of bubble graphs that originate both from the axion and a residual dilaton term.</description>

      <title>On heat coefficients, multiplicative anomaly and 4D Casimir energy for GJMS operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note aims to verify a prediction on the total derivative term of the 4D trace anomaly, and the corresponding heat coefficient, for GJMS operators. It stems from the explicit computation of an {\it improved} Casimir (or vacuum) energy on the sphere that takes into account the multiplicative anomaly among the (shifted) Laplacian factors and connects, via the Cappelli-Coste relation, with both the type A central charge and the total derivative term of the 4D trace anomaly. The present heat coefficient computation is based on Juhl's explicit formula for GJMS operators, Gilkey's formula for the integrated heat coefficient of higher-order Laplacians, and the \textit{conformal principle} by Branson and {\O}rsted.</description>

      <title>Holographic Fluctuation-Dissipation Relations in Finite Density Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using real-time holography, we investigate fluctuation-dissipation relations in holographic systems at finite density. In the bulk, it corresponds to the study of scattering of charged scalar field against a charged black hole background and derives an exterior field theory outside the AdS Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. This theory captures dissipation (from infalling Quasi-normal modes) and fluctuations (from Hawking radiation). Here, we also develop a Witten diagrammatic framework for computing $n$-point functions for interacting charged scalars. From the boundary perspective, it gives real-time correlations of the dual CFT held at finite temperature and finite chemical potential. Our results yield (non)-linear holographic fluctuation-dissipation relations at finite density, which are shown to recover the correct behaviour in the zero-density limit.</description>

Abstract: In this article we provide a more detailed account of the geometry and topology of the composite bundle formalism introduced by Tresguerres in Phys. Rev. D 66 (2002) 064025 [1] to accommodate gravitation as a gauge theory. In the first half of the article we identify a global structure required by the composite construction which not only exposes how the ordinary frame and tangent bundle expected in general relativity arise but provides the link or connection between these ordinary bundles and the gauge bundles of the composite bundle construction. In the second half of the article we discuss implications of this method of constructing gravity as a fiber bundle for the global structure of spacetime. We find that the underlying manifold of the composite bundle construction is expected to admit, not only a spin structure but also a string structure. As a consequence of our work we are able to extend past work on global structures of physically reasonable spacetime manifolds. It has been shown that in four spacetime dimensions, that if an oriented, Lorentzian, four dimensional manifold is stably casual that it is parallizable, and hence admits a spin structure which allows for chiral spinors. We may now add to this that such a manifold also admits a string structure.</description>

      <title>Domain wall interpretation of the PTA signal confronting black hole overproduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17841v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations have detected a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at nano-Hz frequencies, with Domain Wall networks (DWs) proposed as potential sources. To be cosmologically viable, they must annihilate before dominating the universe energy budget, thus generating a SGWB. While sub-horizon DWs shrink and decay rapidly, causality requires DWs with super-horizon size to continue growing until they reach the Hubble horizon. Those entering the latest can be heavier than a Hubble patch and collapse into Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). We conduct a Bayesian analysis of the PTA signal, interpreting it as an outcome of SGWB from DW networks, with a prior ensuring no PBH overproduction. Our findings indicate that DWs result in the production of solar-mass PBHs. The binary mergers occurring within these PBHs generate a second SGWB in the kilo-Hz domain which could be observable in on-going or planned Earth-based interferometers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a renormalization group approach based on the idea that the primary contribution to the Schwarzschild-like black hole spacetime arises from the value of the gravitational coupling. The latter depends on the distance from the origin and approaches its classical value in the far zone. However, at some stage, this approach introduces an arbitrariness in choosing an identification parameter. There are three approaches to the identification: the modified proper length (the Bonanno-Reuter metric), the Kretschmann scalar (the Hayward metric), and an iterative, and, in a sense, coordinate-independent procedure (Dymnikova solution). Using the WKB method, we calculated grey-body factors for the Standard Model massless test fields and their corresponding energy emission rates. For all of these solutions, we found that the intensity of Hawking radiation of massless fields is significantly suppressed by several or more orders once the quantum correction is taken into consideration. This indicates that the effect of suppression of the Hawking radiation may be appropriate to the quantum corrected black holes in asymptotically safe gravity in general and is independent on the particular choice of the identification parameter.</description>

Abstract: We uncover the solution space of a five dimensional geometry which we deem it as the direct counterpart of the Bianchi Type V cosmological model. We kinematically reduce the scale factor matrix and then, with an appropriate scaling and choice of time, we cast the spatial equations into a simple "Kasner" like form; thus revealing linear integrals of motion. Their number is enough so that, along with the quadratic constraint, it suffices to scan the entire space of solutions. The latter is revealed to be quite rich, containing cosmological solutions, some of which admit dimensional reduction asymptotically to four dimensions, Kundt spacetimes with vanishing type I (polynomial) curvature scalars and solutions describing periodic universes which behave like cosmological time crystals.</description>

Abstract: We extend the construction of Alcubierre-Nat\'{a}rio class of warp drives to an infinite class of spacetimes with similar properties. This is achieved by utilising the Martel-Poisson charts which closely resembles the Weak Painlev\'{e}-Gullstrand form for various background metrics (Mink, AdS, dS). The highlight of this construction is the non-flat intrinsic metric which in three dimensional spacetimes introduce conical singularities at the origin and in higher dimensions generates non-zero Ricci scalar for the spatial hypersurfaces away from the origin. We analyse the expansion/contraction of space and the (NEC) violations associated with these warp drives and find interesting scalings due to the global imprints of the conical defects. Other properties like tilting of light cones, event horizons and several generalisations are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Signatures of gravitational wave memory in the radiative process of entangled quantum probes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we examine entangled quantum probes in geodesic trajectories in a flat background with a gravitational wave (GW) burst. In particular, these quantum probes are prepared initially either in the symmetric or anti-symmetric Bell's states, and we study the radiative process as the GW burst passes. We split a generic GW burst into two profiles with and without memory. GW burst with (without) memory profiles have different (similar) asymptotic strains between early and late times. We observe that for eternal switching, there is a finite change in the collective atomic transition rate due to the memory part of the GW burst, while the contribution from the without memory counterpart vanishes. We also consider finite Gaussian switching and observe characteristic differences in the radiative process between the GW backgrounds with and without memory. Notably, if the Gaussian switching is peaked much later compared to the passing of GW, only the memory part contributes to the radiative process. Thus, although examined in a simplified set-up, our findings suggest the potential to distinguish bursts with and without GW memory based on the radiative process of entangled detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study cosmological spacetime configurations in $f(Q)$ gravity with nonvanishing symmetric teleparallel connections. It is known that the spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic connections can be classified into three sets. Focusing on two of those, we explore the stability of cosmological background evolution near the general relativity regime across radiation, matter, dark energy, and geometric dark energy dominated eras. Our results show that for the standard connection set 1 the general relativity regime can be realized in two ways and both exhibit stable behavior throughout all evolutionary epochs. Conversely, for the alternative connection set 2 the trivial general relativity limit is stable, while the nontrivial option exhibits stability during the radiation era and marginal stability during the matter era, but for the dark energy and geometric dark energy eras our results are inconclusive. Furthermore, we discuss the general conditions on the function $f(Q)$ that physically viable models should obey, and point out that for a generic $f(Q)$ the alternative connection sets 2 and 3 are prone to trigger a sudden singularity. This can happen even near the otherwise good looking general relativity regime, as we demonstrate by an explicit numerical example. Hence the alternative configurations could be problematic already on the background level.</description>

      <title>Can light-rings self-gravitate?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a spherically symmetric and static spacetime of a compact object, such as that of a Schwarzschild black hole, the light-ring is a 2-sphere where photons experience the only possible circular orbits. As a "Gedankenexperiment", we imagine an advanced civilisation able to populate the light-ring of a nonrotating black hole of mass $M$ with photons having a fine-tuned impact parameter that allows their orbits to be exactly circular with radius $r=3M$. As the number of photons in the light-ring increases in time, its mass will no longer be negligible and hence it will impact on the background spacetime, that is, it will "self-gravitate". We here consider two different routes to assign a nonzero mass to the light-ring that are either based on a discrete concentration of photons on a specific radial location or on a suitable distribution of photons in a given region. In both cases, and using the Einstein equations, we find that the inclusion of the energy from the accumulated photons leads to the generation of new light-rings. Such new light-rings can either appear at well-defined but discrete locations, or be fused in a well-defined region. In either case, we show that such light-ring configurations are dynamically unstable and a small perturbation, either via the inclusion of an additional photon onto the light-ring or via the absorption of a photon by the black hole, leads to a catastrophic destruction of the light-ring structures.</description>

      <title>A Study of thin relativistic viscose accretion disk around a distorted kerr black hole (DKB)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02955v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze a thin disk around the distorted Kerr black hole (DKB) within the framework of general relativity using an axisymmetric solution of the Einstein equations. We consider this accretion disk around the Kerr black hole in an external gravitational field up to the quadrupole moment and discuss the key aspects of black hole accretion disk theory. Our findings indicate that the presence of a quadrupole moment significantly influences the radiation emitted from the accretion disk. While the location of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) remains largely unchanged, the magnitude of the radiation flux, as well as the shape, orientation, and energy distribution of the accretion disk, are affected. The direction of distortion of the event horizon determines whether the disk becomes more oblate or prolate, impacting observed variations in maximum height, position, and temperature. Furthermore, the quadrupole moment alters the geometry of the black hole's spacetime, which can influence the efficiency of energy extraction from the black hole's spin, an important factor in powering emissions from accretion disks. We obtain dynamical quantities around a distorted rotating black hole disk. Additionally, we examine how rotation influences the dynamics of the DKB. We also investigate the effects of varying the viscosity coefficient on the behavior of the DKB.</description>

      <title>The Second-Level Preheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes two levels of preheating for the inflaton that is non-minimally coupled with gravity. The first level, later named by the quadratic regime, corresponds to the matter-dominated era and is responsible for draining the inflaton's energy density. The second level, which we will call the quartic regime, corresponds to the radiation-dominated era and is responsible for the reheating of the universe. We investigate the behavior of non-renormalizable higher dimension operators in both the quadratic and quartic regimes. In the quadratic regime, the preheating is also efficient, even though it is less than the lower dimension. On the other hand, the non-renormalizable higher dimension operators in the quartic regime are extremely inefficient. In our work, we also introduce a simple mechanism controlled by the characteristic momentum $\alpha$ to suppress the particle production during preheating. Additionally, we emphasized the significance of the small momentum of the particles produced during preheating for the abundance of primordial black holes. This result supports the efficient preheating in the quadratic regime. Finally, we evaluate two modes of the reheating temperature, which differ based on the preheating efficiency during the quadratic regime.</description>

      <title>Constraining accretion physics with gravitational waves from eccentric extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the evolution of eccentric, equatorial extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) immersed in the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei. We find that single gravitational-wave observations from these systems could provide measurements with ~ 10 % relative precision of, simultaneously, the disk viscosity and mass accretion rate of the central supermassive black hole. This is possible when the EMRI transitions, within the observation time, from supersonic to subsonic motion relative to the disk gas, for eccentricities e &gt; ~ 0.025-0.1. The estimate of the accretion rate would assist in the identification of the EMRI's host galaxy, or the observation of a direct electromagnetic counterpart, improving the chances of using these sources as cosmological sirens. Our work highlights the rich phenomenology of binary evolution in astrophysical environments and the need to improve the modelling and analysis of these systems for future gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Inferring additional physics through unmodelled signal reconstructions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameter estimation of gravitational wave data is often computationally expensive, requiring simplifying assumptions such as circularisation of binary orbits. Although, if included, the sub-dominant effects like orbital eccentricity may provide crucial insights into the formation channels of compact binary mergers. To address these challenges, we present a pipeline strategy leveraging minimally modelled waveform reconstruction to identify the presence of eccentricity in real time. Using injected signals, we demonstrate that ignoring eccentricity ($e_{\rm 20Hz} \gtrsim 0.1$) leads to significant biases in parameter recovery, including chirp mass estimates falling outside the 90% credible interval. Waveform reconstruction shows inconsistencies increase with eccentricity, and this behaviour is consistent for different mass ratios. Our method enables low-latency inferences of binary properties supporting targeted follow-up analyses and can be applied to identify any physical effect of measurable strength.</description>

      <title>Dwarf galaxies imply dark matter is heavier than $\mathbf{2.2 \times 10^{-21}} \, \mathbf{eV}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is widely established that a lower bound on the dark matter particle mass, $m$, can be obtained by demanding that the de Broglie wavelength in a given galaxy must be smaller than the virial radius of the galaxy, leading to $m\gtrsim 10^{-22}\text{ eV}$ when applied to typical dwarf galaxies. This lower limit has never been derived precisely or rigorously. We use stellar kinematical data for the Milky Way satellite galaxy Leo II to self-consistently reconstruct a statistical ensemble of dark matter wavefunctions and corresponding density profiles. By comparison to a data-driven, model-independent reconstruction, and using a variant of the maximum mean discrepancy as a statistical measure, we determine that a self-consistent description of dark matter in the local Universe requires $m&gt;2.2 \times 10^{-21}\,\mathrm{eV}\;\mathrm{(CL&gt;95\%)}$. This lower limit is free of any assumptions pertaining to cosmology, microphysics (including spin), or dynamics of dark matter, and only assumes that it is predominantly composed of a single bosonic particle species.</description>

      <title>Model-agnostic assessment of dark energy after DESI DR1 BAO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17252v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Baryon acoustic oscillation measurements by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (Data Release 1) have revealed exciting results that show evidence for dynamical dark energy at $\sim3\sigma$ when combined with cosmic microwave background and type Ia supernova observations. These measurements are based on the $w_0w_a$CDM model of dark energy. The evidence is less in other dark energy models such as the $w$CDM model. In order to avoid imposing a dark energy model, we reconstruct the distance measures and the equation of the state of dark energy independent of any dark energy model and driven only by observational data. Our results show that the model-agnostic (in terms of late-time models) evidence for dynamical dark energy from DESI is not significant. Our analysis also provides model-independent constraints on cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant and the matter-energy density parameter at present. Although we used CMB distance priors (not full CMB data) from a $\Lambda$CDM early-time model, our results remain largely similar for other cosmological models, provided that these models do not differ significantly from the standard model.</description>

      <title>Testing Gravity with Realistic Gravitational Waveforms in Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the effects of relaxing the assumption that gravitational waves composing the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) are uncorrelated between frequencies in analyses of the data from Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). While individual monochromatic plane waves are often a good approximation, a background composed of unresolved astrophysical sources cannot be exactly uncorrelated since an infinite plane wave propagates no temporal signal. We consider how relaxing this assumption allows us to extract potential information about modified dispersion relations and other fundamental physics questions, as both the group and phase velocity of waves become relevant. After developing the formalism we carry out simple Gaussian wavepacket examples and then consider more realistic waveforms, such as that from binary inspirals. When the frequency evolves only slowly across the PTA temporal baseline, the monochromatic assumption at an effective mean frequency remains a good approximation and we provide scaling relations that characterize its accuracy.</description>

      <title>Neutrino masses from large-scale structures: future sensitivity and theory dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the incoming years, cosmological surveys aim at measuring the sum of neutrino masses $\Sigma m_\nu$, complementing the determination of their mass ordering from laboratory experiments. In order to assess the full potential of large-scale structures (LSS), we employ state-of-the-art predictions from the effective field theory of LSS (EFTofLSS) at one loop to perform Fisher forecasts on the sensitivity (combining power spectrum and bispectrum) of ongoing and future surveys (DESI, MegaMapper) in combination with CMB measurements (Planck, Litebird and Stage-4). We find that the 1$\sigma$ sensitivity on $\Sigma m_\nu$ is expected to be 15 meV with Planck+DESI, and 7 meV with S4+MegaMapper, where $\sim 10\%$ and $30\%$ of the constraints are brought by the one-loop bispectrum respectively. To understand how robust are these bounds, we explore how they are relaxed when considering extensions to the standard model, dubbed `new physics'. We find that the shift induced on $\Sigma m_\nu$ by a $1\sigma$ shift on new physics parameters (we consider extra relativistic species, neutrino self-interactions, curvature or a time-evolving electron mass) could be $\mathcal O(10)$ meV for Planck+DESI, but it will be suppressed down to $\mathcal O(1)$ meV in S4+MegaMapper. Our study highlights the quantitative impact of including the bispectrum at one loop in the EFTofLSS, and the robustness of the sensitivity to $\Sigma m_\nu$ against potential new physics thanks to the synergy of cosmological probes.</description>

Abstract: We prove a conjectured relation between the energy-momentum and the displacement norm of superconformal defects. The proof completes earlier results, and shows that supersymmetry identifies two natural notions of brane tension in Anti-de Sitter gravity. As a byproduct we show that a modification of the energy-momentum tensor that removes the stress of static superconformal defects, ensures also that the radiation these emit obeys the Null Energy Condition. This sheds new light on the radiation-reaction problem for moving charges.</description>
