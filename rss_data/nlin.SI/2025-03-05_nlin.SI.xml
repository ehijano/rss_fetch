      <title>Singularity confinement and proliferation of tau functions for a general differential-difference Sawada-Kotera equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blending Painlev\'e property with singularity confinement for a general arbitrary order Sawada-Kotera differential-difference equation, we find a proliferation of ``tau-functions'' (coming from strictly confined patterns). However only one of these function enters into the Hirota bilinear form (the others give multi-linear expressions) but has specific relations with all others. We also discuss the case of two modifications of Sawada-Kotera showing that periodic patterns appear in addition to strictly confined ones. Fully discretisations and express method for computing algebraic entropy are discussed.</description>

      <title>Two-component nonlinear wave solutions of the sixth-order generalised Boussinesq-type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two different versions of cubic sixth-order generalised Boussinesq-type wave equations are considered in this study. A generalised perturbation reduction method is used to solve these equations, which allows the reduction of considered equations to coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations. Two-component nonlinear wave solutions are obtained. The profiles and parameters of these solutions for both nonlinear equations are presented and compared. These solutions coincide with the vector 0 \pi pulse of self-induced transparency, which was previously studied in several known nonlinear wave equations.</description>

      <title>The structures of simple Hurwitz numbers and monotone Hurwitz numbers with varying genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the structures of ordinary simple Hurwitz numbers and monotone Hurwitz numbers with varying genus. More precisely, we prove that when the ramification type is fixed and the genus is treated as a variable, the connected monotone Hurwitz number is a linear combination of products of exponentials and polynomials, and the ordinary simple Hurwitz number is a linear combination of exponentials. Using these structural properties, we also derive the large genus asymptotics of these two kinds of Hurwitz numbers. As a result, we prove one conjecture, and disprove another, both proposed by Do, He and Robertson.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Toda maps are transfer matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider entire matrix functions $A(z)$ taking values in $\operatorname{SL}(2,\mathbb C)$. These map pairs of Herglotz functions by acting pointwise as linear fractional transformations. The main examples of such Toda maps are provided by transfer matrices of differential and difference operators and by the cocycles associated with the classical integrable systems (Toda, KdV, etc.) on these operators. Here we consider polynomial matrix functions $A(z)$. We describe these in terms of a factorization, and we then prove that if $A$ induces a Toda map, then $A$ is essentially a transfer matrix.</description>

      <title>On the symmetries of the modified Emden-type equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.5826</link>
      <description>arXiv:1304.5826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an autonomous system the symmetries of the Lagrangian are embedded in the symmetries of the differential equation. Recently, it has been found that the modified Emden-type equations follow from non-standard Lagrangian functions which involve neither the kinetic energy term nor the potential function. By working with one such Lagrangian we have calculated the Lagrangian symmetries and explicitly demonstrated that, as in the case of standard Lagrangian functions, the variational symmetries of the non-standard Lagrangian are also included in the Lie symmetries of the differential equation.</description>

      <title>Variational Pattern Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address pattern selection problems in nonlinear interface dynamics by maximizing the entropy of the most probable (classical) scenario associated with the processes. This variational principle we applied to well-known selection problems in a Hele-Shaw cell: stationary Saffman-Taylor finger in a channel and self-similar finger in a wedge. The obtained results excellently agree with experiments. We also address the universal fjord opening angle. This principle complements a non-variational selection developed earlier. Surface tension is not needed for selection in both approaches, contrary to the common belief.</description>
