      <title>Diamond phase in space and possibility of its spectroscopic detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eventual presence of diamond carbon allotrope in space is discussed in numerous theoretical and experimental studies. The review summarises principal mechanisms of nanodiamond formation and experimental results of spectroscopic and structural investigations of nano- and microdiamonds extracted from meteorites. Size dependence of diamond spectroscopic properties is discussed. Infrared spectroscopy allows detection of C-H bonds on surfaces of hot nanodiamond grains. Spectroscopic observation of nitrogen-related point defects in nanodiamonds is very challenging; moreover, such defects were never observed in nanodiamonds from meteorites. At the same time, photoluminescence and, eventually, absorption, of some impurity-related defects, in particular, of silicon-vacancy (SiV) center, observed in real meteoritic nanodiamonds, opens a possibility of diamond detection in astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>White dwarf magnetospheres: Shielding volatile content of icy objects and implications for volatile pollution scarcity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. About 25% -- 50% of white dwarfs are found to be contaminated by heavy elements, which are believed to originate from external sources such as planetary materials. Elemental abundances suggest that most of the pollutants are rocky objects and only a small fraction of white dwarfs bear traces of volatile accretion.
  Aims. In order to account for the scarcity of volatile pollution, we investigate the role of the white dwarfs' magnetospheres in shielding the volatile content of icy objects.
  Methods. We estimated the volatile sublimation of inward-drifting exocomets. We assume the orbits of the exocomets are circularized by the Alfven wing drag that is effective for long-period comets.
  Results. Volatile material can sublimate outside the corotation radius and be shielded by the magnetic field. {The two conditions for this volatile-shielded mechanism are that the magnetosphere radius must be larger than the corotation radius and that the volatiles are depleted outside the corotation radius, which requires a sufficiently slow orbital circularization process.} We applied our model to nine white dwarfs with known rotational periods, magnetic fields, and atmosphere compositions. Our volatile-shielded model may explain the excess of volatile elements such as C and S in the disk relative to the white dwarf atmosphere in WD2326+049 (G29-38). Nevertheless, given the sensitivity of our model to the circularization process and material properties of icy objects, there remains considerable uncertainty in our results.
  Conclusions. Our work suggests a possible explanation for the scarcity of volatile-accretion signatures among white dwarfs. We also identify a correlation between the magnetic field strength, the spin period, and the composition of pollutants in white dwarf atmospheres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-term evolution of astrophysical systems is driven by a Hamiltonian that is independent of the fast angle. As this Hamiltonian may contain explicitly time-dependent parameters, the conservation of mechanical energy is not guaranteed in such systems. We derive how the semi-major axis evolves in these cases. We analyze two astrophysically interesting examples, those of the harmonic and quadrupole perturbations.</description>

      <title>NotPlaNET: Removing False Positives from Planet Hunters TESS with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentiating between real transit events and false positive signals in photometric time series data is a bottleneck in the identification of transiting exoplanets, particularly long-period planets. This differentiation typically requires visual inspection of a large number of transit-like signals to rule out instrumental and astrophysical false positives that mimic planetary transit signals. We build a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) to separate eclipsing binaries and other false positives from potential planet candidates, reducing the number of light curves that require human vetting. Our CNN is trained using the TESS light curves that were identified by Planet Hunters citizen scientists as likely containing a transit. We also include the background flux and centroid information. The light curves are visually inspected and labeled by project scientists and are minimally pre-processed, with only normalization and data augmentation taking place before training. The median percentage of contaminants flagged across the test sectors is 18% with a maximum of 37% and a minimum of 10%. Our model keeps 100% of the planets for 16 of the 18 test sectors, while incorrectly flagging one planet candidate (0.3%) for one sector and two (0.6%) for the remaining sector. Our method shows potential to reduce the number of light curves requiring manual vetting by up to a third with minimal misclassification of planet candidates.</description>

      <title>JWST-TST High Contrast: JWST/NIRCam observations of the young giant planet $\beta$ Pic b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first JWST/NIRCam observations of the directly-imaged gas giant exoplanet $\beta$ Pic b. Observations in six filters using NIRCam's round coronagraphic masks provide a high signal-to-noise detection of $\beta$ Pic b and the archetypal debris disk around $\beta$ Pic over a wavelength range of $\sim$1.7-5 $\mu$m. This paper focuses on the detection of $\beta$ Pic b and other potential point sources in the NIRCam data, following a paper by Rebollido et al. which presented the NIRCam and MIRI view of the debris disk around $\beta$ Pic. We develop and validate approaches for obtaining accurate photometry of planets in the presence of bright, complex circumstellar backgrounds. By simultaneously fitting the planet's PSF and a geometric model for the disk, we obtain planet photometry that is in good agreement with previous measurements from the ground. The NIRCam data supports the cloudy nature of $\beta$ Pic b's atmosphere and the discrepancy between its mass as inferred from evolutionary models and the dynamical mass reported in the literature. We further identify five additional localized sources in the data, but all of them are found to be background stars or galaxies based on their color or spatial extent. We can rule out additional planets in the disk midplane above 1 Jupiter mass outward of 2 arcsec ($\sim$40 au) and away from the disk midplane above 0.05 Jupiter masses outward of 4 arcsec ($\sim$80 au). The inner giant planet $\beta$ Pic c remains undetected behind the coronagraphic masks of NIRCam in our observations.</description>

      <title>Hunting for Polluted White Dwarfs and Other Treasures with Gaia XP Spectra and Unsupervised Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarfs (WDs) polluted by exoplanetary material provide the unprecedented opportunity to directly observe the interiors of exoplanets. However, spectroscopic surveys are often limited by brightness constraints, and WDs tend to be very faint, making detections of large populations of polluted WDs difficult. In this paper, we aim to increase considerably the number of WDs with multiple metals in their atmospheres. Using 96,134 WDs with Gaia DR3 BP/RP (XP) spectra, we constructed a 2D map using an unsupervised machine learning technique called Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to organize the WDs into identifiable spectral regions. The polluted WDs are among the distinct spectral groups identified in our map. We have shown that this selection method could potentially increase the number of known WDs with 5 or more metal species in their atmospheres by an order of magnitude. Such systems are essential for characterizing exoplanet diversity and geology.</description>

      <title>X-ray Irradiation of the Giant Planet Orbiting the T Tauri Star TAP 26</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new Chandra X-ray observations of TAP 26, a ~17 Myr old magnetically-active weak-lined T Tauri star that has been reported to host a massive planet in a 10.8 day orbit. At a separation of a = 0.097 AU the planet will be exposed to intense X-ray and UV radiation from the star. The first observation caught the star in a state of elevated X-ray emission with variability on a timescale of a few hours and an X-ray temperature kTx ~ 2 - 4 keV. Two subsequent observations 5-10 days later showed slow variability and a lower X-ray flux and temperature (kTx ~ 1 keV). We characterize the X-ray emission and estimate the X-ray ionization and heating rates that will need to be incorporated into realistic models of the planet's atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Multi spacecraft study with the Icarus model: Modelling the propagation of CMEs to Mercury and Earth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are the main drivers of the disturbances in interplanetary space. Understanding the CME interior magnetic structure is crucial for advancing space weather studies. Assessing the capabilities of a numerical heliospheric model is crucial, as understanding the nature and extent of its limitations can be used for improving the model and the space weather predictions based on it.
  The present paper aims to test the capabilities of the recently developed heliospheric model Icarus and the linear force-free spheromak model that has been implemented in it.
  To validate the Icarus space weather modeling tool, two CME events were selected that were observed by two spacecraft located near Mercury and Earth, respectively. This enables testing the heliospheric model computed with Icarus at two distant locations. The source regions for the CMEs were identified, and the CME parameters were determined and later optimized. Different adaptive mesh refinement levels were applied in the simulations to assess its performance by comparing the simulation results to in-situ measurements.
  The first CME event erupted on SOL2013-07-09T15:24. The modeled time series were in good agreement with the observations both at MESSENGER and ACE. The second CME event started on SOL2014-02-16T10:24 and was more complicated, as three CME interactions occurred in this event. It was impossible to recover the observed profiles without modeling the other two CMEs that were observed, one before the main CME and one afterward. For both CME studies, AMR level 3 was sufficient to reconstruct small-scale features near Mercury, while at Earth, AMR level 4 was necessary due to the radially stretched grid that was used.</description>

      <title>HD 110067 c has an aligned orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planetary systems in mean motion resonances hold a special place among the planetary population. They allow us to study planet formation in great detail as dissipative processes are thought to have played an important role in their existence. Additionally, planetary masses in bright resonant systems may be independently measured both by radial velocities (RVs) and transit timing variations (TTVs). In principle, they also allow us to quickly determine the inclination of all planets in the system, as for the system to be stable, they are likely all in coplanar orbits. To describe the full dynamical state of the system, we also need the stellar obliquity that provides the orbital alignment of a planet with respect to the spin of their host star and can be measured thanks to the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. It was recently discovered that HD 110067 harbours a system of six sub-Neptunes in resonant chain orbits. We here analyze an ESPRESSO high-resolution spectroscopic time series of HD 110067 during the transit of planet c. We find the orbit of HD 110067 c to be well aligned with sky projected obliquity $\lambda =6^{+24}_{-26}$ deg. This result is indicative that the current architecture of the system has been reached through convergent migration without any major disruptive events. Finally, we report transit-timing variation in this system as we find a significant offset of 19 $\pm$ 4 minutes in the center of the transit compared to the published ephemeris.</description>
