      <title>An Open Quantum Chemistry Property Database of 120 Kilo Molecules with 20 Million Conformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing computational chemistry, bringing unprecedented innovation and efficiency to the field. To further advance research and expedite progress, we introduce the Quantum Open Organic Molecular (QO2Mol) database -- a large-scale quantum chemistry dataset designed for professional and transformative research in organic molecular sciences under an open-source license. The database comprises 120,000 organic molecules and approximately 20 million conformers, encompassing 10 different elements (C, H, O, N, S, P, F, Cl, Br, I), with heavy atom counts exceeding 40. Utilizing the high-precision B3LYP/def2-SVP quantum mechanical level, each conformation was meticulously computed for quantum mechanical properties, including potential energy and forces. These molecules are derived from fragments of compounds in ChEMBL, ensuring their structural relevance to real-world compounds. Its extensive coverage of molecular structures and diverse elemental composition enables comprehensive studies of structure-property relationships, enhancing the accuracy and applicability of machine learning models in predicting molecular behaviors. The QO2Mol database and benchmark codes are available at https://github.com/saiscn/QO2Mol/ .</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of norbornadiene and quadricyclane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ground and excited state electronic structure of the molecular photoswitches quadricyclane and norbornadiene is examined qualitatively and quantitatively. A new custom basis set is introduced, optimised for efficient yet accurate calculations. A number of advanced multi-configurational and multi-reference electronic structure methods are evaluated, identifying those sufficiently accurate and efficient to be used in {\it{on-the-fly}} simulations of photoexcited dynamics. The key valence states participating in the isomerisation reaction are investigated, specifically mapping the important S$_1$/S$_0$ conical intersection that governs the non-radiative decay of the excited system. The powerful yet simple three-state valence model introduced here provides a suitable base for future computational exploration of the photodynamics of the substituted molecules suitable for \textit{e.g}.\ energy-storage applications.</description>

      <title>Polarizable Water Model with Ab Initio Neural Network Dynamic Charges and Spontaneous Charge Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating water accurately has been a challenge due to the complexity of describing polarization and intermolecular charge transfers. Quantum mechanical (QM) electronic structures provide an accurate description of polarization in response to local environments, which is nevertheless too expensive for large water systems. In this study, we have developed a polarizable water model integrating Charge Model 5 atomic charges at the level of second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory, predicted by an accurate and transferable Charge Neural Network (ChargeNN) model. The spontaneous intermolecular charge transfer has been explicitly accounted for, enabling a precise treatment of hydrogen bonds and out-of-plane polarization. Our ChargeNN water model successfully reproduces various properties of water in gas, liquid and solid phases. For example, ChargeNN correctly captures the hydrogen-bond stretching peak and bending-libration combination band, which are absent in the spectra using fixed charges, highlighting the significance of accurate polarization and charge transfers. Finally, the molecular dynamical simulations using ChargeNN for liquid water and a large water droplet with a $\sim$4.5 nm radius reveal that the strong interfacial electric fields are concurrently induced by the partial collapse of the hydrogen-bond network and surface-to-interior charge transfers. Our study paves the way for QM-informed force fields, aiming for large-scale molecular simulations with high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Physics-based inverse modeling of battery degradation with Bayesian methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To further improve Lithium-ion batteries (LiBs), a profound understanding of complex battery processes is crucial. Physical models offer understanding but are difficult to validate and parameterize. Therefore, automated machine-learning methods (ML) are necessary to evaluate models with experimental data. Bayesian methods, e.g., Bayesian optimization for likelihood-free inference (EP-BOLFI), stand out as they capture uncertainties in models and data while granting meaningful parameterization. An important topic is prolonging battery lifetime, which is limited by degradation, such as the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth. As a case study, we apply EP-BOLFI to parametrize SEI growth models with synthetic and real degradation data. EP-BOLFI allows for incorporating human expertise in the form of suitable feature selection, which improves the parametrization. We show that even under impeded conditions, we achieve correct parameterization with reasonable uncertainty quantification, needing less computational effort than standard Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Additionally, the physically reliable summary statistics show if parameters are strongly correlated and not unambiguously identifiable. Further, we investigate Bayesian alternately subsampled quadrature (BASQ), which calculates model probabilities, to confirm electron diffusion as the best theoretical model to describe SEI growth during battery storage.</description>

      <title>Binding memory of liquid molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the binding dynamics of liquid molecules is of fundamental importance in physical and life sciences. However, nanoscale fast dynamics pose great challenges for experimental characterization. Conventionally, the binding dynamics have been assumed to be memoryless. Here, we integrate large scale computer simulation, scaling theory, and real-time single particle tracking microscopy with high spatiotemporal precision to unveil a universal memory effect in the binding dynamics of liquid molecules. This binding memory can be quantified by a binding time autocorrelation function, whose power-law decay depends not only on the binding affinity, but also on the topological and materials properties of the surrounding environment. Context-dependent biomolecular binding memory is likely exploited by biological systems to regulate biochemical reactions and biophysical processes. Deciphering this binding memory offers a novel strategy to probe complex biological systems and advanced soft materials.</description>

      <title>The advent of fully variational quantum eigensolvers using a hybrid multiresolution approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In electronic structure theory, variational computing offers a valuable paradigm for the approximation of electronic ground states. However, for historical reasons, this principle is mostly restricted to model-chemistries in pre-defined fixed basis sets. Especially in quantum computation, these model-chemistries are far from an accurate description of the initial electronic Hamiltonian. Throwing down the gauntlet, we here demonstrate a fully variational approach to the electronic structure problem by variationally optimizing the orbitals representing the second quantized Hamiltonian alongside a quantum circuit that generates the many-electron wavefunction. To this end, the orbitals are represented within an adaptive multi-wavelet format, guaranteeing numerical precision. We then showcase explicit numerical protocols and highlight the quantum circuit's effects on determining the optimal orbital basis.</description>

      <title>In-architecture X-ray assisted C-Br dissociation for on-surface fabrication of diamondoid chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fabrication of well-defined, low-dimensional diamondoid-based materials is a promising approach for tailoring diamond properties such as superconductivity. On-surface self-assembly of halogenated diamondoids under ultrahigh vacuum conditions represents an effective strategy in this direction, enabling reactivity exploration and on-surface synthesis approaches. Here we demonstrate through scanning probe microscopy, time-of-flight mass spectrometry and photoelectron spectroscopy, that self-assembled layers of dibromodiamantanes on gold can be debrominated at atomic wavelengths (Al K$\alpha$ at 8.87 $\mathring{A}$ and Mg K$\alpha$ at 9.89 $\mathring{A}$) and low temperatures without affecting their well-defined arrangement. The resulting 'in-architecture' debromination enables the fabrication of diamantane chains from self-assembled precursors in close proximity, which is otherwise inaccessible through annealing on metal surfaces. Our work introduces a novel approach for the fabrication of nanodiamond chains, with significant implications for in-architecture and layer-by-layer synthesis.</description>

      <title>Temporal reversibility of reactive systems out of equilibrium: A strange paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The second law of thermodynamics stipulates that entropy production is non-negative in macroscopic systems, reaching zero at thermodynamic equilibrium. As a corollary, this implies that the state trajectory of macroscopic systems is inherently time-irreversible under out-of-equilibrium conditions. However, over the past half-century, various studies have demonstrated that this principle does not hold for the composition sample path of some isothermal reactive systems. Theoretical frameworks leading to this unexpected observation primarily focus on zero-dimensional (perfectly homogeneous) systems, which exclude the effect of local fluctuations. This oversimplification might account for the paradoxical theoretical prediction. In the absence of pertinent experimental data, this paper aims to investigate this phenomenon through microscopic simulations.</description>

      <title>Tuning the properties of metal surfaces by alloying: a DFT study of H2, O2, and H2O adsorption on Ni-Fe surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adsorption and dissociation of H$_2$, O$_2$, and H$_2$O on Ni-Fe alloys with variable Fe:Ni ratio are studied by means of Density Functional Theory calculations. The alloy composition deeply influences the thermochemistry of the adsorption and dissociation processes, with relevant implications to catalysis and electrocatalysis. For large concentration of Fe, the adsorption of H$_2$ is facilitated. On the contrary, O$_2$ is bound more strongly on Ni(111). The dissociation of all three molecules is favourable on all considered supports. However, the O$_2$ and H$_2$O dissociation is more favourable on NiFe alloys compared to Ni, while the dissociation of H$_2$ has a similar thermodynamic profile on pure Ni and Ni$_2$Fe alloy, and is less favourable on NiFe.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Superlattice Phase Diagram of Transition Metal Intercalation in Bilayer 2H-TaS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals hosts intercalated with transition metal (TM) ions exhibit a range of magnetic properties strongly influenced by the structural order of the intercalants. However, predictive computational models for the intercalant ordering phase diagram are lacking, complicating experimental pursuits to target key structural phases. Here we use Density Functional Theory (DFT) to construct a pairwise lattice model and Monte Carlo to determine its associated thermodynamic phase diagram. To circumvent the complexities of modeling magnetic effects, we use the diamagnetic ions Zn$^{2+}$ and Sc$^{3+}$ as computationally accessible proxies for divalent and trivalent species of interest (Fe$^{2+}$ and Cr$^{3+}$), which provide insights into the high-temperature thermodynamic phase diagram well above the paramagnetic transition temperature. We find that electrostatic coupling between intercalants is almost entirely screened, so the pairwise lattice model represents a coarse-grained charge density reorganization about the intercalated sites. The resulting phase diagram reveals that the entropically-favored $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ ordering and coexisting locally ordered $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ and $2 \times 2$ domains persist across a range of temperatures and intercalation densities. This occurs even at quarter filling of interstitial sites (corresponding to bulk stoichiometries of M$_{0.25}$TaS$_2$; M = intercalant ion) where a preference for long-range $2 \times 2$ order is typically assumed.</description>

      <title>Improved modularity and new features in ipie: Toward even larger AFQMC calculations on CPUs and GPUs at zero and finite temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ipie is a Python-based auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) package that has undergone substantial improvements since its initial release [J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2023, 19(1): 109-121]. This paper outlines the improved modularity and new capabilities implemented in ipie. We highlight the ease of incorporating different trial and walker types and the seamless integration of ipie with external libraries. We enable distributed Hamiltonian simulations of large systems that otherwise would not fit on single CPU node or GPU card. This development enabled us to compute the interaction energy of a benzene dimer with 84 electrons and 1512 orbitals with multi-GPUs. Using CUDA and cupy for NVIDIA GPUs, ipie supports GPU-accelerated multi-slater determinant trial wavefunctions [arXiv:2406.08314] to enable efficient and highly accurate simulations of large-scale systems. This allows for near-exact ground state energies of multi-reference clusters, [Cu$_2$O$_2$]$^{2+}$ and [Fe$_2$S$_2$(SCH$_3$)$_4$]$^{2-}$. We also describe implementations of free projection AFQMC, finite temperature AFQMC, AFQMC for electron--phonon systems, and automatic differentiation in AFQMC for calculating physical properties. These advancements position ipie as a leading platform for AFQMC research in quantum chemistry, facilitating more complex and ambitious computational method development and their applications.</description>

      <title>A Transformer Based Generative Chemical Language AI Model for Structural Elucidation of Organic Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For over half a century, computer-aided structural elucidation systems (CASE) for organic compounds have relied on complex expert systems with explicitly programmed algorithms. These systems are often computationally inefficient for complex compounds due to the vast chemical structural space that must be explored and filtered. In this study, we present a proof-of-concept transformer based generative chemical language artificial intelligence (AI) model, an innovative end-to-end architecture designed to replace the logic and workflow of the classic CASE framework for ultra-fast and accurate spectroscopic-based structural elucidation. Our model employs an encoder-decoder architecture and self-attention mechanisms, similar to those in large language models, to directly generate the most probable chemical structures that match the input spectroscopic data. Trained on ~ 102k IR, UV, and 1H NMR spectra, it performs structural elucidation of molecules with up to 29 atoms in just a few seconds on a modern CPU, achieving a top-15 accuracy of 83%. This approach demonstrates the potential of transformer based generative AI to accelerate traditional scientific problem-solving processes. The model's ability to iterate quickly based on new data highlights its potential for rapid advancements in structural elucidation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training interatomic potentials for spin-polarized systems continues to be a difficult task for the molecular modeling community. In this note, a proof-of-concept, random initial spin committee approach is proposed for obtaining the ground state of spin-polarized systems with a controllable degree of accuracy. The approach is tested on two toy models of elemental sulfur where the exact optimal spin configuration can be known. Machine-learning potentials are trained on the resulting data, and increasingly accurate fits with respect to the ground state are achieved, marking a step towards machine-learning force fields for general bulk spin-polarized systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many problems in linear algebra -- such as those arising from non-Hermitian physics and differential equations -- can be solved on a quantum computer by processing eigenvalues of the non-normal input matrices. However, the existing Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) framework is ill-suited to this task, as eigenvalues and singular values are different in general. We present a Quantum EigenValue Transformation (QEVT) framework for applying arbitrary polynomial transformations on eigenvalues of block-encoded non-normal operators, and a related Quantum EigenValue Estimation (QEVE) algorithm for operators with real spectra. QEVT has query complexity to the block encoding nearly recovering that of the QSVT for a Hermitian input, and QEVE achieves the Heisenberg-limited scaling for diagonalizable input matrices. As applications, we develop a linear differential equation solver with strictly linear time query complexity for average-case diagonalizable operators, as well as a ground state preparation algorithm that upgrades previous nearly optimal results for Hermitian Hamiltonians to diagonalizable matrices with real spectra. Underpinning our algorithms is an efficient method to prepare a quantum superposition of Faber polynomials, which generalize the nearly-best uniform approximation properties of Chebyshev polynomials to the complex plane. Of independent interest, we also develop techniques to generate $n$ Fourier coefficients with $\mathbf{O}(\mathrm{polylog}(n))$ gates compared to prior approaches with linear cost.</description>

Abstract: Constraining molecules in simulations (such as with constant bond lengths and/or angles) reduces their degrees of freedom (DoF), which in turn affects temperature calculations in those simulations. When local temperatures are measured, e.g. from a set of atoms in a subvolume or from velocities in one Cartesian direction, the result can appear to unphysically violate equipartition of the kinetic energy if the local DoF are not correctly calculated. Here we determine how to correctly calculate local temperatures from arbitrary Cartesian component kinetic energies, accounting for general geometric constraints, by self-consistently evaluating the DoF of atoms subjected to those constraints. The method is validated on a variety of test systems, including systems subject to a temperature gradient and those confined between walls. It is also shown to provide a sensitive test for the breakdown of kinetic energy equipartition caused by the approximate nature of numerical integration or insufficient equilibration times. As a practical demonstration, we show that kinetic energy equipartition between C and H atoms connected by rigid bonds can be violated even at the commonly-used time step of 2 fs, and that this equipartition violation appears to usefully indicate configurational overheating.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced Spin Centers in Photocatalytic Metal-Organic Framework UiO-66</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metal-Organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for advanced photocatalytically active materials. These porous crystalline compounds have large active surface areas and structural tunability and are thus highly competitive with oxides, the well-established material class for photocatalysis. However, due to their complex organic and coordination chemistry composition, photophysical mechanisms involved in the photocatalytic processes in MOFs are still not well understood. Employing electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (trPL), the fundamental processes of electron and hole generation are investigated, as well as capture events that lead to the formation of various radical species in UiO-66, an archetypical MOF photocatalyst. A manifold of photoinduced electron spin centers is detected, which is subsequently analyzed and identified with the help of density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. Under UV illumination, the symmetry, g-tensors and lifetimes of three distinct contributions are revealed: a surface O2-radical, a light-induced electron-hole pair, and a triplet exciton. Notably, the latter was found to emit (delayed) fluorescence. Our findings provide new insights into the photoinduced charge transfer processes, which are the basis of photocatalytic activity in UiO-66. This sets the stage for further studies on photogenerated spin centers in this and similar MOF materials.</description>
