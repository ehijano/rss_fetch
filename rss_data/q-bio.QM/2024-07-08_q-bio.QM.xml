      <title>Multi-Peptide: Multimodality Leveraged Language-Graph Learning of Peptide Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peptides are essential in biological processes and therapeutics. In this study, we introduce Multi-Peptide, an innovative approach that combines transformer-based language models with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict peptide properties. We combine PeptideBERT, a transformer model tailored for peptide property prediction, with a GNN encoder to capture both sequence-based and structural features. By employing Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), Multi-Peptide aligns embeddings from both modalities into a shared latent space, thereby enhancing the model's predictive accuracy. Evaluations on hemolysis and nonfouling datasets demonstrate Multi-Peptide's robustness, achieving state-of-the-art 86.185% accuracy in hemolysis prediction. This study highlights the potential of multimodal learning in bioinformatics, paving the way for accurate and reliable predictions in peptide-based research and applications.</description>

      <title>M5: A Whole Genome Bacterial Encoder at Single Nucleotide Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A linear attention mechanism is described to extend the context length of an encoder only transformer, called M5 in this report, to a multi-million single nucleotide resolution foundation model pretrained on bacterial whole genomes. The linear attention mechanism used approximates a full quadratic attention mechanism tightly and has a simple and lightweight implementation for the use case when the key-query embedding dimensionality is low. The M5-small model is entirely trained and tested on one A100 GPU with 40gb of memory up to 196K nucleotides during training and 2M nucleotides during testing. We test the performance of the M5-small model and record notable improvements in performance as whole genome bacterial sequence lengths are increased as well as demonstrating the stability of the full multi-head attention approximation used as sequence length is increased.</description>

      <title>Measure Adaptations and Rank Aggregation for the Selection of Clustering Methods and Sizes For Single Cell Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing efficiency of single-cell sequencing technology has provided biologists with ample cells to identify and differentiate, often through clustering. Heuristic approaches for clustering method choice have become more prevalent and could lead to inaccurate reports if statistical evaluation of the resulting clusters is omitted. During the advent of microarray data, a similar dilemma was addressed in literature through the provision of supervised and unsupervised measures, which were evaluated through Rank Aggregation. In this paper, these measures are adapted into the single-cell framework through a leave-one-out approach. Additionally, a scheme was created to utilize the information of cluster sizes by using their ranking to assign importance to the aggregation of methods, resulting in one table of methods ranked by cluster sizes. To demonstrate the ensemble of measures and scheme, five benchmark single-cell datasets were clustered with various methods at appropriate cluster sizes. We show that through rank aggregation and our importance scheme, our adapted measures select clustering methods that perform better at cluster sizes associated with true biological groups compared to those selected through traditional measures. For four of the five datasets and with internal measures alone, the rank aggregation scheme could correctly identify methods that performed the best at cluster sizes that match the original biological groups. We plan to package this ensemble of measures in the hopes to provide others with a tool to identify the best performing clustering methods and associated sizes for a variety of single cell datasets.</description>

      <title>Benchmark on Drug Target Interaction Modeling from a Structure Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prediction modeling of drug-target interactions is crucial to drug discovery and design, which has seen rapid advancements owing to deep learning technologies. Recently developed methods, such as those based on graph neural networks (GNNs) and Transformers, demonstrate exceptional performance across various datasets by effectively extracting structural information. However, the benchmarking of these novel methods often varies significantly in terms of hyperparameter settings and datasets, which limits algorithmic progress. In view of these, we conduct a comprehensive survey and benchmark for drug-target interaction modeling from a structure perspective, via integrating tens of explicit (i.e., GNN-based) and implicit (i.e., Transformer-based) structure learning algorithms. To this end, we first unify the hyperparameter setting within each class of structure learning methods. Moreover, we conduct a macroscopical comparison between these two classes of encoding strategies as well as the different featurization techniques that inform molecules' chemical and physical properties. We then carry out the microscopical comparison between all the integrated models across the six datasets, via comprehensively benchmarking their effectiveness and efficiency. Remarkably, the summarized insights from the benchmark studies lead to the design of model combos. We demonstrate that our combos can achieve new state-of-the-art performance on various datasets associated with cost-effective memory and computation.

      <title>A Unified Intracellular pH Landscape with SITE-pHorin: a Quantum-Entanglement-Enhanced pH Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An accurate map of intracellular organelle pH is crucial for comprehending cellular metabolism and organellar functions. However, a unified intracellular pH spectrum using a single probe is still lack. Here, we developed a novel quantum entanglement-enhanced pH-sensitive probe called SITE-pHorin, which featured a wide pH-sensitive range and ratiometric quantitative measurement capabilities. Subsequently, we measured the pH of various organelles and their sub-compartments, including mitochondrial sub-spaces, Golgi stacks, endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, peroxisomes, and endosomes in COS-7 cells. For the long-standing debate on mitochondrial compartments pH, we measured the pH of mitochondrial cristae as 6.60 \pm 0.40, the pH of mitochondrial intermembrane space as 6.95 \pm 0.30, and two populations of mitochondrial matrix pH at approximately 7.20 \pm 0.27 and 7.50 \pm 0.16, respectively. Notably, the lysosome pH exhibited a single, narrow Gaussian distribution centered at 4.79 \pm 0.17. Furthermore, quantum chemistry computations revealed that both the deprotonation of the residue Y182 and the discrete curvature of deformed benzene ring in chromophore are both necessary for the quantum entanglement mechanism of SITE-pHorin. Intriguingly, our findings reveal an accurate pH gradient (0.6-0.9 pH unit) between mitochondrial cristae and matrix, suggesting prior knowledge about \Delta pH (0.4-0.6) and mitochondrial proton motive force (pmf) are underestimated.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking structure-based three-dimensional molecular generative models using GenBench3D: ligand conformation quality matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) deep molecular generative models offer the advantage of goal-directed generation based on 3D-dependent properties, such as binding affinity for structure-based design within binding pockets. Traditional benchmarks created to evaluate SMILES or molecular graphs generators, such as GuacaMol or MOSES, are limited to evaluate 3D generators as they do not assess the quality of the generated molecular conformation. In this work, we hence developed GenBench3D, which implements a new benchmark for models producing molecules within a binding pocket. Our main contribution is the Validity3D metric, evaluating the conformation quality using the likelihood of bond lengths and valence angles based on reference values observed in the Cambridge Structural Database. The LiGAN, 3D-SBDD, Pocket2Mol, TargetDiff, DiffSBDD and ResGen models were benchmarked. We show that only between 0% and 11% of generated molecules have valid conformations. Performing local relaxation of generated molecules in the pocket considerably improved the Validity3D for all models by a minimum increase of 40%. For LiGAN, 3D-SBDD, or TargetDiff, the set of valid relaxed molecules shows on average higher Vina score (i.e. worse) than the set of raw generated molecules, indicating that the binding affinity of raw generated molecules might be overestimated. Using the other scoring functions, that give higher importance to ligand strain, only yield improved scores when using valid relaxed molecules. Using valid relaxed molecules, TargetDiff and Pocket2Mol show better median Vina, Glide and Gold PLP scores than other models. We have publicly released GenBench3D on GitHub for broader use: https://github.com/bbaillif/genbench3d</description>

      <title>Variational and Explanatory Neural Networks for Encoding Cancer Profiles and Predicting Drug Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human cancers present a significant public health challenge and require the discovery of novel drugs through translational research. Transcriptomics profiling data that describes molecular activities in tumors and cancer cell lines are widely utilized for predicting anti-cancer drug responses. However, existing AI models face challenges due to noise in transcriptomics data and lack of biological interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VETE (Variational and Explanatory Transcriptomics Encoder), a novel neural network framework that incorporates a variational component to mitigate noise effects and integrates traceable gene ontology into the neural network architecture for encoding cancer transcriptomics data. Key innovations include a local interpretability-guided method for identifying ontology paths, a visualization tool to elucidate biological mechanisms of drug responses, and the application of centralized large scale hyperparameter optimization. VETE demonstrated robust accuracy in cancer cell line classification and drug response prediction. Additionally, it provided traceable biological explanations for both tasks and offers insights into the mechanisms underlying its predictions. VETE bridges the gap between AI-driven predictions and biologically meaningful insights in cancer research, which represents a promising advancement in the field.</description>

      <title>MotifbreakR v2: extended capability and database integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MotifbreakR is a software tool that scans genetic variants against position weight matrices of transcription factors (TF) to determine the potential for the disruption of TF binding at the site of the variant. It leverages the Bioconductor suite of software packages and annotations to operate across a diverse array of genomes and motif databases. Initially developed to interrogate the effect of single nucleotide variants (common and rare SNVs) on potential TF binding sites, in motifbreakR v2, we have updated the functionality. New features include the ability to query other types of more complex genetic variants, such as short insertions and deletions (indels). This function allows modeling a more extensive array of variants that may have more significant effects on TF binding. Additionally, while TF binding is based partly on sequence preference, predictions of TF binding based on sequence preference alone can indicate many more potential binding events than observed. Adding information from DNA-binding sequencing datasets lends confidence to motif disruption prediction by demonstrating TF binding in cell lines and tissue types. Therefore, motifbreakR implements querying the ReMap2022 database for evidence that a TF matching the disrupted motif binds over the disrupting variant. Finally, in motifbreakR, in addition to the existing interface, we have implemented an R/Shiny graphical user interface to simplify and enhance access to researchers with different skill sets.</description>

      <title>CS3: Cascade SAM for Sperm Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated sperm morphology analysis plays a crucial role in the assessment of male fertility, yet its efficacy is often compromised by the challenges in accurately segmenting sperm images. Existing segmentation techniques, including the Segment Anything Model(SAM), are notably inadequate in addressing the complex issue of sperm overlap-a frequent occurrence in clinical samples. Our exploratory studies reveal that modifying image characteristics by removing sperm heads and easily segmentable areas, alongside enhancing the visibility of overlapping regions, markedly enhances SAM's efficiency in segmenting intricate sperm structures. Motivated by these findings, we present the Cascade SAM for Sperm Segmentation (CS3), an unsupervised approach specifically designed to tackle the issue of sperm overlap. This method employs a cascade application of SAM to segment sperm heads, simple tails, and complex tails in stages. Subsequently, these segmented masks are meticulously matched and joined to construct complete sperm masks. In collaboration with leading medical institutions, we have compiled a dataset comprising approximately 2,000 unlabeled sperm images to fine-tune our method, and secured expert annotations for an additional 240 images to facilitate comprehensive model assessment. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance of CS3 compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Novel Optimization Techniques for Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new optimization algorithm that is well suited for solving parameter estimation problems. We call our new method cubic regularized Newton with affine scaling (CRNAS). In contrast to so-called first-order methods which rely solely on the gradient of the objective function, our method utilizes the Hessian of the objective. As a result it is able to focus on points satisfying the second-order optimality conditions, as opposed to first-order methods that simply converge to critical points. This is an important feature in parameter estimation problems where the objective function is often non-convex and as a result there can be many critical points making it is near impossible to identify the global minimum. An important feature of parameter estimation in mathematical models of biological systems is that the parameters are constrained by either physical constraints or prior knowledge. We use an affine scaling approach to handle a wide class of constraints. We establish that CRNAS identifies a point satisfying $\epsilon$-approximate second-order optimality conditions within $O(\epsilon^{-3/2})$ iterations. Finally, we compare CRNAS with MATLAB's optimization solver fmincon on three different test problems. These test problems all feature mixtures of heterogeneous populations, a problem setting that CRNAS is particularly well-suited for. Our numerical simulations show CRNAS has favorable performance, performing comparable if not better than fmincon in accuracy and computational cost for most of our examples.</description>

      <title>LinearAlifold: Linear-Time Consensus Structure Prediction for RNA Alignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.14794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the consensus structure of a set of aligned RNA homologs is a convenient method to find conserved structures in an RNA genome, which has many applications including viral diagnostics and therapeutics. However, the most commonly used tool for this task, RNAalifold, is prohibitively slow for long sequences, due to a cubic scaling with the sequence length, taking over a day on 400 SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-related genomes (~30,000nt). We present LinearAlifold, a much faster alternative that scales linearly with both the sequence length and the number of sequences, based on our work LinearFold that folds a single RNA in linear time. Our work is orders of magnitude faster than RNAalifold (0.7 hours on the above 400 genomes, or ~36$\times$ speedup) and achieves higher accuracies when compared to a database of known structures. More interestingly, LinearAlifold's prediction on SARS-CoV-2 correlates well with experimentally determined structures, substantially outperforming RNAalifold. Finally, LinearAlifold supports two energy models (Vienna and BL*) and four modes: minimum free energy (MFE), maximum expected accuracy (MEA), ThreshKnot, and stochastic sampling, each of which takes under an hour for hundreds of SARS-CoV variants. Our resource is at: https://github.com/LinearFold/LinearAlifold (code) and http://linearfold.org/linear-alifold (server).</description>

      <title>FakET: Simulating Cryo-Electron Tomograms with Neural Style Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02011v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In cryo-electron microscopy, accurate particle localization and classification are imperative. Recent deep learning solutions, though successful, require extensive training data sets. The protracted generation time of physics-based models, often employed to produce these data sets, limits their broad applicability. We introduce FakET, a method based on Neural Style Transfer, capable of simulating the forward operator of any cryo transmission electron microscope. It can be used to adapt a synthetic training data set according to reference data producing high-quality simulated micrographs or tilt-series. To assess the quality of our generated data, we used it to train a state-of-the-art localization and classification architecture and compared its performance with a counterpart trained on benchmark data. Remarkably, our technique matches the performance, boosts data generation speed 750 times, uses 33 times less memory, and scales well to typical transmission electron microscope detector sizes. It leverages GPU acceleration and parallel processing. The source code is available at https://github.com/paloha/faket.</description>

      <title>Gene Set Summarization using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular biologists frequently interpret gene lists derived from high-throughput experiments and computational analysis. This is typically done as a statistical enrichment analysis that measures the over- or under-representation of biological function terms associated with genes or their properties, based on curated assertions from a knowledge base (KB) such as the Gene Ontology (GO). Interpreting gene lists can also be framed as a textual summarization task, enabling the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), potentially utilizing scientific texts directly and avoiding reliance on a KB.
  We developed SPINDOCTOR (Structured Prompt Interpolation of Natural Language Descriptions of Controlled Terms for Ontology Reporting), a method that uses GPT models to perform gene set function summarization as a complement to standard enrichment analysis. This method can use different sources of gene functional information: (1) structured text derived from curated ontological KB annotations, (2) ontology-free narrative gene summaries, or (3) direct model retrieval.
  We demonstrate that these methods are able to generate plausible and biologically valid summary GO term lists for gene sets. However, GPT-based approaches are unable to deliver reliable scores or p-values and often return terms that are not statistically significant. Crucially, these methods were rarely able to recapitulate the most precise and informative term from standard enrichment, likely due to an inability to generalize and reason using an ontology. Results are highly nondeterministic, with minor variations in prompt resulting in radically different term lists. Our results show that at this point, LLM-based methods are unsuitable as a replacement for standard term enrichment analysis and that manual curation of ontological assertions remains necessary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language-molecule models have emerged as an exciting direction for molecular discovery and understanding. However, training these models is challenging due to the scarcity of molecule-language pair datasets. At this point, datasets have been released which are 1) small and scraped from existing databases, 2) large but noisy and constructed by performing entity linking on the scientific literature, and 3) built by converting property prediction datasets to natural language using templates. In this document, we detail the $\textit{L+M-24}$ dataset, which has been created for the Language + Molecules Workshop shared task at ACL 2024. In particular, $\textit{L+M-24}$ is designed to focus on three key benefits of natural language in molecule design: compositionality, functionality, and abstraction.</description>

Abstract: Advances in experimental techniques allow the collection of high-space-and-time resolution data that track individual motile entities over time. This poses the question of how to use these data to efficiently and effectively calibrate motion models. However, typical mathematical models often overlook the inherent aspects of data collection, such as the discreteness and the experimental noise of the measured locations. In this paper, we focus on velocity-jump models suitable to describe single-agent motion in one spatial dimension, characterised by successive Markovian transitions between a finite network of $n$ states, each with a specified velocity and a fixed rate of switching to every other state. Since the problem of finding the exact distributions of discrete-time noisy data is generally intractable, we derive a series of approximations for the data distributions and compare them to in-silico data generated by the models using four example network structures. These comparisons suggest that the approximations are accurate given sufficiently infrequent state switching, or equivalently, a sufficiently high data collection frequency. Moreover, for infrequent switching, the PDFs comparisons highlight the importance of accounting for the correlation between subsequent measured locations, due to the likely permanence in the state visited in the previous measurement. The approximate distributions computed can be used for fast parameter inference and model selection between a range of velocity-jump models using single-agent tracking data.</description>
