      <title>Optimizing properties on the critical rigidity manifold of underconstrained central-force networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our goal is to develop a design framework for multifunctional mechanical metamaterials that can tune their rigidity while optimizing other desired properties. Towards this goal, we first demonstrate that underconstrained central force networks possess a critical rigidity manifold of codimension one in the space of their physical constraints. We describe how the geometry of this manifold generates a natural parameterization in terms of the states of self-stress, and then use this parameterization to numerically generate disordered network structures that are on the critical rigidity manifold and also optimize various objective functions, such as maximizing the bulk stiffness under dilation, or minimizing length variance to find networks that can be self-assembled from equal-length parts. This framework can be used to design mechanical metamaterials that can tune their rigidity and also exhibit other desired properties.</description>

      <title>Coarse-graining bistability with the Martini force field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An increasing interest in molecular structures whose long term dynamics resemble those of bistable mechanical systems promotes the the search of possible candidates that may operate as two-state switching units. Of particular interest are the systems that are capable to exhibit such bistable effects as spontaneous vibrations, stochastic resonance and spontaneous synchronization. Previously, in all-atom molecular dynamics simulations it has been demonstrated that short pyridine-furan springs show these bistable phenomena. In this article we introduce a coarse-grained model of such springs and investigate the possibility to observe the bistability effects, such as spontaneous vibrations, in such model. Our findings allow the studies of short pyridine-furan springs at large time an length scales and open field for further computational research of large bistable systems.</description>

      <title>Natural convection in the cytoplasm: Theoretical predictions of buoyancy-driven flows inside a cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of temperature gradients within eukaryotic cells has been postulated as a source of natural convection in the cytoplasm, i.e. bulk fluid motion as a result of temperature-difference-induced density gradients. Recent computations have predicted that a temperature differential of $\Delta T \approx 1$ K between the cell nucleus and the cell membrane could be strong enough to drive significant intracellular material transport. We use numerical computations and theoretical calculations to revisit this problem in order to further understand the impact of temperature gradients on flow generation and advective transport within cells. Surprisingly, our computations yield flows that are an order of magnitude weaker than those obtained previously for the same relative size and position of the nucleus with respect to the cell membrane. To understand this discrepancy, we develop a semi-analytical solution of the convective flow inside a model cell using a bi-spherical coordinate framework, for the case of an axisymmetric cell geometry (i.e. when the displacement of the nucleus from the cell centre is aligned with gravity). We also calculate exact solutions for the flow when the nucleus is located concentrically inside the cell. The results from both theoretical analyses agree with our numerical results, thus providing a robust estimate of the strength of cytoplasmic natural convection and demonstrating that these are much weaker than previously predicted. Finally, we investigate the ability of the aforementioned flows to redistribute solute within a cell. Our calculations reveal that, in all but unrealistic cases, cytoplasmic convection has a negligible contribution toward enhancing the diffusion-dominated mass transfer of cellular material.</description>

      <title>Conformational degrees of freedom and stability of splay-bend ordering in the limit of a very strong planar anchoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.08109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the self-organization of flexible planar trimer particles on a structureless surface. The molecules are made up of two mesogenic units linked by a spacer, all of which are modeled as hard needles of the same length. Each molecule can dynamically adopt two conformational states: an achiral bent-shaped (cis-) and a chiral zigzag (trans-) one.
  Using constant pressure Monte Carlo simulations and Onsager-type density functional theory (DFT), we show that the system consisting of these molecules exhibits a rich spectrum of (quasi-)liquid crystalline phases. The most interesting observation is the identification of stable smectic splay-bend ($S_{SB}$) and chiral smectic A ($S_A^*$) phases. The $S_{SB}$ phase is also stable in the limit, where only cis-conformers are allowed. The second phase occupying a considerable portion of the phase diagram is $S_A^*$ with chiral layers, where the chirality of the neighboring layers is of opposite sign. The study of the average fractions of the trans- and cis-conformers in various phases shows that while in the isotropic phase all fractions are equally populated, the $S_A^*$ phase is dominated by chiral conformers (zigzag), but the achiral conformers win in the smectic splay-bend phase. To clarify the possibility of stabilization of the nematic splay bend ($N_{SB}$) phase for trimers, the free energy of the $N_{SB}$ and $S_{SB}$ phases is calculated within DFT for the cis-conformers, for densities where simulations show stable $S_{SB}$. It turns out that the $N_{SB}$ phase is unstable away from the phase transition to the nematic phase, and its free energy is always higher than that of $S_{SB}$, down to the transition to the nematic phase, although the difference in free energies becomes extremely small when approaching the transition.</description>

      <title>Data-driven quasiconformal morphodynamic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal imaging of biological epithelial structures yields shape data at discrete time points, leading to a natural question: how can we reconstruct the most likely path of growth patterns consistent with these discrete observations? We present a physically plausible framework to solve this inverse problem by creating a framework that generalises quasiconformal maps to quasiconformal flows. By allowing for the spatio-temporal variation of the shear and dilatation fields during the growth process, subject to regulatory mechanisms, we are led to a type of generalised Ricci flow. When guided by observational data associated with surface shape as a function of time, this leads to a constrained optimization problem. Deploying our data-driven algorithmic approach to the shape of insect wings, leaves and even sculpted faces, we show how optimal quasiconformal flows allow us to characterise the morphogenesis of a range of surfaces.</description>
