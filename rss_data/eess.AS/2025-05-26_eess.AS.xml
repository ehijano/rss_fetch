      <title>From Weak Labels to Strong Results: Utilizing 5,000 Hours of Noisy Classroom Transcripts with Minimal Accurate Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in speech recognition has relied on models trained on vast amounts of labeled data. However, classroom Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) faces the real-world challenge of abundant weak transcripts paired with only a small amount of accurate, gold-standard data. In such low-resource settings, high transcription costs make re-transcription impractical. To address this, we ask: what is the best approach when abundant inexpensive weak transcripts coexist with limited gold-standard data, as is the case for classroom speech data? We propose Weakly Supervised Pretraining (WSP), a two-step process where models are first pretrained on weak transcripts in a supervised manner, and then fine-tuned on accurate data. Our results, based on both synthetic and real weak transcripts, show that WSP outperforms alternative methods, establishing it as an effective training methodology for low-resource ASR in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Voicing Personas: Rewriting Persona Descriptions into Style Prompts for Controllable Text-to-Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework to control voice style in prompt-based, controllable text-to-speech systems by leveraging textual personas as voice style prompts. We present two persona rewriting strategies to transform generic persona descriptions into speech-oriented prompts, enabling fine-grained manipulation of prosodic attributes such as pitch, emotion, and speaking rate. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods enhance the naturalness, clarity, and consistency of synthesized speech. Finally, we analyze implicit social biases introduced by LLM-based rewriting, with a focus on gender. We underscore voice style as a crucial factor for persona-driven AI dialogue systems.</description>

      <title>Speechless: Speech Instruction Training Without Speech for Low Resource Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of voice assistants powered by large language models (LLM) has highlighted a need for speech instruction data to train these systems. Despite the abundance of speech recognition data, there is a notable scarcity of speech instruction data, which is essential for fine-tuning models to understand and execute spoken commands. Generating high-quality synthetic speech requires a good text-to-speech (TTS) model, which may not be available to low resource languages. Our novel approach addresses this challenge by halting synthesis at the semantic representation level, bypassing the need for TTS. We achieve this by aligning synthetic semantic representations with the pre-trained Whisper encoder, enabling an LLM to be fine-tuned on text instructions while maintaining the ability to understand spoken instructions during inference. This simplified training process is a promising approach to building voice assistant for low-resource languages.</description>

      <title>Private kNN-VC: Interpretable Anonymization of Converted Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speaker anonymization seeks to conceal a speaker's identity while preserving the utility of their speech. The achieved privacy is commonly evaluated with a speaker recognition model trained on anonymized speech. Although this represents a strong attack, it is unclear which aspects of speech are exploited to identify the speakers. Our research sets out to unveil these aspects. It starts with kNN-VC, a powerful voice conversion model that performs poorly as an anonymization system, presumably because of prosody leakage. To test this hypothesis, we extend kNN-VC with two interpretable components that anonymize the duration and variation of phones. These components increase privacy significantly, proving that the studied prosodic factors encode speaker identity and are exploited by the privacy attack. Additionally, we show that changes in the target selection algorithm considerably influence the outcome of the privacy attack.</description>

      <title>Audio-to-Audio Emotion Conversion With Pitch And Duration Style Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a pair of source and reference speech recordings, audio-to-audio (A2A) style transfer involves the generation of an output speech that mimics the style characteristics of the reference while preserving the content and speaker attributes of the source. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, termed as A2A Zero-shot Emotion Style Transfer (A2A-ZEST), that enables the transfer of reference emotional attributes to the source while retaining its speaker and speech contents. The A2A-ZEST framework consists of an analysis-synthesis pipeline, where the analysis module decomposes speech into semantic tokens, speaker representations, and emotion embeddings. Using these representations, a pitch contour estimator and a duration predictor are learned. Further, a synthesis module is designed to generate speech based on the input representations and the derived factors. This entire paradigm of analysis-synthesis is trained purely in a self-supervised manner with an auto-encoding loss. For A2A emotion style transfer, the emotion embedding extracted from the reference speech along with the rest of the representations from the source speech are used in the synthesis module to generate the style translated speech. In our experiments, we evaluate the converted speech on content/speaker preservation (w.r.t. source) as well as on the effectiveness of the emotion style transfer (w.r.t. reference). The proposal, A2A-ZEST, is shown to improve over other prior works on these evaluations, thereby enabling style transfer without any parallel training data. We also illustrate the application of the proposed work for data augmentation in emotion recognition tasks.</description>

      <title>Source Separation of Small Classical Ensembles: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Musical (MSS) source separation of western popular music using non-causal deep learning can be very effective. In contrast, MSS for classical music is an unsolved problem. Classical ensembles are harder to separate than popular music because of issues such as the inherent greater variation in the music; the sparsity of recordings with ground truth for supervised training; and greater ambiguity between instruments. The Cadenza project has been exploring MSS for classical music. This is being done so music can be remixed to improve listening experiences for people with hearing loss. To enable the work, a new database of synthesized woodwind ensembles was created to overcome instrumental imbalances in the EnsembleSet. For the MSS, a set of ConvTasNet models was used with each model being trained to extract a string or woodwind instrument. ConvTasNet was chosen because it enabled both causal and non-causal approaches to be tested. Non-causal approaches have dominated MSS work and are useful for recorded music, but for live music or processing on hearing aids, causal signal processing is needed. The MSS performance was evaluated on the two small datasets (Bach10 and URMP) of real instrument recordings where the ground-truth is available. The performances of the causal and non-causal systems were similar. Comparing the average Signal-to-Distortion (SDR) of the synthesized validation set (6.2 dB causal; 6.9 non-causal), to the real recorded evaluation set (0.3 dB causal, 0.4 dB non-causal), shows that mismatch between synthesized and recorded data is a problem. Future work needs to either gather more real recordings that can be used for training, or to improve the realism and diversity of the synthesized recordings to reduce the mismatch...</description>

      <title>Effects of auditory distance cues and reverberation on spatial perception and listening strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial hearing, the brain's ability to use auditory cues to identify the origin of sounds, is crucial for everyday listening. While simplified paradigms have advanced the understanding of spatial hearing, their lack of ecological validity limits their applicability to real-life conditions. This study aims to address this gap by investigating the effects of listener movement, reverberation, and distance on localisation accuracy in a more ecologically valid context. Participants performed active localisation tasks with no specific instructions on listening strategy, in either anechoic or reverberant conditions. The results indicate that the head movements were more frequent in reverberant environments, suggesting an adaptive strategy to mitigate uncertainty in binaural cues due to reverberation. While distance did not affect the listening strategy, it influenced the localisation performance. Our outcomes suggest that listening behaviour is adapted depending on the current acoustic conditions to support an effective perception of the space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence raises concerns related to energy consumption, copyright infringement and creative atrophy. We show that randomly initialized recurrent neural networks can produce arpeggios and low-frequency oscillations that are rich and configurable. In contrast to end-to-end music generation that aims to replace musicians, our approach expands their creativity while requiring no data and much less computational power.

      <title>Improving endpoint detection in end-to-end streaming ASR for conversational speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ASR endpointing (EP) plays a major role in delivering a good user experience in products supporting human or artificial agents in human-human/machine conversations. Transducer-based ASR (T-ASR) is an end-to-end (E2E) ASR modelling technique preferred for streaming. A major limitation of T-ASR is delayed emission of ASR outputs, which could lead to errors or delays in EP. Inaccurate EP will cut the user off while speaking, returning incomplete transcript while delays in EP will increase the perceived latency, degrading the user experience. We propose methods to improve EP by addressing delayed emission along with EP mistakes. To address the delayed emission problem, we introduce an end-of-word token at the end of each word, along with a delay penalty. The EP delay is addressed by obtaining a reliable frame-level speech activity detection using an auxiliary network. We apply the proposed methods on Switchboard conversational speech corpus and evaluate it against a delay penalty method.</description>

      <title>Impact of Frame Rates on Speech Tokenizer: A Case Study on Mandarin and English</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The speech tokenizer plays a crucial role in recent speech tasks, generally serving as a bridge between speech signals and language models. While low-frame-rate codecs are widely employed as speech tokenizers, the impact of frame rates on speech tokens remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate how varying frame rates affect speech tokenization by examining Mandarin and English, two typologically distinct languages. We encode speech at different frame rates and evaluate the resulting semantic tokens in the speech recognition task. Our findings reveal that frame rate variations influence speech tokenization differently for each language, highlighting the interplay between frame rates, phonetic density, and language-specific acoustic features. The results provide insights into optimizing frame rate selection for speech tokenizers, with implications for automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech, and other speech-related applications.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Implicitly Learn to See and Hear Just By Reading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a fascinating find: By training an auto-regressive LLM model on text tokens, the text model inherently develops internally an ability to understand images and audio, thereby developing the ability to see and hear just by reading. Popular audio and visual LLM models fine-tune text LLM models to give text output conditioned on images and audio embeddings. On the other hand, our architecture takes in patches of images, audio waveforms or tokens as input. It gives us the embeddings or category labels typical of a classification pipeline. We show the generality of text weights in aiding audio classification for datasets FSD-50K and GTZAN. Further, we show this working for image classification on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST, as well on image patches. This pushes the notion of text-LLMs learning powerful internal circuits that can be utilized by activating necessary connections for various applications rather than training models from scratch every single time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17233v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music auto-tagging is essential for organizing and discovering music in extensive digital libraries. While foundation models achieve exceptional performance in this domain, their outputs often lack interpretability, limiting trust and usability for researchers and end-users alike. In this work, we present an interpretable framework for music auto-tagging that leverages groups of musically meaningful multimodal features, derived from signal processing, deep learning, ontology engineering, and natural language processing. To enhance interpretability, we cluster features semantically and employ an expectation maximization algorithm, assigning distinct weights to each group based on its contribution to the tagging process. Our method achieves competitive tagging performance while offering a deeper understanding of the decision-making process, paving the way for more transparent and user-centric music tagging systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthesizing expressive Japanese character speech poses unique challenges due to pitch-accent sensitivity and stylistic variability. This paper benchmarks two open-source text-to-speech models--VITS and Style-BERT-VITS2 JP Extra (SBV2JE)--on in-domain, character-driven Japanese speech. Using three character-specific datasets, we evaluate models across naturalness (mean opinion and comparative mean opinion score), intelligibility (word error rate), and speaker consistency. SBV2JE matches human ground truth in naturalness (MOS 4.37 vs. 4.38), achieves lower WER, and shows slight preference in CMOS. Enhanced by pitch-accent controls and a WavLM-based discriminator, SBV2JE proves effective for applications like language learning and character dialogue generation, despite higher computational demands.</description>

      <title>VoxRAG: A Step Toward Transcription-Free RAG Systems in Spoken Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce VoxRAG, a modular speech-to-speech retrieval-augmented generation system that bypasses transcription to retrieve semantically relevant audio segments directly from spoken queries. VoxRAG employs silence-aware segmentation, speaker diarization, CLAP audio embeddings, and FAISS retrieval using L2-normalized cosine similarity. We construct a 50-query test set recorded as spoken input by a native English speaker. Retrieval quality was evaluated using LLM-as-a-judge annotations. For very relevant segments, cosine similarity achieved a Recall@10 of 0.34. For somewhat relevant segments, Recall@10 rose to 0.60 and nDCG@10 to 0.27, highlighting strong topical alignment. Answer quality was judged on a 0--2 scale across relevance, accuracy, completeness, and precision, with mean scores of 0.84, 0.58, 0.56, and 0.46 respectively. While precision and retrieval quality remain key limitations, VoxRAG shows that transcription-free speech-to-speech retrieval is feasible in RAG systems.</description>

      <title>LLM-based Generative Error Correction for Rare Words with Synthetic Data and Phonetic Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative error correction (GER) with large language models (LLMs) has emerged as an effective post-processing approach to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance. However, it often struggles with rare or domain-specific words due to limited training data. Furthermore, existing LLM-based GER approaches primarily rely on textual information, neglecting phonetic cues, which leads to over-correction. To address these issues, we propose a novel LLM-based GER approach that targets rare words and incorporates phonetic information. First, we generate synthetic data to contain rare words for fine-tuning the GER model. Second, we integrate ASR's N-best hypotheses along with phonetic context to mitigate over-correction. Experimental results show that our method not only improves the correction of rare words but also reduces the WER and CER across both English and Japanese datasets.</description>

      <title>UniTTS: An end-to-end TTS system without decoupling of acoustic and semantic information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of multi-codebook neutral audio codecs such as Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) and Group Vector Quantization (GVQ) has significantly advanced Large-Language-Model (LLM) based Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems. These codecs are crucial in separating semantic and acoustic information while efficiently harnessing semantic priors. However, since semantic and acoustic information cannot be fully aligned, a significant drawback of these methods when applied to LLM-based TTS is that large language models may have limited access to comprehensive audio information. To address this limitation, we propose DistilCodec and UniTTS, which collectively offer the following advantages: 1) This method can distill a multi-codebook audio codec into a single-codebook audio codec with 32,768 codes while achieving a near 100\% utilization. 2) As DistilCodec does not employ a semantic alignment scheme, a large amount of high-quality unlabeled audio (such as audiobooks with sound effects, songs, etc.) can be incorporated during training, further expanding data diversity and broadening its applicability. 3) Leveraging the comprehensive audio information modeling of DistilCodec, we integrated three key tasks into UniTTS's pre-training framework: audio modality autoregression, text modality autoregression, and speech-text cross-modal autoregression. This allows UniTTS to accept interleaved text and speech/audio prompts while substantially preserving LLM's text capabilities. 4) UniTTS employs a three-stage training process: Pre-Training, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Alignment. Source code and model checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/IDEA-Emdoor-Lab/UniTTS and https://github.com/IDEA-Emdoor-Lab/DistilCodec.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Effect of Segmentation and Vocabulary Size on Speech Tokenization for Speech Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of speech tokenization is to transform a speech signal into a sequence of discrete representations, serving as the foundation for speech language models (SLMs). While speech tokenization has many options, their effect on the performance of SLMs remains unclear. This paper investigates two key aspects of speech tokenization: the segmentation width and the cluster size of discrete units. First, we segment speech signals into fixed/variable widths and pooled representations. We then train K-means models in multiple cluster sizes. Through the evaluation on zero-shot spoken language understanding benchmarks, we find the positive effect of moderately coarse segmentation and bigger cluster size. Notably, among the best-performing models, the most efficient one achieves a 50% reduction in training data and a 70% decrease in training runtime. Our analysis highlights the importance of combining multiple tokens to enhance fine-grained spoken language understanding.</description>

      <title>Reverse-Speech-Finder: A Neural Network Backtracking Architecture for Generating Alzheimer's Disease Speech Samples and Improving Diagnosis Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces Reverse-Speech-Finder (RSF), a groundbreaking neural network backtracking architecture designed to enhance Alzheimer's Disease (AD) diagnosis through speech analysis. Leveraging the power of pre-trained large language models, RSF identifies and utilizes the most probable AD-specific speech markers, addressing both the scarcity of real AD speech samples and the challenge of limited interpretability in existing models. RSF's unique approach consists of three core innovations: Firstly, it exploits the observation that speech markers most probable of predicting AD, defined as the most probable speech-markers (MPMs), must have the highest probability of activating those neurons (in the neural network) with the highest probability of predicting AD, defined as the most probable neurons (MPNs). Secondly, it utilizes a speech token representation at the input layer, allowing backtracking from MPNs to identify the most probable speech-tokens (MPTs) of AD. Lastly, it develops an innovative backtracking method to track backwards from the MPNs to the input layer, identifying the MPTs and the corresponding MPMs, and ingeniously uncovering novel speech markers for AD detection. Experimental results demonstrate RSF's superiority over traditional methods such as SHAP and Integrated Gradients, achieving a 3.5% improvement in accuracy and a 3.2% boost in F1-score. By generating speech data that encapsulates novel markers, RSF not only mitigates the limitations of real data scarcity but also significantly enhances the robustness and accuracy of AD diagnostic models. These findings underscore RSF's potential as a transformative tool in speech-based AD detection, offering new insights into AD-related linguistic deficits and paving the way for more effective non-invasive early intervention strategies.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Mitigation Strategies for Catastrophic Forgetting in End-to-End Training of Spoken Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-to-end training of Spoken Language Models (SLMs) commonly involves adapting pre-trained text-based Large Language Models (LLMs) to the speech modality through multi-stage training on diverse tasks such as ASR, TTS and spoken question answering (SQA). Although this multi-stage continual learning equips LLMs with both speech understanding and generation capabilities, the substantial differences in task and data distributions across stages can lead to catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge is lost. This paper investigates catastrophic forgetting and evaluates three mitigation strategies-model merging, discounting the LoRA scaling factor, and experience replay to balance knowledge retention with new learning. Results show that experience replay is the most effective, with further gains achieved by combining it with other methods. These findings provide insights for developing more robust and efficient SLM training pipelines.</description>

      <title>What You Read Isn't What You Hear: Linguistic Sensitivity in Deepfake Speech Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-speech technologies have enabled realistic voice generation, fueling audio-based deepfake attacks such as fraud and impersonation. While audio anti-spoofing systems are critical for detecting such threats, prior work has predominantly focused on acoustic-level perturbations, leaving the impact of linguistic variation largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the linguistic sensitivity of both open-source and commercial anti-spoofing detectors by introducing transcript-level adversarial attacks. Our extensive evaluation reveals that even minor linguistic perturbations can significantly degrade detection accuracy: attack success rates surpass 60% on several open-source detector-voice pairs, and notably one commercial detection accuracy drops from 100% on synthetic audio to just 32%. Through a comprehensive feature attribution analysis, we identify that both linguistic complexity and model-level audio embedding similarity contribute strongly to detector vulnerability. We further demonstrate the real-world risk via a case study replicating the Brad Pitt audio deepfake scam, using transcript adversarial attacks to completely bypass commercial detectors. These results highlight the need to move beyond purely acoustic defenses and account for linguistic variation in the design of robust anti-spoofing systems. All source code will be publicly available.</description>

Abstract: This work presents a suite of fine-tuned Whisper models for Swedish, trained on a dataset of unprecedented size and variability for this mid-resourced language. As languages of smaller sizes are often underrepresented in multilingual training datasets, substantial improvements in performance can be achieved by fine-tuning existing multilingual models, as shown in this work. This work reports an overall improvement across model sizes compared to OpenAI's Whisper evaluated on Swedish. Most notably, we report an average 47% reduction in WER comparing our best performing model to OpenAI's whisper-large-v3, in evaluations across FLEURS, Common Voice, and NST.</description>

      <title>MEGADance: Mixture-of-Experts Architecture for Genre-Aware 3D Dance Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music-driven 3D dance generation has attracted increasing attention in recent years, with promising applications in choreography, virtual reality, and creative content creation. Previous research has generated promising realistic dance movement from audio signals. However, traditional methods underutilize genre conditioning, often treating it as auxiliary modifiers rather than core semantic drivers. This oversight compromises music-motion synchronization and disrupts dance genre continuity, particularly during complex rhythmic transitions, thereby leading to visually unsatisfactory effects. To address the challenge, we propose MEGADance, a novel architecture for music-driven 3D dance generation. By decoupling choreographic consistency into dance generality and genre specificity, MEGADance demonstrates significant dance quality and strong genre controllability. It consists of two stages: (1) High-Fidelity Dance Quantization Stage (HFDQ), which encodes dance motions into a latent representation by Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) and reconstructs them with kinematic-dynamic constraints, and (2) Genre-Aware Dance Generation Stage (GADG), which maps music into the latent representation by synergistic utilization of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism with Mamba-Transformer hybrid backbone. Extensive experiments on the FineDance and AIST++ dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of MEGADance both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>JALMBench: Benchmarking Jailbreak Vulnerabilities in Audio Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio Language Models (ALMs) have made significant progress recently. These models integrate the audio modality directly into the model, rather than converting speech into text and inputting text to Large Language Models (LLMs). While jailbreak attacks on LLMs have been extensively studied, the security of ALMs with audio modalities remains largely unexplored. Currently, there is a lack of an adversarial audio dataset and a unified framework specifically designed to evaluate and compare attacks and ALMs. In this paper, we present JALMBench, the \textit{first} comprehensive benchmark to assess the safety of ALMs against jailbreak attacks. JALMBench includes a dataset containing 2,200 text samples and 51,381 audio samples with over 268 hours. It supports 12 mainstream ALMs, 4 text-transferred and 4 audio-originated attack methods, and 5 defense methods. Using JALMBench, we provide an in-depth analysis of attack efficiency, topic sensitivity, voice diversity, and attack representations. Additionally, we explore mitigation strategies for the attacks at both the prompt level and the response level.</description>

      <title>CosyVoice 3: Towards In-the-wild Speech Generation via Scaling-up and Post-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our prior works, we introduced a scalable streaming speech synthesis model, CosyVoice 2, which integrates a large language model (LLM) and a chunk-aware flow matching (FM) model, and achieves low-latency bi-streaming speech synthesis and human-parity quality. Despite these advancements, CosyVoice 2 exhibits limitations in language coverage, domain diversity, data volume, text formats, and post-training techniques. In this paper, we present CosyVoice 3, an improved model designed for zero-shot multilingual speech synthesis in the wild, surpassing its predecessor in content consistency, speaker similarity, and prosody naturalness. Key features of CosyVoice 3 include: 1) A novel speech tokenizer to improve prosody naturalness, developed via supervised multi-task training, including automatic speech recognition, speech emotion recognition, language identification, audio event detection, and speaker analysis. 2) A new differentiable reward model for post-training applicable not only to CosyVoice 3 but also to other LLM-based speech synthesis models. 3) Dataset Size Scaling: Training data is expanded from ten thousand hours to one million hours, encompassing 9 languages and 18 Chinese dialects across various domains and text formats. 4) Model Size Scaling: Model parameters are increased from 0.5 billion to 1.5 billion, resulting in enhanced performance on our multilingual benchmark due to the larger model capacity. These advancements contribute significantly to the progress of speech synthesis in the wild. We encourage readers to listen to the demo at https://funaudiollm.github.io/cosyvoice3.</description>

      <title>TEDI: Trustworthy and Ethical Dataset Indicators to Analyze and Compare Dataset Documentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dataset transparency is a key enabler of responsible AI, but insights into multimodal dataset attributes that impact trustworthy and ethical aspects of AI applications remain scarce and are difficult to compare across datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce Trustworthy and Ethical Dataset Indicators (TEDI) that facilitate the systematic, empirical analysis of dataset documentation. TEDI encompasses 143 fine-grained indicators that characterize trustworthy and ethical attributes of multimodal datasets and their collection processes. The indicators are framed to extract verifiable information from dataset documentation. Using TEDI, we manually annotated and analyzed over 100 multimodal datasets that include human voices. We further annotated data sourcing, size, and modality details to gain insights into the factors that shape trustworthy and ethical dimensions across datasets. We find that only a select few datasets have documented attributes and practices pertaining to consent, privacy, and harmful content indicators. The extent to which these and other ethical indicators are addressed varies based on the data collection method, with documentation of datasets collected via crowdsourced and direct collection approaches being more likely to mention them. Scraping dominates scale at the cost of ethical indicators, but is not the only viable collection method. Our approach and empirical insights contribute to increasing dataset transparency along trustworthy and ethical dimensions and pave the way for automating the tedious task of extracting information from dataset documentation in future.</description>

      <title>Toward Optimal ANC: Establishing Mutual Information Lower Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) algorithms aim to suppress unwanted acoustic disturbances by generating anti-noise signals that destructively interfere with the original noise in real time. Although recent deep learning-based ANC algorithms have set new performance benchmarks, there remains a shortage of theoretical limits to rigorously assess their improvements. To address this, we derive a unified lower bound on cancellation performance composed of two components. The first component is information-theoretic: it links residual error power to the fraction of disturbance entropy captured by the anti-noise signal, thereby quantifying limits imposed by information-processing capacity. The second component is support-based: it measures the irreducible error arising in frequency bands that the cancellation path cannot address, reflecting fundamental physical constraints. By taking the maximum of these two terms, our bound establishes a theoretical ceiling on the Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE) attainable by any ANC algorithm. We validate its tightness empirically on the NOISEX dataset under varying reverberation times, demonstrating robustness across diverse acoustic conditions.</description>

      <title>DualTalk: Dual-Speaker Interaction for 3D Talking Head Conversations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18096v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In face-to-face conversations, individuals need to switch between speaking and listening roles seamlessly. Existing 3D talking head generation models focus solely on speaking or listening, neglecting the natural dynamics of interactive conversation, which leads to unnatural interactions and awkward transitions. To address this issue, we propose a new task -- multi-round dual-speaker interaction for 3D talking head generation -- which requires models to handle and generate both speaking and listening behaviors in continuous conversation. To solve this task, we introduce DualTalk, a novel unified framework that integrates the dynamic behaviors of speakers and listeners to simulate realistic and coherent dialogue interactions. This framework not only synthesizes lifelike talking heads when speaking but also generates continuous and vivid non-verbal feedback when listening, effectively capturing the interplay between the roles. We also create a new dataset featuring 50 hours of multi-round conversations with over 1,000 characters, where participants continuously switch between speaking and listening roles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the naturalness and expressiveness of 3D talking heads in dual-speaker conversations. We recommend watching the supplementary video: https://ziqiaopeng.github.io/dualtalk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the speech signal, acoustic landmarks identify times when the acoustic manifestations of the linguistically motivated distinctive features are most salient. Acoustic landmarks have been widely applied in various domains, including speech recognition, speech depression detection, clinical analysis of speech abnormalities, and the detection of disordered speech. However, there is currently no dataset available that provides precise timing information for landmarks, which has been proven to be crucial for downstream applications involving landmarks. In this paper, we selected the most useful acoustic landmarks based on previous research and annotated the TIMIT dataset with them, based on a combination of phoneme boundary information and manual inspection. Moreover, previous landmark extraction tools were not open source or benchmarked, so to address this, we developed an open source Python-based landmark extraction tool and established a series of landmark detection baselines. The first of their kinds, the dataset with landmark precise timing information, landmark extraction tool and baselines are designed to support a wide variety of future research.</description>

      <title>SpeechT-RAG: Reliable Depression Detection in LLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation Using Speech Timing Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly adopted for health-related tasks, yet their performance in depression detection remains limited when relying solely on text input. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) typically enhances LLM capabilities, our experiments indicate that traditional text-based RAG systems struggle to significantly improve depression detection accuracy. This challenge stems partly from the rich depression-relevant information encoded in acoustic speech patterns information that current text-only approaches fail to capture effectively. To address this limitation, we conduct a systematic analysis of temporal speech patterns, comparing healthy individuals with those experiencing depression. Based on our findings, we introduce Speech Timing-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation, SpeechT-RAG, a novel system that leverages speech timing features for both accurate depression detection and reliable confidence estimation. This integrated approach not only outperforms traditional text-based RAG systems in detection accuracy but also enhances uncertainty quantification through a confidence scoring mechanism that naturally extends from the same temporal features. Our unified framework achieves comparable results to fine-tuned LLMs without additional training while simultaneously addressing the fundamental requirements for both accuracy and trustworthiness in mental health assessment.</description>

      <title>Impact of Microphone Array Mismatches to Learning-based Replay Speech Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the generalization of a multi-channel learning-based replay speech detector, which employs adaptive beamforming and detection, across different microphone arrays. In general, deep neural network-based microphone array processing techniques generalize poorly to unseen array types, i.e., showing a significant training-test mismatch of performance. We employ the ReMASC dataset to analyze performance degradation due to inter- and intra-device mismatches, assessing both single- and multi-channel configurations. Furthermore, we explore fine-tuning to mitigate the performance loss when transitioning to unseen microphone arrays. Our findings reveal that array mismatches significantly decrease detection accuracy, with intra-device generalization being more robust than inter-device. However, fine-tuning with as little as ten minutes of target data can effectively recover performance, providing insights for practical deployment of replay detection systems in heterogeneous automatic speaker verification environments.</description>

      <title>SAKURA: On the Multi-hop Reasoning of Large Audio-Language Models Based on Speech and Audio Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) extend the large language models with multimodal understanding in speech, audio, etc. While their performances on speech and audio-processing tasks are extensively studied, their reasoning abilities remain underexplored. Particularly, their multi-hop reasoning, the ability to recall and integrate multiple facts, lacks systematic evaluation. Existing benchmarks focus on general speech and audio-processing tasks, conversational abilities, and fairness but overlook this aspect. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAKURA, a benchmark assessing LALMs' multi-hop reasoning based on speech and audio information. Results show that LALMs struggle to integrate speech/audio representations for multi-hop reasoning, even when they extract the relevant information correctly, highlighting a fundamental challenge in multimodal reasoning. Our findings expose a critical limitation in LALMs, offering insights and resources for future research.</description>

      <title>U-SAM: An audio language Model for Unified Speech, Audio, and Music Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The text generation paradigm for audio tasks has opened new possibilities for unified audio understanding. However, existing models face significant challenges in achieving a comprehensive understanding across diverse audio types, such as speech, general audio events, and music. Furthermore, their exclusive reliance on cross-entropy loss for alignment often falls short, as it treats all tokens equally and fails to account for redundant audio features, leading to weaker cross-modal alignment. To deal with the above challenges, this paper introduces U-SAM, an advanced audio language model that integrates specialized encoders for speech, audio, and music with a pre-trained large language model (LLM). U-SAM employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE) projector for task-aware feature fusion, dynamically routing and integrating the domain-specific encoder outputs. Additionally, U-SAM incorporates a Semantic-Aware Contrastive Loss Module, which explicitly identifies redundant audio features under language supervision and rectifies their semantic and spectral representations to enhance cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that U-SAM consistently outperforms both specialized models and existing audio language models across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, it exhibits emergent capabilities on unseen tasks, showcasing its generalization potential. Code is available (https://github.com/Honee-W/U-SAM/).</description>

      <title>Towards Holistic Evaluation of Large Audio-Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With advancements in large audio-language models (LALMs), which enhance large language models (LLMs) with auditory capabilities, these models are expected to demonstrate universal proficiency across various auditory tasks. While numerous benchmarks have emerged to assess LALMs' performance, they remain fragmented and lack a structured taxonomy. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive survey and propose a systematic taxonomy for LALM evaluations, categorizing them into four dimensions based on their objectives: (1) General Auditory Awareness and Processing, (2) Knowledge and Reasoning, (3) Dialogue-oriented Ability, and (4) Fairness, Safety, and Trustworthiness. We provide detailed overviews within each category and highlight challenges in this field, offering insights into promising future directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey specifically focused on the evaluations of LALMs, providing clear guidelines for the community. We will release the collection of the surveyed papers and actively maintain it to support ongoing advancements in the field.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Deep Metric Learning for Cross-Modal Audio-Text Alignment in Open-Vocabulary Keyword Spotting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For text enrollment-based open-vocabulary keyword spotting (KWS), acoustic and text embeddings are typically compared at either the phoneme or utterance level. To facilitate this, we optimize acoustic and text encoders using deep metric learning (DML), enabling direct comparison of multi-modal embeddings in a shared embedding space. However, the inherent heterogeneity between audio and text modalities presents a significant challenge. To address this, we propose Modality Adversarial Learning (MAL), which reduces the domain gap in heterogeneous modality representations. Specifically, we train a modality classifier adversarially to encourage both encoders to generate modality-invariant embeddings. Additionally, we apply DML to achieve phoneme-level alignment between audio and text, and conduct extensive comparisons across various DML objectives. Experiments on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and LibriPhrase datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Active Speech Enhancement: Active Speech Denoising Decliping and Deveraberation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for active sound modification: Active Speech Enhancement (ASE). While Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) algorithms focus on suppressing external interference, ASE goes further by actively shaping the speech signal -- both attenuating unwanted noise components and amplifying speech-relevant frequencies -- to improve intelligibility and perceptual quality. To enable this, we propose a novel Transformer-Mamba-based architecture, along with a task-specific loss function designed to jointly optimize interference suppression and signal enrichment. Our method outperforms existing baselines across multiple speech processing tasks -- including denoising, dereverberation, and declipping -- demonstrating the effectiveness of active, targeted modulation in challenging acoustic environments.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Low-Resource Language and Instruction Following Capabilities of Audio Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio language models process audio inputs using textual prompts for tasks like speech recognition and audio captioning. Although built on multilingual pre-trained components, most are trained primarily on English, limiting their usability for other languages. This paper evaluates audio language models on Thai, a low-resource language, and finds that they lack emergent cross-lingual abilities despite their multilingual foundations. To address this, we explore data mixtures that optimize audio language models for both a target language and English while integrating audio comprehension and speech instruction-following into a unified model. Our experiments provide insights into improving instruction-following in low-resource languages by balancing language-specific and multilingual training data. The proposed model, Typhoon-Audio, significantly outperforms existing open-source models and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art Gemini-1.5-Pro in both English and Thai.</description>

      <title>NBM: an Open Dataset for the Acoustic Monitoring of Nocturnal Migratory Birds in Europe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03633v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The persisting threats on migratory bird populations highlight the urgent need for effective monitoring techniques that could assist in their conservation. Among these, passive acoustic monitoring is an essential tool, particularly for nocturnal migratory species that are difficult to track otherwise. This work presents the Nocturnal Bird Migration (NBM) dataset, a collection of 13,359 annotated vocalizations from 117 species of the Western Palearctic. The dataset includes precise time and frequency annotations, gathered by dozens of bird enthusiasts across France, enabling novel downstream acoustic analysis. In particular, we prove the utility of this database by training an original two-stage deep object detection model tailored for the processing of audio data. While allowing the precise localization of bird calls in spectrograms, this model shows competitive accuracy on the 45 main species of the dataset with state-of-the-art systems trained on much larger audio collections. These results highlight the interest of fostering similar open-science initiatives to acquire costly but valuable fine-grained annotations of audio files. All data and code are made openly available.</description>

      <title>Does Your Voice Assistant Remember? Analyzing Conversational Context Recall and Utilization in Voice Interaction Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-turn voice interaction models have improved user-model communication. However, while closed-source models effectively retain and recall past utterances, whether open-source models share this ability remains unexplored. To fill this gap, we systematically evaluate how well open-source interaction models utilize past utterances using ContextDialog, a benchmark we proposed for this purpose. Our findings show that speech-based models have more difficulty than text-based ones, especially when recalling information conveyed in speech, and even with retrieval-augmented generation, models still struggle with questions about past utterances. These insights highlight key limitations in open-source models and suggest ways to improve memory retention and retrieval robustness.</description>

      <title>CrossMuSim: A Cross-Modal Framework for Music Similarity Retrieval with LLM-Powered Text Description Sourcing and Mining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Music similarity retrieval is fundamental for managing and exploring relevant content from large collections in streaming platforms. This paper presents a novel cross-modal contrastive learning framework that leverages the open-ended nature of text descriptions to guide music similarity modeling, addressing the limitations of traditional uni-modal approaches in capturing complex musical relationships. To overcome the scarcity of high-quality text-music paired data, this paper introduces a dual-source data acquisition approach combining online scraping and LLM-based prompting, where carefully designed prompts leverage LLMs' comprehensive music knowledge to generate contextually rich descriptions. Exten1sive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significant performance improvements over existing benchmarks through objective metrics, subjective evaluations, and real-world A/B testing on the Huawei Music streaming platform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Voice Conversion research in recent times has increasingly focused on improving the zero-shot capabilities of existing methods. Despite remarkable advancements, current architectures still tend to struggle in zero-shot cross-lingual settings. They are also often unable to generalize for speakers of unseen languages and accents. In this paper, we adopt a simple yet effective approach that combines discrete speech representations from self-supervised models with a non-autoregressive Diffusion-Transformer based conditional flow matching speech decoder. We show that this architecture allows us to train a voice-conversion model in a purely textless, self-supervised fashion. Our technique works without requiring multiple encoders to disentangle speech features. Our model also manages to excel in zero-shot cross-lingual settings even for unseen languages.
