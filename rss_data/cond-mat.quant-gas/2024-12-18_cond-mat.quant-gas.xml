      <title>Dynamical Aharonov-Bohm cages and tight meson confinement in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-loop gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the finite-density phases of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) of interconnected loops and dynamical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges. The gauge-invariant Wilson terms, accounting for the magnetic flux threading each loop, correspond to simple two-body Ising interactions in this setting. Such terms control the interference of charges tunneling around the loops, leading to dynamical Aharonov-Bohm (AB) cages that are delimited by loops threaded by a $\pi$-flux. The latter can be understood as $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortices, the analog of visons in two dimensional LGTs, which become mobile by adding quantum fluctuations through an external electric field. In contrast to a semi-classical regime of static and homogeneous AB cages, the mobile visons can self-assemble leading to AB cages of different lengths depending on the density of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges and the interplay of magnetic and electric terms. Inside these cages, the individual charges get confined into tightly-bound charge-neutral pairs, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ analogue of mesons. Depending on the region of parameter space, these tightly-bound mesons can propagate within dilute AB-dimers that virtually expand and contract, or else move by virtually stretching and compressing an electric field string. Both limits lead to a Luttinger liquid described by a constrained integrable model. This phase is separated from an incompressible Mott insulator where mesons belong to closely-packed AB-trimers. In light of recent trapped-ion experiments for a single $\mathbb{Z}_2$ loop, these phases could be explored in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Efficiently measuring $d$-wave pairing and beyond in quantum gas microscopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity is among the most important problems in physics, for which quantum simulation can provide new insights. However, it remains challenging to characterize superconductivity in existing cold-atom quantum simulation platforms. Here, we introduce a protocol for measuring a broad class of observables in fermionic quantum gas microscopes, including long-range superconducting pairing correlations (after a repulsive-to-attractive mapping). The protocol only requires global controls followed by site-resolved particle number measurements -- capabilities that have been already demonstrated in multiple experiments -- and is designed by analyzing the Hilbert-space structure of dimers of two sites. The protocol is sample efficient and we further optimize our pulses for robustness to experimental imperfections such as lattice inhomogeneity. Our work introduces a general tool for manipulating quantum states on optical lattices, enhancing their ability to tackle problems such as that of high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Traveling Bubbles within Symmetric 2D Quantum Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We disclose a class of stable nonlinear traveling waves moving at specific constant velocities within symmetric two-dimensional quantum droplets. We present a comprehensive analysis of these traveling bubbles and find three qualitatively distinct regions within the family of solutions: well-separated phase singularities, singularities within the same dip in the density and rarefaction pulses without singularities. Then, we generalize the discussion to mildly unstable cases, incorporating higher order vortex-antivortex pairs and arrays of vortices that move cohesively with a common velocity within the fluid. In all cases, we provide analytic approximations that aid the understanding of the results in different regimes.</description>

      <title>Closed-channel parameters of Feshbach resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14962v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates how the closed channel of a Feshbach resonance is characterised by experimental observables. Surprisingly, it is found that the two-body observables associated with the Feshbach resonance can be insensitive to the properties of the closed channel. In particular, it is impossible in this situation to determine the energy of the bound state causing the resonance from the usual experimental data. This is the case for all magnetic Feshbach resonances in ultracold atoms, due to their deep two-body interaction potentials. This insensitivity highlights a major difference with Feshbach resonances that involve shallow interaction potentials, such as hadron resonances. It appears however that short-range two-body correlations and three-body observables are affected by a parameter of the closed channel called the "closed-channel scattering length". A photoassociation experiment is proposed to measure this parameter in ultracold atom systems.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions from Heating to non-heating in SU(1, 1) quantum dynamics: applications to Bose-Einstein condensates and periodically driven coupled oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12558v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the entanglement properties in non-equilibrium quantum systems with the SU(1, 1) structure. Through M\"obius transformation, we map the dynamics of these systems following a sudden quench or a periodic drive onto three distinct trajectories on the Poincar\'e disc, corresponding the heating, non-heating, and a phase boundary describing these non-equilibrium quantum states. We consider two experimentally feasible systems where their quantum dynamics exhibit the SU(1, 1) structure: the quench dynamics of the Bose-Einstein condensates and the periodically driven coupled oscillators. In both cases, the heating, non-heating phases, and their boundary manifest through distinct signatures in the phonon population where exponential, oscillatory, and linear growths classify these phases. Similarly, the entanglement entropy and negativity also exhibit distinct behaviors (linearly, oscillatory, and logarithmic growths) characterizing these phases, respectively. Notibly, for the periodically driven coupled oscillators, the non-equilibrium properties are characterized by two sets of SU(1, 1) generators. The corresponding two sets of the trajectories on two Poincar\'e discs lead to a more complex phase diagram. We identify two distinct phases within the heating region discernible solely by the growth rate of the entanglement entropy, where a discontinuity is observed when varying the parameters across the phase boundary within in heating region. This discontinuity is not observed in the phonon population.</description>

      <title>Regimes of Steady-State Turbulence in a Quantum Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We simulate the Gross-Pitaevskii equation to model the development of turbulence in a quantum fluid confined by a cuboid box potential, and forced by shaking along one axis. We observe the development of isotropic turbulence from anisotropic forcing for a broad range of forcing amplitudes, and characterise the states through their Fourier spectra, vortex distributions, and spatial correlations. For weak forcing the steady-state wave-action spectrum exhibits a $k^{-3.5}$ scaling over wavenumber $k$; further decomposition uncovers the same power law in both compressible kinetic energy and quantum pressure, while the bulk superfluid remains phase coherent and free from extended vortices. As the forcing energy exceeds the chemical potential, extended vortices develop in the bulk, disrupting the $k^{-3.5}$ scaling. The spectrum then transitions to a $k^{-7/3}$ regime for compressible kinetic energy only, associated with dense vortex turbulence, and phase coherence limited to the healing length. The strong forcing regime is consistent with an inverse cascade of compressible energy driven by small-scale vortex annihilation.</description>
