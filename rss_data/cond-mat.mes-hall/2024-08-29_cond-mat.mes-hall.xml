      <title>Influence of Nonequilibrium Vibrational Dynamics on Spin Selectivity in Chiral Molecular Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the role of molecular vibrations in the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect in the context of charge transport through a molecular nanojunction. We employ a mixed quantum-classical approach that combines Ehrenfest dynamics for molecular vibrations with the hierarchical equations of motion method for the electronic degrees of freedom. This approach treats the molecular vibrations in a nonequilibrium manner, which is crucial for the dynamics of molecular nanojunctions. To explore the effect of vibrational dynamics on spin selectivity, we also introduce a new figure of merit, the displacement polarization, which quantifies the difference in vibrational displacements for opposing lead magnetizations. We analyze the dynamics of single trajectories, investigating how the spin selectivity depends on voltage and electronic-vibrational coupling. Furthermore, we investigate the dynamics and temperature dependence of ensemble-averaged observables. We demonstrate that spin selectivity is correlated in time with the vibrational polarization, indicating that dynamics of the molecular vibrations is the driving force of CISS in this model within the Ehrenfest approach.</description>

      <title>Orbital magnetoelectric coupling of three dimensional Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital magnetoelectric effect is closely related to the band topology of bulk crystalline insulators. Typical examples include the half quantized Chern-Simons orbital magnetoelectric coupling in three dimensional (3D) axion insulators and topological insulators, which are the hallmarks of their nontrivial bulk band topology. While the Chern-Simons coupling is well defined only for insulators with zero Chern number, the orbital magnetoelectric effects in 3D Chern insulators with nonzero (layer) Chern numbers are still open questions. In this work, we propose a never-mentioned quantization rule for the layer-resolved orbital magnetoelectric response in 3D Chern insulators, the gradient of which is exactly quantized in unit of $e^2/h$. By theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the quantized orbital magnetoelectric response remains robust for various types of interlayer hoppings and stackings, even against disorder and lack of symmetries. We argue that the robustness has a topological origin and protected by layer Chern number. It is thus promising to observe the proposed quantized orbital magnetoelectric response in a slab of 3D Chern insulator thanks to recent experimental developments.</description>

      <title>Reversible to Irreversible Transitions for ac Driven Skyrmions on Periodic Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using atomistic simulations, we investigate the dynamical behavior of magnetic skyrmions in dimer and trimer molecular crystal arrangements, as well as bipartite lattices at 3/2 and 5/2 fillings, under ac driving over a square array of anisotropy defects. For low ac amplitudes, at all fillings we find reversible motion where the skyrmions return to their original positions at the end of each ac drive cycle and the diffusion is zero. We also identify two distinct irreversible regimes. The first is a translating regime in which the skyrmions form channels of flow in opposing directions and translate by one substrate lattice constant per ac drive cycle. The translating state appears in the dimer and trimer states, and produces pronounced peaks in the diffusivity in the direction perpendicular to the external drive. For larger ac amplitudes, we find chaotic irreversible motion in which the skyrmions can randomly exchange places with each other over time, producing long-time diffusive behavior both parallel and perpendicular to the ac driving direction.</description>

      <title>Molecular-Scale Insights into the Heterogeneous Interactions Between an m-Terphenyl Isocyanide Ligand and Noble Metal Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural and chemical properties of metal nanoparticles are often dictated by their interactions with molecular ligand shells. These interactions are highly material-specific and can vary significantly even among elements within the same group or materials with similar crystal structure. Precise characterization of ligand-metal interactions is crucial for the rational design of ligands and the functionalization of nanoparticles. In this study, we found that the ligation behavior with m-terphenyl isocyanide molecule differs significantly between Au and Ag nanoparticles, with distinct ligand extraction efficiencies and size dependencies. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy measurements revealed unique enhancement factors for two molecular vibrational modes, indicating different ligand binding geometries on these metal surfaces. Molecular-level characterization using scanning tunneling microscopy allowed us to directly visualize these variations between Ag and Au surfaces, which we assign as two distinct binding mechanisms. This molecular-scale visualization provides clear insights into the different ligand-metal interactions, as well as the chemical behavior and spectroscopic characterization of isocyanide-functionalized nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Induced Density of Supercritical Coulomb Impurities in Graphene Under Strong Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Coulomb impurity problem of graphene, in the absence of a magnetic field, displays discrete scale invariance. Applying a magnetic field introduces a new magnetic length scale $\ell$ and breaks discrete scale invariance. Moreover, a magnetic field is a singular perturbation as it turns complex energies into real energies. Nonetheless, the Coulomb potential must be regularized with a length $R$ at short distances for supercritical impurities. We investigate the structure of the induced density of a filled Landau impurity band in the supercritical regime. The coupling between Landau level states by the impurity potential is nontrivial and can lead to several anomalous effects. First, we find that the peak in the induced density can be located away from the center of the impurity, depending on the characteristics of the Landau impurity bands. Second, the impurity charge is screened, despite the Landau impurity band being filled. Third, anticrossing impurity states lead to additional impurity cyclotron resonances.</description>

      <title>Modeling magnetization reversal in multilayers with interlayer exchange coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin spirals form inside the magnetic layers of antiferromagnetic and noncollinearly-coupled magnetic multilayers in the presence of an external magnetic field. This spin structure can be modeled to extract the direct exchange stiffness of the magnetic layers and the strength of the interlayer exchange coupling across the spacer layer. In this article, we discuss three models to describe the evolution of the spin spiral with the strength of the external magnetic field in these coupled structures: discrete energy, discrete torque, and continuous torque. These models are expanded to accommodate multilayers with any number of ferromagnetic layers, any combination of material parameters, and asymmetry. We compare their performance when fitting to the measured magnetization data of a range of sputtered samples with one or multiple ferromagnetic layers on either side of the spacer. We find that the discrete models produce better fits than the continuous for asymmetric and multi-ferromagnetic structures and exhibit much better computational scaling with high numbers of atomic layers than the continuous model. For symmetric, single-layered structures, the continuous model produces the same fit statistics and outperforms the discrete models. Lastly, we demonstrate the methods by which one can use interfacial layers to measure the exchange stiffness of magnetic layers with low interlayer exchange coupling. An open-access website has been provided to allow the fitting of magnetization as a function of field in arbitrary coupled structures using the discrete energy model.</description>

      <title>Simulating the electrostatic patch force in sphere-plate and plate-plate geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Potential patches are responsible for a force between closely-spaced objects that forms a parasitic contribution to sensitive force measurements. Existing analytical models cannot account for the patch force in the 3D geometries of real experiments. Here, we present a finite-element method model to evaluate the impact of patches in arbitrary geometries. First, we test our model against the plate-plate and sphere-plate geometries, for which the exact solutions are known. Then, we apply it to the analytically unwieldy case of plate-concave plate that is relevant for Casimir force measurements. This work provides a reliable estimation of the parasitic contribution from random potential patches.</description>

      <title>Topologically Driven Spin-Orbit Torque in Dirac Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We unveil novel spin-orbit torque mechanisms driven by topological edge states in magnetic graphene-based devices. Within the energy gap, a damping-like torque plateau emerges within the quantum anomalous Hall phase upon breaking particle-hole symmetry, while for energies at the spin-split Dirac points located within the bands, a large damping-like torque develops as a result of a vanishing Fermi contour. Such torques are tunable by the degree of spin-pseudospin entanglement dictated by proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling terms. This additionally allows to reach the upper limit of charge-to-spin conversion in non-magnetic devices.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory dependence of tunneling magnetoresistance on barrier thickness in magnetic tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dependence of tunneling conductance and tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) on barrier thickness in magnetic tunnel junctions is theoretically investigated. The complex band structure of the insulator is taken into account, and an analytical formula for tunneling conductance and TMR is derived. Numerical calculations using a tight-binding model validate the analytical formula. The complex nature of insulator's band structure leads to significant oscillations in tunneling conductance and TMR as functions of barrier thickness. It is demonstrated that these TMR oscillations are not caused by quantum confinement within the barrier, but are instead analogous to classical two-slit optical interference.</description>

      <title>Nanorobotic actuator based on interlayer sliding ferroelectricity and field-tunable friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interlayer sliding ferroelectricity has been discovered in a variety of 2D materials with superb features such as atomic thickness, fast response, and fatigue resistance. So far, research on this phenomenon has been limited to fundamental physics and electronic applications, leaving its potential for electromechanical actuation unexplored. In this work, we design an atomic-scale actuator based on sliding ferroelectricity and field-tunable interfacial friction. With a prototype based on parallelly stacked bilayer h-BN sandwiched between gold contacts, we show how an alternating electric field can drive the bilayer into controlled crawling motions and how uniaxial strain can steer the crawl direction. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate the actuator's robust operation under a wide range of drive signals, friction scales, and frictional variations. We further provide experimental directions on how to realize field-tunable friction on h-BN interfaces. The wireless-ready actuation mechanism can be generalized to many 2D material systems possessing sliding ferroelectricity and integrated into flexible electronics platforms, opening new avenues in the development of intelligent nanorobotics.</description>

      <title>Reconciling Kubo and Keldysh Approaches to Fermi-Sea-Dependent Nonequilibrium Observables: Application to Spin Hall Current and Spin-Orbit Torque in Spintronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum transport studies of spin-dependent phenomena in solids commonly employ the Kubo or Keldysh formulas for the steady-state density matrix in the linear-response regime. Its trace with operators of interest -- such as, spin density, spin current density or spin torque -- gives expectation values of experimentally accessible observables. For such local quantities, these formulas require summing over the manifolds of {\em both} Fermi-surface and Fermi-sea quantum states. However, debates have been raging in the literature about vastly different physics the two formulations can apparently produce, even when applied to the same system. Here, we revisit this problem using a testbed of infinite-size graphene with proximity-induced spin-orbit and magnetic exchange effects. By splitting this system into semi-infinite leads and central active region, in the spirit of Landauer two-terminal setup for quantum transport, we prove the {\em numerically exact equivalence} of the Kubo and Keldysh approaches via the computation of spin Hall current density and spin-orbit torque in both clean and disordered limits. The key to reconciling the two approaches are the numerical frameworks we develop for: ({\em i}) evaluation of Kubo(-Bastin) formula for a system attached to semi-infinite leads, which ensure continuous energy spectrum and evade the need for phenomenological broadening in prior calculations; and ({\em ii}) proper evaluation of Fermi-sea term in the Keldysh approach, which {\em must} include the voltage drop across the central active region even if it is disorder free.</description>

      <title>Sliding Wigner crystals in bilayer graphene at zero and finite magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AB-stacked bilayer graphene has emerged as a fascinating yet simple platform for exploring macroscopic quantum phenomena of correlated electrons. Unexpectedly, an insulating phase has recently been observed when a large electric displacement field is applied and the charge carrier density is tuned to the vicinity of an ultra-low-density van Hove singularity. This phase exhibits features consistent with Wigner crystallization, including a characteristic temperature dependence and non-linear current bias behavior. However, more direct evidence for the emergence of an electron crystal in AB-stacked bilayer graphene at zero magnetic field remains elusive. Here we explore the low-frequency noise generated by the depinning and sliding of the Wigner crystal lattice. The current bias and frequency dependence of these noise spectra align well with findings from previous experimental and theoretical studies on the quantum electron solids. Our results offer a compelling transport signature of Wigner crystallization in AB-stacked bilayer graphene at zero and finite magnetic fields, paving the way for further substantiating an anomalous Hall crystal in its original form.</description>

      <title>Symmetry constraints on topological invariants and irreducible band representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EBR is considered the building block in TQC and fundamental concept in SI methods. One of the hypophysis is that a fully occupied EBR has zero Berry-Wilczek-Zee phase and those occupied corresponds to trivial topology. Associated with it are the concepts of atomic limit and equivalence between BRs. In this manuscript, an explicit link between the BWZ phase of connected bands and that of its EBR or irreducible band representation (IBR) basis is established. When gapped system occurs under the TB model, the relation between the BWZ phase of a set of connected bands and its BR basis only persist if the later are IBRs. Thus the BWZ phase can be evaluated in terms of the IBRs. Equivalent segments of path integral of BWZ connection with respect to IBRs are established as representation of the space group and selection rule for corresponding BWZ phase established where possible. The occurrence of IBRs is rooted in real space symmetry but dependent on dynamic interaction and band topology. Three gapped systems in honeycomb lattices are discussed. Two spin-less cases are shown to be topologically trivial, whereas the selection rule cannot be developed for the spin-full pz orbital as in graphene. Two necessary conditions for topologically trivial phase are established, namely 1.Connected bands having the same closed set of IBR basis for all k and, 2.The reduced tensor element for the path integral of BWZ connection for such basis is symmetry forbidden due to contractable close loop having zero BWZ phase. Thus the IBRs are the building block of topologically trivial phase and symmetry constraint on BWZ phase are obtained through IBRs and selection rules via Wigner-Eckart theorem. Some examples demonstrate that the basic hypothesis of SI method is false. The analysis here advocate a paradigm shift from EBR to IBR as building block of topologically trivial phase.</description>

      <title>Variational approach to atom-membrane dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Dirac-Frenkel variational principle, a time-dependent description of the dynamics of a two-level system coupled to a bosonic bath is formulated. The method is applied to the case of a gas of cold atoms adsorbing via phonon creation to an elastic membrane at finite temperature. The time-dependence of the system state is analytically calculated using Laplace transform methods, and a closed-form expression for the transition rate is obtained. Atoms in the gas transition to the adsorbed state through a Feshbach resonance that has contributions from a distribution of vibrational modes of the membrane. The resonance can decay with the creation of a phonon to complete the adsorption process. The adsorption rate at low membrane temperature agrees with the golden rule estimate to lowest order in the coupling constant for values greater than a critical coupling strength. Below this critical coupling strength, the adsorption rate is exponentially suppressed by a phonon reduction factor whose exponent diverges with increasing adsorbent size. The rate changes discontinuously with coupling strength for low temperature membranes, and the magnitude of the discontinuity decreases with increasing temperature. These variational results suggest the quantum adsorption model may contain a first-order phase transition.</description>

Abstract: We study charged particles in three dimensions interacting via a short-range potential in addition to the Coulomb potential. When the Bohr radius and the scattering length are much larger than the potential range, low-energy physics of the system becomes independent from details of the short-range potential. We develop the zero-range theory to describe such universal physics in terms of the Bohr radius and the scattering length by generalizing the Bethe-Peierls boundary condition, which is then applied to two charged particles to reveal their bound states and resonances. Infinite resonances are found for a repulsive Coulomb potential, one of which turns into a bound state with increasing inverse scattering length, whereas infinite bound states exist for an attractive Coulomb potential with no resonances at any scattering length. The zero-range theory is also applied to three equally charged particles at infinite scattering length under the variational Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We find that the effective potential between two heavy particles induced by a light particle is an inverse-square attraction at distances shorter than the Bohr radius, leading to infinite deep bound states, whereas shallow ones successively turn into resonances with increasing Coulomb repulsion.</description>

      <title>Beltrami fields, dispersive electromagnetic waves and gravitational spheromaks from chiral anomaly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we focus on the backreaction effects due to the chiral anomaly. The chiral anomaly gives rise to certain modifications in the conserved currents. In the case of the Maxwell gauge fields there appears a new contribution to the electric current proportional to the background magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as the chiral magnetic effect and it is widely discussed in the current literature. In the case of the gravitational field, the anomaly, as we show here, induces a new contribution to the stress-energy tensor. We analyze the possible manifestations of these modifications in the gravitational field and in hydrodynamics in the chiral media. We also make some comments regarding the backreaction effects in the electrodynamics in the chiral media. In each of these directions we observe the systematical appearance of the Beltrami type fields. In electrodynamics or in hydrodynamics the Beltrami field (e.g., magnetic field or fluid velocity) is a vector that is parallel to its own curl. We suggest a generalization of the Beltrami fields for the tensorial gravitational perturbations. The respective solutions to the gravitational equations we call gravitational spheromaks by analogy with a similar phenomenon in electrodynamics. In the modified hydrodynamics in the chiral media the vorticity is asymptotically a Beltrami vector field in a generalized Gromeka-Beltrami flow.</description>

      <title>Order and disorder in geometrically frustrated magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets, conventional long-range order is suppressed due to the presence of primitive triangular structural units, and the nature of the ensuing ground state remains elusive. One class of candidate states, extensively sought in experiments and vigorously studied theoretically, is the quantum spin liquid (QSL), a magnetically-disordered state in which all spins participate in a quantum-coherent many-body state. Randomly located impurities, present in all materials, may prevent QSL formation and instead lead to the formation of a spin-glass state. In this article, we review available data on the specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, and neutron scattering in GF materials. Such data show that a pure GF magnet possesses a characteristic ``hidden energy scale'' significantly exceeded by the other microscopic energy scales in the material. When cooled down to a temperature below the hidden energy scale, a GF material develops significant short-range order that dominates its properties and, in particular, dictates the spin-glass transition temperature for experimentally accessible impurity densities. We review the manifestations of short-range order in the commonly observed thermodynamics quantities in GF materials, possible scenarios for the hidden energy scale, and related open questions.</description>

      <title>Corner Charge Fluctuations and Many-Body Quantum Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many-body systems with U(1) global symmetry, the charge fluctuations in a subregion reveal important insights into entanglement and other global properties. For subregions with sharp corners, bipartite fluctuations have been predicted to exhibit a universal shape dependence on the corner angle in certain quantum phases and transitions, characterized by a "universal angle function" and a "universal coefficient." However, we demonstrate that this simple formula is insufficient for charge insulators, including composite fermi liquids. In these systems, the corner contribution may depend on the corner angle, subregion orientation, and other microscopic details. We provide an infinite series representation of the corner term, introducing orientation-resolved universal angle functions with their non-universal coefficients. In the small-angle limit or under orientation averaging, the remaining terms' coefficients are fully determined by the many-body quantum metric, which, while not universal, adheres to both a universal topological lower bound and an energetic upper bound. We also clarify the conditions for bound saturation in (anisotropic) Landau levels, leveraging the generalized Kohn theorem and holomorphic properties of many-body wavefunctions. We find that a broad class of fractional quantum Hall wavefunctions, including unprojected parton states and composite-fermion Fermi sea wavefunctions, saturates the bounds.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall states at filling factor 3/4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall states have been observed at filling factor $\nu=3/4$ in three platforms. General theoretical analysis of topological orders at $\nu=3/4$ revealed that four types of non-Abelian states with Ising anyons have ground state degeneracy $12$ on the torus. The properties of $\nu=3/4$ states can be analyzed using two complementary approaches. In the first one, they are treated as particle-hole conjugate of $\nu=1/4$ Moore-Read types states. In the second one, they are mapped to composite fermions with reverse flux attachment at effective filling factor $3/2$, whose integral part realizes an integer quantum Hall state and the fractional part realizes $\nu=1/2$ Moore-Read type states. For the specific case of bilayer graphene, numerical calculations demonstrate that strong Landau level mixing could generate a gapped state at $\nu=3/4$ with 12 fold ground state degeneracy on the torus. Its chiral graviton spectral functions has one low energy peak with negative chirality and one high energy peak with positive chirality. This points to a specific member of the Moore-Read type states and agrees with the deduction based on daughter states.</description>

      <title>Multiferroic Metallic Monolayer Cu(CrSe2)2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-dimensional (2D) Cu(CrSe$_2$)$_2$ monolayer stands out for its combined ferromagnetic (FM), ferroelectric (FE), and metallic properties, marking itself as a prominent 2D multiferroic metal. This work studies those properties and the relevant physics, using density functional calculations, Monte Carlo simulations, and $ab$ $initio$ molecular dynamics. Our results show that Cu(CrSe$_2$)$_2$ monolayer is in the Cr$^{3+}$ $t_{2g}^3$ state with $S$ = 3/2 and Cu$^{1+}$ $3d^{10}$ with $S$ = 0. A ligand hole in the Se 4$p$ orbitals gives rise to metallic behavior and enhances the FM coupling between the local Cr$^{3+}$ $S$ = 3/2 spins. The observed in-plane magnetic anisotropy primarily arises from exchange anisotropy, which is associated with the Cr-Se-Cr itinerant ferromagnetism. In contrast, both single-ion anisotropy and shape magnetic anisotropy contribute negligibly. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is also quite weak, only about 3\% of the intralayer exchange parameters. Our Monte Carlo simulations show a FM Curie temperature ($T_{\rm C}$) of 190 K. Moreover, the monolayer exhibits a vertical FE polarization of 1.79 pC/m and a FE polarization switching barrier of 182 meV/f.u., and the FE state remains stable above 800 K as shown by $ab$ $initio$ molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, a magnetoelectric coupling is partially manifested by a magnetization rotation from in-plane to out-of-plane associated with a FE-to-paraelectric transition. The magnetization rotation can also be induced by either hole or electron doping, and the hole doping increases the $T_{\rm C}$ up to 238 K. In addition, tensile strain reduces the FE polarization but enhances $T_{\rm C}$ to 290 K, while a compressive strain gives an opposite effect. Therefore, the multiferroic metallic Cu(CrSe$_2$)$_2$ monolayer may be explored for advanced multifunctional electronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven by applications in information technology, the search for new materials with stable, long-range magnetic ordering continues. Metalorganic magnets, involving the coordination of metal atoms with specific organic ligands, are a focus of intense research. These magnets offer customizable properties through synthetic adjustments to ligands or coordination chemistry. Here the synthesis, structural characterization, and magnetic properties of the 2D cyanocarbon magnet NiTCNE is reported. 2D-crystalline domains of this single-layered metalorganic network reach sizes exceeding 30 nanometers through co-deposition of the ligand TCNE (tetracyanoethylene) and Ni atoms on an Au(111) surface under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Non-contact atomic force microscopy visualizes the structure with atomic resolution. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism establishes the 2D NiTCNE as a ferromagnet, with a very high magnetic remanence, a coercive field of around 1 tesla and a Curie temperature between 10 and 20 kelvin. As metalorganic chemistry opens a large variety of routes of synthesis, we anticipate that this materials research paves the way to new magnetic nanomaterials for spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>A Non-Isothermal Phase-Field Crystal Model with Lattice Expansion: Analysis and Benchmarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a non-isothermal phase-field crystal model including heat flux and thermal expansion of the crystal lattice. The thermal compatibility condition, as well as a positive entropy-production property, is derived analytically and further verified by numerical benchmark simulations. Furthermore, we examine how the different model parameters control density and temperature evolution during dendritic solidification through extensive parameter studies. Finally, we extend our framework to the modeling of open systems considering external mass and heat fluxes. This work sets the ground for a comprehensive mesoscale model of non-isothermal solidification including thermal expansion within a positive entropy-producing framework, and provides a benchmark for further meso- to macroscopic modeling of solidification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Competing interactions in quantum magnets lead to a variety of emergent states, including ordered phases, nematic magnets and quantum spin liquids. Among them, topological quantum magnets represent a promising platform to create topological excitations protected by the bulk many-body excitation gap. Here we establish the phase diagram of a breathing frustrated antiferromagnetic J1-J2-Heisenberg model, featuring both ordered states and a higher-order topological quantum magnet state. Using exact many-body methods based on neural network quantum states and tensor networks, we determine the existence of a first order phase transition between stripe order and the topological quantum magnet and the second order phase transition between the Neel order and quantum magnet phase, further corroborated by calculations of the many-body gap. Using an auxiliary fermion parton formalism, we show the emergence of topological spinon corner modes stemming from the breathing order parameter of the parent Heisenberg model. Our results establish the breathing frustrated square lattice Heisenberg model as a paradigmatic system to engineer topological quantum magnetism, as recently realized in Ti lattices at MgO.</description>

      <title>Topological zero modes and bounded modes at smooth domain walls: exact solutions and dualities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topology describes global quantities invariant under continuous deformations, such as the number of elementary excitations at a phase boundary, without detailing specifics. Conversely, differential laws are needed to understand the physical properties of these excitations, such as their localization and spatial behavior. For instance, topology mandates the existence of solitonic zero-energy modes at the domain walls between topologically inequivalent phases in topological insulators and superconductors. However, the spatial dependence of these modes is only known in the idealized (and unrealistic) case of a sharp domain wall. Here, we find the analytical solutions of these zero-modes by assuming a smooth and exponentially-confined domain wall. This allows us to characterize the zero-modes using a few length scales: the domain wall width, the exponential decay length, and oscillation wavelength. These quantities define distinct regimes: featureless modes with "no hair" at sharp domain walls, and nonfeatureless modes at smooth domain walls, respectively, with "short hair", i.e., featureless at long distances, and "long hair", i.e., nonfeatureless at all length scales. We thus establish a universal relation between the bulk excitation gap, decay rate, and oscillation momentum of the zero modes, which quantifies the bulk-boundary correspondence in terms of experimentally measurable physical quantities. Additionally, we reveal an unexpected duality between topological zero modes and Shockley modes, unifying the understanding of topologically-protected and nontopological boundary modes. These findings shed some new light on the localization properties of edge modes in topological insulators and Majorana zero modes in topological superconductors and on the differences and similarities between topological and nontopological zero modes in these systems.</description>

      <title>Electric field control of moir\'e skyrmion phases in twisted multiferroic NiI$_2$ bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted magnetic van der Waals materials provide a flexible platform to engineer new forms of unconventional magnetism. Here we demonstrate the emergence of electrically tunable topological moir\'e magnetism in twisted bilayers of the spin-spiral multiferroic NiI$_2$. We establish a rich phase diagram featuring uniform spiral phases, a variety of $k\pi$-skyrmion lattices, and nematic spin textures ordered at the moir\'e scale. The emergence of these phases is driven by the local stacking and the resulting modulated frustration in the spin spiral stemming from the moir\'e pattern. Notably, when the spin-spiral wavelength is commensurate with the moir\'e length scale by an integer $k$, multi-walled skyrmions become pinned to the moir\'e pattern. We show that the strong magnetoelectric coupling displayed by the moir\'e multiferroic allows the electric control of the $k\pi$-skyrmion lattices by an out-of-plane electric field, which couples to the moir\'e-induced electric polarization. While adiabatic changes in the electric field preserve the topology of the spin configurations, abrupt variations can trigger transitions between different skyrmion lattice ground states. Our results establish a highly tunable platform for skyrmionics based on twisted van der Waals multiferroics, potentially enabling a new generation of ultrathin topologically-protected spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Properties of Type-I and Type-II Nodal Line Semimetals: A Comparative Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric (TE) properties of nodal line semimetals (NLSs) using a combination of semi-analytical calculations within Boltzmann's linear transport theory and the relaxation time approximation, along with first-principles calculations for the so-called type-I and type-II NLSs. We consider the conduction and valence bands that cross near the Fermi level of these materials through first-principles calculations of typical type-I (TiS) and type-II (Mg$_3$Bi$_2$) NLSs and use the two-band model fit to find the Fermi velocity $v_{F}$ and effective mass $m$ that will be employed as the initial energy dispersion parameters. The optimum curvature value for each energy band is searched by tuning the energy dispersion parameters to improve the TE properties of the NLss. We can obtain the best $\sim$$3.5\%$ increase in the Seebeck coefficient peak value compared to those using the initial parameter value in the type-I NLS, with the Seebeck coefficient ranging from $0.509S_{0}$ to $0.527S_{0}$ where $S_0 \approx 86.17~\mu$V/K. Meanwhile, the best increase in power factor, as large as $\sim$$83\%$ the initial value, can be obtained in the type-II NLS when $v_{F}$ is lowered. By systematically comparing all of our calculation results, we observed that tuning $v_{F}$ significantly improves TE properties in both types of NLS compared to tuning $m$. Our work is expected to trigger further calculations to scan other potential TE materials, particularly in the class of semimetals, by manipulating their band structure through the variation of the curvatures of their energy bands.</description>

Abstract: The low temperature physics of structurally amorphous materials is governed by two-level system defects (TLS), the exact origin and nature of which remain elusive despite decades of study. Recent advances towards realising stable high-coherence platforms for quantum computing has increased the importance of studying TLS in solid-state quantum circuits, as they are a persistent source of decoherence and instability. Here we perform scanning gate microscopy on a live superconducting quantum circuit at millikelvin temperatures to locate individual TLS. Our method directly reveals the microscopic nature of TLS and is also capable of deducing the three dimensional orientation of individual TLS electric dipole moments. Such insights, when combined with structural information of the underlying materials, can help unravel the detailed microscopic nature and chemical origin of TLS, directing strategies for their eventual mitigation.</description>

Abstract: We report the theoretical discovery of multiple real-space degenerate Floquet-Bloch states in monolayer graphene coherently driven by twisted circularly-polarized light. Using Floquet theory, we characterize the real-space structure of quasienergies and Floquet modes in terms of the orbital angular momentum and radial vortex profile of light. We obtain the effective real-space Floquet Hamiltonian and show it supports crossings of Floquet modes, especially at high-symmetry $K$ and $\Gamma$ points of graphene, localized at rings around the vortex center. At specific frequencies, the vortex bound states form a multiply degenerate structure in real-space. This structure is purely dynamically generated and controlled by the frequency and tuned by the intensity of twisted light. We discuss the experimental feasibility of observing and employing multiple real-space degeneracies for coherent optoelectronic quantum state engineering.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the static dielectric screening approximation of Coulomb interactions in atomically thin semiconductors</title>

Abstract: Coulomb interactions in atomically thin materials are uniquely sensitive to variations in the dielectric screening of the environment, which can be used to control quasiparticles and exotic quantum many-body phases. A static approximation of the dielectric response, where increased dielectric screening is predicted to cause an energy redshift of the exciton resonance, has been until now sufficient. Here, we use charge-tunable exciton resonances to study screening effects in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers embedded in materials with dielectric constants ranging from 4 to more than 1000. In contrast to expectations, we observe a blueshift of the exciton resonance exceeding 30 meV for larger dielectric constant environments. By employing a dynamical screening model, we find that while the exciton binding energy remains mostly controlled by the static dielectric response, the exciton self-energy is dominated by the high-frequency response. Dielectrics with markedly different static and high-frequency screening enable the selective addressing of distinct many-body effects in layered materials and their heterostructures, expanding the tunability range and offering new routes to detect and control correlated quantum many-body states and to design optoelectronic and quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: We examine a class of Hamiltonians characterized by interatomic, interorbital even-odd parity hybridization as a model for a family of topological insulators without the need for spin-orbit coupling. Non-trivial properties of these materials are exemplified by studying the topologically-protected edge states of s-p hybridized alkali and alkaline earth atoms in one and two-dimensional lattices. In 1D the topological features are analogous to the canonical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model but, remarkably, occur in the absence of dimerization. Alkaline earth chains, with Be standing out due to its gap size and near particle-hole symmetry, are of particular experimental interest since their Fermi energy without doping lies directly at the level of topological edge stats. Similar physics is demonstrated to occur in a 2D honeycomb lattice system of s-p bonded atoms, where dispersive edge states emerge. Lighter elements are predicted using this model to host topological states in contrast to spin-orbit coupling-induced band inversion favoring heaving atoms.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional materials are a highly tunable platform for studying the momentum space topology of the electronic wavefunctions and real space topology in terms of skyrmions, merons, and vortices of an order parameter. Such textures for electronic polarization can exist in moir\'e heterostructures. A quantum-mechanical definition of local polarization textures in insulating supercells was recently proposed. Here, we propose a definition for local polarization that is also valid for systems with topologically non-trivial bands. We introduce semilocal hybrid polarizations, which are valid even when the Wannier functions in a system cannot be made exponentially localized in all dimensions. We use this definition to explicitly show that nontrivial real-space polarization textures can exist in topologically non-trivial systems with non-zero Chern number under (1) an external superlattice potential, and (2) under a stacking-induced moir\'e potential. In the latter, we find that while the magnitude of the local polarization decreases discontinuously across a topological phase transition from trivial to topologically nontrivial, the polarization does not completely vanish. Our findings suggest that band topology and real-space polar topology may coexist in real materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a quantum Hall interferometer, the dependence of the signal on source-drain voltage is controlled by details of the edge physics, such as the velocities of edge modes and the interaction between them and with screening layers. Such dependence of the signal has been seen in recent experiments at various integer and fractional filling factors, including $\nu=2$ and $\nu=2/5$, where two edge modes are present. Here we study theoretically the current-voltage curves for various values of the relative edge velocities, interaction strength, and the temperature, in a model containing two edge modes. We consider separate cases in which the inner mode or the outer mode is weakly backscattered at the tunneling contacts. When the inner mode is completely reflected and the outer mode is partially transmitted, we find striking features at very low temperatures related to resonance of excitations of the closed inner channel. Fluctuations in the charge of the closed inner mode, caused by sparse tunneling events, lead to an exponential suppression of the interference visibility at high voltages, in agreement with experiments.</description>

Abstract: Exciton-polaritons, hybrid light-matter elementary excitations arising from the strong coupling regime between excitons in semiconductors and photons in photonic nanostructures, offer a fruitful playground to explore the physics of quantum fluids of light as well as to develop all-optical devices. However, achieving room temperature propagation of polaritons with a large excitonic fraction, which would be crucial, e.g., for nonlinear light transport in prospective devices, remains a significant challenge. } Here we report on experimental studies of exciton-polariton propagation at room temperature in resonant metasurfaces made from a sub-wavelength lattice of perovskite pillars. Thanks to the large Rabi splitting, an order of magnitude larger than the optical phonon energy, the lower polariton band is completely decoupled from the phonon bath of perovskite crystals. The long lifetime of these cooled polaritons, in combination with the high group velocity achieved through the metasurface design, enables long-range propagation regardless of the polariton excitonic fraction. Remarkably, we observed propagation distances exceeding hundreds of micrometers at room temperature, even when the polaritons possess a very high excitonic component, approximately {80}$\%$. Furthermore, the design of the metasurface introduces an original mechanism for directing uni-directional propagation through polarization control. This discovery of a ballistic propagation mode, leveraging high-speed cooled polaritons, heralds a promising avenue for the development of advanced polaritonic devices.</description>

      <title>Corner Charge Fluctuation as an Observable for Quantum Geometry and Entanglement in Two-dimensional Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring bipartite fluctuations of a conserved charge, such as the particle number, is a powerful approach to understanding quantum systems. When the measured region has sharp corners, the bipartite fluctuation receives an additional contribution known to exhibit a universal angle-dependence in 2D isotropic and uniform systems. Here we establish that, for generic lattice systems of noninteracting electrons, the corner charge fluctuation is directly related to quantum geometry; we further generalize the conclusion to interacting systems for the case where there is one atom per unit cell. We first provide a practical scheme to isolate the corner contribution on lattices, and analytically prove that its angle-dependence in the small-angle limit measures the integrated quantum metric exclusively. A model of a compact obstructed atomic insulator is introduced to illustrate this effect analytically, while numerical verification for various Chern insulator models further demonstrate the experimental relevance of the corner charge fluctuation in a finite-size quantum simulator as a probe of quantum geometry. Last but not least, for free-fermions, we unveil a remarkable connection between quantum geometry and quantum information through the lens of corner entanglement entropies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spintronic-based neuromorphic hardware offers high-density and rapid data processing at nanoscale lengths by leveraging magnetic configurations like skyrmion and domain walls. Here, we present the maximal hardware implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on a compact multi-bit skyrmion-based synapse and a hybrid CMOS domain wall-based circuit for activation and max-pooling functionalities. We demonstrate the micromagnetic design and operation of a circular bilayer skyrmion system mimicking a scalable artificial synapse, demonstrated up to 6-bit (64 states) with an ultra-low energy consumption of 0.87 fJ per state update. We further show that the synaptic weight modulation is achieved by the perpendicular current interaction with the labyrinth-maze like uniaxial anisotropy profile, inducing skyrmionic gyration, thereby enabling long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) operations. Furthermore, we present a simultaneous rectified linear (ReLU) activation and max pooling circuitry featuring a SOT-based domain wall ReLU with a power consumption of 4.73 $\mu$W. The ReLU function, stabilized by a parabolic uniaxial anisotropy profile, encodes domain wall positions into continuous resistance states coupled with the HSPICE circuit simulator. Our integrated skyrmion and domain wall-based spintronic hardware achieves 98.07% accuracy in convolutional neural network (CNN) based pattern recognition task, consuming 110 mW per image.</description>

      <title>Andreev Reflection in the Quantum Hall Regime at an Al/InAs Junction on a Cleaved Edge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have fabricated a superconductor/semiconductor (S/Sm) junction composed of Al and InAs using cleaved edge overgrowth. By exploiting the unique geometry with a thin Al/Pt/Al trilayer formed on the side surface of an in-situ cleaved heterostructure wafer containing an InAs quantum well, we achieve a superconducting critical field of 5 T, allowing superconductivity and quantum Hall (QH) effects to coexist down to Landau-level filling factor nu = 3. Andreev reflection at zero magnetic field shows a conductance enhancement that is limited solely by the Fermi velocity mismatch, demonstrating a virtually barrier-free, high-quality S/Sm junction. Bias spectroscopy in the QH regime reveals the opening of a superconducting gap, with the reduced downstream resistance demonstrating that the electron-hole Andreev conversion probability consistently exceeds 50%. Our results, obtained in a new experimental regime characterized by a clean edge-contacted junction with a superconducting electrode narrower than the coherence length, open new avenues for both theoretical and experimental studies of the interplay between superconductivity and QH effects and the engineering of exotic quasiparticles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Floating edge bands (FEB) have been identified in systems such as obstructed atomic insulators and layered nonsymmorphic semimetals, attracting considerable interest recently. Here we demonstrate that FEB can arise in a simplified model incorporating altermagnetism. By enhancing the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model on a square lattice with additional altermagnetic and Zeeman fields perpendicular to the 2D plane, we uncover the emergence of FEB that are distinct from the bulk bands across the entire Brillouin zone and over broad parameter regimes. We calculate topological phase diagrams, highlighting the strong topological properties characterized by the Chern number and the weak topological properties marked by the winding number. Furthermore, we provide analytical results of the energy spectrum and the wave functions of the FEB. We also study the robustness of the FEB, showcasing its resilience against various perturbations such as geometric rotation, energy spectrum asymmetry, and spin coupling. Our findings advance our understanding of FEB and may pave new avenues for further exploration of topological phases in quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.12083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve the quantum-mechanical antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with spins positioned on vertices of the truncated icosahedron using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG). This describes magnetic properties of the undoped C$_{60}$ fullerene at half filling in the limit of strong on-site interaction $U$. We calculate the ground state and correlation functions for all possible distances, the lowest singlet and triplet excited states, as well as thermodynamic properties, namely the specific heat and spin susceptibility.
  We find that unlike smaller C$_{20}$ or C$_{32}$ that are solvable by exact diagonalization, the lowest excited state is a triplet rather than a singlet, indicating a reduced frustration due to the presence of many hexagon faces and the separation of the pentagonal faces, similar to what is found for the truncated tetrahedron. This implies that frustration may be tuneable within the fullerenes by changing their size.
  The spin-spin correlations are much stronger along the hexagon bonds and exponentially decrease with distance, so that the molecule is large enough not to be correlated across its whole extent. The specific heat shows a high-temperature peak and a low-temperature shoulder reminiscent of the kagome lattice, while the spin susceptibility shows a single broad peak and is very close to the one of C$_{20}$.</description>

Abstract: The memory effect in a single crystal spin glass ($\mathrm{Cu}_{0.92}\mathrm{Mn}_{0.08}$) has been measured using \freq ac susceptibility techniques over a temperature range of $0.4 - 0.7 \, T_g$ and a model of the memory effect has been developed. A double-waiting-time protocol is carried out where the spin glass is first allowed to age at a temperature below $T_g$, followed by a second aging at a lower temperature, \Tw{2}, after it has fully rejuvenated. The model is based on calculating typical coincident growth of correlated regions at the two temperatures. It accounts for the absolute magnitude of the memory effect as a function of both waiting times and temperatures. The data can be explained by the memory loss being a function of the relative change in the correlated volume at the first waiting temperature because of the growth in the correlations at the second waiting temperature.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Transition due to Feedback-induced Skin Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The traditional dynamical phase transition refers to the appearance of singularities in an observable with respect to a control parameter for a late-time state or singularities in the rate function of the Loschmidt echo with respect to time. Here, we study the many-body dynamics in a continuously monitored free fermion system with conditional feedback under open boundary conditions. We surprisingly find a novel dynamical transition from a logarithmic scaling of the entanglement entropy to an area-law scaling as time evolves. The transition, which is noticeably different from the conventional dynamical phase transition, arises from the competition between the bulk dynamics and boundary skin effects. In addition, we find that while quasidisorder or disorder cannot drive a transition for the steady state, a transition occurs for the maximum entanglement entropy during the time evolution, which agrees well with the entanglement transition for the steady state of the dynamics under periodic boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the topological phases that appear in an orbital version of the Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes (BBH) model in the presence of conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductivity and with the possibility of tuning an in-plane magnetic field. We chart out the phase diagram by considering different boundary conditions, with the topology of the individual phases further examined by considering both the Wannier and entanglement spectra, as well as the Majorana polarization.
  For weak to moderate values of magnetic field and superconducting pairing amplitude, we find a second-order topological superconductor phase with eight zero-energy corner modes. Further increasing field or pairing, half of the corner states can be turned into zero-energy edge-localized modes, thus forming a type of hybrid-order phase. Then, we find two different putative first-order topological phases, a nodal and a nodeless phase, both with zero-energy flat bands localized along mirror-symmetric open edges. For the nodal phase, the flat bands are localized between the nodes in reciprocal space, while in the nodeless phase, with its a full bulk gap, the zero-energy boundary flat band spans the whole Brillouin zone.</description>

      <title>Quantum limitation on experimental testing of non-equilibrium fluctuation theorems</title>

Abstract: Non-equilibrium fluctuation theorems (NFTs) relate work performed on a system as its Hamiltonian varies with time, to equilibrium data of the initial and final states. In a classical context the system energy can be directly measured, while a quantum implementation requires the incorporation of a work-agent. We demonstrate that the uncertainty principle imposes inherent quantum limitations on the applicability of the NFT for probing non-trivial mesoscopic systems. We work out the NFT validity regime for the simplest quantum-dot toy model, and discuss future applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermodynamics of the spin-boson model using the principle of minimal dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recently developed approach to the thermodynamics of open quantum systems, on the basis of the principle of minimal dissipation, is applied to the spin-boson model. Employing a numerically exact quantum dynamical treatment based on the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method, we investigate the influence of the environment on quantities such as work, heat and entropy production in a range of parameters which go beyond the weak-coupling limit and include both the non-adiabatic and the adiabatic regimes. The results reveal significant differences to the weak-coupling forms of work, heat and entropy production, which are analyzed in some detail.</description>

      <title>The Drude weight of a flatband metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flatband systems form a new class of materials that challenge the conventional wisdom of transport. The intrinsically strong electronic correlations combined with the vanishing kinetic energy scale suggest a sensitive dependence of transport properties on the flat band states and make interacting flat bands promising candidates for exotic quantum transport. Utilizing the Drude weight, we investigate the low-frequency spectral properties of the electrical conductivity within a controlled analytic treatment of the many-body response at temperatures above the bandwidth and the interaction strength and below the bandgap. Focusing on this new transport regime, we demonstrate the potential of a quantum geometric approach for interacting systems and intermediate temperatures. The derived spectral weight yields unexplored 4-point geometric contributions unrelated to the quantum metric, which questions the previously proposed projection methods. For long-ranged interactions, we show that the low-frequency spectral weight reduces to the variance of the Berry curvature.</description>
