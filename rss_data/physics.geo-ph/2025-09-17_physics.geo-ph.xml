      <title>Representations for multidimensional down-down deconvolution of ocean-bottom seismic data: theory and practical implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multidimensional up-down deconvolution effectively eliminates surface-related multiples from ocean-bottom seismic data. Recently, several down-down deconvolution methods have been introduced as attractive alternatives. Whereas multidimensional up-down deconvolution fully accounts for lateral variations of the medium parameters, the underlying theory of some of the down-down deconvolution methods is essentially based on the assumption that the medium is horizontally layered. We derive representations for multidimensional down-down deconvolution for laterally varying media in a uniform manner and discuss the pros and cons of the various methods.</description>

      <title>SURGIN: SURrogate-guided Generative INversion for subsurface multiphase flow with quantified uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a direct inverse modeling method named SURGIN, a SURrogate-guided Generative INversion framework tailed for subsurface multiphase flow data assimilation. Unlike existing inversion methods that require adaptation for each new observational configuration, SURGIN features a zero-shot conditional generation capability, enabling real-time assimilation of unseen monitoring data without task-specific retraining. Specifically, SURGIN synergistically integrates a U-Net enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (U-FNO) surrogate with a score-based generative model (SGM), framing the conditional generation as a surrogate prediction-guidance process in a Bayesian perspective. Instead of directly learning the conditional generation of geological parameters, an unconditional SGM is first pretrained in a self-supervised manner to capture the geological prior, after which posterior sampling is performed by leveraging a differentiable U-FNO surrogate to enable efficient forward evaluations conditioned on unseen observations. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate SURGIN's capability to decently infer heterogeneous geological fields and predict spatiotemporal flow dynamics with quantified uncertainty across diverse measurement settings. By unifying generative learning with surrogate-guided Bayesian inference, SURGIN establishes a new paradigm for inverse modeling and uncertainty quantification in parametric functional spaces.</description>

      <title>Vessel Detection and Localization Using Distributed Acoustic Sensing in Submarine Optical Fiber Cables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Submarine cables play a critical role in global internet connectivity, energy transmission, and communication but remain vulnerable to accidental damage and sabotage. Recent incidents in the Baltic Sea highlighted the need for enhanced monitoring to protect this vital infrastructure. Traditional vessel detection methods, such as synthetic aperture radar, video surveillance, and multispectral satellite imagery, face limitations in real-time processing, adverse weather conditions, and coverage range. This paper explores Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) as an alternative by repurposing submarine telecommunication cables as large-scale acoustic sensor arrays. DAS offers continuous real-time monitoring, operates independently of cooperative systems like the "Automatic Identification System" (AIS), being largely unaffected by lighting or weather conditions. However, existing research on DAS for vessel tracking is limited in scale and lacks validation under real-world conditions. To address these gaps, a general and systematic methodology is presented for vessel detection and distance estimation using DAS. Advanced machine learning models are applied to improve detection and localization accuracy in dynamic maritime environments. The approach is evaluated over a continuous ten-day period, covering diverse ship and operational conditions, representing one of the largest-scale DAS-based vessel monitoring studies to date, and for which we release the full evaluation dataset. Results demonstrate DAS as a practical tool for maritime surveillance, with an overall F1-score of over 90% in vessel detection, and a mean average error of 141 m for vessel distance estimation, bridging the gap between experimental research and real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of nonlinear perturbations in the dynamics of planar crack fronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interaction of crack fronts with asperities is central to the criteria of fracture in heterogeneous materials and for predicting fracture surface formation. It is known how dynamic crack fronts respond to small, 1st-order, perturbations. However, large and localized disturbances to crack motion induce dynamic and geometric nonlinear effects beyond the existing linear theories. Because the determination of the 3D elastic fields surrounding perturbed crack fronts is a necessary step towards any theoretical study of crack front dynamics, we develop a 2nd-order perturbation theory for the asymptotic fields of planar crack fronts. Based on previous work, we consider two models of fracture. In the so-called scalar elastic model, which is analogous to anti-plane (Mode III) fracture, the stress and displacement fields are obtained through matched asymptotic expansions. A self-consistent expansion is used to resolve the fields near tensile (Mode I) crack fronts. Both methods can be extended to higher perturbation orders. The main results of this work are the explicit 2nd-order expressions of the local dynamic energy-release-rates for perturbations of straight fronts. These general formulae recover the known energy-release-rates of curved quasi-static fronts and of straight dynamic fronts.</description>
