      <title>Complementarity Between Paid and Organic Installs in Mobile App Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior spending shutoff experiments in search advertising have found that paid ads cannibalize organic traffic. But it is unclear whether the same is true for other high volume advertising channels like mobile display advertising. We therefore analyzed a large-scale spending shutoff experiment by a US-based mobile game developer, GameSpace. Contrary to previous findings, we found that paid advertising boosts organic installs rather than cannibalizing them. Specifically, every $100 spent on ads is associated with 37 paid and 3 organic installs. The complementarity between paid ads and organic installs is corroborated by evidence of temporal and cross-platform spillover effects: ad spending today is associated with additional paid and organic installs tomorrow and impressions on one platform lead to clicks on other platforms. Our findings demonstrate that mobile app install advertising is about 7.5% more effective than indicated by paid install metrics alone due to spillover effects, suggesting that mobile app developers are under-investing in marketing.</description>

      <title>International Comparisons: Multilateral Indices and Nonparametric Welfare Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilateral index numbers, such as those used to make international comparisons of prices and income, are fundamental objects in economics. However, these numbers are often challenging to interpret in terms of economic welfare as a data-dependent 'taste bias' can arise for these indices that distorts measurement of price and income levels and dispersion. To study this problem, I develop a means to appraise indices' economic interpretability using non-parametric bounds on a true cost-of-living index. These bounds improve upon their classical counterparts, define a new class of indices, and can correct existing indices for preference misspecification. In my main application I apprise existing international comparison methods. I find that taste bias generally leads to overestimates (underestimates) of price (income) levels. Superlative indices, such as the Fisher-GEKS index, lie within the permitted bounds more frequently than non-superlative methods, but the mean size of this bias is modest in all examined cases. My results can thus be interpreted as supporting the economic validity of the myriad multilateral methods which are in practical use.</description>

      <title>Bridging Retrospective and Prospective Merger Analyses: The Case of US Airline Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15785v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an ensemble approach to evaluate mergers that combines retrospective and prospective modeling for a more reliable analysis. We begin with a retrospective analysis based on an event study of three major U.S. airline mergers and document the fragility of the findings. We then develop a structural model that nests the event study in its reduced form, clarifying the implicit assumptions in retrospective analyses that create this fragility while separating efficiency gains from changes in firms' conduct. Using only the pre-merger data, we develop a regression-based approach that leverages exogenous changes in market structure to forecast prices after the merger. Finally, we implement structural merger analysis and show how estimates from all approaches can be synthesized for comprehensive evaluation. This methodological integration uncovers a fundamental tension: merger-induced efficiency gains were limited or, if significant, offset by increased coordination among remaining firms.</description>
