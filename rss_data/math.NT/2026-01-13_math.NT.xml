      <title>Eigenvalues of $p$-adic random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the basic theory of eigenvalues of $p$-adic random matrices, analogous to the classical theory for random matrices over $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$. Such eigenvalue statistics were proposed as a model for the zeroes of $p$-adic $L$-functions by Ellenberg-Jain-Venkatesh, who computed the limiting distribution of the number of eigenvalues in a unit disc. We compute the full joint distribution of the $n$ eigenvalues of an $n \times n$ matrix with Haar distribution, obtaining Coulomb gas type formulas as in the archimedean case, with Vandermonde terms leading to eigenvalue repulsion.
  From these Coulomb gas density functions we derive asymptotics of eigenvalue statistics as $n \to \infty$. These include exact computations, such as a closed form
  $$\rho(x,y) = 1 - \theta_3(-\sqrt{p};||x-y||^2/p)$$
  for the limiting pair correlation of eigenvalues in $\mathbb{Z}_p$, and similar results in quadratic extensions. Such formulas yield concrete numerical predictions on zeroes of $p$-adic $L$-functions.
  For eigenvalues in arbitrary extensions of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ we also give precise estimates on their pair-repulsion and expected number of eigenvalues in each extension. Finally, we compute the asymptotic probability that all eigenvalues lie in $\mathbb{Z}_p$.
  Our proofs combine results from several distinct areas: $p$-adic orbital integrals, roots of random $p$-adic polynomials, the Sawin-Wood moment method for random modules, and Markov chains associated with measures on integer partitions.</description>

      <title>The discrete second moment of mixed derivatives of the Riemann zeta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the full asymptotic for the discrete second moment of the Riemann zeta function of mixed derivatives evaluated at the zeta zeros, providing both unconditional and conditional error terms. This was first studied by Gonek, where only the leading order asymptotic was given, later extended by Conrey--Snaith and Milinovich to include the lower order terms for the first derivative. We extend the case of the first derivative to all derivatives.</description>

      <title>Hurwitz spaces and Inverse Galois Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hurwitz spaces which parametrize branched covers of the line play a prominent role in inverse Galois theory. This paper surveys fifty years of works in this direction with emphasis on recent advances. Based on the Riemann-Hurwitz theory of covers, the geometric and arithmetic setup is first reviewed, followed by the semi-modern developments of the 1990--2010 period: large fields, compactification, descent theory, modular towers. The second half of the paper highlights more recent achievements that have reshaped the arithmetic of Hurwitz spaces, notably via the systematic study of the ring of components. These include the construction of components defined over ${\mathbb Q}$, and the Ellenberg-Venkatesh-Westerland approach to rational points over finite fields, applied to the Cohen-Lenstra heuristics and the Malle conjecture over function fields ${\mathbb F}_q(T)$.</description>

      <title>On families of monic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we derive generalizations of different properties of monic polynomial families of binomial type, i.e. families of monic polynomials, for which the binomial theorem holds $$ p_n(\alpha+\beta)=\sum_{k=0}^n \left(\vphantom{\bigg|}\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{0}{n}{k}\right) p_k(\alpha)p_{n-k}(\beta) $$ Some trivial representations of general ''multiplication'' and ''derivative'' operators are derived. In addition we derive a formula for the logarithmic derivative of general monic polynomial $p_n(x)$ which reduces to the formula $$ \frac{1}{n}\frac{p_n'(x)}{p_n(x)} =\left(x+\frac{1}{\varphi'(y)}\left(\frac{d}{dy}-n\mathrm{L}\right)\right)^{-1}\cdot\left.\frac{\varphi(y)}{y\varphi'(y)}~\right|_{y=0} $$ derived by the author in binomial case, when the generating function of $p_n(x)$ equals to $e^{x\varphi(y)}$.</description>

      <title>Special $L$-values of certain CM weight three Hecke eigenforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ramanujan's theories of elliptic functions to alternative bases for modular forms connect hypergeometric series with modular forms and have led to applications such as the modularity of certain hypergeometric Galois representations. In this paper, we relate special values of $L$-function of certain CM cusp forms to Ramanujan's alternative bases via the modularity of hypergeometric Galois representations arising from CM elliptic curves over real quadratic fields. We also give a complete classification of these representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct, for a $p$-adic field $F$, an explicit semisimple Tannakian category $\text{RigIsoc}_{F}$ whose category of fiber functors recovers Kaletha's Galois gerbe $\mathcal{E}_{\text{Kal}}$. We then classify and write down the simple objects in $\text{RigIsoc}_{F}$, all of which come from elliptic twisted Levi subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}_{n}$.</description>

      <title>Greenberg's conjecture and Iwasawa module of Real biquadratic fields II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we are interested in the stability of the $2$-rank of the class group in the cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_2$-extension of real biquadratic fields. In fact, we give several families of real biquadratic fields $K$ such that $ rank(A(K)) =rank(A_\infty(K))$ and $rank(A(K))\leq 3$, where $A(K)$ and $A_\infty(K)$ are the $2$-class group and the $2$-Iwasawa module of $K$ respectively. Moreover, Greenberg's conjecture is verified for some new families of number fields; in particular, we determine the complete list of all real biquadratic fields with trivial $2$-Iwasawa module. This work is a continuation of M. M. Chems-Eddin, Greenberg's conjecture and Iwasawa module of real biquadratic fields I, J. Number Theory, 281 (2026), 224-266.</description>

      <title>The infinitude of square-free palindromes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We settle an open problem regarding palindromes; that is, positive integers which are the same when written forwards and backwards. In particular, we prove that for any fixed base $b\geq 2$, there exist infinitely many square-free palindromes in base $b$. We also provide an asymptotic expression for the number of such integers $\leq x$. The core of our proof utilises a hybrid $p$-adic/Archimedean van der Corput process, used in conjunction with an equidistribution estimate of Tuxanidy and Panario, as well as an elementary argument of Cilleruelo, Luca and Shparlinski.</description>

      <title>The spinor type number formula for totally definite quaternion orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $D$ be a totally definite quaternion algebra over a totally real number field $F$, and $\mathcal{O}$ be an $O_F$-order (of full rank) in $D$. The type number $t(\mathcal{O})$ is an important arithmetic invariant of $\mathcal{O}$ that counts the number of isomorphism classes of orders belonging to the same genus as $\mathcal{O}$ (i.e. locally isomorphic to $\mathcal{O}$ at every finite place $\mathfrak{p}$ of $F$). The type number formula has been studied by Eichler, Peters, Pizer, Vigneras, K\"orner and many others. As the genus of $\mathcal{O}$ further divides into spinor genera, one naturally seeks a finer type number formula for the number of isomorphism classes of orders belonging to the same spinor genus of $\mathcal{O}$. The main goal of this paper is to provide such a refinement for a large class of quaternion $O_F$-orders $\mathcal{O}$ that includes all Eichler orders. This enables us to prove that $t(\mathcal{O})$ is divisible by the order of a quotient group $\mathrm{WSG}(\mathcal{O})$ of the Gauss genus group $\mathrm{Cl}^+(O_F)/\mathrm{Cl}^+(O_F)^2$ naturally attached to $\mathcal{O}$. Similarly, we show that the trace of the $\mathfrak{n}$-Brandt matrix $\mathfrak{B}(\mathcal{O}, \mathfrak{n})$ is divisible by the class number $h(F)$ for any nonzero integral $O_F$-ideal $\mathfrak{n}$. In particular, the class number $h(\mathcal{O})=\mathrm{Tr}(\mathfrak{B}(\mathcal{O}, O_F))$ is always divisible by $h(F)$ for such quaternion orders. This generalizes the divisibility result of $h(\mathcal{O})$ proved in a different way by Chia-Fu Yu and the second named author [Indiana Univ. Math. J., Vol. 70, No. 2 (2021)] in the case when $\mathcal{O}$ is a maximal $O_F$-order in a totally definite quaternion algebra unramified at all the finite places.</description>

      <title>Resolution of Erd\H{o}s Problem #728: a writeup of Aristotle's Lean proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07421v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a writeup of a resolution of Erd\H{o}s Problem #728; this is the first Erd\H{o}s problem (a problem proposed by Paul Erd\H{o}s which has been collected in the Erd\H{o}s Problems website) regarded as fully resolved autonomously by an AI system. The system in question is a combination of GPT-5.2 Pro by OpenAI and Aristotle by Harmonic, operated by Kevin Barreto. The final result of the system is a formal proof written in Lean, which we translate to informal mathematics in the present writeup for wider accessibility.
  The proved result is as follows. We show a logarithmic-gap phenomenon regarding factorial divisibility: For any constants $0&lt;C_1&lt;C_2$ and $0 &lt; \varepsilon &lt; 1/2$ there exist infinitely many triples $(a,b,n)\in\mathbb N^3$ with $\varepsilon n \le a,b \le (1-\varepsilon)n$ such that \[ a!\,b!\mid n!\,(a+b-n)!\qquad\text{and}\qquad C_1\log n &lt; a+b-n &lt; C_2\log n. \] The argument reduces this to a binomial divisibility $\binom{m+k}{k}\mid\binom{2m}{m}$ and studies it prime-by-prime. By Kummer's theorem, $\nu_p\binom{2m}{m}$ translates into a carry count for doubling $m$ in base $p$. We then employ a counting argument to find, in each scale $[M,2M]$, an integer $m$ whose base-$p$ expansions simultaneously force many carries when doubling $m$, for every prime $p\le 2k$, while avoiding the rare event that one of $m+1,\dots,m+k$ is divisible by an unusually high power of $p$. These "carry-rich but spike-free" choices of $m$ force the needed $p$-adic inequalities and the divisibility. The overall strategy is similar to results regarding divisors of $\binom{2n}{n}$ studied earlier by Erd\H{o}s and by Pomerance.</description>

      <title>A note on extensions of $p$-adic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute extension groups in the category of duals of $p$-adic Banach space representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)$. Focusing on representations arising from the $p$-adic local Langlands correspondence for generic Galois representations, we classify these extensions completely. These results are then applied to prove the vanishing of extensions between the duals of reducible representations and supercuspidal isotypic components of the \`etale cohomology of the finite level Drinfeld spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article focuses on smooth, projective, and geometrically integral varieties $X$ over a field $k$, whose geometric Picard group $Pic(X_{\overline{k}})$ is torsion-free. We establish an isomorphism$Br(X)/Br(k) \simeq Br_{nr}\bigl(Sym_{X/k}^{n}\bigr)/Br(k)$, where $Sym_{X/k}^{n}$ denotes the $n$-th symmetric product. Using this isomorphism, we investigate the relationship between the Brauer--Manin obstruction to the Hasse principle and weak approximation for rational points on the smooth proejctive model $Sym_{X/k}^{n,sm}$, and the corresponding obstruction for $0$-cycles of degree $n$ on $X$.</description>

      <title>Infinite sumsets in $U^k(\Phi)$-uniform sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending recent developments of Kra, Moreira, Richter and Roberson, we study infinite sumset patterns in $U^k(\Phi)$-uniform subsets of the integers, defined via the local uniformity seminorms introduced by Host and Kra. The main result relates the degree $k$ of a $U^k(\Phi)$-uniform set to the existence of sumset patterns along prescribed vertices of $\ell$-dimensional parallelepipeds, for $k \leq \ell$. The proof relies on a dynamical analysis of return-time sets to neighborhoods of points lying over pronilfactor fibers. We then derive higher-order parity obstructions for sumset patterns and consequences in topological dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\rho_k(N)$ denote the maximum size of a set $A\subseteq \{1,2,\dots,N\}$ such that no product of $k$ distinct elements of $A$ is a perfect $d$-th power. In this short note, we prove that $\rho _d(N)=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{d-1}\pi\left( \frac{N}{k} \right) +O_d(\pi (N^{1/2}))$, furthermore, for prime power $d$ and sufficiently large $N$ we have $\rho _d(N)=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{d-1}\pi\left( \frac{N}{k} \right)$. This answers a question of Verstra\"ete.</description>

      <title>The Greedy Algorithm for Dissociated Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A set $\mathcal S\subset \mathbb N$ is said to be a \textit{subset-sum-distinct} or \textit{dissociated} if all of its finite subsets have different sums. Alternately, an equivalent classification is if any equality of the form $$\sum_{s\in \mathcal S} \varepsilon_s \cdot s =0$$ where $\varepsilon_s \in \{-1,0,+1\}$ implies that all the $\varepsilon_s$'s are $0$. For a dissociated set $\mathcal S$, we prove that for $c_\ast = \frac 12 \log_2 \left(\frac \pi 2\right)$ and any $c_\ast-1&lt;C&lt;c_\ast$, we have $$\mathcal S(n) \,:=\, \mathcal S\cap [1,n] \,\le\, \log_2 n +\frac 12 \log_2\log_2 n + C$$ for all $n\in \mathcal N_C$ with asymptotic density $\mathbf d\left(\mathcal N_C\right)=2-2^{c_\ast-C}$. Further, we consider the greedy algorithm for generating these sets and prove that this algorithm always eventually doubles. Finally, we also consider some generalizations of dissociated sets and prove similar results about them.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations for the d'Arcais Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The d'Arcais polynomials $P_n(z)$ for $n\in\{0,1,\dots\}$ are defined as $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} P_n(z) q^n = \exp(-z\ln((q;q)_{\infty}))$ where the $q$-Pochhammer symbol is $(q;q)_{\infty} = \prod_{k=1}^{\infty} (1-q^k)$ for $|q|&lt;1$. Denoting the coefficients for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ by the formula $P_n(z) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} A(2,n,k) z^k/n!$, we prove that $k_n! A(2,n,k_n)/n!$ satisfies a Bahadur-Rao type large deviation formula in the limit $n \to \infty$ with $k_n/n \to \kappa \in [0,1)$ as long as $k_n \to \infty$. The large deviation rate function is the Legendre-Fenchel transform $g^*(-\kappa)$ where $g(\kappa) = f^{-1}(\kappa)$ for the function $f : (0,\infty) \to \mathbb{R}$ given by $f(y)= \ln(-\ln((e^{-y};e^{-y})_{\infty}))$. We relate this fact to information about the abundancy index.</description>

      <title>Recovering polynomials over finite fields from noisy character values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $g(X)$ be a polynomial over a finite field ${\mathbb F}_q$ with degree $o(q^{1/2})$, and let $\chi$ be the quadratic residue character. We give a polynomial time algorithm to recover $g(X)$ (up to perfect square factors) given the values of $\chi \circ g$ on ${\mathbb F}_q$, with up to a constant fraction of the values having errors. This was previously unknown even for the case of no errors.
  We give a similar algorithm for additive characters of polynomials over fields of characteristic $2$. This gives the first polynomial time algorithm for decoding dual-BCH codes of polynomial dimension from a constant fraction of errors.
  Our algorithms use ideas from Stepanov's polynomial method proof of the classical Weil bounds on character sums, as well as from the Berlekamp-Welch decoding algorithm for Reed-Solomon codes. A crucial role is played by what we call *pseudopolynomials*: high degree polynomials, all of whose derivatives behave like low degree polynomials on ${\mathbb F}_q$.
  Both these results can be viewed as algorithmic versions of the Weil bounds for this setting.</description>

      <title>On faithfulness and DP-transformations generated by arithmetic Cantor series expansions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to the study of conditions for the Hausdorff-Besicovitch faithfulness of the family of cylinders generated by Cantor series expansions. We show that there exist subgeometric Cantor series expansions for which the corresponding families of cylinders are not faithful for the Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimension on the unit interval. On the other hand we found a rather wide subfamily of subgeometric Cantor series expansions generating faithful families of cylinders.
  We also study conditions for the Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimension preservation on [0;1] by probability distribution functions of random variables with independent symbols of arithmetic Cantor series expansions.</description>

Abstract: We study a weak form of formality for differential graded algebras, called $A_3$-formality, for the cohomology of pro-p Demushkin groups at odd primes p. We show that the differential graded $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebras of continuous cochains of Demushkin groups with q-invariant not equal 3 are $A_3$-formal, whereas Demushkin groups with q-invariant 3 are not $A_3$-formal. We prove these results by an explicit computation of the Benson-Krause-Schwede canonical class in Hochschild cohomology.</description>

      <title>A proof of Newman's conjecture for the extended Selberg class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.05142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Newman's conjecture (proved by Rodgers and Tao in 2018) concerns a certain family of deformations $\{\xi_t(s)\}_{t \in \mathbb{R}}$ of the Riemann xi function for which there exists an associated constant $\Lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ (called the de Bruijn-Newman constant) such that all the zeros of $\xi_t$ lie on the critical line if and only if $t \geq \Lambda$. The Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the statement that $\Lambda \leq 0$, and Newman's conjecture states that $\Lambda \geq 0$.
  In this paper we give a new proof of Newman's conjecture which avoids many of the complications in the proof of Rodgers and Tao. Unlike the previous best methods for bounding $\Lambda$, our approach does not require any information about the zeros of the zeta function, and it can be readily be applied to a wide variety of $L$-functions. In particular, we establish that any $L$-function in the extended Selberg class has an associated de Bruijn-Newman constant and that all of these constants are nonnegative.
  Stated in the Riemann xi function case, our argument proceeds by showing that for every $t &lt; 0$ the function $\xi_t$ can be approximated in terms of a Dirichlet series $\zeta_t(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\exp(\frac{t}{4} \log^2 n)n^{-s}$ whose zeros then provide infinitely many zeros of $\xi_t$ off the critical line.</description>

Abstract: We study averages of $L$-functions associated with Hecke-Maass cusp forms for $SL(3,\mathbb{Z})$, multiplied by Dirichlet polynomials built from the Fourier coefficients of the cusp forms. To prove this, we employ a variant of the Kuznetsov trace formula. In particular, we show that the reciprocals of these $L$-functions can be approximated by very short Dirichlet polynomials, on average over $t$ and over the forms.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to determine all algebraic relations among various special gamma values over function fields, and prove a Chowla-Selberg-type formula for quasi-periods of CM abelian $t$-modules. Our results are based on the intrinsic relations between gamma values in question and periods of CM dual $t$-motives, which are interpreted in terms of their "distributions". This also enables us to derive an analogue of the Deligne-Gross period conjecture for CM Hodge-Pink structures.</description>

      <title>A Nomizu-van Est theorem in Ekedahl's derived $\ell$-adic setting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.09744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theorem of Nomizu and van Est computes the cohomology of a compact nilmanifold, or equivalently the group cohomology of an arithmetic subgroup of a unipotent linear algebraic group over $\mathbb{Q}$. We prove a similar result for the cohomology of a compact open subgroup of a unipotent linear algebraic group over $\mathbb{Q}_{\ell}$ with coefficients in a complex of continuous $\ell$-adic representations. We work with the triangulated categories defined by Ekedahl which play the role of ``derived categories of continuous $\ell$-adic representations''. This is motivated by Pink's formula computing the derived direct image of an $\ell$-adic local system on a Shimura variety in its minimal compactification, and its application to automorphic perverse sheaves on Shimura varieties. The key technical result is the computation of the cohomology with coefficients in a unipotent representation with torsion coefficients by an explicit complex of polynomial cochains which is of finite type.</description>

To achieve this, we develop a broad framework of identities that we use to derive several applications. Building on similar principles, we also provide an appendix establishing the inequality $\sum_{n\le

Abstract: We consider the parametric family of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ of the form $E_{m} : y^{2} = x(x - n_{1})(x - n_{2}) + t^{2}$, where $n_{1}$, $n_{2}$ and $t$ are particular polynomial expressions in an integral variable $m$. In this paper, we investigate the torsion group $E_{m}(\mathbb{Q})_{\rm{tors}}$, a lower bound for the Mordell-Weil rank $r({E_{m}})$ and the $2$-Selmer group ${\rm{Sel}}_{2}(E_{m})$ under certain conditions on $m$. This extends the previous works done in this direction, which are mostly concerned with the Mordell-Weil ranks of various parametric families of elliptic curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a criterion for an integral domain to be a principal ideal domain (PID), due to Dedekind and Hasse, can also be applied in quaternion orders, and that it can be used to build a finite algorithm to determine if a given order is a principal left (or right) ideal domain. Using this algorithm, we give an alternative proof that the maximal orders of discriminant 7 and 13, which are non-Euclidean, are PIDs.
  We also provide a completely arithmetic proof of a result of Gordon Pall that shows that, in an order that is a PID, an element of whose norm is divisible by an integer $m$ always has a left and a right divisor with norm $m$. This easily yields the existence and uniqueness (up to associates) of factorizations of a quaternion modeled on a factorization of its norm.</description>

Abstract: This article considers the family of elliptic curves given by $E_{p}: y^2=x^3-5px$ and certain conditions on an odd prime $p$. More specifically, we have shown that if $p \equiv 7, 23 \pmod {40}$, then the rank of $E_{p}$ is zero for both $ \mathbb{Q} $ and $ \mathbb{Q}(i) $. Furthermore, if the prime $ p $ is of the form $ 40k_1 + 3 $ or $ 40k_2 + 27$, where $k_1, k_2 \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $(5k_1+1)$ or $(5k_2 +4)$ are perfect squares, then the given family of elliptic curves has rank one over $\mathbb{Q}$ and rank two over $\mathbb{Q}(i)$. Moreover, if the prime $ p $ is of the form $ 40k_3 + 11 $ or $ 40k_4 + 19$ where $k_3 ~\text{and}~ k_4 \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $(160k_3+49)$ or $(160k_4 + 81) $ are perfect squares, then the given family of elliptic curves has rank at least one over $\mathbb{Q}$ and rank at least two over $\mathbb{Q}(i)$.</description>

      <title>The Euler characteristic of $\ell$-adic local systems on $\mathcal{A}_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Euler characteristic of $\ell$-adic local systems on the moduli stack $\mathcal{A}_n$ of principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension $n$ associated to algebraic representations of $\mathbf{GSp}_{2n}$, as virtual representations of the absolute Galois group of $\mathbb{Q}$ and the unramified Hecke algebra of $\mathbf{GSp}_{2n}$. To this end we take the last steps of the Ihara-Langlands-Kottwitz method to compute the intersection cohomology of minimal compactifications of Siegel modular varieties in level one, following work of Kottwitz and Morel, proving an unconditional reformulation of Kottwitz' conjecture in this case. This entails proving the existence of $\mathrm{GSpin}$-valued Galois representations associated to certain level one automorphic representations for $\mathbf{PGSp}_{2n}$ and $\mathbf{SO}_{4n}$. As a consequence we prove the existence of $\mathrm{GSpin}$-valued Galois representations associated to level one Siegel eigenforms, a higher genus analogue of theorems of Deligne (genus one) and Weissauer (genus two). Using Morel's work and Franke's spectral sequence we derive explicit formulas expressing the Euler characteristic of compactly supported cohomology of automorphic $\ell$-adic local systems on Siegel modular varieties in terms of intersection cohomology. Specializing to genus three and level one, we prove an explicit conjectural formula of Bergstr\"om, Faber and van der Geer for the compactly supported Euler characteristic in terms of spin Galois representations associated to level one Siegel cusp forms. Specializing to trivial local systems we give explicit formulas for the number of points of $\mathcal{A}_n$ over finite fields for all $n \leq 7$.</description>

      <title>Modular Periodicity of Random Initialized Recurrences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24882v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical studies of the Fibonacci sequence focus on its periodicity modulo $m$ (the Pisano periods) with canonical initialization. We investigate instead the complete periodic structure arising from all $m^2$ possible initializations in $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$. We discover perfect mirror symmetry between the Fibonacci recurrence $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and its parity transform $a_n = - a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and observe fractal self-similarity in the extension from prime to prime power moduli. Additionally, we classify prime moduli based on their quadratic reciprocity and demonstrate that periodic sequences exhibit weight preservation under modular extension. Furthermore, we define a minima distribution $P(n)$ governed by Lucas ratios, which satisfies the symmetric relation $P(n)=P(1-n)$. For cyclotomic recurrences, we propose explicit counting functions for the number of distinct periods with connections to necklace enumeration. These findings imply potential connections to Viswanath's random recurrence, modular forms and L-functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that there are only finitely many finite fields whose members are the sum of an $n$-potent element and a $5$-potent element. Combining this with the algorithmic results provided by S.D. Cohen {\it et al.}, we confirm in the affirmative the conjecture in \cite{Cohen} concerning all finite fields satisfying this condition. Furthermore, we obtain several elementary results for General problem, proving that the number of finite fields satisfying general condition is also finite.</description>

      <title>The splitting field and generators of the elliptic surface $Y^2=X^3 +t^{360} +1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The splitting field of an elliptic surface $\mathcal{E}/\mathbb{Q}(t)$ is the smallest finite extension $\mathcal{K} \subset \mathbb{C}$ such that all $\mathbb{C}(t)$-rational points are defined over $\mathcal{K}(t)$. In this paper, we provide a symbolic algorithmic approach to determine the splitting field and a set of $68$ linearly independent generators for the Mordell--Weil lattice of Shioda's elliptic surface $Y^2=X^3 +t^{360} +1$. This surface is noted for having the largest known rank 68 for an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{C}(t)$.
  Our methodology utilizes the known decomposition of the Mordell-Weil Lattice of this surface into Lattices of ten rational elliptic surfaces and one $K3$ surface. We explicitly compute the defining polynomials of the splitting field, which reach degrees of 1728 and 5760, and verify the results via height pairing matrices and specialized symbolic software packages.</description>

      <title>On a Smoothed Dirichlet Divisor Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hardy showed that $\sum_{n \ioe x}\tau(n)-x(\log x +2\gamma -1)$ is not $o(x^{1/4})$. In this article, we prove that $\sum_{n \ioe x}\tau(n)(1-\frac{x}{n})-xP(\log x)=\frac{1}{4}+O \left( \frac{\log x}{x^{1/4}} \right)$, where $P$ is a polynomial of degree 2. As a corollary, this estimate enables us to settle a conjecture surmised by Berkane, Bordell\`{e}s, and Ramar\'{e} dealing with the positivity of an integral of the error term in the Dirichlet divisor problem. All results are entirely explicit and allow us to study the proximity between the remainder of the Dirichlet divisor problem and its logarithmic version.</description>

Abstract: Let p be any prime, and $p^(\nu_p(n!))$ the maximal power of $p$ dividing $n!$. It is proved that there exists a positive integer $n_0$, which depends only on $p$, such that $q^(\nu_q(n!)) &lt; p^(\nu_p(n!))$ for all $n \ge n_0$ and all primes $q &gt; p$. For twin primes $p$ and $q = p + 2$ it is proved that the minimal $n_0$ satisfying $q^(\nu_q(n!)) &lt; p^(\nu_p(n!))$ for all $n \ge n_0$ is given by $n_0 = (p^2+p)/2$.</description>

  We present a new proof of Shafarevich's theorem on finiteness of elliptic curves with good reduction outside a given finite set of primes. This gives a new entry point to fundamental diophantine finiteness theorems such as Siegel's theorem on the $S$-unit equation. Our proof is free from diophantine approximation or transcendence theory, and it is closer to the ideas of Faltings in his proof of Mordell's conjecture .</description>

      <title>Automorphic vector-forms using the Cohn-Elkies magic functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce the theory of what we call Hecke vector-forms. A Hecke vector-form can be viewed as a vector function representation of some quasiautomorphic form that transforms like an automorphic form on an arbitrarily chosen Hecke triangle group. In other words, because quasiautomorphic forms have complicated transformation behavior when compared with automorphic forms, the construction of a Hecke vector-form is to retrieve a transformation behavior analogous to the simpler, automorphic case. In this way, a Hecke vector-form can be viewed as the vector function analogue of an automorphic form. Since our work is for any quasi-automorphic form over an arbitrary Hecke triangle group, we briefly review the construction of such groups. Furthermore, we review the derivation of the hauptmodul, the automorphic forms, and the normalized quasiautomorphic form of weight 2 for any Hecke triangle group. We then proceed to the theory of Hecke vector-forms and establish the desired transformation behavior with respect to the generators of the associated group. A proof of this fact is strictly elementary, relying on fine properties of binomial coefficients. Lastly, we relate the vector-forms to Hecke automorphic linear differential equations, which are analogues of the frequently researched modular linear differential equations. Our results include Hecke vector-forms of the classical quasimodular forms as the simplest case.</description>

      <title>Bounded geometry for PCF-special subvarieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For each integer $d\geq 2$, let $M_d$ denote the moduli space of maps $f: \mathbb{P}^1\to \mathbb{P}^1$ of degree $d$. We study the geometric configurations of subsets of postcritically finite (or PCF) maps in $M_d$. A complex-algebraic subvariety $Y \subset M_d$ is said to be PCF-special if it contains a Zariski-dense set of PCF maps. Here we prove that there are only finitely many positive-dimensional irreducible PCF-special subvarieties in $M_d$ with degree $\leq D$. In addition, there exist constants $N = N(D,d)$ and $B = B(D,d)$ so that for any complex algebraic subvariety $X \subset M_d$ of degree $\leq D$, the Zariski closure $\overline{X\cap\mathrm{PCF}}~$ has at most $N$ irreducible components, each with degree $\leq B$. We also prove generalizations of these results for points with small critical height in $M_d(\bar{\mathbb{Q}})$.</description>

      <title>The geometry of preperiodic points in families of maps on $\mathbb{P}^N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of algebraic families of maps on $\mathbb{P}^N$, over the field $\mathbb{C}$ of complex numbers, and the geometry of their preperiodic points. The goal of this note is to formulate a conjectural characterization of the subvarieties of $S \times\mathbb{P}^N$ containing a Zariski-dense set of preperiodic points, where the parameter space $S$ is a quasiprojective complex algebraic variety; the characterization is given in terms of the non-vanishing of a power of the invariant Green current associated to the family of maps. This conjectural characterization is inspired by and generalizes the Relative Manin-Mumford Conjecture for families of abelian varieties, recently proved by Gao and Habegger, and it includes as special cases the Manin-Mumford Conjecture (theorem of Raynaud) and the Dynamical Manin-Mumford Conjecture (posed by Ghioca, Tucker, and Zhang). We provide examples where the equivalence is known to hold, and we show that several recent results can be viewed as special cases. Finally, we give the proof of one implication in the conjectural characterization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For each $N\geq 2$, Asakura and Otsubo have recently introduced a smooth family of algebraic curves $\{X_{N,\lambda}\}_{\lambda \in \mathbb{P}^1\setminus \{0, 1, \infty\}}$ in characteristic 0 that is closely related to hypergeometric functions and the Fermat curve of degree $N$. In this paper, we study the Gross-Kudla-Schoen modified diagonal 1-cycles of these curves. We prove that if $p \ge 3$ is a prime, then for every $\lambda$ the Griffiths Abel-Jacobi image of the modified diagonal cycle of $X_{p,\lambda}$ is nontrivial for every cuspidal choice of a base point. On the other hand, we show that the modified diagonal cycle and hence the Ceresa cycle of $X_{3,\lambda}$ is torsion in the Chow group for every $\lambda$ and every choice of a base point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbbm{P}^{1,an}$ be the Berkovich projective line over a complete, algebraically closed, non-Archimedean field. Let $\phi$ be a degree $\geq 2$ rational map with potential good reduction, acting on $\mathbbm{P}^{1,an}$. In this article, we study the topology of the fixed locus of $\phi$. we show that the reduction of $\phi$ at its type~II totally ramified fixed point dictates the topological structure of the fixed locus of $\phi$. We give an easily verifiable equivalent criterion for the fixed locus of $\phi$ to be connected as well as an equivalent criterion for the fixed locus of $\phi$ to be finite. Moreover, we provide a sharp upper bound for the number of connected components of the fixed locus of a rational map with potential good reduction.</description>

      <title>Multiple polylogarithms at non-positive indices and combinatorics of Magnus polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate multiple polylogarithms with non-positive multi-indices (nonpositive MPLs) from a combinatorial and algebraic viewpoint. By introducing a correspondence between non-positive multiple polylogarithms and Magnus polynomials in a free associative algebra, we obtain an explicit Magnus-type representation of products of mono-indexed non-positive MPLs. The main identity (Theorem A) expresses such a product as a single non-positive MPL indexed by a Magnus polynomial, which may be regarded as a M\"obius inversion of the expansion formula due to Duchamp-Hoang Ngoc Minh-Ngo. Moreover, we study the effects of permuted indices and show that certain differences of Magnus polynomials belong to the kernel of the linear map ${\rm Li}^-_{\bullet}$ , leading to new functional equations among non-positive MPLs of the same weight and depth. These results clarify the combinatorial structure underlying non-positive MPLs and reveal a close connection with the Magnus expansion in non-commutative algebra.</description>
