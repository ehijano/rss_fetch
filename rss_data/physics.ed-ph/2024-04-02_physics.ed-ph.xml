      <title>Society's educational debts in biology, chemistry, and physics across race, gender, and class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of collaborative instruction in helping students achieve higher grades in introductory science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses has led many educators and researchers to assume these methods also address inequities. However, little evidence tests this assumption. Structural inequities in our society have led to the chronic underrepresentation of Black, Hispanic, women, and first-generation students in STEM disciplines. Broadening participation from underrepresented groups in biology, chemistry, and physics would reduce social inequalities while harnessing diversity's economic impact on innovation and workforce expansion. We leveraged data on content knowledge from 18,791 students in 305 introductory courses using collaborative instruction at 45 institutions. We modeled student outcomes across the intersections of gender, race, ethnicity, and first-generation college status within and across science disciplines. Using these models, we examine the educational debts society owes college science students prior to instruction and whether instruction mitigates, perpetuates, or exacerbates those debts. The size of these educational debts and the extent to which courses added to or repaid these debts varied across disciplines. Across all three disciplines, society owed Black and Hispanic women and first-generation Black men the largest educational debts. Collaborative instructional strategies were not sufficient to repay society's educational debts.</description>

      <title>Exploring Faculty Identity Sharing: A Pathway to Empathy in Physics Faculty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates how faculty acquire contextual information about students, examining mechanisms and motivations used when sharing their identity to facilitate empathy. Empathy is "the ability and tendency to share and understand others' internal state" (Zaki and Ochsner, 2012), and is a critical factor in both motivating faculty to enact large scale change and take immediate, smaller actions. This study explores the impact identity sharing has on obtaining contextual information that motivates empathetic action. Nineteen semi structured interviews with physics faculty explored participant identities and interactions across various contexts. Employing emergent thematic coding, we crafted four personas around faculty sharing, teaching values, and student reciprocity. Brooke, the Trust Builder, prioritizes creating an environment of trust by openly discussing their identity, aiming to foster student openness. Nour, the Identity Navigator, shares personal experiences to assist others in navigating their own identities, acknowledging the challenges of college years. Brooke and Nour had more students approaching them with personal issues, indicating a correlation between faculty identity sharing and student openness. Casey, the Cautious Sharer, expresses concerns about potential alienation or backlash, approaching personal sharing with caution. Wray, adopting a Walled Off approach, separates personal and professional life due to past negative experiences or a belief in the importance of that division. Among the faculty interviewed, 15 who were explicitly open about their identities reported that students approached them with personal issues. This study outlines mechanisms influencing when and what faculty share about themselves in different contexts. Our findings underscore the significance of fostering dialogue as the initial step in empathy development.</description>

      <title>Un esercizio di storia della scienza: misurare i periodi dei satelliti galileiani di Giove con il Sidereus Nuncius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After Galileo's publication of the Sidereus Nuncius in 1610, Giovanni Battista Agucchi obtained in 1611 an estimate of the orbital periods of the Galilean satellites of Jupiter using the figures published in the book. The article shows how to repeat these measurements in a teaching context for high school students.</description>
