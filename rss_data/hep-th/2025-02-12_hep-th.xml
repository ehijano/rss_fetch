      <title>Nonrenormalization Theorem for ${\cal N}=(4,4)$ Interface Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a formula for the half-BPS interface entropy between any pair of ${\cal N}=(4,4)$ theories on the same conformal manifold. This generalizes the diastasis formula derived in arXiv:1311.2202 for ${\cal N}=(2,2)$ theories, which is restricted to the conformal submanifolds generated by either chiral or twisted chiral multiples of ${\cal N}=(2,2)$ supersymmetry. To derive the ${\cal N}=(4,4)$ formula, we use the fact that the conformal manifold of ${\cal N}=(4,4)$ theories is symmetric and quaternionic-K\"ahler and that its isotropy group contains the $SU(2) \otimes SU(2)$ external automorphism of the ${\cal N}=(4,4)$ superconformal algebra. As an application of the formula, we prove a supersymmetric non-renormalization theorem, which explains the observation in arXiv:1005.4433 that the interface entropy for half-BPS Janus solutions in type IIB supergravity on ${\it AdS}_3 \times S^3 \times T^4$ coincides with the corresponding quantity in their free conformal field limits.</description>

      <title>Demystifying integrable QFTs in AdS: No-go theorems for higher-spin charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-spin conserved currents and charges feature prominently in integrable 2d QFTs in flat space. Motivated by the question of integrable field theories in AdS space, we consider the consequences of higher-spin currents for QFTs in AdS$_2$, and find that their effect is much more constraining than in flat space. Specifically, it is impossible to preserve: (a)~any higher-spin charges when deforming a massive free field by interactions, or (b)~any spin-4 charges when deforming a CFT by a Virasoro primary. Therefore, in these settings, there are no integrable theories in AdS with higher-spin conserved charges. Along the way, we explain how higher-spin charges lead to integer spacing in the spectrum of primaries, sum rules on the OPE data, and constraints on correlation functions. We also explain a key difference between AdS and flat space: in AdS one cannot `partially' conserve a higher-spin current along particular directions, since the AdS isometries imply full conservation.</description>

      <title>Gradient Flows and the Curvature of Theory Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06940v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metric and potential associated with the gradient property of renormalisation group flow in multiscalar models in $d=4-\varepsilon$ dimensions are studied. The metric is identified with the Zamolodchikov metric of nearly marginal operators on the sphere. An explicit form for the associated Ricci scalar in $d=4-\varepsilon$ is derived, which shows that the space of multiscalar field theories is curved. The potential is identified with a quantity $\widetilde{F}$ that was previously proposed as a weakly monotonic function interpolating between the $a$-theorem in four dimensions and the $F$-theorem in three dimensions. This implies that the $\widetilde{F}$-theorem can be extended perturbatively to a theorem about gradient flow in $d=4-\varepsilon$.</description>

Abstract: Mostly inspired by recent work by Katzarkov, Kontsevich, and Shehsmani, combined with previous work by Aganagic, Ooguri, Saulina and Vafa with regard to BPS black hole microstate counting in terms of topological field theory calculations, we will show how these tools can be applied to concrete setups arising from String Theory, and why the formalism of functorial Homological Mirror Symmetry needs to be further developed.</description>

      <title>Three-Field String Inflation with Perturbative Corrections: Dynamics and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we construct an explicit string motivated example of three-field inflation in a related, yet distinct from, the recently discovered perturbative large volume scenario (pLVS). Contrary to the usual constructions, in this set up, large volume is ensured by the interplay between the effects of $\alpha^{\prime 3}$, logarithmic loop and higher derivative $F^4$ corrections. After addressing a full moduli stabilization scenario, we move on to a detailed analysis of three-field model of inflation in a canonical basis. We conduct multiple consistency checks to establish a solid foundation for our model within the framework of the underlying 4D effective field theory (EFT). Our model differs from previous setups in three key aspects: first, the interaction between subleading corrections that drive full moduli stabilization follows a different pattern, second, the volume form of the underlying Calabi-Yau is different, and third, in our three-field inflation scenario, the second slow-roll parameter consistently dominates over the first by several orders of magnitude. The latter signals the possible presence of primordial features which can be verified by forthcoming ground and space based experiments. We can roughly distinguish two stages of inflation: the first stage mostly occurs in the steepest direction during horizon crossing giving us almost $55$ efolds of inflation-- once one of the inflatons falls off the ridge and then to its true minimum, the other two fields become active, giving us a truly multi-field behavior in the second stage -- adding few more efodls of inflation. We also confirm our claim by introducing the non-planar torsion in the inflationary trajectory -- this quantity becomes non-trivial in the second stage of inflation. Finally, we calculate the cosmological observables, which align with Planck data, and discuss potential directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Interpolating families of integrable AdS3 backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct families of integrable deformations that interpolate between the $AdS_3\times S^3\times S^3\times S^1$ and either $AdS_3\times S^3\times S^2\times T^2$ or $AdS_3\times S^2\times S^2\times T^3$. They preserve half of the supersymmetry of the original background, namely one copy of the $\mathfrak{d}(2,1;\alpha)$ algebra. From this it follows a similar integrable interpolation between $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$ and $AdS_3\times S^2\times T^5$, which also preserves half of the supersymmetry, namely a copy of the $\mathfrak{psu}(1,1|2)$ algebra. In all cases, the interpolating backgrounds are constructed by using TsT transformations, which makes it easy to implement them in the integrability formalism in the full quantum theory. To illustrate this point, we discuss the lightcone gauge fixing of the models and compute their pp-wave Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Quantumness in (A)dS spacetimes with Unruh-DeWitt Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probing quantumness in curved spacetime is regarded as one of fundamental and important topics in the framework of relativistic quantum information. In this work, we focus on the theoretical feasibility of probing quantum properties in de Sitter (dS) and Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes via detectors. By employing the Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled with a massless scalar field, which is treated as an open system, quantum uncertainty and quantum coherence in both dS and AdS spacetimes are investigated. Our analysis reveals that the acceleration in dS spacetime and the boundary conditions in AdS spacetime significantly impact the detector's evolution in the initial stage. Notably, both of the uncertainty and coherence will oscillate with the initial state being in a superposition state, however the high temperature is able to suppress their oscillation. Interestingly, it is found that the constant values of the final uncertainty and coherence are identical as those in dS and AdS spacetimes, which are determined by the ratio of energy gap to temperature. Hence, the current exploration offers insight into quantumness in dS and AdS spacetimes, and might be helpful to facilitate the curved-spacetime-based quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Note on hidden zeros and expansions of tree-level amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we derive and interpret hidden zeros of tree-level amplitudes of various theories, including Yang-Mills, non-linear sigma model, special Galileon, Dirac-Born-Infeld, and gravity, by utilizing universal expansions of tree-level amplitudes which expand amplitudes of different theories to those of bi-adjoint scalar theory. Hidden zeros of above amplitudes are attributed to zeros of bi-adjoint scalar amplitudes which can be easily proved. For unordered amplitudes such as gravitational ones, the kinematic condition for zeros causes potential divergences of propagators. We also show the detailed mechanism of eliminating such divergences.</description>

      <title>Bound states of a fermion-dyon system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bound states of fermions in the external field of an Abelian dyon are studied here both analytically and numerically. Their existence is due to the dyon's electric charge resulting from a polarization of the fermionic vacuum. The configuration of the dyon's field is not invariant under $P$ or $CP$ transformations. The dependence of the energy levels of the fermion-dyon system on a parameter of $CP$ violation is investigated. The absence of $P$ invariance results in nonzero electric dipole moments of the bound fermionic states. These depend nontrivially on the parameter of $CP$ violation. The bound fermionic states also possess nonzero magnetic dipole moments. Unlike the electric dipole moments, the magnetic dipole moments are practically independent of the parameter of $CP$ violation. In addition, the magnitudes of the electric dipole moments significantly exceed those of the magnetic dipole moments.</description>

      <title>Gauge Origami and BPS/CFT correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauge origami is a generalized supersymmetric gauge theory defined on several intersecting space-time components. It provides a systematic way to consider generalizations of instantons. In this thesis, we explore the gauge origami system in $\mathbb{R}^{1,1}\times \mathbb{C}^{4}$ and its BPS/CFT correspondence. String theoretically, instantons of the gauge origami system arise from D0-branes bound to D$(2p)$-branes wrapping cycles in $\mathbb{C}^{4}$. The low energy theory of the D0-branes is understood as an $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric quiver quantum mechanical system and the Witten index of it produces the instanton partition function. We define a $q$-deformed quiver Cartan matrix associated to this quiver structure and introduce vertex operators associated with the D-branes and show that the contour integral formula for the Witten index has a nice free field realization. Such free field realization leads to the concept of BPS $qq$-characters or BPS quiver W-algebras, which are generalizations of the conventional deformed W-algebras. The $qq$-characters of D2 and D4-branes correspond to screening charges and generators of the affine quiver W-algebra, respectively. On the other hand, the $qq$-characters of D6 and D8-branes represent novel types of $qq$-characters, where monomial terms are characterized by plane partitions and solid partitions. The composition of these $qq$-characters yields the instanton partition functions of the gauge origami system, eventually establishing the BPS/CFT correspondence. Additionally, we demonstrate that the fusion of $qq$-characters of D-branes in lower dimensions results in higher-dimensional D-brane $qq$-characters. We also investigate quadratic relations among these $qq$-characters. Furthermore, we explore the relationship with the representations of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_{1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review some recent developments in 1-st order GLSM construction, or so-called Gross-Neveu formalism for sigma models. We recall the general idea behind this framework and describe a 1-st order GLSM data from which the general generalized Gross-Neveu model can be constructed, using $\mathbb{CP}^{n-1}$ sigma model as simplest example. Then, we formulate a general statement that answers the question of which generalized Gross-Neveu models are equivalent to sigma models on compact homogeneous Hermitian spaces of classical groups endowed with the normal metrics.</description>

Abstract: We recall our work in the 1980s taking seriously the maximal eleven dimensions of supergravity, in particular the round, left squashed and right squashed $S^7$ compactifications to $D=4$ yielding $\mathcal N=8$, $\mathcal N=1$ and $\mathcal N=0$, respectively. This involved Kaluza-Kein techniques that have found wider applications such as spontaneous compactification, holonomy and supersymmetry, topology versus geometry, squashing and Higgs, vacuum stability and consistent truncations.</description>

      <title>Searching for Inflationary Physics with the CMB Trispectrum: 3. Constraints from Planck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06931v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Is there new physics hidden in the four-point function of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)? We conduct a detailed analysis of the Planck PR4 temperature and polarization trispectrum for $\ell\in[2,2048]$. Using the theoretical and computational tools developed in Paper 1 and Paper 2, we search for 33 template amplitudes, encoding a variety of effects from inflationary self-interactions to particle exchange. We find no evidence for primordial non-Gaussianity and set stringent constraints on both phenomenological amplitudes and couplings in the inflationary Lagrangian. Due to the use of optimal estimators and polarization data, our constraints are highly competitive. For example, we find $\sigma(g_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc})=4.8\times 10^4$ and $\tau_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc} &lt;1500$ (95\% CL), a factor of two improvement on Effective Field Theory amplitudes, and a $43\sigma$ detection of gravitational lensing. Many templates are analyzed for the first time, such as direction-dependent trispectra and the collapsed limit of the `cosmological collider', across a range of masses and spins. We perform a variety of validation tests; whilst our results are stable, the most relevant systematics are found to be lensing bias, residual foregrounds, and mismatch between simulations and data. The techniques discussed in this series can be extended to future datasets, allowing the primordial Universe to be probed at even higher sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Acceleration-induced radiation from a qudit particle detector model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We nonperturbatively examine the emission rate of acceleration-induced radiation from a uniformly accelerated gapless qudit-type Unruh-DeWitt detector. We find that the emission rate can be written as Larmor's formula multiplied by a factor that depends on the detector's initial state. In particular, certain initial states of integer-spin detectors do not produce radiation. Although the appearance of Larmor's formula may suggest a classical phenomenon, we argue that the resulting radiation is fundamentally distinct from that of structureless classical sources, as it evolves into a multimode coherent state correlated with the detector's internal degree of freedom. Thus, gapless detectors cannot be treated as structureless sources, as previously proposed.</description>

      <title>All axion dark matter from supersymmetric models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supersymmetric models accompanied by certain anomaly-free discrete R-symmetries Z_n^R are attractive in that 1. the R-symmetry (which can arise from compactified string theory as a remnant of the broken 10-d Lorentz symmetry) forbids unwanted superpotential terms while allowing for the generation of an accidental, approximate global U(1)_{PQ} symmetry needed to solve the strong CP problem and 2. they provide a raison d'etre for an otherwise ad-hoc R-parity conservation. We augment the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) by two additional Z_n^R- and PQ-charged fields X and Y wherein SUSY breaking at an intermediate scale m_{hidden} leads to PQ breaking at a scale f_a\sim 10^{11} GeV leading to a SUSY DFSZ axion. The same SUSY breaking can trigger R-parity breaking via higher-dimensional operators leading to tiny R-violating couplings of order (f_a/m_P)^N and a WIMP quality problem. For Z_4^R and Z_8^R, we find only an N=1 suppression. Then the lightest SUSY particle (LSP) of the MSSM becomes unstable with a lifetime of order ~ 10^{-3}-10 seconds so the LSPs all decay away before the present epoch.

      <title>WilloWISPs: A New Dark Growth Channel for Black Holes Suggests a Full-Spectrum Hierarchical MACHO Mass Function for Dark Matter</title>

Abstract: Evidence of neutron stars with deconfined quark-matter cores suggest a new pathway for the evolution of black holes. New theories about the cores of neutron stars support the idea that quarkonium is likely to grow there as the neutron star ages. Surveys of stellar remnants have shown that there is no major mass gap between neutron stars and black holes. Black holes, specifically primordial ones (PBHs), have been suggested as an explanation for dark matter before. However, the way that very large black holes can form in the lifetime of the visible universe has only recently been explained with the solution to The Final Parsec Problem. If neutron stars can become exotic stars or black holes, then they may persist long enough to quiescently provide enough mass in dense matter regions to allow Intermediate-Mass Black Holes (IMBH) and Supermassive Black Holes (SMBH) to form quickly via coalescence. We find that a hierarchical clustering of Massive and Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs) with axion-dominated mini-halos can help to explain all of the missing dark matter. The model presented here suggests that this type of MACHO is likely equivalent to black holes above an unknown critical mass, which is less than ~5 $M_{\odot}$, and that they ought to form quark stars below this mass. If quark stars are a metastable transition between neutron stars and black holes, then black holes ought to be equivalent to boson stars with event horizons, after all the residual quark material has formed a Bose-Einstein condensate of mesons.</description>

      <title>Gauge origami on broken lines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In analogy to Nekrasov's theory of gauge origami on intersecting branes, we introduce the gauge origami moduli space on broken lines. We realize this moduli space as a Quot scheme parametrising zero-dimensional quotients of a torsion sheaf on two intersecting affine lines, and describe it as a moduli space of quiver representations. We construct a virtual fundamental class and virtual structure sheaf, by which we define $K$-theoretic invariants. We compute its associated partition function for all ranks, and show that it reproduces the generating series of equivariant $\chi_{y}$-genus when the moduli space is smooth. Finally, we relate our partition function with the virtual invariants of the Quot schemes of the affine plane and Nekrasov's partition function.</description>

      <title>Non-linear integral equations for the XXX spin-1/2 quantum chain with non-diagonal boundary fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The XXX spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain with non-diagonal boundary
  fields represents a cornerstone model in the study of integrable systems
  with open boundaries. Despite its significance, solving this model exactly
  has remained a formidable challenge due to the breaking of $U(1)$
  symmetry. Building on the off-diagonal Bethe Ansatz (ODBA), we derive a set
  of nonlinear integral equations (NLIEs) that encapsulate the exact spectrum
  of the model.
  For $U(1)$ symmetric spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chains such NLIEs involve two
  functions $a(x)$ and $\bar{a}(x)$ coupled by an integration kernel with
  short-ranged elements. The solution functions show characteristic features
  for arguments at some length scale which grows logarithmically with system
  size $N$.
  For the non $U(1)$ symmetric case, the equations involve a novel third
  function $c(x)$, which captures the inhomogeneous contributions of the
  $T$-$Q$ relation. The kernel elements coupling this function to the
  standard ones are long-ranged and lead for the ground-state to a winding
  phenomenon. In $\log(1+a(x))$ and $\log(1+\bar a(x))$ we observe a
  sudden change by $2\pi$i at a characteristic scale $x_1$ of the
  argument. Other features appear at a value $x_0$ which is of order $\log N$.
  These two length scales, $x_1$ and $x_0$, are independent: their ratio
  $x_1/x_0$ is large for small $N$ and small for large $N$. Explicit
  solutions to the NLIEs are obtained numerically for these limiting cases,
  though intermediate cases ($x_1/x_0 \sim 1$) present computational
  challenges.
  This work lays the foundation for studying finite-size corrections and
  conformal properties of other integrable spin chains with non-diagonal
  boundaries, opening new avenues for exploring boundary effects in quantum
  integrable systems.</description>

      <title>The Weinberg no-go theorem for cosmological constant and nonlocal gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how a nonlocal gravitational interaction can circumvent the Weinberg no-go theorem on cosmological constant, which forbids the existence of any solution to the cosmological constant problem within the context of local field theories unless some fine-tuning is assumed. In particular, Infinite Derivative Gravity theories hint at a possible understanding of the cosmological constant as a nonlocal gravitational effect on very large scales. In this perspective, one can describe the observed cosmic acceleration in terms of an effective field theory without relying on the fine-tuning of parameters or additional matter fields.</description>

      <title>Yukawa coupling, and inflationary correlation functions for a spectator scalar via stochastic spectral expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic spectator scalar field coupled to fermion via the Yukawa interaction, in the inflationary de Sitter background. We consider the fermion to be massless, and take the one loop effective potential found earlier by using the exact fermion propagator in de Sitter spacetime. We take the potential for the spectator scalar to be quintessence-like, $V(\phi)=\alpha |\phi|^p$ ($\alpha \ensuremath{&gt;} 0,\ p\ensuremath{&gt;} 4$), so that the total effective potential is generically bounded from below for all values of the parameters and couplings, and a late time equilibrium state is allowed. Using next the stochastic spectral expansion method, we numerically investigate the two point correlation function, as well as the density fluctuations corresponding to the spectator field, with respect to the three parameters of the total effective potential, $\alpha,\ p$ and the Yukawa coupling, $g$. In particular, we find that the power spectrum and the spectral index corresponds to blue tilt with increasing $g$. The three point correlation function and non-Gaussianity corresponding to the density fluctuation has also been investigated. The increasing Yukawa coupling is shown to flatten the peak of the shape function in the squeezed limit. Also in this limit, the increase in the same is shown to increase the local non-Gaussianity parameter.</description>

      <title>Modified theories of gravity at different curvature scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General Relativity (GR) remains the cornerstone of gravitational physics, providing remarkable success in describing a wide range of astrophysical and cosmological phenomena. However, several challenges underscore the urgent need to explore modified gravity theories. GR struggles to reconcile with quantum mechanics, fails to provide fundamental explanations for dark matter and dark energy, and faces limitations in describing extreme regimes such as black hole singularities and the very early universe. This review provides an organized perspective on modified gravity theories by classifying them based on the principles of GR they preserve or violate. Specifically, we consider three broad categories: (1) metric theories that uphold local Lorentz invariance (LLI) and gauge invariance, (2) theories that break gauge invariance, LLI, or parity, and (3) beyond-metric theories that violate the Einstein's equivalence principle (EEP). This classification highlights the underlying assumptions of GR that these theories challenge or extend, providing a framework for understanding their motivations and implications. The review also discusses the current and upcoming experimental and observational tests of GR, including those probing its foundational principles, such as LLI, gauge invariance, and EEP. For each class of modified theories, we examine their ability to address critical open questions in cosmology and black hole physics. These include their potential to explain the accelerated expansion of the current universe, the nature of dark matter, and deviations in black hole dynamics from GR predictions. This review aims to provide a structured understanding of modified gravity theories and their observational implications in the multimessenger era by focusing on the principles preserved or violated.

      <title>Signatures of modified gravity from the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To date, no observational confirmation of dark matter particles has been found. In this paper, we put forward an alternative approach to inferring evidence for dark matter through modified gravity, without invoking fundamental dark matter particles. Specifically, we explore the possibility of extracting signatures of Kaluza-Klein gravity through the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect. Kaluza-Klein theory has recently been proposed as an alternative to the dark sector, and predicts a tower of particles, including spin-0 and spin-1 gravitons alongside the usual spin-2 gravitons, which can gravitationally couple to matter. We thus analyze a quantum system in free fall around a gravitating body in the presence of a modified Yukawa-like gravitational potential, and determine the gravitational phase induced by the additional degrees of freedom introduced by the Kaluza-Klein model. Our results reveal that, in addition to the usual result from General Relativity, the quantum wave function of the system exhibits an additional effect: a splitting of the energy levels with a new quantum number due to the extra vector gravitational degrees of freedom. The energy splitting difference between general relativity and Kaluza-Klein gravity is found to be of the order of meV for an atomic system and eV for a nuclear system. Similar values also arise in generic modified gravity models and can be feasibly tested in the future. Numerical estimates for the graviton mass are also provided, and potential imprints on gravitational waves are mentioned.</description>

      <title>Classification of Gapped Domain Walls of Topological Orders in 2+1 dimensions: A Levin-Wen Model Realization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel systematic construction of gapped domain walls (GDWs) within the Levin-Wen (LW) model, advancing our understanding of topological phases. By gluing two LW models along their open sides in a compatible way, we achieve a complete GDW classification by subsets of bulk input data, encompassing $e$-$m$ exchanging GDWs. A generalized bimodule structure is introduced to capture domain-wall excitations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that folding along any GDW yields a gapped boundary (GB) described by a Frobenius algebra of the input UFC for the folded model, thus bridging GDW and GB classifications within a unified framework.</description>

      <title>Fock state probability changes in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems are powerful effective descriptions of quantum systems interacting with their environments. Studying changes of Fock states probabilities can be intricate in this context since the prevailing description of open quantum dynamics is by master equations of the systems' reduced density matrices, which usually requires finding solutions for a set of complicated coupled differential equations. In this article, we show that such problems can be circumvented by employing a recently developed path integral-based method for directly computing reduced density matrices in scalar quantum field theory. For this purpose, we consider a real scalar field $\phi$ as an open system interacting via a $\lambda \chi^2\phi^2$-term with an environment comprising another real scalar field $\chi$ that has a finite temperature. In particular, we investigate how the probabilities for observing the vacuum or two-particle states change over time if there were initial correlations of these Fock states. Subsequently, we apply our resulting expressions to a neutrino toy model. We show that, within our model, lighter neutrino masses would lead to a stronger distortion of the observable number of particles due to the interaction with the environment after the initial production process.</description>

      <title>The one-loop effective action from the coherent state path integral of loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adopt a novel approach to combine path integral methods with Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). Our approach builds upon the recently developed coherent state path integral formulation of LQG to compute the one-loop effective action. We compare this methodology with the conventional Quantum Field Theory (QFT) prescription for path integrals and extend the formalism to account for the dependence on boundary (coherent) states. This work aims to explore two aspects: to compare our results with the divergences observed in one-loop calculations of Einstein gravity testing UV-finiteness and to initiate an exploration of the IR effective properties of LQG. We compute the effective action around flat spacetime obtaining analytical and numerical results in the long and short wavelength approximations, respectively. Due to the one-loop dynamics of the LQG area, we find a divergence-free effective action. We study the propagator and the dynamical modes and derive the quantum equation of motion at one loop. We ensure consistency with the semiclassical approximation in the long wavelength limit and, beyond this approximation, analyze numerical scaling as the lattice size increases.</description>

Abstract: We define and compute algebraically a "perturbative part" of protected sphere correlation functions in the M2 brane SCFTs. These correlation functions are expected to have a holographic description in terms of twisted, $\Omega$-deformed M-theory. We uncover a hidden perturbative triality symmetry which supports this conjecture. We also discuss some variants of the setup, involving M2 branes at $A_k$ singularities and D3 branes with a transverse compact direction.</description>

      <title>Structure of Massive Gauge/Gravity Scattering Amplitudes, Equivalence Theorems, and Extended Double-Copy with Compactified Warped Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12713v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the structure of scattering amplitudes of massive Kaluza-Klein (KK) states in the compactified 5-dimensional warped gauge and gravity theories. We present systematic formulations of the gauge theory equivalence theorem (GAET) and the gravitational equivalence theorem (GRET) for warped KK theories in $R_\xi^{}$ gauge, where the GAET connects the scattering amplitudes of longitudinal KK gauge bosons to that of the corresponding KK Goldstone bosons and the GRET connects the scattering amplitudes of KK gravitons of helicity-zero (helicity-one) to that of the corresponding gravitational scalar (vector) KK Goldstone bosons. We analyze the structure of 3-point and 4-point scattering amplitudes of massive KK gauge bosons and of massive KK gravitons as well as their corresponding Goldstone bosons. We first prove the GAET and GRET explicitly for the fundamental 3-point KK gauge/gravity scattering amplitudes. We then demonstrate that the validity of the GAET and GRET for 4-point gauge/gravity scattering amplitudes can be reduced to the validity of GAET and GRET for 3-point gauge/gravity scattering amplitudes at tree level. With these, we study the double-copy construction of KK scattering amplitudes in the warped gauge/gravity theories. We newly realize the double-copy for massive 3-point full gauge/gravity amplitudes at tree level under proper correspondences of color-kinematics and of gauge/gravity couplings, whereas we can construct the double-copy for 4-point KK gauge/gravity amplitudes to the leading order (LO) of high energy expansion. We also conjecture that this LO double-copy construction can be extended to $N$-point scattering amplitudes with $N\!\geqslant 5$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14056v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we have extensively investigated the dynamics of circular geodesic (chargeless massive particle) followed by the investigation of the pulsating classical string in the p-brane background. This study is a continuation of our previous work JHEP10(2023)189, in which we numerically identified the presence of chaos for a classical string hovering near generic p-branes ($p &lt; 7$). Here, for a particle probe, we have found evidence of chaos in the vicinity of the horizon. Furthermore, we observed a violation of the well-known MSS bound in specific extremal p-branes; however, no such violation is seen in the non-extremal cases. Similar observations were made for the classical string, where the violation of the bound is significant near the horizon. Thus, our semi-analytical arguments demonstrate that chaotic dynamics in black p-branes exhibit the (generalized) universal bound with notable violations, regardless of whether a particle or classical string is used as a probe.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Deformations of Berglund H\"ubsch Mirror Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate here the deformations of Berglund H\"ubsch loop and chain mirrors where the original manifolds are defined in the same weighted projective space. We show that the deformations are equivalent by two methods. First, we map directly the two models to each other and show that the deformations are the same for $79$ "Good" models, but not for the $77$ "Bad" ones. We then investigate the orbifold of the mirror pair by the maximal symmetry group and show that the number of deformations is the same and that they are almost the same, i.e., the first four exponents of the deformations are identical.</description>

      <title>Bulk Reconstruction and Gauge Invariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02534v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the concept of bulk reconstruction, which involves mapping bulk operators into CFT operators to understand the emergence of spacetime and gravity. We argue that the $N=\infty$ approximation fails to capture crucial aspects of gravity, as it does not respect gauge invariance and lacks direct connections between energy and boundary metrics. Key concepts such as entanglement wedge reconstruction and holographic error correction codes, which are based on the $N=\infty$ theory, may be incorrect or require significant revision when finite $N$ effects are considered. We present explicit examples demonstrating discrepancies in bulk reconstructions and suggest that a gauge-invariant approach is necessary for an accurate understanding.</description>

      <title>Nicolai maps for supersymmetric sigma models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18855v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supersymmetric field theories can be characterized by their Nicolai map, which is a nonlinear and nonlocal field transformation to their free-field limit. The systematic construction of such maps has recently been outlined for actions with power more than two in the fermions, which produces a perturbative expansion in loop-decorated fermionic tree diagrams. We thoroughly investigate the nonlinear $\mathbb C P^1$ sigma model in ($3{+}1$)-dimensional Minkowski space as a paradigmatical example. We construct and test a chiral form of the Nicolai map, to third order in the coupling, including all (regularized) quantum parts. In addition, all trees with one or two edges are summed up. The free-action condition determines only the one-edge part of the map. We resolve the fermion loop decoration of the Nicolai trees by injecting an auxiliary vector field and present the ensuing classical Nicolai map to second order in a dimensionful coupling.</description>

      <title>De Sitter quantum gravity and the emergence of local algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum theories of gravity are generally expected to have some degree of non-locality, with familiar local physics emerging only in a particular limit. Perturbative quantum gravity around backgrounds with isometries and compact Cauchy slices provides an interesting laboratory in which this emergence can be explored. In this context, the remaining isometries are gauge symmetries and, as a result, gauge-invariant observables cannot be localized. Instead, local physics can arise only through certain relational constructions.
  We explore such issues below for perturbative quantum gravity around de Sitter space. In particular, we describe a class of gauge-invariant observables which, under appropriate conditions, provide good approximations to certain algebras of local fields. Our results suggest that, near any minimal $S^d$ in dS$_{d+1}$, this approximation can be accurate only over regions in which the corresponding global time coordinate $t$ spans an interval $\Delta t \lesssim O(\ln G^{-1})$. In contrast, however, we find that the approximation can be accurate over arbitrarily large regions of global dS$_{d+1}$ so long as those regions are located far to the future or past of such a minimal $S^d$. This in particular includes arbitrarily large parts of any static patch.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thus far, the literature regarding holographic complexity almost entirely focuses on the context of $(d+1)$-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime rather than the full higher-dimensional gauge/gravity duality in string or M theory. We provide a framework to study holographic complexity in the full duality, explaining the relation of complexity functionals in the higher-dimensional theory to those in anti-de Sitter spacetime and when complexity functionals can apply universally to gauge/gravity dualities rather than a specific dual pair. We also show that gauge invariance constrains boundary terms for complexity functionals, using the ten- and eleven-dimensional supergravity actions as key examples. Finally, we propose new universal complexity functionals following these considerations, including a revised gauge-invariant action complexity.</description>

      <title>Timelike Supersymmetric Solutions of D=3, N=4 Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study timelike supersymmetric solutions of a $D=3, N=4$ gauged supergravity using Killing spinor bilinears method and prove that AdS$_3$ is the only solution within this class. We then consider the ungauged version of this model. It is found that for this type of solutions, the ungauged theory effectively truncates to a supergravity coupled to a sigma model with a 2-dimensional hyperbolic target space $\mathbb{H}^2$, and all solutions can be expressed in terms of two arbitrary holomorphic functions. The spacetime metric is a warped product of the time direction with a 2-dimensional space, and the warp factor is given in terms of the K\"ahler potential of $\mathbb{H}^2$. We show that when the holomorphic function that determines the sigma model scalar fields is not constant, the metric on the sigma model target manifold becomes part of the spacetime metric. We then look at some special choices for these holomorphic functions for which the spacetime metric and the Killing spinors are only radial dependent. We also derive supersymmetric null solutions of the ungauged model which are pp-waves on the Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Topological Defects from Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates cosmic topological defects in gauge theories, focusing on models with an $SU(N)$ gauge group coupled with a single flavor, explored through a holographic framework. At low energies, the effective theory is described by an axion-like particle resulting from the spontaneous breaking of the axial $U(1)_A$ flavor symmetry. As the Universe cools below a critical temperature, the chiral symmetry is broken, and non-trivial vacuum configurations form, resulting in the creation of cosmic strings and domain walls. We provide a UV description of these defects in a particular holographic theory, the Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model, as probe D6-branes. We show the presence of a first-order phase transition separating string loop from domain wall solutions. String loops charged under the baryon symmetry and with angular momentum - vortons - can be understood as excitations of a topological phase of matter given by a Chern-Simons theory living on the D6-brane world volume. Finally, we provide an effective description of string loops and vortons in terms of degrees of freedom living on the flavor brane, i.e. mesonic modes.</description>

      <title>The lack of influence of the scalar hair on the DC conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently obtained black hole solutions within the framework of beyond-Horndeski theories, which have the advantage of featuring primary hair, are generalized in the presence of two axionic fields. In order to induce a momentum dissipation, the axionic field solutions are homogeneously distributed along the horizon coordinates of the planar base manifold. We show that, despite the explicit dependence of the scalar field and the metric on the primary hair, this latter does not directly affect the calculation of transport properties. Its influence is indirect, modifying the horizon location, but the transport properties themselves do not explicitly depend on the hair parameter. We take a step further and show that even within a more general class of beyond-Horndeski theories, where the scalar field depends linearly on the hair parameter, the scalar hair still has no direct impact on the DC conductivity. This result underscores the robustness of our earlier findings, and seem to confirm that the transport properties remain unaffected by the explicit presence of the hair parameter.</description>

      <title>Large $N$ limits of supersymmetric quantum field theories: A pedagogical overview</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The different large $N$ limits of supersymmetric quantum field theories in three, four, and five dimensions are reviewed. We distinguish between the planar limit of SQCD theories, the M-theory limit suited in three and five dimensions, and the long quiver limit. The method to solve exactly the sphere partition functions in each type of limit is spelled out in a pedagogical way. After a comprehensive general treatment of the saddle point approximation in the large $N$ limit, we present an extensive list of examples and detail the calculations. The scope of this overview is to provide an entry-level, computation-oriented understanding of the techniques featured in the field theory side of the AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

Abstract: There is a hearsay that the PST approach to the covariant Lagrangian description of relativistic duality invariant theories is somewhat complicated. I will show, using an example of a chiral two-form field theory in six space-time dimensions, that it is actually natural and very simple. It directly stems from the Hamiltonian formulation of chiral-form theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01487v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrary to conformal transformations, disformal transformations can change the principal null directions of a spacetime geometry. Thus, depending on the frame a gravitational wave (GW) detector minimally couples to, the properties of GWs may change under a disformal transformation. In this paper, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions which determine whether GWs change under disformal transformations or not. Our argument is coordinate-independent and can be applied to any spacetime geometry at the fully non-linear level. As an example, we show that an exact radiative solution of massless Einstein-scalar gravity which admits only shear-free parallel transported frame is mapped to a disformed geometry which does not possess any shear-free parallel transported frame. This radiative geometry and its disformed counterpart provide a concrete example of the possibility to generate tensorial GWs from a disformal transformation at the fully non-linear level. This type of non-linear effect can be completely overlooked in the usual linear perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Chronology Protection Conjecture in The Dyonic Kerr-Sen Black Hole Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Chronology Protection Conjecture (CPC) was first introduced by Hawking after his semi-classical investigation to the behaviour of a spacetime with closed timelike curves (CTCs) in response to scalar perturbation. It is argued that there would be instabilities leading to amplification of the perturbation and finally causing collapse of the region with CTCs. In this work, we investigate the CPC by exactly solve the Klein-Gordon equation in the region inside the inner horizon of the non-extremal Dyonic Kerr-Sen~(KS) black hole, where closed timelike curves exist. Successfully find the exact radial solution, we apply the polynomial condition that turns into rule of the energy quantization. The quasinormal modes~(QNMs) of the scalar fields in the region inside the inner horizon of the rotating black hole with nonzero energy have only positive imaginary part describing states that grow in time. The exponentially growing modes will backreact and deform the spacetime region where CTC exists. The CPC is proven to be valid in the Dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole spacetime. Moreover, since the Dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole is the most general axisymmetric black hole solution of the string inspired Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion (EMDA) theory, the semiclassical proof in this work is also valid for all simpler rotating black holes of the EMDA theory. The structure of the Dyonic KS spacetime distinctive from the Kerr-Newman counterpart is also explored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06582v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments have reported strong evidence of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). If interpreted as primordial Gravitational Waves (pGWs), the signal favors a strongly blue-tilted spectrum. On the other hand, the Ekpyrosis-bouncing cosmology with a strongly blue-tilted GW spectrum, i.e., $n_T \simeq 2$, offers a potential explanation for the observed SGWB signal. In this paper, we construct a concrete Ekpyrosis-bouncing model, and show its capacity to intepret the PTA result without pathologies. Both tensor and scalar perturbations are analysed with constraints from the current observations.</description>

Abstract: We present the canonical analysis of different versions of unimodular gravity defined in the Pleba\'nski formalism, based on a (generally complex) SO(3) spin connection and set of (self-dual) two-forms. As in the metric formulation of unimodular gravity, one can study either a theory with fixed volume form or work in a parametrised formalism in which the cosmological constant becomes a dynamical field, constrained to be constant by the field equations. In the first case, the Hamiltonian density contains a part which is not constrained to vanish, but rather constrained to be constant, again as in the metric formulation. We also discuss reality conditions and challenges in extracting Lorentzian solutions.</description>

      <title>Disentangling critical quantum spin chains with Clifford circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clifford circuits can be utilized to disentangle quantum states with polynomial cost, thanks to the Gottesman-Knill theorem. Based on this idea, the Clifford circuits augmented matrix product states (CAMPS) method, which is a seamless integration of Clifford circuits within the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm, was proposed recently and was shown to be able to reduce entanglement in various quantum systems. In this work, we further explore the power of the CAMPS method in critical spin chains described by conformal field theories (CFTs) in the scaling limit. We find that the optimized disentanglers correspond to {\it duality} transformations, which significantly reduce the entanglement entropy in the ground state. For the critical quantum Ising spin chain governed by the Ising CFT with self-duality, the Clifford circuits found by CAMPS coincide with the duality transformation, i.e., the Kramers-Wannier self-duality in the critical Ising chain. It reduces the entanglement entropy by mapping the free conformal boundary condition to the fixed one. In the more general case of the XXZ chain, the CAMPS gives rise to a duality transformation mapping the model to the quantum Ashkin-Teller spin chain. Our results highlight the potential of the framework as a versatile tool for uncovering hidden dualities and simplifying the entanglement structure of critical quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate quantum information measures in ion traps by utilizing the harmonic oscillator model to characterize trapped potentials and ion dynamics. Our findings confirm that, in the steady-state case, mutual information and synchronization measures exhibit similar behaviors. Additionally, we explore how these measures change in the quench model and how they are influenced by coupling and external noise, such as an external magnetic field. Moreover, for a proposed target ground state, we determine the circuit depth and analyze the effects of the external magnetic field and coupling constant, highlighting their dynamic evolution over time. We also discuss the coherent state of a single ion in a trap, noting an inverse relationship between complexity and fidelity-where increased fidelity corresponds to decreased system complexity, indicating a more ordered state with improved control and optimization. However, at higher system frequencies, complexity increases due to intricate interactions and rapid state changes, necessitating advanced control mechanisms.</description>
