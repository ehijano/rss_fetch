      <title>Stability of quasicrystalline ultracold fermions to dipolar interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic potentials can be used to interpolate between localization and delocalization in one dimension. However, little is known about the stability of quasicrystalline phases to long-range interactions. In this work, we study repulsive ultracold dipolar fermions in a quasiperiodic optical lattice to characterize the behavior of interacting quasicrystals. We simulate the full time evolution of the typical experimental protocols used to probe quasicrystalline order and localization properties. We extract experimentally measurable dynamical observables and correlation functions to characterize the three phases observed in the noninteracting setting: localized, intermediate, and extended. We then study the stability of such phases to repulsive dipolar interactions. We find that dipolar interactions can completely alter the shape of the phase diagram by stabilizing the intermediate phase, mostly at the expense of the extended phase. Moreover, in the strongly interacting regime, a resonance-like behavior characterized by density oscillations appears. Remarkably, strong dipolar repulsions can also localize particles even in the absence of quasiperiodicity if the primary lattice is sufficiently deep. Our work shows that dipolar interactions in a quasiperiodic potential can give rise to a complex, tuneable coexistence of localized and extended quantum states.</description>

      <title>Impurity in a zero-temperature three-dimensional Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an impurity in a sea of zero-temperature fermions uniformly distributed throughout the space. The impurity scatters on fermions. On average, the momentum of impurity decreases with time as $t^{-1/(d+1)}$ in $d$ dimensions, and the momentum distribution acquires a scaling form in the long time limit. We solve the Lorentz-Boltzmann equation for the scaled momentum distribution of the impurity in three dimensions. The solution is a combination of confluent hypergeometric functions. In two spatial dimensions, the Lorentz-Boltzmann equation is analytically intractable, so we merely extract a few exact predictions about asymptotic behaviors when the scaled momentum of the impurity is small or large.</description>

      <title>The Uhlmann Phase Winding in Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Uhlmann phase is a generalization of the celebrated Berry phase, and can characterize topological properties at finite temperature and for mixed states. In this paper, we investigate the Uhlmann phase of Bose-Einstein Condensates at finite temperature, which are quantum systems with rich and diverse phenomena. Using the $SU(1,1)$ symmetry of Bogoliubov Hamiltonian, we derive a general formula of Uhlmann phase for BEC and numerically show that it can differ from the Berry phase in zero-temperature limit, in contrast to previous studies on Uhlmann phase. We also find that the Uhlmann phase exhibits a winding behavior as the temperature increases, and relate the total winding degree to the Berry phase. This winding behavior indicates that the Uhlmann phase takes values in a Riemann surface. We further propose a scheme to measure the Uhlmann phase of BEC experimentally based on purification of the density matrix using an atomic interferometer.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodic and periodic extended Hatano-Nelson model: Anomalous localization transition and non-Hermitian skin effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of quasiperiodic and periodic onsite potentials in a Hatano-Nelson model with next-nearest-neighbour hopping. By considering a non-reciprocal next-nearest-neighbour hopping and a quasiperiodic onsite potential under periodic boundary conditions, we show a breakdown of the typical correspondence between the delocalization-localization and complex-real transitions as a function of the potential strength. Moreover, we reveal that in the delocalized regime, when the potential strength increases, the eigenstates under OBC exhibit a bipolar non-Hermitian skin effect, i.e., they tend to localize on both the edges instead of localizing on either of the edges. However, when a periodic onsite potential is considered, the system not only exhibits a bipolar skin effect, but also shows a complete direction reversal of the skin effect as a function of the onsite periodic potential.</description>

      <title>Systematic analysis of relative phase extraction in one-dimensional Bose gases interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially resolved relative phase measurement of two adjacent 1D Bose gases is enabled by matter-wave interference upon free expansion. However, longitudinal dynamics is typically ignored in the analysis of experimental data. We provide an analytical formula showing a correction to the readout of the relative phase due to longitudinal expansion and mixing with the common phase. We numerically assess the error propagation to the estimation of the gases' physical quantities such as correlation functions and temperature. Our work characterizes the reliability and robustness of interferometric measurements, directing us to the improvement of existing phase extraction methods necessary to observe new physical phenomena in cold-atomic quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>A quantum Monte Carlo based density functional for Dysprosium dipolar system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04597v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantum Monte Carlo based density functional to describe droplet formation and supersolidity in dipolar systems. The usual Lee-Huang-Yang term, accounting for quantum correlations in the conventional extended Gross-Pitaievskii equation (eGPE), has been substituted by the correlation energy evaluated with Quantum Monte Carlo. We demonstrate the ability of the new functional to reproduce existing experimental data for the minimum critical number of atoms $N_\mathrm{c}$ required for droplet formation. $N_\mathrm{c}$ is a challenging quantity for theoretical predictions, and the eGPE provides only a qualitative description of it, mainly when it is applied to Dysprosium. We also use the new approach to characterize the BEC-supersolid transition. The quantum Monte Carlo based functional can be easily implemented in any existing eGPE code, improving the description of dipolar systems without increasing the computational cost.</description>

      <title>Observation of Nonlinear Response and Onsager Regression in a Photon Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum regression theorem states that the correlations of a system at two different times are governed by the same equations of motion as the temporal response of the average values. Such a relation provides a powerful framework for the investigation of physical systems by establishing a formal connection between intrinsic microscopic behaviour and a macroscopic 'effect' due to an external 'cause'. Measuring the response to a controlled perturbation in this way allows to determine, for example, structure factors in condensed matter systems as well as other correlation functions of material systems. Here we experimentally demonstrate that the two-time particle number correlations in a photon Bose-Einstein condensate inside a dye-filled microcavity exhibit the same dynamics as the response of the condensate to a sudden perturbation of the dye molecule bath. This confirms the regression theorem for a quantum gas and, moreover, establishes a test of this relation in an unconventional form where the perturbation acts on the bath and only the condensate response is monitored. For strong perturbations, we observe nonlinear relaxation dynamics which our microscopic theory relates to the equilibrium fluctuations, thereby extending the regression theorem beyond the regime of linear response. The demonstrated nonlinearity of the condensate-bath system paves the way for studies of novel elementary excitations in lattices of driven-dissipative photon condensates.</description>

      <title>Quasilocal entanglement across the Mott-Hubbard transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The possibility to directly measure, in a cold-atom quantum simulator, the von Neumann entropy and mutual information between a site and its environment opens new perspectives on the characterization of the Mott-Hubbard metal-insulator transition, in the framework of quantum information theory. In this work we provide an alternative view of the Mott transition in the two-dimensional Hubbard model in terms of rigorous quasilocal measures of entanglement and correlation between two spatially separated electronic orbitals, with no contribution from their environment. A space-resolved analysis of cluster dynamical mean-field theory results elucidates the prominent role of the nearest-neighbor entanglement in probing Mott localization: both its lower and upper bounds sharply increase at the metal-insulator transition. The two-site entanglement beyond nearest neighbors is shown to be quickly damped as the inter-site distance is increased. These results ultimately resolve a conundrum of previous analyses based on the single-site von Neumann entropy, which has been found to monotonically decrease when the interaction is increased. The quasilocal two-site entanglement recovers instead the distinctive character of Mott insulators as strongly correlated quantum states, demonstrating its central role in the $2d$ Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Percolation as a confinement order parameter in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) were introduced in 1974 by Wilson to study quark confinement. These models have been shown to exhibit (de-)confined phases, yet it remains challenging to define experimentally accessible order parameters. Here we propose percolation-inspired order parameters (POPs) to probe confinement of dynamical matter in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs using electric field basis snapshots accessible to quantum simulators. We apply the POPs to study a classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT and find a confining phase up to temperature $T=\infty$ in 2D (critical $T_c$, i.e. finite-$T$ phase transition, in 3D) for any non-zero density of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges. Further, using quantum Monte Carlo we demonstrate that the POPs reproduce the square lattice Fradkin-Shenker phase diagram at $T=0$ and explore the phase diagram at $T&gt;0$. The correlation length exponent coincides with the one of the 3D Ising universality class and we determine the POP critical exponent characterizing percolation. Our proposed POPs provide a geometric perspective of confinement and are directly accessible to snapshots obtained in quantum simulators, making them suitable as a probe for quantum spin liquids.</description>
