      <title>Semantic Communications Services within Generalist Operated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of integrating semantic communication principles into operated networks, traditionally optimized based on network-centric metrics rather than application-specific needs. Operated networks strongly adhere to the principle of ``separation of concerns", which emphasizes a clear distinction between network operation and application. Despite the initial perceived incompatibility between semantic communication and the principles of operated networks, this paper provides solutions to reconcile them. The foundations of these solutions include the adoption of non-arbitrary semantic representations as a standard encoding for communications, the establishment of a standard interface between the application and network, and a dedicated network control plane. These enable the application to describe the data typology and the nature of the task, and to agree upon a transmission scheme tailored to the supported task. Through three scenarios involving an application transmitting text representations, we illustrate the implementation of the proposal and demonstrate the potential of the approach.</description>

      <title>Semantic and Goal-oriented Wireless Network Coverage: The Area of Effectiveness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing wireless coverage is a fundamental task for public network operators and private deployments, whose goal is to guarantee quality of service across the network while minimizing material waste and energy consumption. These maps are usually built through ray tracing techniques and/or channel measurements that can be consequently translated into network Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as capacity or throughput. However, next generation networks (e.g., 6G) typically involve beyond communication resources, towards services that require data transmission, but also processing (local and remote) to perform complex decision making in real time, with the best balance between performance, energy consumption, material waste, and privacy. In this paper, we introduce the novel concept of areas of effectiveness, which goes beyond the legacy notion of coverage, towards one that takes into account capability of the network of offering edge Artificial Intelligence (AI)-related computation. We will show that radio coverage is a poor indicator of real system performance, depending on the application and the computing capabilities of network and devices. This opens new challenges in network planning, but also resource orchestration during operation to achieve the specific goal of communication.</description>

      <title>Propagation Measurements and Modeling for Low Altitude UAVs From 1 to 24 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In most countries, small (&lt;2 kg) and medium (&lt;25 kg) size unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must fly at low altitude, below 120 m, and with permanent radio communications with ground for control and telemetry. These communications links can be provided using 4G/5G networks or dedicated links, but in either this case the communications can be significantly degraded by frequent Non Line of Sight (NLoS) propagation. In this case, reflection and diffraction from ground objects are critical to maintain links, and hence accurate propagation models for this must be considered. In this letter we present a model for path loss when the UAV is flying in NLOS conditions. The study is based on measurements made at frequencies of 1, 4, 12, and 24 GHz with a UAV flying in a suburban environment. Measurements have been used to model NLOS propagation below 4 GHz, where the dominant mechanism is diffraction, and above 4GHzwhere multipath is the dominant propagationmechanism. The model can be of use in predicting excess losses when UAVs fly in suburban NLOS conditions.</description>

      <title>Complex Electromagnetic Space Combat System-of-systems Modeling and Key Node Identification Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the application of advanced science and technology in the military field, modern warfare has developed into a confrontation between systems. The combat system-of-systems (CSoS) has numerous nodes, multiple attributes and complex interactions, and its research and analysis are facing great difficulties. Electromagnetic space is an important dimension of modern warfare. Modeling and analyzing the CSoS from this perspective is of great significance to studying modern warfare and can provide a reference for the research of electromagnetic warfare. In this study, the types of nodes and relationships in the complex electromagnetic space of CSoS are first divided, the important attributes of the combat nodes are extracted, and the relationship weights are normalized to establish a networked model. On this basis, the calculation method of CSoS combat effectiveness based on the combat cycle is proposed, and then the identification and sorting of key nodes can be realized by the node deletion method. Finally, by constructing an instance of aircraft carrier fleet confrontation, the feasibility of this method has been verified, and the experimental results have been compared with classical algorithms to demonstrate the advanced nature of this method.</description>

      <title>Task-Driven Semantic Quantization and Imitation Learning for Goal-Oriented Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication marks a new paradigm shift from bit-wise data transmission to semantic information delivery for the purpose of bandwidth reduction. To more effectively carry out specialized downstream tasks at the receiver end, it is crucial to define the most critical semantic message in the data based on the task or goal-oriented features. In this work, we propose a novel goal-oriented communication (GO-COM) framework, namely Goal-Oriented Semantic Variational Autoencoder (GOS-VAE), by focusing on the extraction of the semantics vital to the downstream tasks. Specifically, we adopt a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to compress media data at the transmitter side. Instead of targeting the pixel-wise image data reconstruction, we measure the quality-of-service at the receiver end based on a pre-defined task-incentivized model. Moreover, to capture the relevant semantic features in the data reconstruction, imitation learning is adopted to measure the data regeneration quality in terms of goal-oriented semantics. Our experimental results demonstrate the power of imitation learning in characterizing goal-oriented semantics and bandwidth efficiency of our proposed GOS-VAE.</description>

      <title>BD Currency Detection: A CNN Based Approach with Mobile App Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currency recognition plays a vital role in banking, commerce, and assistive technology for visually impaired individuals. Traditional methods, such as manual verification and optical scanning, often suffer from limitations in accuracy and efficiency. This study introduces an advanced currency recognition system utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately classify Bangladeshi banknotes. A dataset comprising 50,334 images was collected, preprocessed, and used to train a CNN model optimized for high performance classification. The trained model achieved an accuracy of 98.5%, surpassing conventional image based currency recognition approaches. To enable real time and offline functionality, the model was converted into TensorFlow Lite format and integrated into an Android mobile application. The results highlight the effectiveness of deep learning in currency recognition, providing a fast, secure, and accessible solution that enhances financial transactions and assistive technologies.</description>

      <title>Equidistant-Sample or Wait-and-Sample to Minimize Age Under Sampling Constraint?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a status update system with a source, a sampler, a transmitter, and a monitor. The source governs a stochastic process that the monitor wants to observe in a timely manner. To achieve this, the sampler samples fresh update packets which the transmitter transmits via an error prone communication channel to the monitor. The transmitter can transmit without any constraint, i.e., it can transmit whenever an update packet is available to the transmitter. However, the sampler is imposed with a sampling rate constraint. The goal of the sampler is to devise an optimal policy that satisfies the resource constraint while minimizing the age of the monitor. We formulate this problem as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). We find several structures of an optimal policy. We leverage the optimal structures to find a low complexity optimal policy in an explicit manner, without resorting to complex iterative schemes or techniques that require bounding the age.</description>

      <title>Ethereal: Divide and Conquer Network Load Balancing in Large-Scale Distributed Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale distributed training in production datacenters constitutes a challenging workload bottlenecked by network communication. In response, both major industry players (e.g., Ultra Ethernet Consortium) and parts of academia have surprisingly, and almost unanimously, agreed that packet spraying is \emph{necessary} to improve the performance of large-scale distributed training workloads.
  In this paper, we challenge this prevailing belief and pose the question: \emph{How close can singlepath transport come to matching the performance of packet spraying?} We demonstrate that singlepath transport (from a NIC's perspective) is sufficient and can perform nearly as well as ideal packet spraying, particularly in the context of distributed training in CLOS-based topologies. Our assertion is based on four key observations about workloads driven by collective communication patterns: \emph{(i)} flow sizes are known upon arrival, \emph{(ii)} flow sizes are equal within each step of a collective, \emph{(iii)} the completion time of a collective is more critical than individual flow completion times, and \emph{(iv)} flows can be \emph{split} upon arrival to control load balancing directly from the application layer.
  We present Ethereal, a simple distributed load balancing algorithm that opportunistically splits flows and assigns paths to each flow in a transparent manner, requiring little to no changes to existing RDMA NICs. Our evaluation, spanning a wide range of collective communication algorithms and GPT models using Astra-Sim, shows that Ethereal significantly reduces the completion times by up to $30\%$ compared to packet spraying and by up to $40\%$ compared to REPS, even under link failures. This paper offers an alternative perspective for developing next-generation transport protocols tailored to large-scale distributed training.</description>

      <title>Region-based Content Enhancement for Efficient Video Analytics at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16990v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video analytics is widespread in various applications serving our society. Recent advances of content enhancement in video analytics offer significant benefits for the bandwidth saving and accuracy improvement. However, existing content-enhanced video analytics systems are excessively computationally expensive and provide extremely low throughput. In this paper, we present region-based content enhancement, that enhances only the important regions in videos, to improve analytical accuracy. Our system, RegenHance, enables high-accuracy and high-throughput video analytics at the edge by 1) a macroblock-based region importance predictor that identifies the important regions fast and precisely, 2) a region-aware enhancer that stitches sparsely distributed regions into dense tensors and enhances them efficiently, and 3) a profile-based execution planer that allocates appropriate resources for enhancement and analytics components. We prototype RegenHance on five heterogeneous edge devices. Experiments on two analytical tasks reveal that region-based enhancement improves the overall accuracy of 10-19% and achieves 2-3x throughput compared to the state-of-the-art frame-based enhancement methods.</description>

      <title>Distributing Intelligence in 6G Programmable Data Planes for Effective In-Network Intrusion Prevention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of attacks on new generation network infrastructures is becoming increasingly relevant, given the widening of the attack surface of these networks resulting from the greater number of devices that will access them in the future (sensors, actuators, vehicles, household appliances, etc.). Approaches to the design of intrusion detection systems must evolve and go beyond the traditional concept of perimeter control to build on new paradigms that exploit the typical characteristics of future 5G and 6G networks, such as in-network computing and intelligent programmable data planes. The aim of this research is to propose a disruptive paradigm in which devices in a typical data plane of a future programmable network have anomaly detection capabilities and cooperate in a fully distributed fashion to act as an ML-enabled Intrusion Prevention System ``embedded" into the network. The reported proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate that the proposed paradigm allows working effectively and with a good level of precision while occupying overall less CPU and RAM resources of the devices involved.</description>

      <title>Space-ground Fluid AI for 6G Edge Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Edge artificial intelligence (AI) and space-ground integrated networks (SGINs) are two main usage scenarios of the sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks. Edge AI supports pervasive low-latency AI services to users, whereas SGINs provide digital services to spatial, aerial, maritime, and ground users. This article advocates the integration of the two technologies by extending edge AI to space, thereby delivering AI services to every corner of the planet. Beyond a simple combination, our novel framework, called Space-ground Fluid AI, leverages the predictive mobility of satellites to facilitate fluid horizontal and vertical task/model migration in the networks. This ensures non-disruptive AI service provisioning in spite of the high mobility of satellite servers. The aim of the article is to introduce the (Space-ground) Fluid AI technology. First, we outline the network architecture and unique characteristics of Fluid AI. Then, we delve into three key components of Fluid AI, i.e., fluid learning, fluid inference, and fluid model downloading. They share the common feature of coping with satellite mobility via inter-satellite and space-ground cooperation to support AI services. Finally, we discuss the considerations for the real-world deployment of Fluid AI and identify further research opportunities.</description>

      <title>+Tour: Recommending personalized itineraries for smart tourism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation touristic services will rely on the advanced mobile networks' high bandwidth and low latency and the Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) paradigm to provide fully immersive mobile experiences. As an integral part of travel planning systems, recommendation algorithms devise personalized tour itineraries for individual users considering the popularity of a city's Points of Interest (POIs) as well as the tourist preferences and constraints. However, in the context of next-generation touristic services, recommendation algorithms should also consider the applications (e.g., social network, mobile video streaming, mobile augmented reality) the tourist will consume in the POIs and the quality in which the MEC infrastructure will deliver such applications. In this paper, we address the joint problem of recommending personalized tour itineraries for tourists and efficiently allocating MEC resources for advanced touristic applications. We formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the itinerary of individual tourists while optimizing the resource allocation at the network edge. We then propose an exact algorithm that quickly solves the problem optimally, considering instances of realistic size. Using a real-world location-based photo-sharing database, we conduct and present an exploratory analysis to understand preferences and users' visiting patterns. Using this understanding, we propose a methodology to identify user interest in applications. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm using this dataset. Results show that our algorithm outperforms a modified version of a state-of-the-art solution for personalized tour itinerary recommendation, demonstrating gains up to 11% for resource allocation efficiency and 40% for user experience. In addition, our algorithm performs similarly to the modified state-of-the-art solution regarding traditional itinerary recommendation metrics.</description>
