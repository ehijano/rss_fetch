      <title>Incivility and Contentiousness Spillover between COVID-19 and Climate Science Engagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affective polarization and its accompanying cleavage-based sorting drives incivility and contentiousness around climate change and other science-related issues. Looking at the COVID-19 period, we study cross-domain spillover of incivility and contentiousness in public engagements with climate change and climate science on Twitter and Reddit. We find strong evidence of the signatures of affective polarization surrounding COVID-19 spilling into the climate change domain. Across different social media systems, COVID-19 content is associated with incivility and contentiousness in climate discussions. These patterns of increased antagonism were responsive to pandemic events that made the link between science and public policy more salient. We also show that the observed spillover activated along pre-pandemic political cleavages, specifically anti-internationalist populist beliefs, that linked climate policy opposition to vaccine hesitancy. Our findings highlight the dangers of entrenched cross-domain polarization manifesting as spillover of antagonistic behavior.</description>

      <title>Robust Deep Signed Graph Clustering via Weak Balance Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signed graph clustering is a critical technique for discovering community structures in graphs that exhibit both positive and negative relationships. We have identified two significant challenges in this domain: i) existing signed spectral methods are highly vulnerable to noise, which is prevalent in real-world scenarios; ii) the guiding principle ``an enemy of my enemy is my friend'', rooted in \textit{Social Balance Theory}, often narrows or disrupts cluster boundaries in mainstream signed graph neural networks. Addressing these challenges, we propose the \underline{D}eep \underline{S}igned \underline{G}raph \underline{C}lustering framework (DSGC), which leverages \textit{Weak Balance Theory} to enhance preprocessing and encoding for robust representation learning. First, DSGC introduces Violation Sign-Refine to denoise the signed network by correcting noisy edges with high-order neighbor information. Subsequently, Density-based Augmentation enhances semantic structures by adding positive edges within clusters and negative edges across clusters, following \textit{Weak Balance} principles. The framework then utilizes \textit{Weak Balance} principles to develop clustering-oriented signed neural networks to broaden cluster boundaries by emphasizing distinctions between negatively linked nodes. Finally, DSGC optimizes clustering assignments by minimizing a regularized clustering loss. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate DSGC consistently outperforms all baselines, establishing a new benchmark in signed graph clustering.</description>

      <title>Social inequality and cultural factors impact the awareness and reaction during the cryptic transmission period of pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 31, 2020. However, rumors of a "mysterious virus" had already been circulating in China in December 2019, possibly preceding the first confirmed COVID-19 case. Understanding how awareness about an emerging pandemic spreads through society is vital not only for enhancing disease surveillance, but also for mitigating demand shocks and social inequities, such as shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and essential supplies. Here we leverage a massive e-commerce dataset comprising 150 billion online queries and purchase records from 94 million people to detect the traces of early awareness and public response during the cryptic transmission period of COVID-19. Our analysis focuses on identifying information gaps across different demographic cohorts, revealing significant social inequities and the role of cultural factors in shaping awareness diffusion and response behaviors. By modeling awareness diffusion in heterogeneous social networks and analyzing online shopping behavior, we uncover the evolving characteristics of vulnerable populations. Our findings expand the theoretical understanding of awareness spread and social inequality in the early stages of a pandemic, highlighting the critical importance of e-commerce data and social network data in effectively and timely addressing future pandemic challenges. We also provide actionable recommendations to better manage and mitigate dynamic social inequalities in public health crises.</description>

      <title>An Evolutionary Game With the Game Transitions Based on the Markov Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The psychology of the individual is continuously changing in nature, which has a significant influence on the evolutionary dynamics of populations. To study the influence of the continuously changing psychology of individuals on the behavior of populations, in this paper, we consider the game transitions of individuals in evolutionary processes to capture the changing psychology of individuals in reality, where the game that individuals will play shifts as time progresses and is related to the transition rates between different games. Besides, the individual's reputation is taken into account and utilized to choose a suitable neighbor for the strategy updating of the individual. Within this model, we investigate the statistical number of individuals staying in different game states and the expected number fits well with our theoretical results. Furthermore, we explore the impact of transition rates between different game states, payoff parameters, the reputation mechanism, and different time scales of strategy updates on cooperative behavior, and our findings demonstrate that both the transition rates and reputation mechanism have a remarkable influence on the evolution of cooperation. Additionally, we examine the relationship between network size and cooperation frequency, providing valuable insights into the robustness of the model.</description>

      <title>HyGEN: Regularizing Negative Hyperedge Generation for Accurate Hyperedge Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperedge prediction is a fundamental task to predict future high-order relations based on the observed network structure. Existing hyperedge prediction methods, however, suffer from the data sparsity problem. To alleviate this problem, negative sampling methods can be used, which leverage non-existing hyperedges as contrastive information for model training. However, the following important challenges have been rarely studied: (C1) lack of guidance for generating negatives and (C2) possibility of producing false negatives. To address them, we propose a novel hyperedge prediction method, HyGEN, that employs (1) a negative hyperedge generator that employs positive hyperedges as a guidance to generate more realistic ones and (2) a regularization term that prevents the generated hyperedges from being false negatives. Extensive experiments on six real-world hypergraphs reveal that HyGEN consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art hyperedge prediction methods.</description>

      <title>Can Generative Agent-Based Modeling Replicate the Friendship Paradox in Social Media Simulations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Agent-Based Modeling (GABM) is an emerging simulation paradigm that combines the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models with traditional Agent-Based Modeling to replicate complex social behaviors, including interactions on social media. While prior work has focused on localized phenomena such as opinion formation and information spread, its potential to capture global network dynamics remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by analyzing GABM-based social media simulations through the lens of the Friendship Paradox (FP), a counterintuitive phenomenon where individuals, on average, have fewer friends than their friends. We propose a GABM framework for social media simulations, featuring generative agents that emulate real users with distinct personalities and interests. Using Twitter datasets on the US 2020 Election and the QAnon conspiracy, we show that the FP emerges naturally in GABM simulations. Consistent with real-world observations, the simulations unveil a hierarchical structure, where agents preferentially connect with others displaying higher activity or influence. Additionally, we find that infrequent connections primarily drive the FP, reflecting patterns in real networks. These findings validate GABM as a robust tool for modeling global social media phenomena and highlight its potential for advancing social science by enabling nuanced analysis of user behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Getting a group to adopt cooperative norms is an enduring challenge. But in real-world settings, individuals don't just passively accept static environments, they act both within and upon the social systems that structure their interactions. Should we expect the dynamism of player-driven changes to the "rules of the game" to hinder cooperation -- because of the substantial added complexity -- or help it, as prosocial agents tweak their environment toward non-zero-sum games? We introduce a laboratory setting to test whether groups can guide themselves to cooperative outcomes by manipulating the environmental parameters that shape their emergent cooperation process. We test for cooperation in a set of economic games that impose different social dilemmas. These games vary independently in the institutional features of stability, efficiency, and fairness. By offering agency over behavior along with second-order agency over the rules of the game, we understand emergent cooperation in naturalistic settings in which the rules of the game are themselves dynamic and subject to choice. The literature on transfer learning in games suggests that interactions between features are important and might aid or hinder the transfer of cooperative learning to new settings.</description>

      <title>Is Science Inevitable?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using large-scale citation data and a breakthrough metric, the study systematically evaluates the inevitability of scientific breakthroughs. We find that scientific breakthroughs emerge as multiple discoveries rather than singular events. Through analysis of over 40 million journal articles, we identify multiple discoveries as papers that independently displace the same reference using the Disruption Index (D-index), suggesting functional equivalence. Our findings support Merton's core argument that scientific discoveries arise from historical context rather than individual genius. The results reveal a long-tail distribution pattern of multiple discoveries across various datasets, challenging Merton's Poisson model while reinforcing the structural inevitability of scientific progress.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As implied by the plethora of literature on graph rewiring, the choice of computational graph employed by a neural network can make a significant impact on its downstream performance. Certain effects related to the computational graph, such as under-reaching and over-squashing, may even render the model incapable of learning certain functions. Most of these effects have only been thoroughly studied in the domain of undirected graphs; however, recent years have seen a significant rise in interest in feedforward computational graphs: directed graphs without any back edges. In this paper, we study the desirable properties of a feedforward computational graph, discovering two important complementary measures: fidelity and mixing time, and evaluating a few popular choices of graphs through the lens of these measures. Our study is backed by both theoretical analyses of the metrics' asymptotic behaviour for various graphs, as well as correlating these metrics to the performance of trained neural network models using the corresponding graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.15657v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online social media is integral to human life, facilitating messaging, information sharing, and confidential communication while preserving privacy. Platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook exemplify this phenomenon. However, users face challenges due to network anomalies, often stemming from malicious activities such as identity theft for financial gain or harm. This paper proposes a novel method using user similarity measures and the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) algorithm to identify fake user accounts in the Twitter dataset. Despite the problem's complexity, the method achieves an AUC rate of 80\% in classifying and detecting fake accounts. Notably, the study builds on previous research, highlighting advancements and insights into the evolving landscape of anomaly detection in online social networks.</description>

      <title>Community detection by spectral methods in multi-layer networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Community detection in multi-layer networks is a crucial problem in network analysis. In this paper, we analyze the performance of two spectral clustering algorithms for community detection within the framework of the multi-layer degree-corrected stochastic block model (MLDCSBM) framework. One algorithm is based on the sum of adjacency matrices, while the other utilizes the debiased sum of squared adjacency matrices. We also provide their accelerated versions through subsampling to handle large-scale multi-layer networks. We establish consistency results for community detection of the two proposed methods under MLDCSBM as the size of the network and/or the number of layers increases. Our theorems demonstrate the advantages of utilizing multiple layers for community detection. Our analysis also indicates that spectral clustering with the debiased sum of squared adjacency matrices is generally superior to spectral clustering with the sum of adjacency matrices. Furthermore, we provide a strategy to estimate the number of communities in multi-layer networks by maximizing the averaged modularity. Substantial numerical simulations demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm employing the debiased sum of squared adjacency matrices over existing methods for community detection in multi-layer networks, the high computational efficiency of our accelerated algorithms for large-scale multi-layer networks, and the high accuracy of our strategy in estimating the number of communities. Finally, the analysis of several real-world multi-layer networks yields meaningful insights.</description>

      <title>Epidemiology-informed Network for Robust Rumor Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid spread of rumors on social media has posed significant challenges to maintaining public trust and information integrity. Since an information cascade process is essentially a propagation tree, recent rumor detection models leverage graph neural networks to additionally capture information propagation patterns, thus outperforming text-only solutions. Given the variations in topics and social impact of the root node, different source information naturally has distinct outreach capabilities, resulting in different heights of propagation trees. This variation, however, impedes the data-driven design of existing graph-based rumor detectors. Given a shallow propagation tree with limited interactions, it is unlikely for graph-based approaches to capture sufficient cascading patterns, questioning their ability to handle less popular news or early detection needs. In contrast, a deep propagation tree is prone to noisy user responses, and this can in turn obfuscate the predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel Epidemiology-informed Network (EIN) that integrates epidemiological knowledge to enhance performance by overcoming data-driven methods sensitivity to data quality. Meanwhile, to adapt epidemiology theory to rumor detection, it is expected that each users stance toward the source information will be annotated. To bypass the costly and time-consuming human labeling process, we take advantage of large language models to generate stance labels, facilitating optimization objectives for learning epidemiology-informed representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed EIN not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets but also exhibits enhanced robustness across varying tree depths.</description>

      <title>Multi-Order Hyperbolic Graph Convolution and Aggregated Attention for Social Event Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social event detection (SED) is a task focused on identifying specific real-world events and has broad applications across various domains. It is integral to many mobile applications with social features, including major platforms like Twitter, Weibo, and Facebook. By enabling the analysis of social events, SED provides valuable insights for businesses to understand consumer preferences and supports public services in handling emergencies and disaster management. Due to the hierarchical structure of event detection data, traditional approaches in Euclidean space often fall short in capturing the complexity of such relationships. While existing methods in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces have shown promising results, they tend to overlook multi-order relationships between events. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel framework, Multi-Order Hyperbolic Graph Convolution with Aggregated Attention (MOHGCAA), designed to enhance the performance of SED. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements under both supervised and unsupervised settings. To further validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework, we conducted extensive evaluations across multiple datasets, confirming its superiority in tackling common challenges in social event detection.</description>

      <title>Less is More: One-shot Subgraph Reasoning on Large-scale Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To deduce new facts on a knowledge graph (KG), a link predictor learns from the graph structure and collects local evidence to find the answer to a given query. However, existing methods suffer from a severe scalability problem due to the utilization of the whole KG for prediction, which hinders their promise on large scale KGs and cannot be directly addressed by vanilla sampling methods. In this work, we propose the one-shot-subgraph link prediction to achieve efficient and adaptive prediction. The design principle is that, instead of directly acting on the whole KG, the prediction procedure is decoupled into two steps, i.e., (i) extracting only one subgraph according to the query and (ii) predicting on this single, query dependent subgraph. We reveal that the non-parametric and computation-efficient heuristics Personalized PageRank (PPR) can effectively identify the potential answers and supporting evidence. With efficient subgraph-based prediction, we further introduce the automated searching of the optimal configurations in both data and model spaces. Empirically, we achieve promoted efficiency and leading performances on five large-scale benchmarks. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/one-shot-subgraph.</description>

Abstract: One fundamental challenge in graph machine learning is generalizing to new graphs. Many existing methods following the inductive setup can generalize to test graphs with new structures, but assuming the feature and label spaces remain the same as the training ones. This paper introduces the fully-inductive setup, where models should perform inference on arbitrary test graphs with new structures, feature and label spaces. We propose GraphAny as the first attempt at this challenging setup. GraphAny models inference on a new graph as an analytical solution to a LinearGNN, which can be naturally applied to graphs with any feature and label spaces. To further build a stronger model with learning capacity, we fuse multiple LinearGNN predictions with learned inductive attention scores. Specifically, the attention module is carefully parameterized as a function of the entropy-normalized distance features between pairs of LinearGNN predictions to ensure generalization to new graphs. Empirically, GraphAny trained on a single Wisconsin dataset with only 120 labeled nodes can generalize to 30 new graphs with an average accuracy of 67.26%, surpassing not only all inductive baselines, but also strong transductive methods trained separately on each of the 30 test graphs.</description>

      <title>GraphHash: Graph Clustering Enables Parameter Efficiency in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17245</link>

Abstract: Deep recommender systems rely heavily on large embedding tables to handle high-cardinality categorical features such as user/item identifiers, and face significant memory constraints at scale. To tackle this challenge, hashing techniques are often employed to map multiple entities to the same embedding and thus reduce the size of the embedding tables. Concurrently, graph-based collaborative signals have emerged as powerful tools in recommender systems, yet their potential for optimizing embedding table reduction remains unexplored. This paper introduces GraphHash, the first graph-based approach that leverages modularity-based bipartite graph clustering on user-item interaction graphs to reduce embedding table sizes. We demonstrate that the modularity objective has a theoretical connection to message-passing, which provides a foundation for our method. By employing fast clustering algorithms, GraphHash serves as a computationally efficient proxy for message-passing during preprocessing and a plug-and-play graph-based alternative to traditional ID hashing. Extensive experiments show that GraphHash substantially outperforms diverse hashing baselines on both retrieval and click-through-rate prediction tasks. In particular, GraphHash achieves on average a 101.52% improvement in recall when reducing the embedding table size by more than 75%, highlighting the value of graph-based collaborative information for model reduction.

      <title>CSEval: Towards Automated, Multi-Dimensional, and Reference-Free Counterspeech Evaluation using Auto-Calibrated LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Counterspeech has emerged as a popular and effective strategy for combating online hate speech, sparking growing research interest in automating its generation using language models. However, the field still lacks standardised evaluation protocols and reliable automated evaluation metrics that align with human judgement. Current automatic evaluation methods, primarily based on similarity metrics, do not effectively capture the complex and independent attributes of counterspeech quality, such as contextual relevance, aggressiveness, or argumentative coherence. This has led to an increased dependency on labor-intensive human evaluations to assess automated counter-speech generation methods. To address these challenges, we introduce CSEval, a novel dataset and framework for evaluating counterspeech quality across four dimensions: contextual-relevance, aggressiveness, argument-coherence, and suitableness. Furthermore, we propose Auto-Calibrated COT for Counterspeech Evaluation (Auto-CSEval), a prompt-based method with auto-calibrated chain-of-thoughts (CoT) for scoring counterspeech using large language models. Our experiments show that Auto-CSEval outperforms traditional metrics like ROUGE, METEOR, and BertScore in correlating with human judgement, indicating a significant improvement in automated counterspeech evaluation.</description>
