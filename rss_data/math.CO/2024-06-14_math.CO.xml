      <title>Fixed hooks in arbitrary columns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a paper by the author, Hemmer, Hopkins, and Keith the concept of a fixed point in a sequence was applied to the sequence of first column hook lengths of a partition. In this paper we generalize this notion to fixed hook lengths in an arbitrary column of a partition. We establish combinatorial connections between these fixed hooks and colored partitions that have interesting gap and mex-like conditions. Additionally, we obtain several generating functions for hook lengths of a given fixedness by hook length or part size in unrestricted partitions as well as some classical restrictions such as odd and distinct partitions.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds for the total (distance) $k$-domination number of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $k \geq 1$ and a graph $G$ without isolated vertices, a \emph{total (distance) $k$-dominating set} of $G$ is a set of vertices $S \subseteq V(G)$ such that every vertex in $G$ is within distance $k$ to some vertex of $S$ other than itself. The \emph{total (distance) $k$-domination number} of $G$ is the minimum cardinality of a total $k$-dominating set in $G$, and is denoted by $\gamma_{k}^t(G)$. When $k=1$, the total $k$-domination number reduces to the \emph{total domination number}, written $\gamma_t(G)$; that is, $\gamma_t(G) = \gamma_{1}^t(G)$. This paper shows that several known lower bounds on the total domination number generalize nicely to lower bounds on total (distance) $k$-domination.</description>

      <title>Maximizing the Maximum Degree in Ordered Yao Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an ordered point set in a Euclidean space or, more generally, in an abstract metric space, the ordered Yao graph is obtained by connecting each of the points to its closest predecessor by a directed edge. We show that for every set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, there exists an order such that the corresponding ordered Yao graph has maximum degree at least $\log{n}/(4d)$. Apart from the $1/(4d)$ factor, this bound is the best possible. As for the abstract setting, we show that for every $n$-element metric space, there exists an order such that the corresponding ordered Yao graph has maximum degree $\Omega(\sqrt{\log{n}/\log\log{n}})$.</description>

      <title>Quotient-convergence of Submodular Setfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of quotient-convergence for sequences of submodular set functions, providing, among others, a new framework for the study of convergence of matroids through their rank functions. Extending the limit theory of bounded degree graphs, which analyzes graph sequences via neighborhood sampling, we address the challenge posed by the absence of a neighborhood concept in matroids. We show that any bounded set function can be approximated by a sequence of finite set functions that quotient-converges to it. In addition, we explicitly construct such sequences for increasing, submodular, and upper continuous set functions, and prove the completeness of the space under quotient-convergence.</description>

      <title>Cycle Matroids of Graphings: From Convergence to Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent line of research has concentrated on exploring the links between analytic and combinatorial theories of submodularity, uncovering several key connections between them. In this context, Lov\'asz initiated the study of matroids from an analytic point of view and introduced the cycle matroid of a graphing. Motivated by the limit theory of graphs, the authors introduced a form of right-convergence, called quotient-convergence, for a sequence of submodular setfunctions, leading to a notion of convergence for matroids through their rank functions. In this paper, we study the connection between local-global convergence of graphs and quotient-convergence of their cycle matroids. We characterize the exposed points of the associated convex set, forming an analytic counterpart of matroid base-polytopes. Finally, we consider dual planar graphings and show that the cycle matroid of one is the cocycle matroid of its dual if and only if the underlying graphings are hyperfinite.</description>

      <title>Distribution of hooks in self-conjugate partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We confirm the speculation that the distribution of $t$-hooks among unrestricted integer partitions essentially descends to self-conjugate partitions. Namely, we prove that the number of hooks of length $t$ among the size $n$ self-conjugate partitions is asymptotically normally distributed with mean
  $\mu_t(n) \sim \frac{\sqrt{6n}}{\pi} + \frac{3}{\pi^2} - \frac{t}{2}$ and variance $\sigma_t^2(n) \sim \frac{(\pi^2 - 6) \sqrt{6n}}{\pi^3}.$</description>

      <title>Strong External Difference Families and Classification of $\alpha$-valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One method of constructing $(a^2+1, 2,a, 1)$-SEDFs (i.e., strong external difference families) in $\mathbb{Z}_{a^2+1}$ makes use of $\alpha$-valuations of complete bipartite graphs $K_{a,a}$. We explore this approach and we provide a classification theorem which shows that all such $\alpha$-valuations can be constructed recursively via a sequence of ``blow-up'' operations. We also enumerate all $(a^2+1, 2,a, 1)$-SEDFs in $\mathbb{Z}_{a^2+1}$ for $a \leq 14$ and we show that all these SEDFs are equivalent to $\alpha$-valuations via affine transformations. Whether this holds for all $a &gt; 14$ as well is an interesting open problem. We also study SEDFs in dihedral groups, where we show that two known constructions are equivalent.</description>

      <title>Simple Chopsticks: Playing with any number of hands and fingers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chopsticks is a game played by two players where they start with one finger raised on each hand. On their turn, each player moves by pointing an attacking hand at one of their opponent's hands. The number of fingers on the pointed hand increases by the number of fingers on the attacking hand. If, after a move, a hand contains more than five fingers, it is removed from play. There are also other rules that allow players to move fingers from one hand to another, but we focus on this simple setup.
  We introduce a generalization of Chopsticks, called Simple Chopsticks, in which the players may have any number of $n$-fingered hands. We find that having more hands than your opponent is generally good, and use this fact to fully characterize the outcomes of \octopus/ in the case where the players have 2-fingered hands.</description>

      <title>Davenport constant and its variants for some non-abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define two variants $e(G)$, $f(G)$ of the Davenport constant $d(G)$ of a finite group $G$, that is not necessarily abelian. These naturally arising constants aid in computing $d(G)$ and are of potential independent interest. We compute the constants $d(G)$, $e(G)$, $f(G)$ for some nonabelian groups G, and demonstrate that, unlike abelian groups where these constants are identical, they can each be distinct. As a byproduct of our results, we also obtain some cases of a conjecture of J. Bass. We compute the $k$-th Davenport constant for several classes of groups as well. We also make a conjecture on $f(G)$ for metacyclic groups and provide evidence towards it.</description>

      <title>The reflection complexity of sequences over finite alphabets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In combinatorics on words, the well-studied factor complexity function $\rho_{\bf x}$ of a sequence ${\bf x}$ over a finite alphabet counts, for any nonnegative integer $n$, the number of distinct length-$n$ factors of ${\bf x}$. In this paper, we introduce the \emph{reflection complexity} function $r_{\bf x}$ to enumerate the factors occurring in a sequence ${\bf x}$, up to reversing the order of symbols in a word. We introduce and prove results on $r_{\bf x}$ regarding its growth properties and relationship with other complexity functions. We prove that if ${\bf x}$ is $k$-automatic, then $r_{\bf x}$ is computably $k$-regular, and we use the software {\tt Walnut} to evaluate the reflection complexity of automatic sequences, such as the Thue--Morse sequence. We prove a Morse--Hedlund-type result characterizing eventually periodic sequences in terms of their reflection complexity, and we deduce a characterization of Sturmian sequences. Furthermore, we investigate the reflection complexity of episturmian, $(s+1)$-dimensional billiard, and Rote sequences. There are still many unanswered questions about this measure.</description>

      <title>On the independence number of sparser random Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cayley sum graph $\Gamma_A$ of a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_n$ is defined to have vertex set $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and an edge between two distinct vertices $x, y \in \mathbb{Z}_n$ if $x + y \in A$. Green and Morris proved that if the set $A$ is a $p$-random subset of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ with $p = 1/2$, then the independence number of $\Gamma_A$ is asymptotically equal to $\alpha(G(n, 1/2))$ with high probability. Our main theorem is the first extension of their result to $p = o(1)$: we show that, with high probability, $$\alpha(\Gamma_A) = (1 + o(1)) \alpha(G(n, p))$$ as long as $p \ge (\log n)^{-1/80}$.
  One of the tools in our proof is a geometric-flavoured theorem that generalizes Fre\u{i}man's lemma, the classical lower bound on the size of high dimensional sumsets. We also give a short proof of this result up to a constant factor; this version yields a much simpler proof of our main theorem at the expense of a worse constant.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a few special cases of the more general question: How many permutations $\pi\in\mathcal{S}_n$ have the property that $\pi^2$ has $j$ descents for some $j$? In this paper, we first enumerate Grassmannian permutations $\pi$ by the number of descents in $\pi^2$. We then consider all permutations whose square has exactly one descent, fully enumerating when the descent is "small" and providing a lower bound in the general case. Finally, we enumerate permutations whose square or cube has the maximum number of descents, and finish the paper with a few future directions for study.</description>

      <title>On Fox's trapezoidal conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate Fox's trapezoidal conjecture for alternating links. We show that it holds for diagrammatic Murasugi sums of special alternating links, where all sums involved have length less than three (which includes diagrammatic plumbing). It also holds for links containing a large twist region, which we call twist-concentrated. Furthermore, we show some weaker inequalities between consecutive coefficients of the Alexander polynomial of an alternating 3-braid closure, and extend this to arbitrary alternating links. We then study an extension of the trapezoidal conjecture due to Hirasawa and Murasugi, which states that the stable length of the Alexander polynomial of an alternating link can be bounded from above using the signature. We estabilish this and determine when equality holds for diagrammatic Murasugi sums of special alternating knots where each sum has length less than three, and also for twist-concentrated 3-braids. Finally, we study the behavior of the Hirasawa-Murasugi inequality under concordance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we prove a Griesmer type bound for additive codes over finite fields. This new bound gives an upper bound on the length of maximum distance separable (MDS) codes, codes which attain the Singleton bound. We will also consider codes to be MDS if they obtain the fractional Singleton bound, due to Huffman. We prove that this bound in the fractional case can be obtained by codes whose length surpasses the length of the longest known codes in the non-fractional case. We also provide some exhaustive computational results over small fields and dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the bounded derived category of the lattice of order ideals of the product of two ordered chains is fractionally Calabi-Yau. We also show that these lattices are derived equivalent to higher Auslander algebras of type A. The proofs involve the study of intervals of the poset that have resolutions described with antichains having rigid properties. These two results combined corroborate a conjecture by Chapoton linking posets to Fukaya Seidel Categories.</description>

      <title>Sparse reconstruction in spin systems II: Ising and other factor of IID measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a sequence of Boolean functions $f_n : \{-1, 1\}^{V_n} \longrightarrow \{-1, 1\}$, with random input given by some probability measure $\mathbb{P}_n$, we say that there is sparse reconstruction for $f_n$ if there is a sequence of subsets $U_n \subseteq V_n$ of coordinates satisfying $|U_n| = o(|V_n|)$ such that knowing the spins in $U_n$ gives us a non-vanishing amount of information about the value of $f_n$.
  In the first part of this work, we showed that if the $\mathbb{P}_n$s are product measures, then no sparse reconstruction is possible for any sequence of transitive functions. In this sequel, we consider spin systems that are relatives of IID measures in one way or another, with our main focus being on the Ising model on finite transitive graphs or exhaustions of lattices. We prove that no sparse reconstruction is possible for the entire high temperature regime on Euclidean boxes and the Curie-Weiss model, while sparse reconstruction for the majority function of the spins is possible in the critical and low temperature regimes. We give quantitative bounds for two-dimensional boxes and the Curie-Weiss model, sharp in the latter case.
  The proofs employ several different methods, including factor of IID and FK random cluster representations, strong spatial mixing, a generalization of discrete Fourier analysis to Divide-and-Color models, and entropy inequalities.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most basic facts related to the famous Ulam reconstruction conjecture is that the connectedness of a graph can be determined by the deck of its vertex-deleted subgraphs, which are considered up to isomorphism. We strengthen this result by proving that connectedness can still be determined when the subgraphs in the deck are given up to equivalence under the color refinement isomorphism test. Consequently, this implies that connectedness is recognizable by Reconstruction Graph Neural Networks, a recently introduced GNN architecture inspired by the reconstruction conjecture (Cotta, Morris, Ribeiro 2021).</description>

      <title>On the existence of magic squares of powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any $d \geq 2$, we prove that there exists an integer $n_0(d)$ such that there exists an $n \times n$ magic square of $d^\text{th}$ powers for all $n \geq n_0(d)$. In particular, we establish the existence of an $n \times n$ magic square of squares for all $n \geq 4$, which settles a conjecture of V\'{a}rilly-Alvarado.
  All previous approaches had been based on constructive methods and the existence of $n \times n$ magic squares of $d^\text{th}$ powers had only been known for sparse values of $n$. We prove our result by the Hardy-Littlewood circle method, which in this setting essentially reduces the problem to finding a sufficient number of disjoint linearly independent subsets of the columns of the coefficient matrix of the equations defining magic squares. We prove an optimal (up to a constant) lower bound for this quantity.</description>

      <title>Projective tilings and full-rank perfect codes</title>

Abstract: A tiling of a vector space $S$ is the pair $(U,V)$ of its subsets such that every vector in $S$ is uniquely represented as the sum of a vector from $U$ and a vector from $V$. A tiling is connected to a perfect codes if one of the sets, say $U$, is projective, i.e., the union of one-dimensional subspaces of $S$. A tiling $(U,V)$ is full-rank if the affine span of each of $U$, $V$ is $S$. For finite non-binary vector spaces of dimension at least $6$ (at least $10$), we construct full-rank tilings $(U,V)$ with projective $U$ (both $U$ and $V$, respectively). In particular, that construction gives a full-rank ternary $1$-perfect code of length $13$, solving a known problem. We also discuss the treatment of tilings with projective components as factorizations of projective spaces.

      <description>arXiv:2211.06087v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectral hypergraph theory mainly concerns using hypergraph spectra to obtain structural information about the given hypergraphs. The study of cospectral hypergraphs is important since it reveals which hypergraph properties cannot be deduced from their spectra. In this paper, we show a new method for constructing cospectral uniform hypergraphs using two well-known hypergraph representations: adjacency tensors and adjacency matrices.</description>

      <title>An upper bound on the number of frequency hypercubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A frequency $n$-cube $F^n(q;l_0,...,l_{m-1})$ is an $n$-dimensional $q$-by-...-by-$q$ array, where $q = l_0+...+l_{m-1}$, filled by numbers $0,...,m-1$ with the property that each line contains exactly $l_i$ cells with symbol $i$, $i = 0,...,m-1$ (a line consists of $q$ cells of the array differing in one coordinate). The trivial upper bound on the number of frequency $n$-cubes is $m^{(q-1)^{n}}$. We improve that lower bound for $n&gt;2$, replacing $q-1$ by a smaller value, by constructing a testing set of size $s^{n}$, $s&lt;q-1$, for frequency $n$-cubes (a testing sets is a collection of cells of an array the values in which uniquely determine the array with given parameters). We also construct new testing sets for generalized frequency $n$-cubes, which are essentially correlation-immune functions in $n$ $q$-valued arguments; the cardinalities of new testing sets are smaller than for testing sets known before.
  Keywords: frequency hypercube, correlation-immune function, latin hypercube, testing set.</description>

      <title>Two classes of posets with real-rooted chain polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coefficients of the chain polynomial of a finite poset enumerate chains in the poset by their number of elements. It has been a challenging open problem to determine which posets have real-rooted chain polynomials. Two new classes of posets, namely those of all rank-selected subposets of Cohen-Macaulay simplicial posets and all noncrossing partition lattices associated to finite Coxeter groups, are shown to have this property. The first result generalizes one of Brenti and Welker. As a special case, the descent enumerator of permutations of the set $\{1, 2,\dots,n\}$ which have ascents at specified positions is shown to be real-rooted, hence log-concave and unimodal, and a good estimate for the location of the peak is deduced.</description>

Abstract: For a graph $G$, let $S_2(G)$ be the sum of the first two largest signless Laplacian eigenvalues of $G$, and $f(G)=e(G)+3-S_2(G)$. Oliveira, Lima, Rama and Carvalho conjectured that $K^+_{1,n-1}$ (the star graph with an additional edge) is the unique graph with minimum value of $f(G)$ on $n$ vertices. In this paper, we prove this conjecture, which also confirm a conjecture for the upper bound of $S_2(G)$ proposed by Ashraf et al.</description>

Abstract: We describe the classification of orthogonal arrays OA$(2048,14,2,7)$, or, equivalently, completely regular $\{14;2\}$-codes in the $14$-cube ($30848$ equivalence classes). In particular, we find that there is exactly one almost-OA$(2048,14,2,7{+}1)$, up to equivalence. As derived objects, OA$(1024,13,2,6)$ ($202917$ classes) and completely regular $\{12,2;2,12\}$- and $\{14, 12, 2; 2, 12, 14\}$-codes in the $13$- and $14$-cubes, respectively, are also classified.

      <title>Equivariant Hilbert and Ehrhart series under translative group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the equivariant Hilbert series of the complex Stanley-Reisner ring of a simplicial complex $\Sigma$ under the action of a finite group via simplicial automorphisms. We prove that, when $\Sigma$ is Cohen-Macaulay and the group action is translative, i.e., color-preserving for some proper coloring of $\Sigma$, the equivariant Hilbert series of $\Sigma$ admits a rational expression whose numerator is a positive integer combination of irreducible characters.
  We relate such a result to equivariant Ehrhart theory via an equivariant analogue of the Betke-McMullen theorem developed by Jochemko, Katth\"an and Reiner: namely, if a lattice polytope admits a lattice unimodular triangulation that is invariant under the action of a finite group, then the equivariant Ehrhart series of the polytope equals the equivariant Hilbert series of such a triangulation.
  As an application, we study the equivariant Ehrhart series of alcoved polytopes in the sense of Lam and Postnikov and derive explicit results in the case of order polytopes and of Lipschitz poset polytopes.</description>

      <title>Association schemes arising from non-weakly regular bent functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Association schemes play an important role in algebraic combinatorics and have important applications in coding theory, graph theory and design theory. The methods to construct association schemes by using bent functions have been extensively studied. Recently, in [13], {\"O}zbudak and Pelen constructed infinite families of symmetric association schemes of classes $5$ and $6$ by using ternary non-weakly regular bent functions.They also stated that constructing $2p$-class association schemes from $p$-ary non-weakly regular bent functions is an interesting problem, where $p&gt;3$ is an odd prime. In this paper, using non-weakly regular bent functions, we construct infinite families of symmetric association schemes of classes $2p$, $(2p+1)$ and $\frac{3p+1}{2}$ for any odd prime $p$. Fusing those association schemes, we also obtain $t$-class symmetric association schemes, where $t=4,5,6,7$. In addition, we give the sufficient and necessary conditions for the partitions $P$, $D$, $T$, $U$ and $V$ (defined in this paper) to induce symmetric association schemes.</description>

      <title>A variable version of the quasi-kernel conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quasi-kernel of a digraph $D$ is an independent set $Q$ such that every vertex can reach $Q$ in at most two steps. A 48-year conjecture made by P.L. Erd\H{o}s and Sz\'ekely, denoted the small QK conjecture, says that every sink-free digraph contains a quasi-kernel of size at most $n/2$.
  Recently, Spiro posed the large QK conjecture, that every sink-free digraph contains a quasi-kernel $Q$ such that $|N^-[Q]|\geq n/2$, and showed that it follows from the small QK conjecture.
  In this paper, we establish that the large QK conjecture implies the small QK conjecture with a weaker constant. We also show that the large QK conjecture is equivalent to a sharp version of it, answering affirmatively a question of Spiro. We formulate variable versions of these conjectures, which are still open in general.
  Not many digraphs are known to have quasi-kernels of size $(1-\alpha)n$ or less. We show this for digraphs with bounded dichromatic number, by proving the stronger statement that every sink-free digraph contains a quasi-kernel of size at most $(1-1/k)n$, where $k$ is the digraph's kernel-perfect number.</description>

Abstract: We provide a general recursive method for constructing transfer systems on finite lattices. Using this we calculate the number of homotopically distinct $N_\infty$ operads for dihedral groups $D_{p^n}$, $p &gt; 2$ prime, and cyclic groups $C_{qp^n}$, $p \neq q$ prime. We then further display some of the beautiful combinatorics obtained by restricting to certain homotopically meaningful $N_\infty$ operads for these groups.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative probability insights into the double-scaling limit SYK Model with constant perturbations: moments cumulants and $q$-independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extending our previous results, we study the double-scaling limit SYK (DSSYK) model with an additional diagonal matrix with a fixed number $c$ of nonzero constant entries $\theta$. This constant diagonal term can be rewritten in terms of Majorana fermion products. Its specific formula depends on the value of $c$. We find exact expressions for the moments of this model. More importantly, by proposing a moment-cumulant relation, we reinterpret the effect of introducing a constant term in the context of non-commutative probability theory. This gives rise to a $\tilde{q}$ dependent mixture of independences within the moment formula. The parameter $\tilde{q}$, derived from the $q$-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck ($q$-OU) process, controls this transformation. It interpolates between classical independence ($\tilde{q}=1$) and Boolean independence ($\tilde{q}=0$). The underlying combinatorial structures of this model provide the non-commutative probability connections. Additionally, we explore the potential relation between these connections and their gravitational path integral counterparts.</description>

      <title>A greedy heuristic for graph burning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, the optimization version of the graph burning problem seeks for a sequence of vertices, $(u_1,u_2,...,u_k) \in V(G)^k$, with minimum $k$ and such that every $v \in V(G)$ has distance at most $k-i$ to some vertex $u_i$. The length $k$ of the optimal solution is known as the burning number and is denoted by $b(G)$, an invariant that helps quantify the graph's vulnerability to contagion. This paper explores the advantages and limitations of an $\mathcal{O}(mn + kn^2)$ deterministic greedy heuristic for this problem, where $n$ is the graph's order, $m$ is the graph's size, and $k$ is a guess on $b(G)$. This heuristic is based on the relationship between the graph burning problem and the clustered maximum coverage problem, and despite having limitations on paths and cycles, it found most of the optimal and best-known solutions of benchmark and synthetic graphs with up to 102400 vertices.</description>

      <title>The $k$-Opt algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem has exponential running time for $k \ge 5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $k$-Opt algorithm is a local search algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem. Starting with an initial tour, it iteratively replaces at most $k$ edges in the tour with the same number of edges to obtain a better tour. Krentel (FOCS 1989) showed that the Traveling Salesman Problem with the $k$-Opt neighborhood is complete for the class PLS (polynomial time local search) and that the $k$-Opt algorithm can have exponential running time for any pivot rule. However, his proof requires $k \gg 1000$ and has a substantial gap. We show the two properties above for a much smaller value of $k$, addressing an open question by Monien, Dumrauf, and Tscheuschner (ICALP 2010). In particular, we prove the PLS-completeness for $k \geq 17$ and the exponential running time for $k \geq 5$.</description>

      <title>On the zeros of partition functions with multi-spin interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ be probability spaces, let $X$ be their direct product, let $\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_m: X \longrightarrow {\Bbb C}$ be random variables, each depending only on a few coordinates of a point $x=(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$, and let $f=\phi_1 + \ldots + \phi_m$. The expectation $E\thinspace e^{\lambda f}$, where $\lambda \in {\Bbb C}$, appears in statistical physics as the partition function of a system with multi-spin interactions, and also in combinatorics and computer science, where it is known as the partition function of edge-coloring models, tensor network contractions or a Holant polynomial. Assuming that each $\phi_i$ is 1-Lipschitz in the Hamming metric of $X$, that each $\phi_i(x)$ depends on at most $r \geq 2$ coordinates $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ of $x \in X$, and that for each $j$ there are at most $c \geq 1$ functions $\phi_i$ that depend on the coordinate $x_j$, we prove that $E\thinspace e^{\lambda f} \ne 0$ provided $| \lambda | \leq \ (3 c \sqrt{r-1})^{-1}$ and that the bound is sharp up to a constant factor. Taking a scaling limit, we prove a similar result for functions $\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_m: {\Bbb R}^n \longrightarrow {\Bbb C}$ that are 1-Lipschitz in the $\ell^1$ metric of ${\Bbb R}^n$ and where the expectation is taken with respect to the standard Gaussian measure in ${\Bbb R}^n$. As a corollary, the value of the expectation can be efficiently approximated, provided $\lambda$ lies in a slightly smaller disc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s and Graham found it conceivable that the best $n$-term Egyptian underapproximation of almost every positive number for sufficiently large $n$ gets constructed in a greedy manner, i.e., from the best $(n-1)$-term Egyptian underapproximation. We show that the opposite is true: the set of real numbers with this property has Lebesgue measure zero. [This note solves Problem 206 on Bloom's website "Erd\H{o}s problems".]</description>
