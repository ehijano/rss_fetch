      <title>GPT takes the SAT: Tracing changes in Test Difficulty and Math Performance of Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) is crucial for college admissions but its effectiveness and relevance are increasingly questioned. This paper enhances Synthetic Control methods by introducing "Transformed Control", a novel method that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) powered by Artificial Intelligence to generate control groups. We utilize OpenAI's API to generate a control group where GPT-4, or ChatGPT, takes multiple SATs annually from 2008 to 2023. This control group helps analyze shifts in SAT math difficulty over time, starting from the baseline year of 2008. Using parallel trends, we calculate the Average Difference in Scores (ADS) to assess changes in high school students' math performance. Our results indicate a significant decrease in the difficulty of the SAT math section over time, alongside a decline in students' math performance. The analysis shows a 71-point drop in the rigor of SAT math from 2008 to 2023, with student performance decreasing by 36 points, resulting in a 107-point total divergence in average student math performance. We investigate possible mechanisms for this decline in math proficiency, such as changing university selection criteria, increased screen time, grade inflation, and worsening adolescent mental health. Disparities among demographic groups show a 104-point drop for White students, 84 points for Black students, and 53 points for Asian students. Male students saw a 117-point reduction, while female students had a 100-point decrease.</description>

      <title>Simple robust two-stage estimation and inference for generalized impulse responses and multi-horizon causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel two-stage estimation and inference procedure for generalized impulse responses (GIRs). GIRs encompass all coefficients in a multi-horizon linear projection model of future outcomes of y on lagged values (Dufour and Renault, 1998), which include the Sims' impulse response. The conventional use of Least Squares (LS) with heteroskedasticity- and autocorrelation-consistent covariance estimation is less precise and often results in unreliable finite sample tests, further complicated by the selection of bandwidth and kernel functions. Our two-stage method surpasses the LS approach in terms of estimation efficiency and inference robustness. The robustness stems from our proposed covariance matrix estimates, which eliminate the need to correct for serial correlation in the multi-horizon projection residuals. Our method accommodates non-stationary data and allows the projection horizon to grow with sample size. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate our two-stage method outperforms the LS method. We apply the two-stage method to investigate the GIRs, implement multi-horizon Granger causality test, and find that economic uncertainty exerts both short-run (1-3 months) and long-run (30 months) effects on economic activities.</description>

      <title>A new mapping of technological interdependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00014v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How does technological interdependence affect innovation? We address this question by examining the influence of neighbors' innovativeness and the structure of the innovators' network on a sector's capacity to develop new technologies. We study these two dimensions of technological interdependence by applying novel methods of text mining and network analysis to the documents of 6.5 million patents granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) between 1976 and 2021. We find that, in the long run, the influence of network linkages is as important as that of neighbor innovativeness. In the short run, however, positive shocks to neighbor innovativeness yield relatively rapid effects, while the impact of shocks strengthening network linkages manifests with delay, even though lasts longer. Our analysis also highlights that patent text contains a wealth of information often not captured by traditional innovation metrics, such as patent citations.</description>

      <title>Robust Bayesian Method for Refutable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04512v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a robust Bayesian method for economic models that can be rejected by some data distributions. The econometrician starts with a refutable structural assumption which can be written as the intersection of several assumptions. To avoid the assumption refutable, the econometrician first takes a stance on which assumption $j$ will be relaxed and considers a function $m_j$ that measures the deviation from the assumption $j$. She then specifies a set of prior beliefs $\Pi_s$ whose elements share the same marginal distribution $\pi_{m_j}$ which measures the likelihood of deviations from assumption $j$. Compared to the standard Bayesian method that specifies a single prior, the robust Bayesian method allows the econometrician to take a stance only on the likeliness of violation of assumption $j$ while leaving other features of the model unspecified. We show that many frequentist approaches to relax refutable assumptions are equivalent to particular choices of robust Bayesian prior sets, and thus we give a Bayesian interpretation to the frequentist methods. We use the local average treatment effect ($LATE$) in the potential outcome framework as the leading illustrating example.</description>

      <title>Performance of Empirical Risk Minimization For Principal Component Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes bounds on the predictive performance of empirical risk minimization for principal component regression. Our analysis is nonparametric, in the sense that the relation between the prediction target and the predictors is not specified. In particular, we do not rely on the assumption that the prediction target is generated by a factor model. In our analysis we consider the cases in which the largest eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the predictors grow linearly in the number of predictors (strong signal regime) or sublinearly (weak signal regime). The main result of this paper shows that empirical risk minimization for principal component regression is consistent for prediction and, under appropriate conditions, it achieves near-optimal performance in both the strong and weak signal regimes.</description>

      <title>Occupational segregation in a Roy model with composition preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.04485v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a model of labor market sector self-selection that combines comparative advantage, as in the Roy model, and sector composition preference. Two groups choose between two sectors based on heterogeneous potential incomes and group compositions in each sector. Potential incomes incorporate group specific human capital accumulation and wage discrimination. Composition preferences are interpreted as reflecting group specific amenity preferences as well as homophily and aversion to minority status. We show that occupational segregation is amplified by the composition preferences and we highlight a resulting tension between redistribution and diversity. The model also exhibits tipping from extreme compositions to more balanced ones. Tipping occurs when a small nudge, associated with affirmative action, pushes the system to a very different equilibrium, and when the set of equilibria changes abruptly when a parameter governing the relative importance of pecuniary and composition preferences crosses a threshold.</description>

      <title>Why you should also use OLS estimation of tail exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Even though practitioners often estimate Pareto exponents running OLS rank-size regressions, the usual recommendation is to use the Hill MLE with a small-sample correction instead, due to its unbiasedness and efficiency. In this paper, we advocate that you should also apply OLS in empirical applications. On the one hand, we demonstrate that, with a small-sample correction, the OLS estimator is also unbiased. On the other hand, we show that the MLE assigns significantly greater weight to smaller observations. This suggests that the OLS estimator may outperform the MLE in cases where the distribution is (i) strictly Pareto but only in the upper tail or (ii) regularly varying rather than strictly Pareto. We substantiate our theoretical findings with Monte Carlo simulations and real-world applications, demonstrating the practical relevance of the OLS method in estimating tail exponents.</description>
