      <title>Hyperluminous Supersoft X-ray Sources in the Chandra Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperluminous supersoft X-ray sources, such as bright extragalactic sources characterized by particularly soft X-ray spectra, offer a unique opportunity to study accretion onto supermassive black holes in extreme conditions. Examples of hyperluminous supersoft sources are tidal disruption events, systems exhibiting quasi-periodic eruptions, changing-look AGN, and anomalous nuclear transients. Although these objects are rare phenomena amongst the population of X-ray sources, we developed an efficient algorithm to identify promising candidates exploiting archival observations. In this work, we present the results of a search for hyperluminous supersoft X-ray sources in the recently released Chandra catalog of serendipitous X-ray sources. This archival search has been performed via both a manual implementation of the algorithm we developed and a novel machine-learning-based approach. This search identified a new tidal disruption event, which might have occurred in an intermediate-mass black hole. This event occurred between 2001 and 2002, making it one of the first tidal disruption events ever observed by Chandra.</description>

      <title>BatAnalysis -- A Comprehensive Python Pipeline for Swift BAT Time-Tagged Event Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) is a coded aperture gamma-ray instrument with a large field of view that was designed to detect and localize transient events. When a transient is detected, either on-board or externally, the BAT saves time-tagged event (TTE) data which provides the highest quality information of the locations of the photons on the detector plane and their energies. This data can be used to produce spectra, lightcurves, and sky images of a transient event. While these data products are produced by the Swift Data Center and can be produced by current software, they are often preset to certain time and energy intervals which has limited their use in the current time domain and multi-messenger environment. Here, we introduce a new capability for the BatAnalysis python package to download and process TTE data under an open-source pythonic framework that allows for easy interfacing with other python packages. The new capabilities of the BatAnalysis software allows for TTE data to be used by the community in a variety of advanced customized analyses of astrophysical sources which BAT may have TTE data for, such as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs), Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXB), Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters, magnetars, and many other sources. We highlight the usefulness of the BatAnalysis package in analyzing TTE data produced by an on-board GRB trigger, a FRB external trigger, a sub-threshold detection of the LMXB EXO 0748-676, and an external trigger of a GRB that BAT detected during a slew.</description>

      <title>A New Interpretation for the Hot Corona in Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work attempts to provide a new interpretation for the hot corona in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). A thin
  parabolic magnetic reconnection layer, anchored at the innermost disk and extending along the boundary of the
  magnetic tower for a few tens of gravitational radii, serves as a hard-X-ray source above the disk. Within this
  reconnection layer, the tearing instability leads to the formation of a chain of plasmoids, which contain relativistic
  electrons that generate X-ray radiation through inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of soft photons emitted by the
  accretion disk. Based on previous theoretical works and numerical simulations, we develop a heuristic framework
  to parameterize the geometry and magnetization of the reconnection layer, as well as to compute both the power of
  the IC-scattering radiation and the height of the reconnection layer. Our model allows for a quantitative
  investigation of the relation between the height of the corona and the X-ray radiation luminosity, which can be
  directly compared against the observed relation from X-ray reverberation mapping of individual AGNs. The
  theoretical results are in good agreement with the observations of IRAS 13224-3809, indicating the validation of
  our model.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Lorentz Invariance Violation from Gamma-ray Burst rest-frame spectral lags using Profile Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reanalyze the spectral lag data for 56 GRBs in the cosmological rest frame to search for Lorentz Invariance Violation using frequentist inference. For this purpose, we use the technique of profile likelihood to deal with the nuisance parameters corresponding to a constant astrophysical spectral lag in the GRB rest frame and the unknown intrinsic scatter, while the parameter of interest is the energy scale ($E_{QG}$) for LIV. With this method, we do not obtain a global minimum for $\chi^2$ as a function of $E_{QG}$ up to the Planck scale. Therefore, we can set one-sided lower limits on $E_{QG}$ in a seamless manner. The 95% c.l. lower limits which we obtain on $E_{QG}$ are then given by $E_{QG}\geq 1.22 \times 10^{15}$ GeV and $E_{QG}\geq 6.64\times 10^{5}$ GeV, for linear and quadratic LIV, respectively. Therefore, this work represents yet another proof of principles application of profile likelihood in the search for LIV using GRB spectral lags.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Index in Fluid Models of Collisionless Black Hole Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of highly sub-Eddington accretion onto black holes commonly use a single fluid model for the collisionless, near-horizon plasma. These models must specify an equation of state. It is common to use an ideal gas with $p = (\gamma - 1) u$ and $\gamma = 4/3, 13/9,$ or $5/3$, but these produce significantly different outcomes. We discuss the origins of this discrepancy and the assumptions underlying the single fluid model. The main result of this investigation is that under conditions relevant to low luminosity black hole accretion the best choice of single fluid adiabatic index is close to but slightly less than $5/3$. Along the way we provide a simple equilibrium model for the relation between the ion-to-electron dissipation ratio and the ion to electron temperature ratio and explore the implications for electron temperature fluctuations in Event Horizon Telescope sources.</description>

      <title>Secondary spins of extreme mass ratio inspirals: Measurement precision and astrophysical applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), consisting of a secondary (stellar mass) black hole (BH) orbiting around a supermassive BH, are one of the primary targets for future spaceborne gravitational wave (GW) detectors. The spin of the secondary BH encodes the formation history of the stellar mass BH and the formation process of the EMRI. In this work, we construct a kludge EMRI waveform model taking the secondary spin into account and forecast the measurement precision of the secondary spin by future spaceborne GW detectors with the Fisher information matrix. We find the secondary spin should be measured with a reasonably good precision for generic eccentric and inclined EMRIs, though the measurement precision largely degrades for low-eccentricity and nearly equatorial EMRIs. As an example of its astrophysical applications, we propose that the secondary spin can be used for distinguishing dry (loss cone) EMRIs (where the secondary BHs were born in the collapse of individual massive stars and are of low spin) and Hills EMRIs (where the secondary BHs are remnants of massive star binaries and the secondary spins follow a bimodal distribution).</description>

      <title>Propagation Delays of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Ray from Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the time delay incurred during ultra-high energy cosmic ray (UHECR) propagation over cosmological distances and its potential impact on the correlation between UHECR directions of arrival and sources such as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), the UHECR chemical composition, and extragalactic magnetic field constraints. We propagate particles in different magnetic field configurations, spanning over an extended range of particle Larmor radii and magnetic field coherence lengths, also including attenuation losses. We find that UHECR delays could easily be comparable to (and longer than) AGN duty cycles, effectively erasing the correlation between known AGNs and UHECR anisotropies. We finally consider how strong constraints on the chemical composition of the heaviest UHECRs could enable a better characterization of extragalactic magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>X-ray Emission Properties of a Compact Symmetric Object Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the X-ray observations obtained from \xmm\, and \chandra\, for a sample of bona-fide Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) to investigate their X-ray emission properties. Ultimately, we obtain 32 effective X-ray observational spectra from 17 CSOs. Most spectra can be well described by an absorbed single power-law model, with the exception of 6 spectra requiring an additional component in the soft X-ray band and 2 spectra exhibiting an iron emission line component. The data analysis results unveil the diverse characteristics of X-ray emission from CSOs. The sample covers X-ray luminosity ranging within $10^{40}-10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$, intrinsic absorbing column density ($N_{\rm H}^{\rm int}$) ranging within $10^{20}-10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, and photon spectral index ($\Gamma_{\rm X}$) ranging within 0.75--3.0. None of the CSOs in our sample have $N_{\rm H}^{\rm int}$ &gt; $10^{23}\rm~cm^{-2}$, indicating that the X-ray emission in these CSOs is not highly obscured. The distribution of $\Gamma_{\rm X}$ for these CSOs closely resembles that observed in a sample of radio-loud quasars and low-excitation radio galaxies (RGs). In the radio--X-ray luminosity panel, these CSOs exhibit a distribution more akin to FR I RGs than FR II RGs, characterized by higher luminosities. The positive correlation between $\Gamma_{\rm X}$ and the Eddington ratio, which has been noted in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei, is not observed in these CSOs. These findings suggest that although the contribution of the disk-corona system cannot be completely ruled out, jet/lobe radiation likely plays a dominant role in the X-ray emission of these CSOs.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Multi-Wavelength Flares of the Most Distant Very High-Energy (&gt;100 GeV) Gamma-ray Emitting Blazar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study analyzes the multi-wavelength flaring activity of the distant flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) OP 313 (z=0.997) during November 2023 to March 2024, using data from Fermi-Large Area Telescope, Swift X-ray Telescope, and Ultraviolet and Optical Telescope. The analysis highlights two significant very high energy(VHE) detection epochs and GeV gamma-ray ?aring episodes, providing insight into jet emission processes and radiative mechanisms. Key findings include broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) evolution, including enigmatic X-ray spectral changes. Modeling of the multi-wavelength SED with a one-zone leptonic radiative processes attributes the emissions to synchrotron radiation, Synchrotron Self-Compton (SSC), and External Compton (EC) mechanisms, with torus photons as the primary source for EC processes. The results suggest that the gamma-ray emitting region lies outside the broad-line region but within the dusty torus. Furthermore, we find that the radiated power is significantly smaller than the total jet power, suggesting that most of the bulk energy remains within the jet even after passing through the blazar emission zone. These findings advance our understanding of particle acceleration, jet dynamics, and photon field interactions in FSRQs.</description>

      <title>Exploring the capability of the HH 80-81 protostellar jet to accelerate relativistic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Protostellar jets driven by massive protostars are collimated outflows producing high-speed shocks through dense interstellar medium. Fast shocks can accelerate particles up to relativistic energies via diffusive shock acceleration, producing non-thermal emission that can originate ${\gamma}$-ray photons. HH 80-81 is one of the most powerful collimated protostellar jets in our galaxy, with non-thermal emission detected in radio, X-ray, and ${\gamma}$-ray bands. Characterize the ${\gamma}$-ray emission originated by the accelerated particles of the region is crucial for demonstrating the capability of protostars to accelerate cosmic rays.
  Aims. Our goal is to determine the particle distribution that is producing the ${\gamma}$-ray spectrum of HH 80-81 in order to ascertain the leptonic/hadronic origin of the ${\gamma}$-ray emission. We aim at associating the high-energy emission in the region with the HH 80-81 system, characterize its spectrum, and elaborate emission models based on what we expect from the diffusive shock acceleration.
  Methods. We use the 15 yr database provided by the Fermi-LAT satellite to study the high-energy emission of the jet, spanning from 300 MeV to 100 GeV. In addition, we perform a source association based on positional arguments. Then, we employ the naima and Gamera softwares to analyze the possible mechanisms that are producing ${\gamma}$-rays considering the ambient conditions. We perform a radiative fitting and study the nature of the particles behind the ${\gamma}$-ray emission.
  Results. By analyzing all the candidates to produce the ${\gamma}$-ray emission that we detect, we conclude that HH 80-81 is the most probable candidate to explain the ${\gamma}$-ray emission in the region. The detected spectrum can be explained by both hadronic and leptonic particle components.</description>

      <title>Deriving pulsar pair-production multiplicities from pulsar wind nebulae using H.E.S.S. and LHAASO observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe) dominate the galactic gamma-ray sky at very high energies, and are major contributors to the leptonic cosmic ray flux. However, whether or not pulsars also accelerate ions to comparable energies is not yet experimentally confirmed. We aim to constrain the birth period and pair-production multiplicity for a set of pulsars. In doing so, we aim to constrain the proportion of ions in the pulsar magnetosphere and hence the proportion of ions that could enter the pulsar wind. We estimate possible ranges of the value of the average pair production multiplicity for a sample of 26 pulsars in the Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF) catalogue, which have also been observed by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) telescopes. We then derive lower limits for the pulsar birth periods and average pair production multiplicities for a subset of these sources where the extent of the pulsar wind nebula and surrounding supernova shell have been measured in the radio. We also derive curves for the average pair production multiplicities as a function of birth period for sources recently observed by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). We show that there is a potential for hadrons entering the pulsar wind for most of the H.E.S.S. and LHAASO sources we consider, dependent upon the efficiency of luminosity conversion into particles. We also present estimates of the pulsar birth period for six of these sources, which all fall into the range of $\simeq$10-50 ms.</description>

      <title>Non-Keplerian Charged Accretion Disk Orbiting a Black Hole~Pulsar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have focused on how spinning black holes (BHs) within a binary system containing a strongly magnetized neutron star, then immersed in external magnetic fields, can acquire charge through mechanisms like the Wald process and how this charge could power pulsar-like electromagnetic radiation. Those objects called ``Black hole pulsar'' mimic the behaviour of a traditional pulsar, and they can generate electromagnetic fields, such as magnetic dipoles. Charged particles within an accretion disk around the black hole would then be influenced not only by the gravitational forces but also by electromagnetic forces, leading to different geometries and dynamics. In this context, we focus here on the interplay of the magnetic dipole and the accretion disk. We construct the equilibrium structures of non-conducting charged perfect fluids orbiting Kerr black holes under the influence of a dipole magnetic field aligned with the rotation axis of the BH. The dynamics of the accretion disk in such a system are shaped by a complex interplay between the non-uniform, non-Keplerian angular momentum distribution, the black hole's induced magnetic dipole, and the fluid's charge. We show how these factors jointly influence key properties of the disk, such as its geometry, aspect ratio, size, and rest mass density.</description>

      <title>Fifteen Years of M31* X-ray Variability and Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We append an additional fifteen years (2009-2024) to the Chandra X-ray light curve of M31*, the supermassive black hole at the center of M31, the Andromeda galaxy. Extending and expanding on the work in Li et al. 2011, we show that M31* has remained in an elevated X-ray state from 2006 through at least 2016 (when regular Chandra monitoring ceased) and likely through 2024, with the most recent observations still showing an elevated X-ray flux. We identify one moderate flare in 2013 where the other nuclear X-ray sources are in low-flux states, making that flare a valuable target for followup with multiwavelength and multimessenger archival data. We extract a mostly uncontaminated spectrum for M31* from this observation, showing that its X-ray properties are similar to those observed at Sgr A* in its quiescent state by Baganoff et al. 2003. Furthermore, we find no substantial change in the source's hardness ratio in the 2006 and 2013 flares compared to the post-2006 elevated state, suggesting the these flares are increases in the regular X-ray emission mechanisms instead of entirely new emission modes. Our extended light curve for M31* provides valuable context for multimessenger or multiwavelength observations of nearby supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>TeV Afterglow of BOAT GRB without Jet Break</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new model for the TeV afterglow of GRB 221009A. The rapid increase of the TeV flux in the very early phase is reproduced by the magnetic acceleration. We consider the change in the radial structure of the circumstellar medium from homogeneous to wind-like to describe the breaks in the TeV light curve. Our results imply a highly magnetized ejecta with a significantly thick width, making the deceleration time around 400 s for observers. In our model, no early jet break is required.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Deep-stacking for High-energy Neutrino Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the discovery of the brightest high-energy neutrino sources in the sky, the further detection of fainter sources is more challenging. A natural solution is to combine fainter source candidates, and instead of individual detections, aim to identify and learn about the properties of a larger population. Due to the discreteness of high-energy neutrinos, they can be detected from distant very faint sources as well, making a statistical search benefit from the combination of a large number of distant sources, a called deep-stacking. Here we show that a Bayesian framework is well-suited to carry out such statistical probes, both in terms of detection and property reconstruction. After presenting an introductory explanation to the relevant Bayesian methodology, we demonstrate its utility in parameter reconstruction in a simplified case, and in delivering superior sensitivity compared to a maximum likelihood search in a realistic simulation.</description>

      <title>Searching for Dark Matter with MeVCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CubeSat technology is an emerging alternative to large-scale space telescopes due to its short development time and cost-effectiveness. MeVCube is a proposed CubeSat mission to study the least explored MeV gamma-ray sky, also known as the `MeV gap'. Besides being sensitive to a plethora of astrophysical phenomena, MeVCube can also be important in the hunt for dark matter. If dark matter is made up of evaporating primordial black holes, then it can produce photons in the sensitivity range of MeVCube. Besides, particle dark matter can also decay or annihilate to produce final state gamma-ray photons. We perform the first comprehensive study of dark matter discovery potential of a near-future MeVCube CubeSat mission. In all cases, we find that MeVCube will have much better discovery reach compared to existing limits in the parameter space. This may be an important step towards discovering dark matter through its non-gravitational interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar mergers and common-envelope evolution are fast (dynamical-timescale) interactions in binary stars that drastically alter their evolution. They are key to understanding a plethora of astrophysical phenomena. Stellar mergers are thought to produce blue straggler stars, blue supergiants, and stars with peculiar rotation and surface chemical abundances. Common-envelope evolution is proposed as a key stage in the formation of gravitational wave sources, X-ray binaries, type Ia supernovae, cataclysmic variables, and other systems. A significant fraction (tens of percent) of binary stars undergo such a phase during their evolution. In this chapter, we first discuss processes leading to a stellar merger or common-envelope phase. We then explain these complex interactions, starting from underlying physical principles like entropy sorting in stellar mergers and the energy formalism in common envelopes. This is followed by a more complete picture revealed by three-dimensional (magneto)hydrodynamical simulations. The outcomes of these interactions are discussed comprehensively and special emphasis is given to the role of magnetic fields. Both stellar mergers and common-envelope evolution remain far from fully understood, and we conclude by highlighting open questions in their study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since their first detection in 2015, gravitational wave observations have enabled a variety of studies, ranging from stellar evolution to fundamental physics. In this chapter, we focus on their use as "standard sirens", describing the different methodologies that can be adopted to measure cosmological parameters with compact object binaries from ground-based gravitational wave detectors. We cover the three main classes of standard siren measurements, showing how the expansion of the Universe can be constrained through Bayesian statistics both with gravitational wave observations alone and with the aid of electromagnetic emission from the electromagnetic counterpart of gravitational wave events and from galaxies. Finally, we summarize the existing measurements and prospects for future constraints on cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>PyLMT: A transient detection pipeline for the 4-m International Liquid Mirror Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The International Liquid Mirror Telescope (ILMT) is a 4-m aperture, zenith-pointing telescope with a field-of-view of 22', situated in the foothills of the Himalayas. The telescope operates in continuous survey mode, making it a useful instrument for time-domain astronomy, particularly for detecting transients, variable stars, active galactic nuclei variability, and asteroids. This paper presents the PyLMT transient detection pipeline to detect such transient/varying sources in the ILMT images. The pipeline utilises the image subtraction technique to compare a pair of images from the same field, identifying such sources in subtracted images with the help of convolutional neural networks (CNN) based real/bogus classifiers. The test accuracies determined for the real/bogus classifiers ranged from 94% to 98%. The resulting precision of the pipeline calculated over candidate alerts in the ILMT frames is 0.91. It also houses a CNN-aided transient candidate classifier that classifies the transient/variable candidates based on host morphology. The test accuracy of the candidate classifier is 98.6%. It has the provision to identify catalogued asteroids and other solar system objects using public databases. The median execution time of the pipeline is approximately 29 minutes per image of 17 minutes exposure. Relevant CNNs have been trained on data acquired with the ILMT during the cycle of October-November 2022. Subsequent tests on those images have confirmed the detection of numerous catalogued asteroids, variable stars, and other uncatalogued sources. The pipeline has been operational and has detected 12 extragalactic transients, including 2 new discoveries in the November 2023-May 2024 observation cycle.</description>

      <title>Novel charged black hole solutions in conformal Killing gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate static spherically symmetric solutions in the context of Conformal Killing Gravity, a recently proposed modified theory of gravity that offers a new approach to the cosmological constant problem. Coupling this new theory with nonlinear electrodynamics, we derive the corresponding field equations and study their behavior under different parameter choices. We analyze three different models, each focusing on different key parameters. Our results reveal a rich causal structure with multiple horizons and transitions between extreme and non-extreme solutions depending on the parameter values. Moreover, we compute the nonlinear Lagrangian density for each model and find that it agrees with Maxwell theory in the limit $F \rightarrow 0$. We also confirm the existence of a central curvature singularity via the Kretschmann scalar. To connect our theoretical results with observational prospects, we study the black hole shadows associated with each model. The analysis shows that the calculated shadow size and shape of the three proposed models are consistent with the data for the supermassive object at the center of our galaxy and are therefore possible candidates for modeling this structure.</description>

      <title>Detection of Ubiquitous Circumbinary Matter in Hot Subdwarfs Formed from Common-Envelope Ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of compact binary systems is largely driven by their evolution through a common envelope (CE) phase, crucial for understanding phenomena such as type Ia supernovae and black hole mergers. Despite their importance, direct observational evidence for CE material has been elusive due to the transient nature of these envelopes. Numerical simulations suggest that some envelope material may persist post-ejection. In this study, we investigate circumstellar material (CSM) surrounding hot subdwarf (sdB) stars, focusing on material ejected during the CE phase of binary evolution. We analyze Ca II K absorption lines in 727 sdB candidates from the LAMOST-LRS survey, selecting 145 stars with strong absorption features, indicating the presence of CSM. We compare the velocities of the Ca II K lines with the systemic velocities of sdB binaries, confirming that the material originates from ejected common-envelope material. The results show that the CSM persists long after the CE event, suggesting the formation of a stable, long-lived circumstellar environment around sdB stars. This study enhances our understanding of the role of CSM in post-CE evolution and provides new insights into the physical processes shaping the evolution of sdB binaries.</description>

      <title>A $\chi^2$ statistic for the identification of strongly lensed gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) emanated by stellar mass compact binary coalescences (CBCs), and lensed by galaxy- or cluster-scale lenses, will produce two or more copies of the GW signal. These will have identical phase evolution but differing amplitudes. Such lensing signatures are expected to be detected by the end of the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra's (LVK's) fifth observing run (O5). In this work, we propose a novel $\chi_{\mathrm{lens}}^2$ statistic to segregate pairs of detected GW events as either lensed or unlensed, using templates typically used in GW searches. The statistic is an application of the generalized $\chi^2$ discriminator described in \citet{dhurandhar2017}, tailored to probe the similarity (or lack thereof) between the phase evolutions of two CBC signals. We assess the performance of $\chi_{\mathrm{lens}}^2$ on a realistic astrophysical dataset of lensed and unlensed CBCs detectable in O4, assuming a single LIGO-like detector at design sensitivity. We find that we can correctly identify lensed events with efficiencies comparable to existing Bayesian and machine learning methods. Evaluating $\chi_{\mathrm{lens}}^2$ is orders of magnitude faster than Bayesian methods. Moreover, the statistics of $\chi_{\mathrm{lens}}^2$, in stationary Gaussian noise, are fully understood, in contrast to machine learning methods. $\chi_{\mathrm{lens}}^2$ can, therefore, be used to rapidly and accurately weed out the vast majority of unlensed candidate pairs and identify lensed pairs.</description>

      <title>Modeling Cosmic Rays at AGN Jet-Driven Shock Fronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback is a key physical mechanism proposed to regulate star formation, primarily in massive galaxies. In particular, cosmic rays associated with AGN jets have the potential to efficiently suppress cooling flows and quench star formation. The locus of cosmic ray production and their coupling to gas play a crucial role in the overall self-regulation process. To investigate this in detail, we conduct high-resolution, non-cosmological MHD simulations of a massive $10^{14} {\rm M_\odot}$ halo using the FIRE-2 (Feedback In Realistic Environments) stellar feedback model. We explore a variety of AGN jet feedback scenarios with cosmic rays, examining different values for the cosmic ray energy fraction in jets, cosmic ray coupling sites (in the black hole vicinity versus at the large-scale jet-driven shock front), and jet precession parameters. Our findings indicate that when cosmic rays are injected near the black hole, they efficiently inhibit black hole accretion by suppressing the density before the jet propagates out to large radii. As a result, this leads to episodic black hole accretion, with the jet not having sufficient energy flux to reach large radii and impact cooling flows. Conversely, if the cosmic rays are injected at the jet-driven shock front, not only does the jet sustain a higher overall energy flux for an extended period, but it also disperses cosmic rays out to larger radii, more effectively suppressing the cooling flow. Furthermore, the period and angle of jet precession can influence the position of shock fronts. We identify an optimal range of jet precession periods ($\sim$ tens of Myr) that generates shocks at the inner circumgalactic medium, where cooling flows are most severe. We report that this specific configuration offers the most effective scenario for cosmic rays at the shock front to suppress the cooling flow and star formation.</description>

      <title>Numerical evolution of the resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamic equations: a minimally implicit Runge-Kutta scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Minimally-Implicit Runge-Kutta (MIRK) methods for the numerical evolution of the resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RRMHD) equations, following the approach proposed by Komissarov (2007) of an augmented system of evolution equations to numerically deal with constraints. Previous approaches rely on Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) Runge-Kutta schemes; in general, compared to explicit schemes, IMEX methods need to apply the recovery (which can be very expensive computationally) of the primitive variables from the conserved ones in numerous additional times. Moreover, the use of an iterative process for the recovery could have potential convergence problems, increased by the additional number of required loops. In addition, the computational cost of the previous IMEX approach in comparison with the standard explicit methods is much higher. The MIRK methods are able to deal with stiff terms producing stable numerical evolutions, minimize the number of recoveries needed in comparison with IMEX methods, their computational cost is similar to the standard explicit methods and can actually be easily implemented in numerical codes which previously used explicit schemes. Two standard numerical tests are shown in the manuscript.</description>

      <title>A practical Bayesian method for gravitational-wave ringdown analysis with multiple modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) ringdown signals from black holes (BHs) encode crucial information about the gravitational dynamics in the strong-field regime, which offers unique insights into BH properties. In the future, the improving sensitivity of GW detectors is to enable the extraction of multiple quasi-normal modes (QNMs) from ringdown signals. However, incorporating multiple modes drastically enlarges the parameter space, posing computational challenges to data analysis. Inspired by the $F$-statistic method in the continuous GW searches, we develope an algorithm, dubbed as FIREFLY, for accelerating the ringdown signal analysis. FIREFLY analytically marginalizes the amplitude and phase parameters of QNMs to reduce the computational cost and speed up the full-parameter inference from hours to minutes, while achieving consistent posterior and evidence. The acceleration becomes more significant when more QNMs are considered. Rigorously based on the principle of Bayesian inference and importance sampling, our method is statistically interpretable, flexible in prior choice, and compatible with various advanced sampling techniques, providing a new perspective for accelerating future GW data analysis.</description>

      <title>Non-conservation of linear momentum in widely used hierarchical methods in gravitational gas dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper considers the implementation of the fast multipole method (FMM) in the PHANTOM code for the calculation of forces in a self-gravitating system. The gravitational interaction forces are divided into short-range and long-range interactions depending on the value of the tree opening parameter of the hierarchical kd-tree. It is demonstrated that Newton's third law holds for any pair of cells of the kd-tree engaged in mutual interaction. However, for the entire system a linear momentum is not conserved. As a result, there is an unphysical force that causes the center of mass to migrate. For example, for a pair of neutron stars, the displacement of the system's center of mass is found to be comparable to the radii of the objects at times of a few tens of Keplerian revolutions. This displacement cannot be reduced by increasing the number of particles for values of the tree opening parameter greater than 0.2. For smaller values, the time required for the calculation is significantly longer.</description>

      <title>Gamma/hadron separation in the TAIGA experiment with neural network methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the ability of rare VHE gamma ray selection with neural network methods is investigated in the case when cosmic radiation flux strongly prevails (ratio up to {10^4} over the gamma radiation flux from a point source). This ratio is valid for the Crab Nebula in the TeV energy range, since the Crab is a well-studied source for calibration and test of various methods and installations in gamma astronomy. The part of TAIGA experiment which includes three Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes observes this gamma-source too. Cherenkov telescopes obtain images of Extensive Air Showers. Hillas parameters can be used to analyse images in standard processing method, or images can be processed with convolutional neural networks. In this work we would like to describe the main steps and results obtained in the gamma/hadron separation task from the Crab Nebula with neural network methods. The results obtained are compared with standard processing method applied in the TAIGA collaboration and using Hillas parameter cuts. It is demonstrated that a signal was received at the level of higher than 5.5{\sigma} in 21 hours of Crab Nebula observations after processing the experimental data with the neural network method.</description>

      <title>A Poisson Process AutoDecoder for X-ray Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray observing facilities, such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the eROSITA, have detected millions of astronomical sources associated with high-energy phenomena. The arrival of photons as a function of time follows a Poisson process and can vary by orders-of-magnitude, presenting obstacles for common tasks such as source classification, physical property derivation, and anomaly detection. Previous work has either failed to directly capture the Poisson nature of the data or only focuses on Poisson rate function reconstruction. In this work, we present Poisson Process AutoDecoder (PPAD). PPAD is a neural field decoder that maps fixed-length latent features to continuous Poisson rate functions across energy band and time via unsupervised learning. PPAD reconstructs the rate function and yields a representation at the same time. We demonstrate the efficacy of PPAD via reconstruction, regression, classification and anomaly detection experiments using the Chandra Source Catalog.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.05720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We draw attention to two unanswered questions in radio pulsars' theory. The first one concerns the inclination angles between magnetic and rotation axes. We show that the very existence of interpulse pulsars indicates that all possible angles are realized. The second one is the question of the break of the death line on the PPdot-diagram. We show that this break can be easily explained by a very mechanism of secondary plasma generation.</description>

      <title>Robust integration of fast flavor conversions in classical neutrino transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum kinetic evolution of neutrinos in dense environments, such as the core-collapse supernovae or the neutron star mergers, can result in fast flavor conversion (FFC), presenting a significant challenge to achieving robust astrophysical modeling of these systems. Recent works that directly simulate the quantum kinetic transport of neutrinos in localized domains have suggested that the asymptotic outcome of FFCs can be modeled by simple analytical prescriptions when coarse grained over a size much larger than the FFC length scale. In this Letter, by leveraging such a scale separation, we incorporate the analytical prescriptions into global simulations that solve the classical neutrino transport equation including collisions and advection under spherical symmetry. We demonstrate that taking this approach allows to obtain results that quantitatively agree with those directly from the corresponding global quantum kinetic simulations and precisely capture the collisional feedback effect for cases where the FFC happens inside the neutrinosphere. Notably, the effective scheme does not require resolving the FFC time and length scales, hence only adds negligible computational overhead to classical transport. Our work highlights that efficient and robust integration of FFCs in classical neutrino transport used in astrophysical simulation can be feasible.</description>

      <title>X-Ray Bright Active Galactic Nuclei in Local Dwarf Galaxies: Insights from eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although supermassive black holes (SMBHs) reside in the heart of virtually every massive galaxy, it remains debated whether dwarf galaxies commonly host SMBHs. Because low-mass galaxies may retain memory of the assembly history of their black holes (BHs), probing the BH occupation fraction of local dwarf galaxies might offer insights into the growth and seeding mechanisms of the first BHs. In this work, we exploit the Western half of the eROSITA all-sky survey (covering 20,000 deg$^2$) and compile a catalog of accreting SMBHs in local ($D&lt;200$ Mpc) dwarf galaxies. Cleaning our sample from X-ray background sources, X-ray binaries, and ultraluminous X-ray sources, we identify 74 AGN-dwarf galaxy pairs. Using this large and uniform sample, we derive a luminosity function of dwarf galaxy AGN, fitting it with a power law function and obtaining dN/d$L_{\rm X} = (15.9\pm2.2)\times L_{\rm X}^{-1.63\pm0.05}$. Measuring the offset between the dwarf galaxies centroids and the X-ray sources, we find that $\approx50\%$ of the AGN are likely off-nuclear, in agreement with theoretical predictions. We compare the BH-to-stellar mass relation of our sample with the local and high-redshift relations, finding that our sources better adhere to the former, suggesting that local AGN across different mass scales underwent a similar growth history. Finally, we compare our sources with semi-analytical models: while our sample's shallowness prevents distinguishing between different seeding models, we find that the data favor models which keep SMBH in dwarf galaxies active at a moderate rate, motivating model improvement by comparison to AGN in the dwarf galaxy regime.</description>

      <title>Probing X-ray Timing and Spectral Variability in the Blazar PKS 2155-304 Over a Decade of XMM-Newton Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blazars, a class of active galactic nuclei (AGN) powered by supermassive black holes, are known for their remarkable variability across multiple timescales and wavelengths. Despite significant advancements in our understanding of AGN central engines, thanks to both ground- and space-based telescopes, the details of the mechanisms driving this variability remain elusive. The primary objective of this study is to constrain the X-ray variability properties of the TeV blazar PKS 2155-304. We conducted a comprehensive X-ray spectral and timing analysis, focusing on both long-term and intra-day variability (IDV), using data from 22 epochs of {\it XMM-Newton} observations collected over 15 years (2000 to 2014). For the timing analysis, we estimated the fractional variability, variability amplitude, minimum variability timescales, flux distribution, and power spectral density. In the spectral analysis, we fitted the X-ray spectra using power-law, log-parabola, and broken power-law models to determine the best-fitting parameters. We observed moderate IDV in the majority of the light curves. Seven out of the 22 observations showed a clear bimodal flux distribution, indicating the presence of two distinct flux states. Our analysis revealed a variable power spectral slope. Most hardness ratio plots did not show significant variation with flux, except for two observations, where the hardness ratio changed considerably with flux. The fitted X-ray spectra favored the broken power law model for the majority of observations, indicating break in the spectral profiles. The findings of this work shed light on the IDV of blazars, providing insights into the non-thermal jet processes that drive the observed flux variations.</description>

      <title>Exclusion of a direct progenitor detection for the Type Ic SN 2017ein based on late-time observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To date, SN 2017ein is the only Type Ic supernova with a directly identified progenitor candidate. This candidate points to a very massive ($&gt;$45 $M_\odot$) Wolf-Rayet progenitor, but its disappearance after the explosion of SN 2017ein remains unconfirmed. In this work, we revisit SN 2017ein in late-time images acquired by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) at 2.4--3.8 yrs after peak brightness. We find this source has not disappeared and its brightness and color remain almost the same as in the pre-explosion images. Thus, we conclude that the pre-explosion source is not the genuine progenitor of SN 2017ein. We exclude the possibility that it is a companion star of the progenitor, since it has a much lower extinction than SN 2017ein; its color is also inconsistent with a star cluster, indicated by the newly added magnitude limit in F336W, apart from F555W and F814W. We suggest, therefore, this source is an unrelated star in chance alignment with SN 2017ein. Based on the low ejecta mass, we propose that SN 2017ein is most likely originated from a moderately massive star with $M_{\rm ini}$ $\sim$ 8--20 $M_\odot$, stripped by binary interaction, rather than a very massive Wolf-Rayet progenitor.</description>

      <title>Constraints from Gamma-ray Burst Phenomenology on the Hypothesis of Quark Star as the central engine of Gamma-ray Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of a strange quark star (QS) predicted in the Bodmer-Witten hypothesis has been a matter of debate. The combustion from a neutron star to a strange QS in its accreted process in a low-mass X-ray binary is proposed to be a scenario that generates gamma-ray bursts (GRBs); the baryon contamination of the outflow is very low and mainly from the masses of crusts ($M_{\rm crust}$) of QSs. A special subset of GRBs detected in the past 16 years are collected and used to estimate $M_{\rm crust}$ under this assumption of QSs as central engines. Correspondingly, $M_{\rm crust}$ is calculated in the frameworks of several models for cold dense quark matter (MIT bag model and Nambu-Jona-Lasino model with or without the impacts from the formation of color superconducting condensates being considered), for comparison with the observation. In conclusion, we find that the GRB samples have so far failed to provide positive support for this hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Direct evidence for r-process nucleosynthesis in delayed MeV emission from the SGR 1806-20 magnetar giant flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of heavy elements synthesized through the rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process) has been an enduring mystery for over half a century. Cehula et al. (2024) recently showed that magnetar giant flares, among the brightest transients ever observed, can shock-heat and eject neutron star crustal material at high velocity, achieving the requisite conditions for an $r$-process. Patel et al. (in prep.) confirmed an $r$-process in these ejecta using detailed nucleosynthesis calculations. Radioactive decay of the freshly synthesized nuclei releases a forest of gamma-ray lines, Doppler broadened by the high ejecta velocities $v \gtrsim 0.1c$ into a quasi-continuous spectrum peaking around 1 MeV. Here, we show that the predicted emission properties (light-curve, fluence, and spectrum) match a previously unexplained hard gamma-ray signal seen in the aftermath of the famous December 2004 giant flare from the magnetar SGR 1806-20. This MeV emission component, rising to peak around 10 minutes after the initial spike before decaying away over the next few hours, is direct observational evidence for the synthesis of $\sim 10^{-6}M_{\odot}$ of $r$-process elements. The discovery of magnetar giant flares as confirmed $r$-process sites, contributing at least $\sim 1$-$10\%$ of the total Galactic abundances, has implications for the Galactic chemical evolution, especially at the earliest epochs probed by low-metallicity stars. It also implicates magnetars as potentially dominant sources of heavy cosmic rays. Characterization of the $r$-process emission from giant flares by resolving decay line features offers a compelling science case for NASA's forthcoming COSI nuclear spectrometer, as well as next-generation MeV telescope missions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Fundamental Planes of Black Hole Activity for Strong Jet Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whether the X-ray emissions of strong jet sources originate from disk+coronas or jets is still controversial. In this work, we constructed a strong jet sample containing 50 flat-spectrum radio quasars, 51 low-synchrotron-peaked BL Lac objects and 18 intermediate-synchrotron-peaked BL Lac objects to explore the origin of X-ray emissions. Generally, blazars are the typical radio-loud active galactic nucleus with a powerful jet toward the observer, causing their broadband emissions to be boosted. By considering the Doppler boosting effect, we obtain the intrinsic radio--X-ray correlation and the fundamental plane (FP) of black hole activity for the strong jet sources: the intrinsic radio--X-ray correlation is $L_{\rm{R,int}}\propto L_{\rm{X,int}}^{1.04}$, which favor the jet-dominated mode, the intrinsic FP is $\log L_{\rm{R,int}}=(1.07\pm0.06)\log L_{\rm{X,int}}-(0.22\pm0.10)\log M_{\rm{BH}}-(3.77\pm2.11)$, which can be interpreted by the hybrid mode of jet+standard disk. Our results suggest that the X-ray emissions of strong jet sources are dominated by the jets, but there may also be a small contribution from the disk. In addition, the radio--X-ray correlation and FP of strong jet sources do not have a significant dependence on the Eddington-ratio.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Annihilation via Breit-Wigner Enhancement with Heavier Mediator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new scenario that both the dark matter freeze-out in the early Universe and its possible annihilation for indirect detection around a supermassive black hole are enhanced by a Breit-Wigner resonance. With the mediator mass larger than the total initial dark matter mass, this annihilation is almost forbidden at late times. Thus, the stringent cosmic microwave background and indirect detection constraints do not apply. However, a supermassive black hole can accelerate the dark matter particles to reactivate this resonant annihilation whose subsequent decay to photons leaves a unique signal. The running Fermi-LAT and the future COSI satellites can test this scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the late-time relaxation of a perturbed Schwarzschild black hole, driven by a source term representing an infalling particle in generic orbits. We consider quasi-circular and eccentric binaries, dynamical captures and radial infalls, with orbital dynamics driven by an highly accurate analytical radiation reaction. After reviewing the description of the late-time behaviour as an integral over the whole inspiral history, we derive an analytical expression exactly reproducing the slow relaxation observed in our numerical evolutions, obtained with a hyperboloidal compactified grid, for a given particle trajectory. We find this signal to be a superposition of an infinite number of power-laws, the slowest decaying term being Price's law. Next, we use our model to explain the several orders-of-magnitude enhancement of tail terms for binaries in non-circular orbits, shedding light on recent unexpected results obtained in numerical evolutions. In particular, we show the dominant terms controlling the enhancement to be activated when the particle is far from the BH, with small tangential and radial velocities soon before the plunge. As we corroborate with semi-analytical calculations, this implies that for large eccentricities the tail amplitude can be correctly extracted even when starting to evolve only from the last apastron before merger. We discuss the implications of these findings on the extraction of late-time tail terms in non-linear evolutions, and possible observational consequences. We also briefly comment on the scattering scenario, and on the connection with the soft graviton theorem.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical search method for gravitational waves from stellar-mass binary black holes in noisy space-based detector data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future space-based laser interferometric detectors, such as LISA, will be able to detect gravitational waves (GWs) generated during the inspiral phase of stellar-mass binary black holes (SmBBHs). The detection and characterization of GWs from SmBBHs poses a formidable data analysis challenge, arising from the large number of wave cycles that make the search extremely sensitive to mismatches in signal and template parameters in a likelihood-based approach. This makes the search for the maximum of the likelihood function over the signal parameter space an extremely difficult task. We present a data analysis method that addresses this problem using both algorithmic innovations and hardware acceleration driven by GPUs. The method follows a hierarchical approach in which a semi-coherent $\mathcal{F}$-statistic is computed with different numbers of frequency domain partitions at different stages, with multiple particle swarm optimization (PSO) runs used in each stage for global optimization. An important step in the method is the judicious partitioning of the parameter space at each stage to improve the convergence probability of PSO and avoid premature convergence to noise-induced secondary maxima. The hierarchy of stages confines the semi-coherent searches to progressively smaller parameter ranges, with the final stage performing a search for the global maximum of the fully-coherent $\mathcal{F}$-statistic. We test our method on 2.5 years of a single LISA TDI combination and find that for an injected SmBBH signal with a SNR between $\approx 11$ and $\approx 14$, the method can estimate (i) the chirp mass with a relative error of $\lesssim 0.01\%$, (ii) the time of coalescence within $\approx 100$ sec, (iii) the sky location within $\approx 0.2$ ${\rm deg}^2$, and (iv) orbital eccentricity at a fiducial signal frequency of 10 mHz with a relative error of $\lesssim 1\%$.

      <title>High-Energy and Ultra-High-Energy Neutrinos from Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are capable of emitting extremely energetic particles independent of their interactions with the Standard Model. In this work, we investigate whether PBHs evaporating in the early universe could be responsible for some of the observed high-energy neutrinos above the TeV or PeV scale in the present universe. We compute the energy spectrum of neutrinos directly emitted by PBHs with a monochromatic mass function and estimate the wash-out point, which determines the maximum energy of the spectrum. We find that the spectrum generally extends to high energies following a power law of $E_{\nu}^{-3}$ until it reaches the wash-out point, which crucially depends on the PBH mass. For PBHs of $10^{13}$ grams, the spectrum can extend up to the PeV scale, though the flux is too low for detection. We also consider an indirect production mechanism involving dark particles that are emitted by PBHs and decay into neutrinos at a much later epoch. This mechanism allows lighter (such as those in the gram to kilogram range) PBHs to produce more energetic neutrino fluxes without being washed out by the thermal plasma in the early universe. In this scenario, we find that ultra-high-energy neutrinos around or above the EeV scale can be generated, with sufficiently high fluxes detectable by current and future high-energy neutrino observatories such as IceCube and GRAND.</description>

      <title>Formation of giant radio sources in galaxy clusters</title>

Abstract: The number of observed giant radio sources (GRSs) has increased significantly in recent years, yet their formation mechanisms remain elusive. The discovery of giant radio galaxies within galaxy clusters has further intensified the ongoing debates. We utilize magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the formation of GRSs in cluster environments. To avoid confounding the effects of power and total energy injection, we hold the energy of jet outbursts fixed and study the effect of power by varying the active duration of the jets. Furthermore, we examine the roles of magnetic, thermal, and kinetic energy components by adjusting their fractions in the jets. Additionally, we calculate radio emission for comparison with observations in the radio power-linear size diagram (P-D diagram). Finally, we also study the energy transport processes of different jets. We find the "lower power-larger bubble" effect: lower-power jets tend to produce larger radio sources with fixed total jet energy. Regarding different energy components, jets dominated by toroidal magnetic field energy generate larger radio sources than kinetic and thermal energy-dominated jets. Conversely, strong poloidal magnetic fields hinder radio lobe growth. When injecting $2.06 \times 10^{59}$ erg into a $10^{14}$ solar mass halo, only jets with powers of approximately $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3}$ Eddington luminosity efficiently traverse the observational region in the P-D diagram. Our findings suggest that energetic, long-lasting (low-power), continuous jets endowed with significant toroidal magnetic fields facilitate the formation of GRSs in cluster environments. However, although the jets with significantly lower power can generate substantially larger radio sources, their faintness may render them unobservable.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Vanishing Nonlinear Love Numbers of Schwarzschild Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tidal Love numbers parametrize the conservative induced tidal response of self-gravitating objects. It is well established that asymptotically-flat black holes in four-dimensional general relativity have vanishing Love numbers. In linear perturbation theory, this result was shown to be a consequence of ladder symmetries acting on black hole perturbations. In this work, we show that a black hole's tidal response induced by a static, parity-even tidal field vanishes for all multipoles to all orders in perturbation theory. Our strategy is to focus on static and axisymmetric spacetimes for which the dimensional reduction to the fully nonlinear Weyl solution is well-known. We define the nonlinear Love numbers using the point-particle effective field theory, matching with the Weyl solution to show that an infinite subset of the static, parity-even Love number couplings vanish, to all orders in perturbation theory. This conclusion holds even if the tidal field deviates from axisymmetry. Lastly, we discuss the symmetries underlying the vanishing of the nonlinear Love numbers. An $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb R)$ algebra acting on a covariantly-defined potential furnishes ladder symmetries analogous to those in linear theory. This is because the dynamics of the potential are isomorphic to those of a static, massless scalar on a Schwarzschild background. We comment on the connection between the ladder symmetries and the Geroch group that is well-known to arise from dimensional reduction.</description>

      <title>Non-locality in Quadrupolar Gravitational Radiation</title>

Abstract: General Relativity suffers for two main problems which have not yet been overcome: it predicts spacetime singularities and cannot be formulated as a perturbative renormalizable theory. In particular, many attempts have been made for avoiding singularities, such as considering higher order or infinite derivative theories. The price to pay in both cases is to give up locality and therefore they are known altogether as non-local theories of gravity. In this paper, we investigate how to recognize the presence of non-local effects by exploiting the power emitted by gravitational waves in a binary system in presence of non-local corrections as $R\Box^{-1}R$ to the Hilbert-Einstein action. After solving the field equations in terms of the source stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ and obtaining the gravitational wave stress-energy pseudo-tensor, $\tau_{\mu\nu}$, we find that the General Relativity quadrupole formula is modified in a non-trivial way, making it feasible to find a possible signature of non-locality. Our final results on the gravitational wave stress-energy pseudo-tensor could also be applied to several astrophysical scenarios involving energy or momentum loss, potentially providing multiple tests for non-local deviations from General Relativity. We finally discuss the detectability of the massless transverse scalar mode, discovering that, although this radiation is extremely weak, in a small range around the model divergence, its amplitude could fall within the low-frequency Einstein Telescope sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Solar Gamma-Ray Evidence for a Distinct Population of $&gt;$ 1 MeV Flare-Accelerated Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Significant improvements in our understanding of nuclear $\gamma$-ray line production and instrument performance allow us to better characterize the continuum emission from electrons at energies $\gtrsim$ 300 keV during solar flares. We represent this emission by the sum of a power-law extension of hard X-rays (PL) and a power law times an exponential function (PLexp). We fit the $\gamma$-ray spectra in 25 large flares observed by SMM, RHESSI, and Fermi with this summed continuum along with calculated spectra of all known nuclear components. The PL, PLexp, and nuclear components are separated spectroscopically. A distinct origin of the PLexp is suggested by significant differences between its time histories and those of the PL and nuclear components. RHESSI imaging/spectroscopy of the 2005 January 20 flare, reveals that the PL and nuclear components come from the footpoints while the PLexp component comes from the corona. While the index and flux of the anisotropic PL component are strongly dependent on the flares' heliocentric angle, the PLexp parameters show no such dependency and are consistent with a component that is isotropic. The PLexp spectrum is flat at low energies and rolls over at a few MeV. Such a shape can be produced by inverse Compton scattering of soft X-rays by 10--20 MeV electrons and by thin-target bremsstrahlung from electrons with a spectrum that peaks between 3 -- 5 MeV, or by a combination of the two processes. These electrons can produce radiation detectable at other wavelengths.</description>

      <title>H$\alpha$-X-ray Surface Brightness Correlation for Filaments in Cooling Flow Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive galaxies in cooling flow clusters display clear evidence of feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Joint X-ray and radio observations have shown that AGN radio jets push aside the surrounding hot gas and form cavities in the hot intracluster medium (ICM). These systems host complex, kiloparsec-scale, multiphase filamentary structures, from warm ionized (10,000 K) to cold molecular ($&lt;$100 K). These striking clumpy filaments are believed to be a natural outcome of thermally unstable cooling from the hot ICM, likely triggered by feedback processes while contributing to feeding the AGN via Chaotic Cold Accretion (CCA). However, the detailed constraints on the formation mechanism of the filaments are still uncertain, and the connection between the different gas phases has to be fully unveiled. By leveraging a sample of seven X-ray bright cooling-flow clusters, we have discovered a tight positive correlation between the X-ray surface brightness and the H$\alpha$ surface brightness of the filaments over two orders of magnitude, as also found in stripped tails.</description>

      <title>Can Dark Stars account for the star formation efficiency excess at very high redshifts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently conducted observations of massive galaxies at high redshifts, revealing a notable anomaly in their star formation efficiency (SFE). Motivated by the recent identification of three $\sim 10^{6}M_\odot$ dark star candidates, we investigate whether dark stars can be the origin of the SFE excess. It turns out that the excess can be reproduced by a group of dark stars with $M \gtrsim 10^{3}\, \rm M_{\odot}$, because of their domination in generating primary UV radiation in high-redshift galaxies. The genesis of these dark stars is attributed to the capture of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) within a mass range of tens of GeV to a few TeV. However, if the top-heavy initial mass function of dark stars holds up to $\sim 10^{5}M_\odot$, the relic black holes stemming from their collapse would be too abundant to be consistent with the current observations of Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). We thus suggest that just a small fraction of SFE excess may be contributed by the very massive dark stars and the majority likely originated from other reasons such as the Population III stars in view of their rather similar UV radiation efficiencies.</description>

      <title>Mining the time axis with TRON. I. Millisecond pulsars in Omega Centauri, Terzan 5 and 47 Tucanae detected through MeerKAT interferometric imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09488v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medium-timescale (minutes to hours) radio transients are a relatively unexplored population. The wide field-of-view and high instantaneous sensitivity of instruments such as MeerKAT provides an opportunity to probe this class of sources, using image-plane detection techniques. We aim to systematically mine archival synthesis imaging data in order to search for medium-timescale transients and variables that are not detected by conventional long-track image synthesis techniques. We deploy a prototype blind transient and variable search pipeline named TRON. This processes calibrated visibility data, constructs high-time cadence images, performs a search for variability on multiple timescales, and extracts lightcurves for detected sources. As proof of concept, we apply it to three MeerKAT observations of globular clusters, known to host transient or variable sources. We detect a previously known eclipsing MSP suspected to be a `black widow' system, in the globular cluster Omega Centauri, with a light curve confirming the eclipsing nature of the emission. We detect a previously known `red back' eclipsing MSP in the globular cluster Terzan 5. Using observations of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae, we detect two known millisecond pulsars (MSPs), and one previously reported MSP candidate, with hints of eclipsing behaviour.</description>

      <title>Intervening nuclear obscuration changing the X-ray look of the $z\approx6$ QSO CFHQS J164121+375520</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: X-ray observations of the optically selected $z=6.025$ QSO CFHQS J164121+375520 (hereafter J1641) revealed that its flux dropped by a factor $\gtrsim7$ from 2018, when it was a bright and soft X-ray source, to 2021. Such a strong variability amplitude has not been observed before among $z&gt;6$ QSOs, and the underlying physical mechanism was unclear. We carried out a new X-ray and rest-frame UV monitoring campaign of J1641 over 2022-2024. We detected J1641 with Chandra in the 2-7 keV band, while no significant emission is detected at softer X-ray energies, making J1641 an X-ray changing look QSO at $z&gt;6$. Comparing with the 2018 epoch, the 0.5-2 keV flux dropped dramatically by a factor $&gt;20$. We ascribe this behaviour to intervening, and still ongoing, obscuration by Compton-thick gas intercepting our line of sight between 2018 and 2021. The screening material could be an inner disk or a failed nuclear wind that increased their thickness. Another possibility is that we have witnessed an occultation event due to dust-free clouds located at sub-pc/pc scales, similar to those recently invoked to explain the remarkable X-ray weakness of AGN discovered by JWST. These interpretations are also consistent with the lack of strong variations of the QSO rest-frame UV lightcurve over the same period. Future monitoring of J1641 and the possible discovery of other X-ray changing look QSOs at $z&gt;6$ will provide us with precious information about the physics of rapid supermassive black-hole growth at high redshift.</description>
