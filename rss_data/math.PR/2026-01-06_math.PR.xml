      <title>Central limit theorem for a partially observed interacting system of Hawkes processes I: subcritical case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a system of $N$ Hawkes processes and observe the actions of a subpopulation of size $K \le N$ up to time $t$, where $K$ is large. The influence relationships between each pair of individuals are modeled by i.i.d.Bernoulli($p$) random variables, where $p \in [0,1]$ is an unknown parameter. Each individual acts at a {\it baseline} rate $\mu &gt; 0$ and, additionally, at an {\it excitation} rate of the form $N^{-1} \sum_{j=1}^{N} \theta_{ij} \int_{0}^{t} \phi(t-s)\,dZ_s^{j,N}$, which depends on the past actions of all individuals that influence it, scaled by $N^{-1}$ (i.e. the mean-field type), with the influence of older actions discounted through a memory kernel $\phi \colon \mathbb{R}{+} \to \mathbb{R}{+}$. Here, $\mu$ and $\phi$ are treated as nuisance parameters. The aim of this paper is to establish a central limit theorem for the estimator of $p$ proposed in \cite{D}, under the subcritical condition $\Lambda p &lt; 1$.</description>

      <title>Convergence of higher derivatives of random polynomials with independent roots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mu$ be a probability measure on $\mathbb C$, and let $P_n$ be the random polynomial whose zeros are sampled independently from $\mu$. We study the asymptotic distribution of zeros of high-order derivatives of $P_n$. We show that, for large classes of measures $\mu$, the empirical distribution of zeros of the $k$-th derivative converges back to $\mu$ for all derivative orders $k=o(n/\log n)$. This includes all discrete measures and a broad family of measures satisfying a mild dimension-nondegeneracy condition.
  We further establish a robustness result showing that, for arbitrary $\mu$, even after adding a vanishing proportion of roots drawn from a dimension-nondegenerate perturbation, the derivative zero measures still converge back to $\mu$. These results break the previously known logarithmic barrier on the order of differentiation and demonstrate that the limiting root distribution is preserved under differentiation of order growing nearly linearly with the degree.</description>

      <title>Singular distributions of random variables with independent digits of representation in numeral system with natural base and redundant alphabet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given natural parameters s and r, where $2\leq s\leq r$, we consider the distribution of a random variable $\xi=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}s^{-k}\xi_k\equiv\Delta^{r_s}_{\xi_1\xi_2...\xi_k...},$ where $(\xi_k)$ is a sequence of independent random variables taking values in $\{0,1,...,r\}$ with probabilities $p_0,p_1,...,p_r$, respectively, and all $ p_i&lt;1$. In the case s=3=r, necessary and sufficient conditions for the singularity and absolute continuity of the distribution of random variable are established. The work also discusses the connection between the distribution of random variable and infinite Bernoulli convolutions governed by the corresponding series as well as representations of numbers in the base-3 numeral system with one redundant digit. Several open problems are formulated.</description>

      <title>Importance sampling of unbounded random stopping times: computing committor functions and exit rates without reweighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare events in molecular dynamics are often related to noise-induced transitions between different macroscopic states (e.g., in protein folding). A common feature of these rare transitions is that they happen on timescales that are on average exponentially long compared to the characteristic timescale of the system, with waiting time distributions that have (sub)exponential tails and infinite support. As a result, sampling such rare events can lead to trajectories that can be become arbitrarily long, with not too low probability, which makes the reweighting of such trajectories a real challenge. Here, we discuss rare event simulation by importance sampling from a variational perspective, with a focus on applications in molecular dynamics, in particular the computation of committor functions. The idea is to design importance sampling schemes that (a) reduce the variance of a rare event estimator while controlling the average length of the trajectories and (b) that do not require the reweighting of possibly very long trajectories. In doing so, we study different stochastic control formulations for committor and mean first exit times, which we compare both from a theoretical and a computational point of view, including numerical studies of some benchmark examples.</description>

      <title>On the role of the Ky Fan metric in rough ideal convergence in probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a probability space $(S,\Delta, \mathbb{P})$ and a separable metric space $(U,d)$, the $Ky~Fan$ metric $\rho(X,Y)$ on the space $\mathfrak{X}^0$ of equivalence classes of random variables (w.r.t. almost sure equality) formed from the set $\mathfrak{X}(U)$ of $U$-valued random variables is given by $\rho(X,Y)=\inf \{\varepsilon&gt;0:\mathbb{P}(d(X,Y)&gt;\varepsilon)\leq\varepsilon\}.$ In this article, we primarily introduce the concept of rough ideal convergence in probability which serves as a unifying generalization of both ideal convergence of sequences in metric spaces and convergence of random variables in probability. We demonstrate that the rough ideal limit set is closed and bounded w.r.t. the $Ky~Fan$ metric $\rho$, and that, for a certain class of ideals, it forms an $F_{\sigma\delta}$ subset of $\mathfrak{X}^0$. In this process, we present the key concepts of strong and weak rough ideal cluster points in probability. It turns out that the set of strong rough ideal cluster points in probability is always closed, whereas the weak set is conditionally closed in the metric space ($\mathfrak{X}^0,\rho)$. Finally, we obtain a characterization of a maximal admissible ideal in terms of the sets of strong rough ideal cluster points and the rough ideal limit set in probability.</description>

      <title>Almost-Exact Simulation Scheme for Heston-type Models: Bermudan and American Option Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, an Almost-Exact Simulation (AES) scheme was introduced for the Heston stochastic volatility model and tested for European option pricing. This paper extends this scheme for pricing Bermudan and American options under both Heston and double Heston models. The AES improves Monte Carlo simulation efficiency by using the non-central chi-square distribution for the variance process. We derive the AES scheme for the double Heston model and compare the performance of the AES schemes under both models with the Euler scheme. Our numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the AES scheme in providing accurate option prices with reduced computational time, highlighting its robustness for both models. In particular, the AES achieves higher accuracy and computational efficiency when the number of simulation steps matches the exercise dates for Bermudan options.</description>

      <title>A UCB Bandit Algorithm for General ML-Based Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01061v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ML-UCB, a generalized upper confidence bound algorithm that integrates arbitrary machine learning models into multi-armed bandit frameworks. A fundamental challenge in deploying sophisticated ML models for sequential decision-making is the lack of tractable concentration inequalities required for principled exploration. We overcome this limitation by directly modeling the learning curve behavior of the underlying estimator. Specifically, assuming the Mean Squared Error decreases as a power law in the number of training samples, we derive a generalized concentration inequality and prove that ML-UCB achieves sublinear regret. This framework enables the principled integration of any ML model whose learning curve can be empirically characterized, eliminating the need for model-specific theoretical analysis. We validate our approach through experiments on a collaborative filtering recommendation system using online matrix factorization with synthetic data designed to simulate a simplified two-tower model, demonstrating substantial improvements over LinUCB</description>

      <title>On counting polygons in a crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How many $n$-step polygons exist that contain a given vertex of an infinite quasi-transitive graph $G$? The exponential growth rate of such polygons is identified as the connective constant when $G$ has sub-exponential growth and possesses a so-called square graph height function. The last condition amounts to the requirement that $G$ has a certain ${\Bbb Z}^2$ action of automorphisms. The main theorem extends a result of Hammersley (Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 57 (1961) 516--523) and others for the hypercubic lattice, and responds to Hammersley's challenge to prove such a result for more general "crystals''.</description>

      <title>A Modified Bayesian Criterion for Model Selection in Mixed and Hierarchical Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a modified Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) specifically designed for mixture models and hierarchical structures. This criterion incorporates the determinant of the Hessian matrix of the log-likelihood function, thereby refining the classical Bayes Factor by accounting for the curvature of the likelihood surface. Such geometric information introduces a more nuanced penalization for model complexity. The proposed approach improves model selection, particularly under small-sample conditions or in the presence of noise variables. Through theoretical derivations and extensive simulation studies-including both linear and linear mixed models-we show that our criterion consistently outperforms traditional methods such as BIC, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and related variants. The results suggest that integrating curvature-based information from the likelihood landscape leads to more robust and accurate model discrimination in complex data environments.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Control Methods for Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a stochastic control framework for global optimization over both finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces and the Wasserstein space of probability measures. In the Euclidean setting, the original minimization problem is approximated by a family of regularized stochastic control problems; using dynamic programming, we analyze the associated Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equations and obtain tractable representations via the Cole--Hopf transform and the Feynman--Kac formula. For optimization over probability measures, we formulate a regularized mean-field control problem characterized by a master equation, and further approximate it by controlled $N$-particle systems. We establish that, as the regularization parameter tends to zero (and as the particle number tends to infinity for the optimization over probability measures), the value of the control problem converges to the global minimum of the original objective. Building on the resulting probabilistic representations, Monte Carlo-based numerical schemes are proposed and numerical experiments are reported to illustrate the practical performance of the methods and to support the theoretical convergence rates.</description>

      <title>European Options in Market Models with Multiple Defaults: the BSDE approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study non-linear Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (BSDEs) driven by a Brownian motion and p default martingales. The driver of the BSDE with multiple default jumps can take a generalized form involving an optional finite variation process. We first show existence and uniqueness. We then establish comparison and strict comparison results for these BSDEs, under a suitable assumption on the driver. In the case of a linear driver, we derive an explicit formula for the first component of the BSDE using an adjoint exponential semimartingale. The representation depends on whether the finite variation process is predictable or only optional. We apply our results to the problem of pricing and hedging a European option in a linear complete market with two defaultable assets and in a non-linear complete market with p defaultable assets. Two examples of the latter market model are provided: an example where the seller of the option is a large investor influencing the probability of default of a single asset and an example where the large seller's strategy affects the default probabilities of all p assets.</description>

      <title>Critical volatility threshold for log-normal to power-law transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random walk models with log-normal outcomes fit local market observations remarkably well. Yet interconnected or recursive structures - layered derivatives, leveraged positions, iterative funding rounds - periodically produce power-law distributed events. We show that the transition from log-normal to power-law dynamics requires only three conditions: randomness in the underlying process, rectification of payouts, and iterative feed-forward of expected values. Using an infinite option-on-option chain as an illustrative model, we derive a critical volatility threshold at $\sigma^* = \sqrt{2\pi} \approx 250.66\%$ for the unconditional case. With selective survival - where participants require minimum returns to continue - the critical threshold drops discontinuously to $\sigma_{\text{th}}^{*} = \sqrt{\pi/2} \approx 125.3\%$, and can decrease further with higher survival thresholds. The resulting outcomes follow what we term the Critical Volatility ($V^*$) Distribution - a power-law whose exponent admits closed-form expression in terms of survival pressure and conditional expected growth. The result suggests that fat tails may be an emergent property of iterative log-normal processes with selection rather than an exogenous feature.</description>

      <title>Separation properties of a hybrid point process with determinantal radii and uniform arguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We recently characterized the separated determinantal point processes $\Lambda_\phi$ associated with Fock spaces $\mathcal F_\phi$ in the plane with doubling weight $\phi$. We also showed that, as expected, a more restrictive condition is required to characterize the separated Poisson processes with the same first intensities as $\Lambda_\phi$. To gain further insight into this different behavior, we center our attention to radial weights $\phi(z)$ and introduce a hybrid process $\Lambda_\phi^M=\{r_k e^{i\theta_k}\}_{k=1}^\infty$, where the moduli $r_k$ are taken from $\Lambda_\phi$, while the arguments $\theta_k$ are chosen independently and uniformly in $[0,2\pi)$. Our main result is that $\Lambda_\phi^M$ is almost surely separated if and only if its first intensity satisfies the same condition as in the Poisson case.</description>

Abstract: There are a wide range of first passage time (FTP) problems in the physical and life sciences that can be modelled in terms of a Brownian particle binding to a reactive surface (absorption). However, prior to absorption, the particle may undergo several rounds of surface attachment (adsorption), detachment (desorption) and diffusion. Alternatively, the surface may be stochastically gated so that absorption can only occur when the gate is open. In both cases one can view each return to the surface as a renewal event. In this paper we develop a renewal theory for stochastically gated FTP problems along analogous lines to previous work on adsorption/desorption processes. We proceed by constructing a renewal equation that relates the joint probability density for particle position and the state of a gate (or multiple gates) to the probability density and FPT density for a totally absorbing (non-gated) boundary. This essentially decomposes sample paths into an alternating sequence of bulk diffusion and instantaneous adsorption/desorption events, which is terminated when adsorption coincides with an open gate. Through a variety of examples, we show how renewal theory provides a general mathematical framework for incorporating stochastic gating into FTP problems.</description>

      <title>Pathwise Representation of the Smoothing Distribution in Continuous-Time Linear Gaussian Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the filtering and smoothing problem for continuous-time linear Gaussian systems. While classical approaches such as the Kalman-Bucy filter and the Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother provide recursive formulas for the conditional mean and covariance, we present a pathwise perspective that characterizes the smoothing error dynamics as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. As an application, we show that standard filtering and smoothing equations can be uniformly derived as corollaries of our main theorem. In particular, we provide the first mathematically rigorous derivation of the Bryson-Frazier smoother in the continuous-time setting. Beyond offering a more transparent understanding of the smoothing distribution, our formulation enables pathwise sampling from it, which facilitates Monte Carlo methods for evaluating nonlinear functionals.</description>

      <title>Quantum Talagrand-type Inequalities via Variance Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish dimension-free Talagrand-type variance inequalities on the quantum Boolean cube $M_{2}(\mathbb C)^{\otimes n}$. Motivated by the splitting of the local carr\'e du champ into a conditional-variance term and a pointwise-derivative term, we introduce an $\alpha$-interpolated local gradient $|\nabla_j^{\alpha}A|$ that bridges $\mathrm{Var}_j(A)$ and $|d_jA|^{2}$. For $p\in[1,2],q\in[1,2)$ and $\alpha\in[0,1]$, we prove a Talagrand-type inequality of the form $$\|A\|_\infty^{2-p}\,\bigl\||\nabla^{\alpha}A|\bigr\|_{p}^{p}\ \gtrsim\mathrm{Var}(A)\cdot \max\left\{1, \mathcal{R}(A,q)^{p/2}\right\},$$ where $\mathcal{R}(A,q)$ is a logarithmic ratio quantifying how small either $A-\tau(A)$ or the gradient vector $(d_jA)_j$ is in $L^{q}$ compared to $\mathrm{Var}(A)^{1/2}$. As consequences we derive a quantum Eldan--Gross inequality in terms of the squared $\ell_2$-mass of geometric influences, a quantum Cordero-Erausquin--Eskenazis $L^{p}$-$L^{q}$ inequality, and Talagrand-type $L^{p}$-isoperimetric bounds.
  We further develop a high-order theory by introducing the local variance functional $$V_J(A)=\int_0^\infty 2\mathrm{Inf}^{2}_{J}(P_tA) dt.$$ For $|J|=k$ we prove a local high-order Talagrand inequality relating $\mathrm{Inf}^{p}_{J}[A]$ to $V_J(A)$, with a Talagrand-type logarithmic term when $\mathrm{Inf}^{q}_{J}[A]$ is small. This yields $L^{p}$-$L^{q}$ influence inequalities and partial isoperimetric bounds for high-order influences. Our proofs are purely semigroup-based, relying on an improved Lipschitz smoothing estimate for $|\nabla^{\alpha}P_tA|$ obtained from a sharp noncommutative Khintchine inequality and hypercontractivity.</description>

      <title>Heavy tails in dynamic flow networks: Universal explanation of their emergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Overload-induced cascading failures can cause extreme disruptions in a wide range of networked systems, such as power grids, transportation networks, or financial systems. Empirical studies across domains report that the size of such disruptions often follows a Pareto- or heavy-tailed distribution. While many models reproduce this scaling behavior, they are either tailored to specific domains or based on simplified mechanisms that overlook key aspects of overload cascading behavior. Hence, a general understanding of the mechanisms driving scale-free behavior in these settings remains incomplete. In this paper, we develop a universal and analytically tractable model of overload cascading failures on flow networks, offering a new perspective on how Pareto-tailed disruptions emerge across networks. Our framework shows, under mild assumptions, that heavy-tailed disruptions can arise naturally from Pareto-tailed external inputs, and it establishes a transformation law linking the input and output tail exponents. We further identify broad conditions under which the resulting cascade cost exhibits a heavy-tailed distribution and show that the mechanism is robust across several domains, including power transmission, traffic networks, and processing systems. Our results provide a unified explanation for the emergence of scale-free failures in overload-driven systems and connect previously disparate, application-specific models under a unified framework.</description>

      <title>Modified weighted power variations of the Hermite process and applications to integrated volatility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behaviour of modified weighted power variations of the Hermite process of arbitrary order. By selecting suitable "good" increments and exploiting their decomposition into dominant independent components, we establish a central limit theorem for weighted $p$-variations using tools from Stein-Malliavin calculus. Our results extend previous works on modified quadratic and wavelet-based variations to general powers and to weighted settings, with explicit bounds in Wasserstein distance. We further apply these limit theorems to construct asymptotically Gaussian estimators of integrated volatility in Hermite-driven models, thereby extending fBm-based methods to non-Gaussian settings. The last part of our work contains numerical simulations which illustrate the practical performance of the proposed estimators.</description>

      <title>Forward Performance Processes under Multiple Default Risks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article constructs a forward exponential utility in a market with multiple defaultable risks. Using the Jacod-Pham decomposition for random fields, we first characterize forward performance processes in a defaultable market under the default-free filtration. We then construct a forward utility via a system of recursively defined, indexed infinite-horizon backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with discounting, and establish the existence, uniqueness, and boundedness of their solutions. To verify the required (super)martingale property of the performance process, we develop a rigorous characterization of this property with respect to the general filtration in terms of a set of (in)equalities relative to the default-free filtration. We further extend the analysis to a stochastic factor model with ergodic dynamics. In this setting, we derive uniform bounds for the Markovian solutions of the infinite-horizon BSDEs, overcoming technical challenges arising from the special structure of the system of BSDEs in the defaultable setting. Passing to the ergodic limit, we identify the limiting BSDE and relate its constant to the risk-sensitive long-run growth rate of the optimal wealth process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.00256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a famous paper, Bezuidenhout and Grimmett demonstrated that the contact process dies out at the critical point.Their proof technique has often been used to study the growth of population patterns. The present text is intended as an introduction to their ideas, with examples of minimal technicality. In particular, we recover the basic theorem about Galton-Watson chains: except in a degenerate case, survival is possible only if the fertility rate exceeds 1. The classical proof that is taught in classrooms is essentially analytic, based on generating functions and convexity arguments. Following the Bezuidenhout-Grimmett way, we propose a proof that is more consistent with probabilistic intuition. We also study the survival problem for a cooperative model, mixing sexual and asexual reproduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a topology under which the pair empirical measure of a large class of random walks satisfies a strong Large Deviation principle. The definition of the topology is inspired by the recent article by Mukherjee and Varadhan~\cite{MV2016}. This topology is natural for translation-invariant problems such as the downward deviations of the volume of a Wiener sausage or simple random walk, known as the Swiss cheese model~\cite{BBH2001}. We also adapt our result to some rescaled random walks and provide a contraction principle to the single empirical measure despite a lack of continuity from the projection map, using the notion of diagonal tightness.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the equivalence of definitions for conditional Poisson processes, Cox processes, and stochastic intensities of point processes on the real line. We show that Watanabe's characterisation of conditional Poisson processes in terms of local martingales is necessary and sufficient. Additionally, we consider conditions enabling the measure change method a la Girsanov to alter the intensity of Cox processes to a desired new target intensity, e.g. for the probability reference approach in filtering. Such a measure change exists if a corresponding stochastic exponential is a proper martingale. We show that this holds if the new locally integrable target intensity is the product of the original intensity and another non-negative process.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of the triangular kinetic prudent walk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Expressions for scaling limits of random walks, such as those obtained in several areas of the Probability theory literature, are of great significance in characterizing long term, stationary behavior of random processes. Presumably, in the limit of extremely long periods of time random walks and other stochastic processes including percolation are expected to fall into several \textit{universality classes}; such classes are of great significance in being able to disregard local, microscopic, dynamics, in favor of similar stationary dynamics in the bulk over long times. While several probabilistic models of interest are expected to behave similarly with respect to time, differences in fluctuations of limit shapes, and other stationary profiles, are expected to emerge. Given expressions obtained for the scaling limit of the kinetic prudent walk that have been obtained by Beffara, Friedli, and Velenik, in addition to the scaling limit for the kinetic uniform walk that have been obtained by Petrelis, Sun and Torri, we answer several questions pertaining to limit shapes, for the triangular prudent walk. While one would expect that the kinetic prudent walks, either over the square or triangular lattices, would have differing limit shapes, determining whether any differences between the scaling limit normalizations, and related quantities, emerge is of interest. In comparison to previously obtained scaling limits, we incorporate symmetries of the triangular lattice for computing the scale limit, beginning with a suitable basis.</description>

      <title>A scaling limit of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice Yang-Mills-Higgs theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10507v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The construction of non-Abelian Euclidean Yang-Mills theories in dimension four, as scaling limits of lattice Yang-Mills theories or otherwise, is a central open question of mathematical physics. This paper takes the following small step towards this goal. In any dimension $d\ge 2$, we construct a scaling limit of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice Yang-Mills theory coupled to a Higgs field (under the degenerate potential) transforming in the fundamental representation of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$. After unitary gauge fixing and taking the lattice spacing $\varepsilon\to 0$, and simultaneously taking the gauge coupling constant $g\to 0$ and the Higgs length $\alpha\to \infty$ in such a manner that $\alpha g$ is always equal to $c\varepsilon$ for some fixed $c$ and $g= O(\varepsilon^{50d})$, a stereographic projection of the gauge field is shown to converge to a scale-invariant massive Gaussian field. This gives the first construction of a scaling limit of a non-Abelian lattice Yang-Mills theory in a dimension higher than two, as well as the first rigorous proof of mass generation by the Higgs mechanism in such a theory. Analogous results are proved for $\mathrm{U}(1)$ theory as well. The question of constructing a non-Gaussian scaling limit remains open.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the first passage times of discrete-time branching random walks in ${\mathbb R}^d$ where $d\geq 1$. Here, the genealogy of the particles follows a supercritical Galton-Watson process. We provide asymptotics of the first passage times to a ball of radius one with a distance $x$ from the origin, conditioned upon survival. We provide explicitly the linear dominating term and the logarithmic correction term as a function of $x$. The asymptotics are precise up to an order of $o_{\mathbb P}(\log x)$ for general jump distributions and up to $O_{\mathbb P}(\log\log x)$ for spherically symmetric jumps. A crucial ingredient of both results is the tightness of first passage times. We also discuss an extension of the first passage time analysis to a modified branching random walk model that has been proven to successfully capture shortest path statistics in polymer networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we extend the framework of monotone dynamical systems to a broad and important class of stochastic equations, namely cooperative McKean-Vlasov SDEs with multiplicative noise. Under a locally dissipative assumption, our main theorem establishes the existence of multiple order-related invariant measures in the the Wasserstein space together with monotone connecting orbits (heteroclinic orbits) between them, with respect to the stochastic order. The presence of such connecting orbits also reveals the unstable nature of those invariant measures appearing as their backward limits, a dynamical feature that has remained largely unexplored in stochastic equations. The framework applies to a wide range of classical models, including granular media equations in double-well and multi-well confining potentials with quadratic interaction, perturbed double-well landscapes, and interacting multi-species population models. Our method is based on building a monotone dynamical system that preserves the stochastic order, achieved through a cone compatible with this order and an extension of the classical Dancer-Hess connecting orbit theorem.</description>

More precisely, we consider a directed random walk on the backbone of the supercritical oriented percolation cluster in dimensions $d+1$ with $d\geq 1$ being the spatial dimension. In [BBDS23] an annealed local central limit theorem was proven for all $d\geq 1$ and a quenched local limit theorem under the assumption $d\geq 3$. Here we show that the latter result also holds for all $d \ge 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider mean-field vector spin glasses with possibly non-convex interactions. Up to a small perturbation of the parameters defining the model, the asymptotic behavior of the Gibbs measure is described in terms of a critical point of an explicit functional. In this paper, we study some properties of these critical points. Under modest assumptions ensuring that different types of spins interact, we show that the replica-symmetry-breaking structures of the different types of spins are in one-to-one correspondence with one another. For instance, if some type of spins displays one level of replica-symmetry breaking, then so do all the other types of spins. This extends the recent results of [Electronic Journal of Probability, 27:1-75, 2022] and [Comm. Math. Phys., 394(3):1101-1152, 2022] that were obtained in the case of multi-species spherical spin glasses with convex interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10939v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the mean field backward stochastic differential equations (MFBSDEs) with double mean reflections, whose generator and constraints both depend on the distribution of the solution. When the generator is Lipschitz continuous, based on the backward Skorokhod problem with nonlinear constraints, we investigate the solvability of the doubly mean reflected MFBSDEs by constructing a contraction mapping. Furthermore, if the constraints are linear, the solution can also be constructed by a penalization method. For the case of quadratic growth, we obtain the existence and uniqueness results by using a fixed-point argument, the BMO martingale theory and the {\theta}-method.</description>

      <title>On the Martin boundary for discrete TASEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a problem with three equivalent formulations: describing Gibbs measures for five-vertex model in quadrant; classifying coherent systems on a p-deformation of the Gelfand-Tsetlin graph related to Grothendieck polynomials; finding the Martin boundary for discrete time TASEP with p-geometric jumps. We find a wide family of the Gibbs measures, parameterized by certain analytic functions. A subset of our measures have probabilistic interpretation as interacting particle systems with fixed particles speeds. In contrast to previous related boundary problems, we find that admissible speeds are not arbitrary, but must be larger than $\frac{p}{1-p}$. For this subset we further establish Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem, connecting the fluctuations to families of independent GUE eigenvalues. As a consequence, the measures from the subset are extreme points of the Martin boundary. It remains open whether our list of measures is exhaustive.</description>

      <title>A fresh look at Bivariate Binomial Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04132v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binomial distributions capture the probabilities of `heads' outcomes when a (biased) coin is tossed multiple times. The coin may be identified with a distribution on the two-element set {0,1}, where the 1 outcome corresponds to `head'. One can also toss two separate coins, with different biases, in parallel and record the outcomes. This paper investigates a slightly different `bivariate' binomial distribution, where the two coins are dependent (also called: entangled, or entwined): the two-coin is a distribution on the product {0,1} x {0,1}. This bivariate binomial exists in the literature, with complicated formulations. Here we use the language of category theory to give a new succint formulation. This paper investigates, also in categorically inspired form, basic properties of these bivariate distributions, including their mean, variance and covariance, and their behaviour under convolution and under updating, in Laplace's rule of succession. Furthermore, it is shown how Expectation Maximisation works for these bivariate binomials, so that mixtures of bivariate binomials can be recognised in data. This paper concentrates on the bivariate case, but the binomial distributions may be generalised to the multivariate case, with multiple dimensions, in a straightforward manner.</description>

      <title>Infinite divisibility of $\alpha$-Cauchy and related variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the infinite divisibility of the $\alpha$-Cauchy variable $\mathcal{C}_\alpha$, $\alpha &gt; 1$. The distribution of $\mathcal{C}_2$ is the well-known Cauchy distribution, which is infinitely divisible and even stable. But when $\alpha \neq 2$, there is no known result on the infinite divisibility of $\mathcal{C}_\alpha$. In this paper, we prove that $\mathcal{C}_\alpha$ is infinitely divisible if $1 &lt; \alpha \leq 2$, and we give some sufficient conditions for $|\mathcal{C}_\alpha|^p, \, p\in \mathbb{R},$ to be infinitely divisible, which partially answers the open questions raised by Yano, Yano and Yor in 2009. In the proofs, a class of positive random variables having moments of Gamma type plays an important role, and we investigate the conditions for their existence.</description>

      <title>The Recalibration Conundrum: Hedging Valuation Adjustment for Callable Claims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02479v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamic hedging theory only makes sense in the setup of one given model, whereas the practice of dynamic hedging is just the opposite, with models fleeing after the data through daily recalibration. This is quite of a quantitative finance paradox. In this paper we revisit Burnett (2021) \&amp; Burnett and Williams (2021)'s notion of hedging valuation adjustment (HVA), originally intended to deal with dynamic hedging frictions, in the direction of recalibration and model risks. Specifically, we extend to callable assets the HVA model risk approach of B{\'e}n{\'e}zet and Cr{\'e}pey (2024). The classical way to deal with model risk is to reserve the differences between the valuations in reference models and in the local models used by traders. However, while traders' prices are thus corrected, their hedging strategies and their exercise decisions are still wrong, which necessitates a risk-adjusted reserve. We illustrate our approach on a stylized callable range accrual representative of huge amounts of structured products on the market. We show that a model risk reserve adjusted for the risk of wrong exercise decisions may largely exceed a basic reserve only accounting for valuation differences.</description>

      <title>Sample Path Regularity of Gaussian Processes from the Covariance Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14886v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are the most common formalism for defining probability distributions over spaces of functions. While applications of GPs are myriad, a comprehensive understanding of GP sample paths, i.e. the function spaces over which they define a probability measure, is lacking. In practice, GPs are not constructed through a probability measure, but instead through a mean function and a covariance kernel. In this paper we provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the covariance kernel for the sample paths of the corresponding GP to attain a given regularity. We focus primarily on H\"older regularity as it grants particularly straightforward conditions, which simplify further in the cases of stationary and isotropic GPs. We then demonstrate that our results allow for novel and unusually tight characterisations of the sample path regularities of the GPs commonly used in machine learning applications, such as the Mat\'ern GPs.</description>

      <title>Random interpolation in the Nevanlinna and Smirnov classes and related spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study random interpolating sequences with prescribed radii in the Nevanlinna and Smirnov classes. As it turns out these are characterized by the Blaschke condition. This follows from a more general result. Indeed, we show that this characterization is true in so-called big Hardy-Orlicz spaces. It is noteworthy to mention that conditions for deterministic interpolation in these spaces are given by harmonic majorants, the existence of which is difficult to check in general.</description>

      <title>Cutting a unit square and permuting blocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a random permutation of $kn$ objects that permutes $n$ disjoint blocks of size $k$ and then permutes elements within each block. Normalizing its cycle lengths by $kn$ gives a random partition of unity, and we derive the limit law of this partition as $k,n \to \infty$. The limit may be constructed via a simple square cutting procedure that generalizes stick breaking in the classical case of random permutations ($k=1$). The expected size of the largest part of this square cutting distribution is approximated to be $0.40$, in contrast with the Golomb-Dickman constant around $0.624$ describing the longest cycle of a uniform random permutation as well as the largest prime factor of a random integer. The distribution function of this largest part is shown to also be the mean of a certain multiplicative function. Along the way we give the first extension of the Erd\H{o}s-Tur\'an law to a proper permutation subgroup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the information geometry of L\'evy processes. As a starting point, we derive the $\alpha$-divergence between two L\'evy processes. Subsequently, the Fisher information matrix and the $\alpha$-connection associated with the geometry of L\'evy processes are computed from the $\alpha$-divergence. In addition, we discuss statistical applications of this information geometry. As illustrative examples, we investigate the differential-geometric structures of various L\'evy processes relevant to financial modeling, including tempered stable processes, the CGMY model, and variance gamma processes.</description>

      <title>Products of Infinite Countable Groups Have Fixed Price One</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08325v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the product of any two infinite countable groups has fixed price one. This resolves a longstanding problem posed by Gaboriau. The proof uses the propagation method to construct a Poisson horoball process as a weak limit of a sequence of factors of iid. We then construct a low-cost graphing by showing that the resulting horoballs have a variant of the infinite touching property almost surely, if the metric and the other parameters of the construction are chosen carefully. A novelty is providing direct simple proofs that do not rely on sophisticated results like amenability and double-recurrence, which are used in related works. An essential tool for avoiding any growth conditions is the convergence in the sense of point processes of pointed closed subsets, which is a notion from stochastic geometry. Also, to manage the overlapping of the horoballs, a generalization of the induction lemma is presented for random multisets of a group.</description>

      <title>On the Emergence of Linear Behavior in Large-Scale Dynamical Systems via Spatial Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various natural and engineered systems, from urban traffic flow to the human brain, can be described by large-scale networked dynamical systems. These systems are similar in being comprised of a large number of microscopic subsystems, each with complex nonlinear dynamics and interactions, that collectively give rise to different forms of macroscopic dynamics. Despite significant research, why and how various forms of macroscopic dynamics emerge from underlying micro-dynamics remains largely unknown. In this work we focus on linearity as one of the most fundamental aspects of system dynamics. By extending the theory of mixing sequences, we show that \textit{in a broad class of autonomous nonlinear networked systems, the dynamics of the average of all subsystems' states becomes asymptotically linear as the number of subsystems grows to infinity, provided that, in addition to technical assumptions, pairwise correlations between subsystems decay to 0 as their pairwise distance grows to infinity}. We prove this result when the latter distance is between subsystems' linear indices or spatial locations, and provide extensions to linear time-invariant (LTI) limit dynamics, finite-sample analysis of rates of convergence, and networks of spatially-embedded subsystems with random locations. To our knowledge, this work is the first rigorous analysis of macroscopic linearity in large-scale heterogeneous networked dynamical systems, and provides a solid foundation for further theoretical and empirical analyses in various domains of science and engineering.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations Principle for Isoperimetry and Its Equivalence to Nonlinear Log-Sobolev Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The isoperimetric problem is a classic topic in geometric measure theory, yet critical questions regarding the characterization of optimal solutions -- even asymptotically optimal ones -- remain largely unresolved. In this paper, we investigate the large deviations asymptotics (governing sequences of exponentially small sets) for the isoperimetric problem on the product Riemannian manifold $M^{n}$ endowed with the product probability measure $\nu^{\otimes n}$, where $M$ is a Riemannian manifold satisfying $\mathrm{CD}(0,\infty)$. When the probability measure ${\nu}$ admits a finite moment generating function for squared distance, we establish an exact characterization of the large deviations asymptotics of the isoperimetric profile, which reveals a precise equivalence between this asymptotic isoperimetry and an established strengthening of log-Sobolev inequality -- namely, nonlinear log-Sobolev inequality. It is observed that conditional typical sets, a fundamental concept from information theory, form an asymptotically optimal solution to the isoperimetric problem. This class of subsets further yields an upper bound on the isoperimetric profile in the central limit regime (concerning constant-volume sets), expressed as the Gaussian isoperimetric profile times the square root of spectral gap. Furthermore, we apply our results to establish quantitative relations among optimal constants in isoperimetric, concentration and transport inequalities, additionally covering isoperimetry for subexponentially and superexponentially small sets. Our results provide a rigorous justification from the perspective of nonlinear log-Sobolev inequalities for why isoperimetric minimizers behave fundamentally differently across spaces with distinct geometric structures. Our proof idea integrates tools from information theory, optimal transport, and geometric measure theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic stability and ergodic properties of quantum trajectories under imperfect measurement, extending previous results established for the ideal case of perfect measurement. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition ensuring the convergence of the estimated trajectory, initialized from an estimated state, to the true trajectory. This result is obtained assuming that the associated quantum channel is irreducible. Building on this, we prove the uniqueness of the invariant measure and demonstrate convergence toward this measure.</description>
