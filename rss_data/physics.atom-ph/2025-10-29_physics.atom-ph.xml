      <title>Fast Penning Ionization of Cold Rydberg atoms in an Electric Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe a fast Penning ionization in a dilute gas of cold rubidium Rydberg atoms, in the presence of a static electric field of 50 V/cm, with the ionization rate coefficients for two specific states being measured, which are orders of magnitude higher than the theoretical predictions in field-free space. Our analysis based on a polarized two-atom model reveals that the ionization threshold of Rydberg atoms is lowered by the static electric field, reducing the energy exchange required for Penning ionization and increasing the ionization rate. Beyond this, the dipole-dipole interaction strengthened by the electric field between two Rydberg atoms at a micrometer-scale distance leads to double ionization of the atoms pair, opening a new autoionization channel. Such enhancement of the Penning ionization by a static electric field poses both a threat to the stability and a potential control strategy for quantum systems composed of cold Rydberg atoms with micrometer-scale interatomic separations.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Inclusion of Higher-order Ca$^+$ Isotope Shifts in the King's Plot Yields an Order Improvement on the $e^-$-$n$ Coupling Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By critically evaluating higher-order nonlinear effects to the isotope shifts (ISs) in the low-lying transition frequencies of the singly charged calcium ion, stringent constraint on the electron-neutron coupling due to a hypothetical boson describing physics beyond the Standard Model is inferred. It shows an order magnitude difference compared to the previously reported limit demonstrating importance of higher-order effects in the analysis of nonlinearity in the King's plot. The first-order IS parameters and enhancement factor ($D$) were evaluated using two complementary approaches in the relativistic coupled-cluster theory framework: namely finite-field (FF) and analytical response (AR) approaches. Extraction of the second-order IS parameters in the FF approach show numerical instabilities, so they are determined in the AR approach. Comparison of these factors with previous calculation shows substantial differences in the magnitudes. However, $D$ values from both the FF and AR approaches display excellent agreement. We also show explicitly roles of electron correlation effects in the evaluation of $D$ values accurately.</description>

      <title>Hyperfine-resolved optical spectroscopy of ultracold $^{87}$Rb$^{133}$Cs molecules: the $\mathrm{b}^3\Pi_0$ metastable state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using an ultracold gas of $^{87}$Rb$^{133}$Cs molecules, we perform hyperfine-resolved spectroscopy of transitions from the vibronic ground state to the lowest rovibrational states of the electronic state $\mathrm{b}^3\Pi_0$, as a function of magnetic field. These transitions are spin forbidden, resulting in narrow linewidths, and feature near-diagonal Franck-Condon factors. We develop a model of the hyperfine and Zeeman structure that includes coupling between the $0^+$ and $0^-$ components of $\mathrm{b}^3\Pi_0$. We fit the spectra to obtain rotational and hyperfine coupling constants. We measure transition dipole moments associated with specific transitions by directly observing Rabi oscillations as a function of a resonant laser pulse duration. Using resonant $\pi$ pulses, we prepare molecules in the electronically excited state and directly measure the spontaneous emission rate.</description>

      <title>Laser-driven high-flux source of coherent quasi-monochromatic extreme ultraviolet radiation for coincidence spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a source of coherent extreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation with a flux of 10$^{13}$ photons per second at 26.5 eV. The source is based on high-harmonic generation (HHG) in argon and pumped by a frequency-doubled 100 kHz repetition rate fiber laser providing 30 fs pulses centered at 515 nm. We report on the characterization of the source and the generated XUV radiation using optical imaging and photoelectron spectroscopy. The generated radiation is quasi-monochromatized using a suitably coated XUV mirror and used for coincidence spectroscopy of ions and electrons generated from a cold gas target. The high intensity of the focused XUV pulses is confirmed by the observation of two-photon double ionization in argon. Moreover, we demonstrate the capability to perform pump-probe experiments using XUV and visible laser pulses.</description>

      <title>Collective emission and selective radiance in atomic clouds and arrays coupled to a microring resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the collective dipole-dipole interactions in atoms coupled to a nanophotonic microring resonator. The atoms can interact with each other through light-induced dipole-dipole interactions mediated by free space and through the resonator whispering-gallery modes. The differing characteristics and mismatched wavenumbers of these modes give rise to complex dynamics and provide new opportunities for controlling light-matter interactions. We explore these phenomena in the context of an experimentally realized atom cloud and study the potential of the proposed sub-wavelength atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Creation of a degenerate Bose-Bose mixture of erbium and lithium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the realization of a degenerate mixture of $^{166}$Er and $^{7}$Li atoms in their energetically lowest spin states. The two species are sequentially laser-cooled and loaded into an optical dipole trap, then transported to a glass cell and simultaneously evaporated to degeneracy. Er serves as the coolant for Li, and we observe efficient sympathetic cooling facilitated by a large interspecies elastic scattering cross section. Three-body losses are found to be small, making this platform promising for the study of interacting mixtures with large mass imbalance.</description>
