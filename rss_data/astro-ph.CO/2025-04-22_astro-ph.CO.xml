      <title>Improving CMB constraints on early Universe physics with LSS: A multi-probe forecast including cross-covariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensions to the $\Lambda\textrm{CDM}$ model prior to recombination can modify the growth of perturbations around radiation-matter equality, leaving a distinct signature in the matter power spectrum. Upcoming large-scale structure surveys will be sensitive to these features, allowing tests of early physics that are complementary to the CMB observations. In this paper, we forecast how well the combination of galaxy clustering, weak lensing and CMB lensing two point statistics, also known as $6\times2$pt analysis, will tighten constraints on extensions to the $\Lambda\textrm{CDM}$ model in the early Universe. We find significant improvements, in particular in the case of early dark energy, where the uncertainty on its density parameter could be divided by a factor of $3$ to $4$ when combining Euclid observables with Simons Observatory or CMB-S4, compared to using CMB observations alone. Testing for different scale cuts, we find that much of the constraining power comes from the largest scales which are less prone to systematic uncertainties. We take into account the most significant terms in the cross-covariance between large-scale structure tracers and CMB power spectra, which arises from gravitational lensing. Assessing the impact of this additional cross-covariance on the constraints, we find small corrections for most parameters, except for $A_s$ and $\tau$ where the lensing induced covariance leads to a more significant degradation of constraints. This forecast analysis highlights the potential of combining CMB and galaxy survey data to test the cosmological model. In particular, early Universe physics, relevant before recombination, stands out as a promising area that benefits substantially from this approach.</description>

      <title>Perturbative analysis of the reheating dynamics of $\alpha$-attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the reheating phase following inflation in the context of single-field models, focusing on the perturbative decay of the inflaton into lighter particles. A general analytical framework is presented to compute the reheating temperature $T_{re}$ and related quantities by combining cosmological observations with model-dependent parameters. We derive expressions for $T_{re}$ for three types of interactions: gravitational, scalar, and Yukawa-type fermionic couplings, and apply these results to the class of $\alpha$-attractor inflationary models, which exhibit attractor behavior in the $(n_s, r)$ plane. The main goal of this work is to investigate how key cosmological quantities such as $T_{re}$, $N_{re}$, and $m_\phi$ among others, evolve with the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the Yukawa coupling constant $y$, within a consistent analytical framework. Although the formulas used are approximate, they are sufficient to capture the qualitative behavior of the relevant quantities across a wide range of parameter values. Here, we are not interested in precise numerical approximations or data analysis, but rather in understanding the general trends and dependence of cosmological quantities of interest. In particular, tendencies observed in the figures, such as the sensitivity of $T_{re}$ to the coupling strength and the equation-of-state parameter $\omega_{re}$, reflect physical features that are not strongly affected by the approximations involved.</description>

      <title>Matter Dipole and Hubble Tension due to Large Wavelength Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically analyze the dipole anisotropy observed in the quasar distribution from the CatWISE2020 catalog. The catalog data shows a peak around $z\approx 1$, suggesting the presence of a large-scale dipole component. We explore the possibility that this dipole could be driven by primordial density fluctuations from modes that were superhorizon at the time of CMB decoupling but have since entered the horizon and become subhorizon. In particular, we consider the impact of adiabatic modes with wavenumbers $k$ in the range $(10^{-4} - 4 \times 10^{-3})~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} $, corresponding to wavelength scales of several Gpc. Such modes can create large-scale density variations, likely causing anisotropies in the distribution of matter and, as a result, affecting the number density of observed quasars. We also demonstrate that a superhorizon curvature perturbations mode, with comoving wavenumber $k\lesssim0.3H_0$ can lead to a significant enhancement in the locally inferred Hubble constant. This effect offers a viable explanation for the observed discrepancy between local and CMB inferred measurements of $H_0$.</description>

      <title>Evidence for non-cold dark matter from DESI DR2 measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate potential deviations from cold dark matter (CDM) using the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Analyzing DESI data alone constrains the dark matter equation of state parameter $w_{\mathrm{dm}} = -0.042^{+0.047}_{-0.024}$, revealing a mild preference for non-cold dark matter. This preference strengthens significantly in combined analyses, but reveals a striking tension in the inferred $w_{\mathrm{dm}}$ values from observations of different nature. The DESI+DESY5 combination yields $w_{\mathrm{dm}} = -0.084 \pm 0.035$, excluding CDM ($w_{\mathrm{dm}}=0$) at 2.4$\sigma$ significance. In contrast, Planck+DESI gives $w_{\mathrm{dm}} = 0.00077\pm0.00038$, differing from concordance model at 2$\sigma$ significance. The non-vanishing $w_{\mathrm{dm}}$ preference is particularly driven by low-redshift BAO measurements ($z&lt;1.1$), while higher redshift data remain consistent with $\Lambda$CDM. The evidence for non-cold dark matter is more pronounced in DESI compared to the previous BAO surveys. All dataset combinations show significant improvement over the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, providing compelling evidence for non-cold dark matter scenario.</description>

      <title>Predicting Halo Formation Time Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context:Halo formation time, which quantifies the mass assembly history of dark-matter halos, directly impacts galaxy properties and evolution. Although not directly observable, it can be inferred through proxies like star formation history or galaxy spatial distributions. Recent advances in machine learning enable more accurate predictions of halo formation time using galaxy and halo properties.
  Aims:This study aims to investigate a machine learning-based approach to predict halo formation time-defined as the epoch when a halo accretes half of its current mass-using both halo and baryonic properties derived from cosmological simulations. By incorporating properties associated with the brightest cluster galaxy located at the cluster center, its associated intracluster light component and satellite galaxies, we aim to surpass these analytical predictions, improve prediction accuracy and identify key properties that can provide the best proxy for the halo assembly history.
  Methods:Using The Three Hundred cosmological simulations, we train Random Forest (RF) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models on halo and baryonic properties, such as mass, concentration, stellar and gas masses, and features of the brightest cluster galaxy and intracluster light. CNN models are trained on two-dimensional radial property maps. We also construct simple linear models using only observationally accessible features. Results:RF models show median biases of 4%-9% with standard deviations of 20%. CNN models reduce median bias to &lt;4%, although they have higher scatter. Simple linear models using a limited number of observables achieve prediction accuracy comparable to RF models. Traditional relations between halo formation time and mass/concentration are preserved.</description>

      <title>Dynamical analysis of the H^2 + H^-2 Dark Energy model considering viscosity and interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we further developed and investigated the dual parameter phenomenological dark energy model (H^2 + H^-2 dark energy model) derived from Kaniadakis holographic dark energy. On the theoretical basis of the original H^2 + H^-2 dark energy model (HHDE), four types of viscosities and seven types of interactions were introduced. These were combined pairwise, and a dynamical analysis was conducted on a total of 35 Modified H^2 + H^-2 Viscous Interacting Dark Energy (MHH-VIDE) models. The advantage of the HHDE model and MHH-VIDE models is that these models can greatly relieve the Hubble tension and cicumventing the potential issue of a 'big rip', and the dark energy is Quintom-like. In this article, we performed a three-dimensional dynamical analysis of the aforementioned models with interactions and viscosity, testing their viability. The results suggest that the nature of this dark energy is closer to a property of spacetime than a cosmological component. The phase diagram analysis reveals a modified radiation-dominated epoch, a transitional matter-dominated phase, and a late-time attractor corresponding to the dark-energy-driven acceleration phase.</description>

      <title>Resolving the S8 tension with the Lambda Prime ($\Lambda'$) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $S_8$ parameter, which quantifies the amplitude of matter fluctuations on scales of $8h^{-1}$ Mpc, has been a source of tension between weak lensing surveys (e.g. KiDS, DES, HSC) and the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements. This discrepancy challenges the standard ${\Lambda}$CDM model and has become one of the most significant tensions in modern cosmology. The ${\Lambda'}$ model offers a potential resolution by introducing modifications to the cosmic growth history through alterations to the gravitational sector. The alterations involve including a Ricci soliton into Einstein's field equations which introduce a time dependent factor yielding a time varying cosmological constant ${\Lambda'}=(1-{\alpha(t)^2}(t)){\Lambda_{DE}}\frac{{\rho}_g}{\rho_{DE}}$ and subsequently the evolution of the cosmos. The Ricci soliton is sourced from gravitational energy density. In this study we analyze results from six surveys and compare the results for $w_a$ and $w_0$ with the ${\Lambda'}$ model. We also find ${\sigma}_8={0.750}_{-0.020}^{+0.020}$ , $S_8={0.788}$. These values are closer to some low $S_8$ measurements from weak lensing surveys (e.g DES, KiDS), which report $S_8 \approx 0.76-0.78$, suggesting that the model may alleviate the $S_8$ tension. High values of ${\alpha(t)}$ in the late universe are the cause of suppressed structure formation and low values of ${\Lambda'}$. The late universe in the ${\Lambda'}$ model is effectively or apparently 5-10% younger than in ${\Lambda}$CDM which translates to $H_0={72.734}_{-1.687}^{+1.687}$ km/s/Mpc, which is in agreement with late universe probes. ${\Lambda'}$ is classified under the dynamical dark energy models, however unlike alternatives, it does not invoke exotic particles nor phantom energy.</description>

      <title>The galaxy bias profile of cosmic voids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic voids are underdense regions within the large-scale structure of the Universe, spanning a wide range of physical scales - from a few megaparsecs (Mpc) to the largest observable structures. Their distinctive properties make them valuable cosmological probes and unique laboratories for galaxy formation studies. A key aspect to investigate in this context is the galaxy bias, $b$, within voids - that is, how galaxies in these underdense regions trace the underlying dark-matter density field. We want to measure the dependence of the large-scale galaxy bias on the distance to the void center, and to evaluate whether this bias profile varies with the void properties and identification procedure. We apply a void identification scheme based on spherical overdensities to galaxy data from the IllustrisTNG magnetohydrodynamical simulation. For the clustering measurement, we use an object-by-object estimate of large-scale galaxy bias, which offers significant advantages over the standard method based on ratios of correlation functions or power spectra. We find that the average large-scale bias of galaxies inside voids tends to increase with void-centric distance when normalized by the void radius. For the entire galaxy population within voids, the average bias rises with the density of the surrounding environment and, consequently, decreases with increasing void size. Due to this environmental dependence, the average galaxy bias inside S-type voids - embedded in large-scale overdense regions - is significantly higher ($\langle b\rangle_{\rm in} &gt; 0$) at all distances compared to R-type voids, which are surrounded by underdense regions ($\langle b\rangle_{\rm in} &lt; 0$). The bias profile for S-type voids is also slightly steeper. Since both types of voids host halo populations of similar mass, the measured difference in bias can be interpreted as a secondary bias effect.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the 21cm forest with Wavelet Scattering Transform: Insight into non-Gaussian features of the 21cm forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 21cm forest, narrow absorption features in the spectra of high redshift radio sources caused by intervening neutral hydrogen, offers a unique probe of the intergalactic medium and small-scale structures during reionization. While traditional power spectrum methods have been widely used for analyzing the 21cm forest, these techniques are limited in capturing the non-Gaussian nature of the signal. In this work, we introduce the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) as a novel diagnostic tool for the 21cm forest, which allows for the extraction of higher-order statistical features that power spectrum methods cannot easily capture. By decomposing simulated brightness temperature spectra into a hierarchy of scattering coefficients, the WST isolates both local intensity fluctuations (first-order coefficients) and scale-scale correlations (second-order coefficients), revealing the complex, multi-scale non-Gaussian interactions inherent in the 21cm forest. This approach enhances the power of 21cm forest in distinguishing between different cosmological models, such as Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and Warm Dark Matter (WDM), as well as scenarios with enhanced X-ray heating. Unlike traditional methods, which focus primarily on Gaussian statistics, the WST captures richer astrophysical and cosmological information. Our analysis shows that WST can significantly improve constraints on key parameters, such as the X-ray heating efficiency and the WDM particle mass, providing deeper insights into the early stages of cosmic structure formation.</description>

      <title>A local, topology-independent parameterization of quasar IGM damping wings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lyman-$\alpha$ damping wings towards quasars provide a unique probe of reionization because their strength correlates strongly with the global volume-averaged neutral hydrogen (HI) fraction of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Cosmic variance in the IGM, however, is a major source of stochasticity since the local neutral environment around a quasar varies significantly even at fixed global neutral fraction. We show that the IGM damping wing carries additional information about this local ionization topology, unexploited by current analysis frameworks. We introduce a set of two new physically motivated summary statistics encoding the local information about the HI distribution in the IGM before it is altered by ionization radiation from the quasar, encompassing 1) the HI column density, weighted by a Lorentzian profile mimicking the frequency dependence of the Lyman-$\alpha$ cross section, and 2) the distance from the quasar to the first neutral patch. This description, when combined with the quasar's lifetime as a third parameter, reduces the IGM transmission scatter in the damping wing region of the spectrum to $\lesssim 1\,\%$ across the full range of physical parameter space. We introduce a simple procedure for generating synthetic HI sightlines around quasars and demonstrate that the resulting damping wing profiles are statistically indistinguishable from a realistic reionization topology. This opens the door for optimally extracting the salient local information encoded in the imprint in a model-independent fashion. In the context of a specific reionization model, measurements of these local parameters can be translated into constraints on the global timing of reionization, but in addition, they provide information about the reionization topology, hitherto unused. A marginally modified version of our framework can also be employed in the context of damping wings towards galaxies.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Hybrid Inflation in light of Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 6, Planck 2018 and LB-BK18</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersymmetry-based hybrid inflation models (referred to as `spontaneously broken supersymmetry' by the Planck collaboration) are attractive for several reasons, including the appealing feature that inflation is associated with local gauge symmetry breaking in the early universe. Following the Planck collaboration's notation, the inflationary potential with sub-Planckian inflaton field values is given by: $V = \Lambda^4 [1 + \alpha_h \log(\phi / M_{Pl})] - m_{3/2} \Lambda^2 \phi + \Lambda^4 O((\phi / M_{Pl})^4)$. Here, $\Lambda = \sqrt{\kappa} M$ denotes the energy scale of inflation, $M$ is the gauge symmetry breaking scale, $\kappa$ is a dimensionless parameter that sets the inflaton mass ($\sqrt{2} \kappa M$), and $\alpha_h$ is determined from quantum corrections in terms of $\kappa$ and the underlying gauge group. A soft supersymmetry-breaking term proportional to the gravitino mass $m_{3/2}$ (~10 TeV) and linear in the inflaton field $\phi$ is also present during inflation. The final term in $V$ represents the leading-order supergravity correction. (Note that the last two terms were not taken into account in the Planck analysis.) We provide estimates for the parameters $\kappa$ (and $\alpha_h$) that yield a scalar spectral index $n_s$ in the range 0.96 to 0.98, which is fully consistent with recent P-ACT-LB measurements presented by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, as well as earlier measurements by Planck. We recall that in the absence of the soft SUSY-breaking term proportional to $m_{3/2}$ in $V$, the spectral index $n_s = 1 - 1/N = 0.98$, where $N = 50$ denotes the number of e-foldings. The tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ in this minimal model is tiny, but it can reach potentially observable values ($r \lesssim 0.01$) in non-minimal models.</description>

      <title>Gigaparsec structures are nowhere to be seen in $\Lambda$CDM: an enhanced analysis of LSS in FLAMINGO-10K simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Sawala et al. 2025 claimed to refute the cosmological significance of the Giant Arc based on their analysis of the FLAMINGO-10K simulation data. In our paper here, we highlight several shortcomings of the authors' analysis. We then perform an enhanced analysis on the FLAMINGO-10K simulation data with applications of: the Single-Linkage Hierarchical Clustering (SLHC), the Convex Hull of Member Spheres (CHMS), and the Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms. Using the full $2.8^3$ Gpc$^3$ FLAMINGO-10K box, with subhaloes at $z=0.7$, and $100$ random realisations (from random subset selections) we find no gigaparsec structures in FLAMINGO-10K, and only a few ultra-large large-scale structures (uLSSs, structures exceeding a maximum pairwise separation of $370$ Mpc). Somewhat surprisingly, we found that the large-scale aspects of the FLAMINGO-10K data could be adequately represented by a Poisson point distribution. The enhanced analysis presented here further supports the remarkable nature of the Giant Arc as a cosmologically-significant structure. Of course, the Giant Arc is also accompanied by a second uLSS, the Big Ring. The analysis presented here builds on the work presented by Sawala et al., but amends the application of their statistical assessments. We do not yet know why there appears to be such a large discrepancy between the FLAMINGO-10K data and the observed LSS in MgII absorbers. Perhaps the results presented here might suggest that the GA, and especially the GA + BR, presents a more direct challenge to $\Lambda$CDM. In contrast to the conclusion of Sawala et al. that `gigaparsec patterns abound in a $\Lambda$CDM universe' we find that they are nowhere to be seen.</description>

      <title>Haloscope Searching for Dark Photons at Q-band with a Novel Coupling Tuning Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laboratory searching for dark matter is crucial for understanding several fundamental conundrums in physics and cosmology. Most cavity-based haloscope searches focus on the frequency range below 10 GHz, while the parameter space with higher frequency remains rarely explored, due to the challenges lying in the fabrication of microwave cavities. Here we report the first Q-band haloscope searching for dark photons with a 33.141 GHz cavity. A novel coupling tuning structure separated from the cavity was designed so as not to degrade the quality factor of the cavity. We have established the most stringent constraints $\chi&lt;2.5\times10^{-12}$ at a confidence level of 90$\%$ in the frequency range from 33.139 GHz to 33.143 GHz, corresponding to the mass of dark photons ranging from 137.05 $\mu$eV to 137.07 $\mu$eV. The results surpass the previous astronomical constraints by nearly three orders of magnitude. This work has demonstrated the feasibility of dark matter haloscopes at Q band. In the future, the constraints can be further improved by more than one order of magnitude through low-temperature experiments, and the setup can be extended to search for axions, axion-like particles, and high-frequency gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Configuration Requirements for 21-cm Forest Background Quasar Searches with the Moon-based Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 21-cm forest offers a powerful cosmological probe of the thermal history and small-scale structure of the intergalactic medium during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Its success, however, critically depends on the availability of high-redshift radio-loud quasars (HzRLQs) as background sources. In this work, we investigate the configuration requirements for a Moon-based low-frequency radio interferometer aimed at maximizing the detection of HzRLQs for future 21-cm forest studies. Building upon a previously developed quasar luminosity function (QLF), we forecast HzRLQ abundances under various array configurations. Assuming a total survey area of $10^4\,\mathrm{deg}^2$ and 1 year of observation, we compare continuum surveys with 10 MHz bandwidth and 21-cm forest surveys with 5 kHz resolution. Our results show that a minimum collecting area of $\sim$6 500 m$^2$ enables detection at $z \sim 6$, while SKA-like arrays ($N_{\mathrm{st}} = 512$) extend the detection limit to $z \sim 10$ for 21-cm forest survey and $z \sim 16$ for continuum survey. Larger arrays with $N_{\mathrm{st}} = 2048$ can reach $z \sim 11$ in 21-cm forest mode. We also explore configurations that maintain fixed collecting areas while increasing the number to enhance survey efficiency. This boosts source detection but significantly increases the data volume and computational demands. These results underscore the importance of optimizing array design for different survey goals and balancing sensitivity, spectral resolution, and data management. A well-designed Moon-based array could open a new observational window on reionization and early cosmic structure formation.</description>

      <title>FRB cosmology with the RM-PRS Luminosity Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as a powerful tool for cosmological studies, particularly through the dispersion measure-redshift ($\mathrm{DM}-z$) relation. This work proposes a novel calibration method for FRBs using the Yang-Li-Zhang (YLZ) empirical relation, which links the rotation measure (RM) of FRBs to the luminosity of their associated persistent radio sources (PRS). We demonstrate that this approach provides independent constraints on cosmological parameters, bypassing limitations inherent to traditional $\mathrm{DM}-z$ method. Utilizing the current sample of four YLZ-calibrated FRBs, we derive a Hubble constant measurement of $H_0 = 86.18_{-14.99}^{+18.03}\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$ (68\% CL). Monte Carlo simulations indicate that a future catalog of 400 FRB-PSR systems could reduce the relative uncertainty of $H_0$ to 4.5\%. Combining YLZ-calibrated FRBs with $\mathrm{DM}-z$ sample reveals critical synergies: joint analysis of equalized samples ($N=100$ for both methods) reduces the relative uncertainty of $H_0$ to 2.9\%, mainly because the incorporation of PRS observations substantially mitigates the degeneracy between the parameters such as IGM baryon mass fraction ($f_{\rm IGM}$) and other cosmological parameters inherent to the $\mathrm{DM}-z$ relation.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the redshift evolution of Type Ia supernovae absolute magnitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates a potential time dependence of the absolute magnitude of Type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia). Employing the Gaussian Process approach, we obtain the SN Ia absolute magnitude and its derivative as a function of redshift. The data set considered in the analysis comprises measurements of apparent magnitude from SN Ia, Hubble rate from cosmic chronometers, and the ratio between angular and radial distances from Large-Scale Structure data (BAO and voids). Our findings reveal good compatibility between the reconstructed SN Ia absolute magnitudes and a constant value. However, the mean value obtained from the Gaussian Process reconstruction is $M=-19.456\pm 0.059$, which is $3.2\sigma$ apart from local measurements by Pantheon+SH0ES. This incompatibility may be directly associated to the $\Lambda$CDM model and local data, as it does not appear in either model-dependent or model-independent estimates of the absolute magnitude based on early universe data. Furthermore, we assess the implications of a variable $M$ within the context of modified gravity theories. Considering the local estimate of the absolute magnitude, we find $\sim3\sigma$ tension supporting departures from General Relativity in analyzing scenarios involving modified gravity theories with variations in Planck mass through Newton's constant.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Constraints with Void Lensing I: the Simulation-Based Inference Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) framework for cosmological parameter estimation via void lensing analysis. Despite the absence of an analytical model of void lensing, SBI can effectively learn posterior distributions through forward modeling of mock data. We develop a forward modeling pipeline that accounts for both cosmology and the galaxy-halo connection. By training a neural density estimator on simulated data, we infer the posteriors of two cosmological parameters, $\Omega_m$ and $S_8$. Validation tests are conducted on posteriors derived from different cosmological parameters and a fiducial sample. The results demonstrate that SBI provides unbiased estimates of mean values and accurate uncertainties. These findings highlight the potential to apply void lensing analysis to observational data even without an analytical void lensing model.</description>

      <title>Physical vs phantom dark energy after DESI: thawing quintessence in a curved background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent data from DESI, in combination with other data, provide moderate evidence of dynamical dark energy, $w\neq-1$. In the $w_0, w_a$ parametrization of $w$, there is a preference for a phantom crossing, $w&lt;-1$, at redshift $z\sim0.5$. In general relativity, the phantom equation of state is unphysical. Thus it is important to check whether phantom crossing is present in other physically self-consistent models of dark energy that have equivalent evidence to the $w_0, w_a$ parametrization. We find that thawing quintessence with nonzero cosmic curvature can fit the recent data slightly better than $w_0, w_a$ in a flat background. The phantom crossing may be a spurious artifact of a parametrization that is not based on a physical model.</description>

      <title>Non-minimal coupling in light of ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The latest ACT data release disfavors the attractor $n_s=1-2/N$. In inflationary models with nonminimal coupling, such attractors typically arise in the strong coupling limit. To align with observational constraints, we focus on nonminimal coupling models with small coupling constants. For the model with the coupling function $\Omega(\phi) = 1 + \xi f(\phi)$ and the potential $V(\phi) = \lambda^2 f^2(\phi)$, we find that observational data constrain the parameters as $0.1 \lesssim \xi \lesssim 35$ and $0 \lesssim k \lesssim 1.5$ for $f(\phi) = \phi^k$ at the $1\sigma$ confidence level. With the help of the nonmiminal coupling $\Omega(\phi) = 1 + \xi \phi^2$, the hilltop inflation and power-law inflation models with power indices $2/3$ and $1/3$ can be consistent with observational data within the $1\sigma$ range. We also give the viable parameter regions for $\xi$ for these three models.</description>

      <title>Did DESI DR2 truly reveal dynamical dark energy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental question in cosmology is whether dark energy evolves over time, a topic that has gained prominence since the discovery of cosmic acceleration. Recently, the DESI collaboration has reported increasing evidence for evolving dark energy using combinations of cosmic microwave background (CMB), type Ia supernova (SN), and their new measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). However, our analysis reveals that these combinations are problematic due to clear tensions among the CMB, BAO and SN datasets. Consequently, DESI's claim of dynamical dark energy (DDE) is not robust. A more reliable approach involves constraining the evolution of dark energy using each dataset independently. Through a statistical comparison for each dataset, on average, we find that DDE is strongly preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM model. This suggests that DDE likely exists, although its real parameter space remains elusive due to weak constraints on the dark energy equation of state and inconsistencies among the datasets. Interestingly, when considering DDE, none of the individual datasets -- including CMB, DESI DR2, Pantheon+, Union3, and DESY5 -- can independently detect cosmic acceleration at a significant level. Our findings not only clarify the current understanding of the nature of dark energy but also challenge the established discovery of cosmic acceleration and the long-held notion that dark energy exerts negative pressure. Both individual and combined datasets suggest that the ultimate fate of the universe is likely to be dominated by matter rather than dark energy.</description>

      <title>Revealing the 3D Cosmic Web through Gravitationally Constrained Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak gravitational lensing is the slight distortion of galaxy shapes caused primarily by the gravitational effects of dark matter in the universe. In our work, we seek to invert the weak lensing signal from 2D telescope images to reconstruct a 3D map of the universe's dark matter field. While inversion typically yields a 2D projection of the dark matter field, accurate 3D maps of the dark matter distribution are essential for localizing structures of interest and testing theories of our universe. However, 3D inversion poses significant challenges. First, unlike standard 3D reconstruction that relies on multiple viewpoints, in this case, images are only observed from a single viewpoint. This challenge can be partially addressed by observing how galaxy emitters throughout the volume are lensed. However, this leads to the second challenge: the shapes and exact locations of unlensed galaxies are unknown, and can only be estimated with a very large degree of uncertainty. This introduces an overwhelming amount of noise which nearly drowns out the lensing signal completely. Previous approaches tackle this by imposing strong assumptions about the structures in the volume. We instead propose a methodology using a gravitationally-constrained neural field to flexibly model the continuous matter distribution. We take an analysis-by-synthesis approach, optimizing the weights of the neural network through a fully differentiable physical forward model to reproduce the lensing signal present in image measurements. We showcase our method on simulations, including realistic simulated measurements of dark matter distributions that mimic data from upcoming telescope surveys. Our results show that our method can not only outperform previous methods, but importantly is also able to recover potentially surprising dark matter structures.</description>

      <title>Is Dynamical Dark Energy Necessary? DESI BAO and Modified Recombination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) exhibit a mild-to-moderate tension with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernova (SN) observations when interpreted within a flat $\Lambda$CDM framework. This discrepancy has been cited as evidence for dynamical dark energy (DDE). Given the profound implications of DDE for fundamental physics, we explore whether the tension can instead be resolved by modifying the physics of recombination. We find that a phenomenological model of modified recombination can effectively reconcile the BAO and CMB datasets and, unlike DDE, also predicts a higher Hubble constant $H_0$, thereby partially alleviating the Hubble tension. A global fit to BAO, CMB, and calibrated SN data clearly favors modified recombination over DDE, suggesting that current claims of a DDE detection may be premature.</description>

      <title>Evolution of self-gravitating spherical dark-matter halos with and without new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient numerical algorithm for evolving self-gravitating systems of dark-matter particles that leverages the assumption of spherical symmetry to reduce the nominally six-dimensional phase space to three dimensions. It can be used to quickly determine numerically the evolution of an initially static stable self-consistent self-gravitating system if there is some additional or new physics. We illustrate here with four examples: (1) the effects of the growth of a supermassive black hole at the center; (2) the effects of stripping of the outer layers of the halo (a toy model for the effects of tidal stripping of galaxies); (3) the response of a self-gravitating system to dark matter that decays to a slightly less massive state; and (4) the effects of a slow change to Newton's constant. The approach can be extended to study dark matter with elastic and inelastic self-interactions and to study the process of virialization in spherical collapse. We describe some aspects of a code NSphere that implements this approach which we are making available.</description>

      <title>The impact of ultraviolet suppression on the rates and properties of strongly lensed Type IIn supernovae detected by LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upcoming wide-field time-domain surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) are expected to discover up to two orders of magnitude more strongly lensed supernovae per year than have so far been observed. Of these, Type IIn supernovae have been predicted to be detected more frequently than any other supernova type, despite their small relative detection fraction amongst non-lensed supernovae. However, previous studies that predict a large population of lensed Type IIn supernova detections model their time evolving spectrum as a pure blackbody. In reality, there is a deficit in the UV flux of supernovae relative to the blackbody continuum due to line-blanketing from iron-group elements in the ejecta and scattering effects. In this work we quantify the effect of this UV suppression on the detection rates by LSST of a simulated population of strongly lensed Type IIn supernovae, relative to a pure blackbody model, using a mock LSST observing run. With a blackbody model, we predict to detect $\sim$70 lensed Type IIn supernova per year with LSST. By modelling a similar UV deficit to that seen in superluminous supernovae, we recover 60 - 80% of the detections obtained using a pure blackbody model, of which $\sim$10 detections per year are sufficiently bright ($m_\textrm{i} &lt; 22.5$ mag) and detected early enough (&gt; 5 observations before lightcurve peak) to enable high-cadence spectroscopic follow up.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signatures of dark sector portal leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the possibility of probing leptogenesis via stochastic gravitational waves (GW) arising from a dark sector assisted first-order electroweak phase transition. The same dark sector, with non-trivial transformation under an unbroken $Z_2$ symmetry is also responsible for providing the only source of CP asymmetry via one-loop interference with the tree level decay of a heavy right-handed neutrino into lepton and Higgs doublets. The new Yukawa and scalar portal couplings enhance the CP asymmetry allowing TeV scale leptogenesis without any resonant enhancement. Light neutrino masses arise from a combination of type-I and one-loop contributions with vanishing lightest neutrino mass. While the new degrees of freedom in sub-TeV range keep the detection prospects at terrestrial experiments promising, the new scalars enhance the strength of the electroweak phase transition keeping the GW signals within reach of near future experiments like LISA.</description>

      <title>Superheavy dark matter from the natural inflation in light of the highest-energy astroparticle events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superheavy dark matter has been attractive as a candidate of particle dark matter. We propose a "natural" particle model, in which the dark matter serves as the inflaton in natural inflation, while decaying to high-energy particles at energies of $10^{9}-10^{13} \, \text{GeV}$ from the prediction of the inflation. A scalar field responsible to dilute the dark matter abundance revives the natural inflation. Since the dark matter must be a spin zero scalar, we study carefully the galactic dark matter 3-body decay into fermions and two body decays into a gluon pair, and point out relevant multi-messenger bounds that constrain these decay modes. Interestingly, the predicted energy scale may coincide with the AMATERASU event and/or the KM3NeT neutrino event, KM3-230213A. We also point out particle models with dark baryon to further alleviate $\gamma$-ray bounds. This scenario yields several testable predictions for the UHECR observations, including the highest-energy neutrons that are unaffected by magnetic fields, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the running of spectral indices, $\alpha_s\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(0.001)$, and the existence of light new colored particles that could be accessible at future collider experiments. Further measurements of high energy cosmic rays, including their components and detailed coordinates may provide insight into not only the origin of the cosmic rays but also inflation.</description>

      <title>Shaping Dark Photon Spectral Distortions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum is an extraordinary tool for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model. The exquisite precision of the measurement makes it particularly sensitive to small effects caused by hidden sector interactions. In particular, CMB spectral distortions can unveil the existence of dark photons which are kinetically coupled to the standard photon. In this work, we use the COBE-FIRAS dataset to derive accurate and robust limits on photon-to-dark-photon oscillations for a large range of dark photon masses, from $10^{-10}$ to $10^{-4}$ eV. We consider in detail the redshift dependence of the bounds, computing CMB distortions due to photon injection/removal using a Green's function method. Our treatment improves on previous results, which had set limits studying energy injection/removal into baryons rather than photon injection/removal, or ignored the redshift evolution of distortions. The difference between our treatment and previous ones is particularly noticeable in the predicted spectral shape of the distortions, a smoking gun signature for photon-to-dark-photon oscillations. The characterization of the spectral shape is crucial for future CMB missions, which could improve the present sensitivity by orders of magnitude, exploring regions of the dark photon parameter space that are otherwise difficult to access.</description>

      <title>The relation of galaxies and dark matter haloes to the filamentary cosmic web</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Millennium Simulation to study the relation of galaxies and dark matter haloes to the cosmic web. We define the web as the unique, fully connected, percolating object with (unsmoothed) matter density everywhere exceeding 5.25 times the cosmic mean. This object contains 35\% of all cosmic mass but occupies only 0.62\% of all cosmic volume. It contains 26\% of dark matter haloes of mass $10^{11}M_\odot$, rising to 50\% at $10^{12.7}M_\odot$, and to $&gt;90\%$ above $10^{14}M_\odot$. In contrast, it contains 45\% of all galaxies of stellar mass $10^{8.5}M_\odot$, rising to 50\% at $10^{10}M_\odot$, to 60\% at $10^{11}M_\odot$ and to 90\% at $10^{11.5}M_\odot$. This difference arises because a large fraction of all satellite and backsplash galaxies are part of the cosmic web. Indeed, more than 50\% of web galaxies are satellites for stellar masses below that of the Milky Way, rising to about 70\% below $10^{10}M_\odot$, whereas centrals substantially outnumber satellites in the non-web population at all stellar masses. As a result, web galaxies have systematically lower specific star-formation rates (sSFR's) than non-web galaxies. For the latter, the distributions of stellar mass and sSFR are almost independent of web distance. Furthermore, for both central and satellite galaxies, the sSFR distributions at given stellar mass are very similar in and outside the web, once differences in backsplash fraction are accounted for. For the galaxy formation model considered here, differences between web and non-web galaxy populations are almost entirely due to the difference in halo mass distribution between the two environments.</description>

      <title>Interacting dark sector with quadratic coupling: theoretical and observational viability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16299v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models proposing a non-gravitational interaction between dark energy (DE) and dark matter (CDM) have been extensively studied as alternatives to the standard cosmological model. A common approach to describing the DE-CDM coupling assumes it to be linearly proportional to the dark energy density. In this work, we consider the model with interaction term $Q=3H\gamma{\rho_{x}^{2}}/{(\rho_{c}+\rho_{x})}$. We show that for positive values of $\gamma$ this model predicts a future violation of the Weak Energy Condition (WEC) for the dark matter component, and for a specific range of negative values of $\gamma$ the CDM energy density can be negative in the past. We perform a parameter selection analysis for this model using data from Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon sample, $H(z)$ measurements from the Cosmic Chronometers sample, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from the DESI survey, and Cosmic Microwave Background data from the Planck combined with the Hubble constant $H_0$ prior. Imposing a prior to ensure that the WEC is not violated, our model is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM in 2$\sigma$ C.L., yet exhibits a preference for smaller values of $\sigma_8$, alleviating the $\sigma_8$ tension between the CMB results from Planck 2018 and the weak gravitational lensing observations from the KiDS-1000 cosmic shear survey.</description>

      <title>Influence of photometric galaxies redshift distribution in BAO estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photometric surveys are good solutions for large-scale structure studies. The Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) benefit from photometric redshift survey observations due to faster coverage and a higher number of observed objects. In the present study, we use the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 catalog of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG) to incorporate the realistic galaxies' redshift Probability Distribution Function (PDF) into the correlation function cosmological model. We used four different photo-z estimators \texttt{ANNz2}, \texttt{BPZ}, \texttt{ENF}, and \texttt{DNF} to compare how they affect the BAO feature constraint, the catalogs called \texttt{Pz Cats}. Moreover, each algorithm included two sample selections based on distinct PDF shapes; one where the PDFs are nearly Gaussian and another opting for the least noisy PDFs with a pronounced peak. Our investigation identifies whether our samples detect BAO using the correlation function's polynomial parameterization. Later, we computed the correlation function $\xi_\perp(z_p)$ by getting the bin pairs transversal to each other using \texttt{CAMB}. The kernel window function is the $f(z|z_p)$ which is the selection of the PDF value when the photometric redshift is nearly the same as the spectroscopic redshift estimated by the matched spectroscopic sample. For compatible $z_{\rm eff}$, we concluded that the shape of the galaxy redshift PDF could shift the BAO feature position either by including the PDF in the model or not. We also learnt that, given the same spectroscopic sample, \texttt{ANNz2} estimator with its respective selection samples outperforms other estimators for most parameters examined.</description>

Abstract: A remarkable feature of dark matter consisting of ultralight bosonic particles is the emergence of superfluid Bose-Einstein condensate structures on galactic scales. We investigate the oscillations of the solitonic dark matter structure in the central galactic region by numerically solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes problem, accounting for perturbations in the gravitational potential and local self-interactions. Our findings reveal that the central solitonic core, formed by the balance of gravitational attraction, quantum pressure, and repulsive interactions, exhibits significant oscillatory behaviour. These oscillations, characterized by distinct eigenmodes, provide insights into the dynamical properties of solitonic dark matter structures and their observational implications and contributions to galactic structure formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Impact of weak-lensing mass-mapping algorithms on cosmology inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weak-lensing mass-mapping algorithms, which reconstruct the convergence field from galaxy shear measurements, are crucial for extracting higher-order statistics to constrain cosmological parameters. However, only limited research has explored whether the choice of mass-mapping algorithm affects the inference of cosmological parameters from weak-lensing higher-order statistics. This study aims to evaluate the impact of different mass-mapping algorithms on the inference of cosmological parameters measured with weak-lensing peak counts. We employ Kaiser-Squires, inpainting Kaiser-Squires, and MCALens mass-mapping algorithms to reconstruct the convergence field from simulated weak-lensing data. Using these maps, we compute the peak counts and wavelet peak counts as data vectors and perform Bayesian analysis with MCMC sampling to estimate posterior distributions of cosmological parameters. Our results indicate that the choice of mass-mapping algorithm significantly affects the constraints on cosmological parameters, with the MCALens method improving constraints by up to 157$\%$ compared to the standard Kaiser-Squires method. This improvement arises from MCALens' ability to better capture small-scale structures. In contrast, inpainting Kaiser-Squires yields constraints similar to Kaiser-Squires, indicating a limited benefit from inpainting for cosmological parameter estimation with peaks. The accuracy of mass-mapping algorithms is thus critical for cosmological inference from weak-lensing data. Advanced algorithms like MCALens, which offer superior reconstruction of the convergence field, can substantially enhance the precision of cosmological parameter estimates. These findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate mass-mapping techniques in weak-lensing studies to fully exploit the potential of higher-order statistics for cosmological research.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we develop a theoretical model for the cross-power spectrum of the galaxy density field before and after standard baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) reconstruction. Using this model, we extract the redshift-space distortion (RSD) parameter from the cross-power spectrum. The model is validated against a suite of high-resolution $N$-body simulations, demonstrating its accuracy and robustness for cosmological analyses.</description>

      <title>A New Uncertainty Scheme for Galaxy Distances from Flow Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The systemic velocity or redshift of galaxies is a convenient tool to calculate their distances in the absence of primary methods, but the uncertainties on these flow distances may be substantial due to galaxy peculiar motions. Here, we derived a simple and easily applicable method to assign uncertainties to flow distances from four different methodologies, namely the Hubble law with both heliocentric and local-sheet velocities, the Cosmicflows-4 model, and the numerical action methods model. Our uncertainty scheme was constructed by comparing these flow distances to accurate, redshift-independent distances of a subsample of ~2000 galaxies from the Cosmicflows-4 database, using the tip magnitude of the red giant branch, Cepheids, surface brightness fluctuations, supernovae type Ia, masers, and supernovae type II. We provide simple functions and tables to calculate the distance uncertainties for all the flow models considered. This uncertainty scheme is generally applicable except for the region around the Virgo cluster, where we assign increased uncertainties due to larger peculiar motions.</description>

      <title>A cosmological full-shape power spectra analysis using pre- and post-reconstructed density fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a joint fitting approach based on theoretical models of power spectra associated with density-field reconstruction. Specifically, we consider the matter auto-power spectra before and after baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) reconstruction, as well as the cross-power spectrum between the pre- and post-reconstructed density fields. We present redshift-space models for these three power spectra at the one-loop level within the framework of standard perturbation theory (SPT), and perform a joint analysis using three types of power spectra, and quantify their impact on parameter constraints. When restricting the analysis to wavenumbers $k \leq 0.2\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and adopting a smoothing scale of $R_{\mathrm{s}} = 15\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$, we find that incorporating all three power spectra improves parameter constraints by approximately $11\%\text{--}16\%$ compared to using only the post-reconstruction power spectrum, with the Figure of Merit (FoM) increasing by $10.5\%$. These results highlight the advantages of leveraging multiple power spectra in BAO reconstruction, ultimately enabling more precise cosmological parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Galaxy and Halo Root Systems: Fingerprints of Mass Assembly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss what we call halo or galaxy root systems, collections of particle pathlines that show the infall of matter from the initial uniform distribution into a collapsed structure. The matter clumps as it falls in; projected through time, it produces filamentary density enhancements analogous to tree roots and branches, blood vessels, or even human transportation infrastructure in cities and regions. This relates to the larger-scale cosmic web, but is defined locally about one of its nodes: a physical, geometric version of a merger tree. We find dark-matter-halo root systems on average to exhibit more roots and root branches for the largest cluster haloes than in small haloes. This may relate to the `cosmic-web detachment' mechanism that likely contributes to star-formation quenching in galaxy groups and clusters. We also find that high spin manifests in these root systems as curvier roots.</description>

      <title>How much has DESI dark energy evolved since DR1?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DESI has reported a dynamical dark energy (DE) signal based on the $w_0 w_a$CDM model that is in conflict with Hubble tension. Recalling that the combination of DESI DR1 BAO and DR1 full-shape (FS) modeling are consistent with $\Lambda$CDM, in this letter we comment on the status of fluctuations in DR1 BAO documented in \cite{DESI:2024mwx, Colgain:2024xqj} in the DR2 update. In particular, we note that neither DR1 BAO nor DR2 BAO nor DR2 BAO+CMB confronted to the $w_0 w_a$CDM model with relaxed model parameter priors confirm late-time accelerated expansion today. Translating DESI BAO constraints into flat $\Lambda$CDM constraints, we observe that the LRG1 constraint remains the most prominent outlier, a distinction now held jointly with ELG1, LRG2 switches from smaller to larger $\Omega_m$ values relative to Planck-$\Lambda$CDM, and ELG data drive the relatively low $\Omega_m$ in the full DR2 BAO. We observe that one cannot restore $w_0 = -1$ within one $1 \sigma$ by removing either LRG1 or ELG1 or LRG2, but LRG2 in DR2, in contrast to LRG1 in DR1, now has the greatest bearing on $w_0 &gt; -1$. We conclude that BAO has yet to stabilise, but the general trend is towards greater consistency with DESI DR1 FS modeling results, where there may be no dynamical DE signal in DESI data alone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent advances in observational astrophysics and continued explorations in the field of analog gravity, we discuss the prospect of simulating models of cosmology within the context of synthetic mechanical lattice experiments. We focus on the physics of expanding Universe scenarios described by the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. Specifically, quantizing scalar fluctuations in a background FLRW spacetime leads to a quadratic bosonic Hamiltonian with temporally varying pair production terms. Here we present a mapping that provides a one-to-one correspondence between these classes of cosmology models and feedback-coupled mechanical oscillators. As proof-of-principle, we then perform experiments on a synthetic mechanical lattice composed of such oscillators. We simulate two different FLRW expansion scenarios with Universes dominated by vacuum energy and matter and discuss our experimental results.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the role of merger histories in the population of In situ stars: linking IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation to H3 survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07169v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We undertake a comprehensive investigation into the distribution of in~situ stars within Milky Way-like galaxies, leveraging TNG50 simulations and comparing their predictions with data from the H3 survey. Our analysis reveals that 28% of galaxies demonstrate reasonable agreement with H3, while only 12% exhibit excellent alignment in their profiles, regardless of the specific spatial cut employed to define in~situ stars. To uncover the underlying factors contributing to deviations between TNG50 and H3 distributions, we scrutinise correlation coefficients among internal drivers(e.g., virial radius, star formation rate [SFR]) and merger-related parameters (such as the effective mass-ratio, mean distance, average redshift, total number of mergers, average spin-ratio and maximum spin alignment between merging galaxies). Notably, we identify significant correlations between deviations from observational data and key parameters such as the median slope of virial radius, mean SFR values, and the rate of SFR change across different redshift scans. Furthermore, positive correlations emerge between deviations from observational data and parameters related to galaxy mergers. We validate these correlations using the Random Forest Regression method. Our findings underscore the invaluable insights provided by the H3 survey in unravelling the cosmic history of galaxies akin to the Milky Way, thereby advancing our understanding of galactic evolution and shedding light on the formation and evolution of Milky Way-like galaxies in cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Simulating Binary Primordial Black Hole Mergers in Dark Matter Halos</title>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs), possibly constituting a non-negligible fraction of dark matter (DM), might be responsible for a number of gravitational wave events detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. In this paper, we simulate the evolution of PBH binaries in DM halos and calculate their merger rate up to redshift of 10. We assume that DM halos are made entirely by a combination of single PBHs and PBH binaries. We present the resulting merger rates from the two main channels that lead to merging PBH binaries: two-body captures and binary-single interactions. We account for alternative assumptions on the dark matter halo mass-concentration relationship versus redshift. We also study what impact the PBH mass distribution, centered in the stellar-mass range, has on the PBH merger rate that the ground-based gravitational-wave observatories can probe. We find that under reasonable assumptions on the abundance of PBH binaries relative to single PBHs, the binary-single interaction rates can be dominant over the two-body capture channel. Our work studies in detail the dynamics of PBHs inside DM halos, advancing our understanding on how the current gravitational-wave events constrain the properties of PBHs. Moreover, we make predictions in a redshift range to be probed by future observatories.</description>

      <title>Large neutrino mass in cosmology and keV sterile neutrino dark matter from a dark sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an extended seesaw model which generates active neutrino masses via the usual type-I seesaw and leads to a large number of massless fermions as well as a sterile neutrino dark matter (DM) candidate in the $\mathcal{O}(10-100) {\rm~keV}$ mass range. The dark sector comes into thermal equilibrium with Standard Model neutrinos after neutrino decoupling and before recombination via a U(1) gauge interaction in the dark sector. This suppresses the abundance of active neutrinos and therefore reconciles sizeable neutrino masses with cosmology. The DM abundance is determined by freeze-out in the dark sector, which allows avoiding bounds from X-ray searches. Our scenario predicts a slight increase in the effective number of neutrino species $N_{\rm eff}$ at recombination, potentially detectable by future CMB missions.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Correlators at the Loop Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological correlators encode rich information about physics at the Hubble scale and may exhibit characteristic oscillatory signals due to the exchange of massive particles. Although many 1-loop processes, especially those that break de Sitter (dS) boosts, can generate significant leading signals for various particle models in cosmological collider physics, the precise results for these correlators or their full signals remain unknown due to the lack of symmetry. In this work, we apply the method of partial Mellin-Barnes (PMB) representation to the calculation of cosmological correlators at the loop level. As a first step, we use the PMB representation to calculate four-point cosmological correlators with bubble topology. We find that both the nonlocal and local signals arise from the factorized part, validating the cutting rules proposed in previous work, and are free from UV divergence. Furthermore, the UV divergence originates solely from the background piece and can be manifestly canceled by introducing the appropriate counterterm, similar to the procedure in flat spacetime. We also demonstrate how to renormalize the 1-loop correlators in Mellin space. After a consistency check with known results for the covariant case, we provide new analytical results for the signals generated from a nontrivial dS-boost-breaking bubble.</description>

      <title>Probing Gravitational Dark Matter with Ultra-high Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evidence for the existence of dark matter (DM) is compelling, yet its nature remains elusive. A minimal scenario involves DM interacting solely through gravity. However, the detection would be extremely challenging. In the early Universe, such DM can be unavoidably generated via annihilation of particles in the standard model (SM) thermal plasma. It is known that the SM thermal plasma also produces gravitational waves (GWs). In this study, we establish a simple connection between the amplitude of thermal GWs and the properties of pure gravitational DM. Notably, future GW experiments in the ultra-high frequency regime have the potential to shed light on the mass and spin of pure gravitational DM.</description>

      <title>Pz Cats: Photometric redshift catalogs based on DES Y3 BAO sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the years, photometric redshift estimation (photo-z) has advanced through various methods. This study evaluates four distinct photo-z estimators-ANNz2, BPZ, ENF, and DNF-using the Dark Energy Survey Y3 BAO Sample. Unlike most studies, we explore selecting optimal galaxies based on their redshift Probability Distribution Function (PDF) by either reducing noise or identifying those approximating a Gaussian distribution. We cross-matched 25,760 galaxies drawn from four spectroscopic surveys with the photo-z sample to comprehend redshift bias and its 68th percentile $\sigma_{68}$. The lowest $\sigma$ for all estimators was found in the range $0.79&lt;z_p&lt;0.85$. Among the estimators, DMF exhibited the greatest bias, while ENF, ANNz2, and BPZ showed decreased precision outside 0.7 to 0.9 redshift range. To select galaxies with minimal bias, ANNz2 emerged as the most reliable algorithm across all criteria. PDFs selection significantly improves colour representation over the spectroscopic sample, underscoring the role of magnitude space in selection. While ANNz2 achieved superior precision, ENF poorly selected Gaussian PDFs, leaving few galaxies for LSS evaluation. Despite smooth PDFs, catastrophic redshift errors were present. Though DNF had the poorest precision, it offered enough galaxies for cosmological use. Subsampling galaxies with secondary peaks less than 30\% of the main peak height, termed Small Peaks, showed ANNz2 excelled. The catalogs produced have been published as Pz Cats within the ZENODO repository.</description>

      <title>Higgs Thermal Nonequilibrium in Primordial QGP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the chemical and kinetic nonequilibrium dynamics of the Higgs boson during the primordial Universe QGP (quark-gluon plasma) epoch $130\mathrm{\,GeV}&gt;T&gt;10\mathrm{\,GeV}$. We show that the Higgs bosons is always out of chemical abundance equilibrium with a fugacity $\Upsilon_h = 0.69$ due to virtual decay channels. Additionally, Higgs momentum distribution is found to be ``cold'' for $T&lt;25$\,GeV, since the scattering rate drops below the production rate.</description>

      <title>Consistency Problems of Conformal Killing Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that gravity field equations based on a tensor with rank greater than 2 have consistency problems in the sense that integration constants in the solutions, such as the parameter $m$ in the Schwarzschild metric, do not allow for an interpretation in terms of conserved quantities in the theory. The recently introduced Conformal Killing Gravity, an interesting extension of General Relativity that inherits all the solutions of the latter, and defined with a rank-3 tensor field equation that does not arise from a diffeomorphism-invariant action, is plagued with this problem. In this theory, it is not clear at all how one can define the energy and angular momentum for black hole solutions, or define the analogues of the formulas, such as the quadrupole formula, in the weak field limit for gravitational waves emitted by compact sources.</description>

      <title>Inflation with Gauss-Bonnet correction: beyond slow-roll</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If a coupling between the inflaton and the Gauss-Bonnet term is introduced, many models of inflation that were ruled out by the most recent Planck data can be made viable again. The predictions for the scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio are typically computed using the slow-roll approximation. In this paper we instead study the full equations of motion and determine the necessary initial conditions for reasonable inflation epoch. We derive the conditions under which the Friedmann equation admits positive solutions for the Hubble parameter. Then we study the possibility of the inflaton becoming trapped in a local potential minimum induced by the Gauss-Bonnet term. Finally we demonstrate the results on monomial potential models with a quadratic and a quartic potential and show that the slow-roll approximation becomes imprecise in the quartic case.</description>

      <title>JWST Discovery of a High-Redshift Tidal Disruption Event Candidate in COSMOS-Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rates and properties of tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide valuable insights into their host galaxy central stellar densities and the demographics of their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). TDEs have been observed only at low redshifts ($z \lesssim 1$), due to the difficulty in conducting deep time-domain surveys. In this work, we present the discovery of a high-redshift TDE candidate, HZTDE-1, in the COSMOS-Web survey with JWST's NIRCam, using a novel selection technique based on color and morphology. We first outline a methodology for identifying high-z TDEs in deep infrared imaging surveys, leveraging their unique spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and morphologies of these transients. We apply this technique to COSMOS-Web in filters F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W, and identify HZTDE-1, a transient point source relative to archival UltraVISTA infrared observations. If we assume it is a TDE, we estimate its photometric redshift to be $z=5.02^{+1.32}_{-1.11}$. HZTDE-1 cannot be explained by reasonable supernova or AGN models. However, we cannot rule out a superluminous supernova at $z\gtrsim3$. If confirmed with follow-up observations, HZTDE-1 would represent the highest-redshift TDE discovery to date, and would suggest an enhancement of the TDE rate in the high-redshift universe. Our method, which can be applied to future deep surveys with JWST and Roman, offers a pathway to identify TDEs at $z&gt;4$ and probe black hole demographics at early cosmic times.</description>
