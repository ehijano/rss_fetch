      <title>Direct Measurement of Microwave Loss in Nb Films for Superconducting Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Niobium films are a key component in modern two-dimensional superconducting qubits, yet their contribution to the total qubit decay rate is not fully understood. The presence of different layers of materials and interfaces makes it difficult to identify the dominant loss channels in present two-dimensional qubit designs. In this paper we present the first study which directly correlates measurements of RF losses in such films to material parameters by investigating a high-power impulse magnetron sputtered (HiPIMS) film atop a three-dimensional niobium superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) resonator. By using a 3D SRF structure, we are able to isolate the niobium film loss from other contributions. Our findings indicate that microwave dissipation in the HiPIMS-prepared niobium films, within the quantum regime, resembles that of record-high intrinsic quality factor of bulk niobium SRF cavities, with lifetimes extending into seconds. Microstructure and impurity level of the niobium film do not significantly affect the losses. These results set the scale of microwave losses in niobium films and show that niobium losses do not dominate the observed coherence times in present two-dimensional superconducting qubit designs, instead highlighting the dominant role of the dielectric oxide in limiting the performance. We can also set a bound for when niobium film losses will become a limitation for qubit lifetimes.</description>

      <title>First-principles design of ambient-pressure Mg$_x$B$_2$C$_2$ and Na$_x$BC superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ ab initio modeling to investigate the possibility of attaining high-temperature conventional superconductivity in ambient-pressure materials based on the known MgB$_2$C$_2$ and recently proposed thermodynamically stable NaBC ternary compounds. The constructed $(T,P_M)$ phase diagrams (M = Mg or Na) indicate that these layered metal borocarbides can be hole-doped via thermal deintercalation that has been successfully used in previous experiments to produce Li$_y$BC ($y=1&gt;x\gtrsim0.5$) samples. The relatively low temperature threshold required to trigger NaBC desodiation may help prevent the formation of defects shown recently to be detrimental to the electron-phonon coupling in the delithiated LiBC analog. According to our numerical solutions of the anisotropic full-bandwidth Migdal-Eliashberg equations, the proposed Mg$_x$B$_2$C$_2$ and Na$_x$BC materials exhibit superconducting critical temperatures between 43 K and 84 K. At the same time, we demonstrate that buckling of defect-free honeycomb BC layers, favored in heavily-doped Na$_x$BC compounds, can substantially reduce or effectively suppress the materials' potential for MgB$_2$-type superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of order-fractionalization in the CPT model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the half-filled CPT model, an analytically tractable Kondo lattice model with Yao-Lee spin-spin interactions on a 3D hyperoctagon lattice, proposed by Coleman, Panigrahi, and Tsvelik. Previous studies have established that the CPT model exhibits odd-frequency triplet superconductivity and order fractionalization. Through asymptotic analyses in the small $J$ and large $J$ Kondo coupling limits, we identify a quantum critical point at $J_c$, marking a transition from a superconductor to a Kondo insulator. By estimating the vison gap energy to account for thermal gauge fluctuations, we determine the energy scales governing the thermal breakdown of order fractionalization. Moreover, at large $J$ the Kondo insulator undergoes orbital decoupling, leading to the formation of a decoupled Kitaev orbital liquid. These findings and analogies with the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauged $XY$ model lead us to propose a tentative phase diagram for the CPT model at half-filling.</description>

      <title>Local thermometry of NbSe$_2$ flake with delta-$T$ noise measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform transport and noise measurements for device consisting of a thin NbSe$_2$ flake laid onto the predefined gold electrodes and covered with a thin hBN flake. In the shot noise of a NbSe$_2$/Au tunnel junction (TJ), we identify Andreev reflection regime by demonstrating the effective charge doubling. Further, by creating temperature gradient across the TJ and measuring its delta-$T$ noise in the normal state, we extract electron-phonon scattering length in NbSe$_2$ and its $T$-dependence. The results of delta-$T$ noise measurements in the absence of a magnetic field when the flake is superconducting are in qualitative agreement with expectations. The introduced approach is promising for the study of nonequilibrium configurations in superconductors.</description>

      <title>Interplay between magnetism and superconductivity in a hybrid magnon-photon bilayer system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02785v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin waves in magnetic films are affected by the vicinity to a superconductor. Here we focus on a bilayer stack made of an insulating Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) film and a high-$T_c$ YBCO superconducting planar resonator and report microwave transmission spectra to monitor the temperature evolution of magnon-photon polaritons. We show that the observed temperature dependence of normal mode splitting and frequency shift with respect to the unperturbed magnon mode can be ultimately related to the penetration depth of YBCO, as an effect of the interplay between spin waves and Meissner currents.</description>

      <title>New Approach to Strong Correlation: Twisting Hubbard into the Orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08746v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the $n$-orbital extension of the Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model to the orbital HK (OHK) model which obtains by covering the Brillouin zone with $N/n$ Hubbard clusters each containing $n$-sites all connected via twisted boundary conditions. We show that this defines a systematic computational scheme to go from $n=1$ ``band'' HK to the full Hubbard model. Further, through powerful scaling arguments, we show that the convergence to Hubbard goes as $1/n^{2d}$ for $n^d$-orbital HK on a $d$-dimensional system implying that all the fluctuations vanish in $d=\infty$. As evidence for the above, we employ exact diagonalization and DMRG to show that the OHK model matches the exact (from Bethe ansatz) ground state energy of the 1d Hubbard model within 1$\%$ with just $n=10$ orbitals. For a square lattice, we recover an insulating state regardless of the strength of the interactions, double occupancy in agreement with state of the art simulations, dynamical spectral weight transfer, short-range antiferromagnetic correlations and charge neutral excitations leading to the algebraic temperature dependence of the specific heat, all with a fraction of the computational time of more advanced cluster methods and making it possible to obtain analytical insights. The success of OHK and its rapid convergence to the Hubbard model reiterates that a fixed point controls the physics. Consequently, the $n$-orbital HK model offers a new tool for strongly correlated quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Deconfined Fermi liquid to Fermi liquid transition and superconducting instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deconfined quantum critical points (DQCP) have attracted lots of attentions in the past decades, but were mainly restricted to incompressible phases. On the other hand, various experimental puzzles call for new theory of unconventional quantum criticality between metals at a generic density. Here we explore the possibility of a deconfined transition between two symmetric Fermi liquids in a bilayer model tuned by inter-layer antiferromagnetic spin-spin coupling $J_\perp$. Across the transition the Fermi surface volume per flavor jumps by $1/2$ of the Brillouin zone (BZ), similar to the small to large Fermi surface transitions in heavy Fermion systems and maybe also in the high Tc cuprates. But in the bilayer case the small Fermi surface phase (dubbed as sFL) has neither symmetry breaking nor fractionalization, akin to the symmetric mass generation (SMG) discussed in high energy physics. We formulate a deconfined critical theory where the two Fermi liquids correspond to higgs and/or confined phases of a $U(1)\times U(1)$ gauge theory. We show that this deconfined FL to FL transition (DFFT) fixed point is unstable to pairing and thus a superconductor dome is expected at low temperature. At finite temperature above the pairing scale, microscopic electron is a three particle bound state of the deconfined fractional fermions in the critical theory. We also introduce another parameter which can suppress the pairing instability, leading to a deconfined tri-critical point stable to zero temperature. We also provide numerical results of the bilayer model in one dimension, with a Luther-Emery liquid between two different Luttinger liquids, similar to the phase diagram from the field theory in two dimension. Our work opens a new direction to exploring deconfined metallic criticality and new pairing mechanism from critical gauge field.</description>
