      <title>Measurement of $p$-$\Xi^{-}$ ($\bar{p}$-$\bar{\Xi}^{+}$) Correlation Function in Isobar and Au+Au Collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV with the STAR Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the strong interactions between baryons, especially hyperon-nucleon ($Y$-$N$) interactions, is crucial for comprehending the equation-of-state (EoS) of the nuclear matter and inner structure of neutron star. In these proceedings, we present the measurements of $p$-$\Xi^{-}$ ($\bar{p}$-$\bar{\Xi}^{+}$) correlation functions with high statistics in Isobar (Ru+Ru, Zr+Zr) and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV by the STAR experiment. With the Lednick\'y-Lyuboshitz approach, the source size and strong interaction parameters of $p$-$\Xi^{-}$ ($\bar{p}$-$\bar{\Xi}^{+}$) pairs are extracted.</description>

      <title>Production of Light Nuclei in Au+Au Collisions with the STAR BES-II Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The yields and ratios of light nuclei in heavy-ion collisions offer a method to distinguish between the thermal and coalescence models. Ratios such as $\rm N_t \times N_p/N_d^2$ and $\rm N_{^3He} \times N_p/N_d^2$ are suggested as potential probes to investigate critical phenomena within the QCD phase diagram. The significantly larger datasets from STAR BES-II compared to BES-I, combined with enhanced detector capabilities, allow for more precise measurements. In this proceeding, we present the centrality and energy dependence of transverse momentum spectra and particle yields of (anti-)proton, (anti-)deuteron, and $\rm ^3He$ at BES-II energies ($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = $7.7 - 27$ GeV), as well as the light nuclei to proton yield ratios and coalescence parameters $(B_2(\rm d)$ and $B_3(\rm ^3He))$.</description>

      <title>Directed Flow of $\Lambda$, $^{3}_{\Lambda}{\rm H}$ and $^{4}_{\Lambda}{\rm H}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 3.2, 3.5, 3.9 and 4.5 GeV at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying hyper-nuclei yields and their collectivity can shed light on their production mechanism as well as the hyperon-nucleon interactions. Heavy-ion collisions from the RHIC beam energy scan phase II (BES-II) provide an unique opportunity to understand these at high baryon densities.
  In these proceedings, we present a systematic study on energy dependence of the directed flow ($v_{1}$) for $\Lambda$ and hyper-nuclei ($^{3}_{\Lambda}{\rm H}$, $^{4}_{\Lambda}{\rm H}$) from mid-central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 3.2, 3.5, 3.9 and 4.5 GeV, collected by the STAR experiment with the fixed-target mode during BES-II. The rapidity (y) dependence of the hyper-nuclei $v_{1}$ is studied in mid-central collisions. The extracted $v_{1}$ slopes ($\mathrm{d}v_{1}/\mathrm{d}y|_{y=0}$) of the hyper-nuclei are positive and decrease gradually as the collision energy increases. These hyper-nuclei results are compared to that of light-nuclei including p, d, t/$\rm ^{3}He$ and $\rm ^{4}He$. Finally, these results are compared with a hadronic transport model including coalescence after-burner.</description>

      <title>Radiative neutron capture cross section of $^{242}$Pu measured at n_TOF-EAR1 in the unresolved resonance region up to 600 keV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of fast reactors burning MOX fuels requires accurate capture and fission cross sections. For the particular case of neutron capture on 242Pu, the NEA recommends that an accuracy of 8-12% should be achieved in the fast energy region (2 keV-500 keV) compared to their estimation of 35% for the current uncertainty. Integral irradiation experiments suggest that the evaluated cross section of the JEFF-3.1 library overestimates the 242Pu(n,{\gamma}) cross section by 14% in the range between 1 keV and 1 MeV. In addition, the last measurement at LANSCE reported a systematic reduction of 20-30% in the 1-40 keV range relative to the evaluated libraries and previous data sets. In the present work this cross section has been determined up to 600 keV in order to solve the mentioned discrepancies. A 242Pu target of 95(4) mg enriched to 99.959% was irradiated at the n TOF-EAR1 facility at CERN. The capture cross section of 242Pu has been obtained between 1 and 600 keV with a systematic uncertainty (dominated by background subtraction) between 8 and 12%, reducing the current uncertainties of 35% and achieving the accuracy requested by the NEA in a large energy range. The shape of the cross section has been analyzed in terms of average resonance parameters using the FITACS code as implemented in SAMMY, yielding results compatible with our recent analysis of the resolved resonance region.The results are in good agreement with the data of Wisshak and K\"appeler and on average 10-14% below JEFF-3.2 from 1 to 250 keV, which helps to achieve consistency between integral experiments and cross section data. At higher energies our results show a reasonable agreement within uncertainties with both ENDF/B-VII.1 and JEFF-3.2. Our results indicate that the last experiment from DANCE underestimates the capture cross section of 242Pu by as much as 40% above a few keV.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty propagation and covariance analysis of 181Ta(n,{\gamma})182Ta nuclear reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutron capture cross-section for the $^{181}$Ta(n,$\gamma$)$^{182}$Ta reaction has been experimentally measured at the neutron energies 0.53 and 1.05 MeV using off-line $\gamma$-ray spectrometry. $^{115}$In(n,n'$\gamma$)$^{115m}$In is used as a reference monitor reaction cross-section. The neutron was produced via the $^{7}$Li(p,n)$^{7}$Be reaction. The present study measures the cross-sections with their uncertainties and correlation matrix. The self-attenuation process, $\gamma$-ray correction factor, and low background neutron energy contribution have been calculated. The measured neutron spectrum averaged cross-sections of $^{181}$Ta(n,$\gamma$)$^{182}$Ta are discussed and compared with the existing data from the EXFOR database and also with the ENDF/B-VIII.0, TENDL-2019, JENDL-5, JEFF-3.3 evaluated data libraries.</description>

      <title>Enhanced production of 60Fe in massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars are a major source of chemical elements in the cosmos, ejecting freshly produced nuclei through winds and core-collapse supernova explosions into the interstellar medium. Among the material ejected, long lived radioisotopes, such as 60Fe (iron) and 26Al (aluminum), offer unique signs of active nucleosynthesis in our galaxy. There is a long-standing discrepancy between the observed 60Fe/26Al ratio by {\gamma}-ray telescopes and predictions from supernova models. This discrepancy has been attributed to uncertainties in the nuclear reaction networks producing 60Fe, and one reaction in particular, the neutron-capture on 59Fe. Here we present experimental results that provide a strong constraint on this reaction. We use these results to show that the production of 60Fe in massive stars is higher than previously thought, further increasing the discrepancy between observed and predicted 60Fe/26Al ratios. The persisting discrepancy can therefore not be attributed to nuclear uncertainties, and points to issues in massive-star models.</description>

      <title>Anthropogenic actinides in seawater and biota from the west coast of Sweden</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The assessment of the origin of the anthropogenic contamination in marine regions impacted by other sources than global fallout is a challenge. This is the case of the west coast of Sweden, influenced by the liquid effluents released by the European Nuclear Reprocessing Plants through North Sea currents and by Baltic Sea local and regional sources, among others. This work focused on the study of anthropogenic actinides (${}^{236}$U, ${}^{237}$Np and ${}^{239,240}$Pu) in seawater and biota from a region close to Gothenburg where radioactive wastes with an unknown composition were dumped in 1964. To this aim, a radiochemical procedure for the sequential extraction of U, Np and Pu from biota samples and the subsequent analysis of ${}^{236}$U, ${}^{237}$Np, ${}^{239}$Pu and ${}^{240}$Pu by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry was developed. The method was validated through the study of two reference materials provided by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA): IAEA-446 (Baltic Sea seaweed) and IAEA-437 (Mediterranean Sea mussels). The ${}^{233}$U$/{}^{236}$U atom ratio was also studied in the seawater samples. The obtained results indicate that the North Sea currents and global fallout are the major sources for ${}^{236}$U, ${}^{237}$Np and ${}^{239,240}$Pu to the studied area, with any clear evidence of other local sources. Complementary, information on the Concentrations Factors (CF) in biota was obtained, for which the available information is very scarce. For seaweed, CF values of $(4.1 \pm 1.1) \times 10^{3}$, $88 \pm 51$ and $70 \pm 20$ have been obtained for Pu, Np and U, respectively. Lower CF values of $(3.6 \pm 1.2) \times 10^{2}$, $37 \pm 15$ and $15.1 \pm 5.2$ for Pu, Np and U, respectively, have been obtained for mussels.</description>

Abstract: Born in Punjab (India) in December 1941, Balraj Singh is not only the single most prolific nuclear data evaluator and disseminator of nuclear structure and decay data with 148 evaluations in Nuclear Data Sheets -- 85 as the first and often only author -- plus other journals, but his upmost curiosity and dedication brought him to be one of the finest nuclear physicists, with an everlasting influence on many of us. Balraj passed away about a year ago on 9 October 2023 in Ottawa, Ontario (Canada) at the age of 81, and at Atomic Data and Nuclear Data Tables we would like to commemorate some of his scientific achievements.</description>

      <title>Recent results from STAR for parton distribution functions at low and high $x$ in proton-proton collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to perturbative quantum chromodynamic calculations, in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = $~200 and 510 GeV studied at RHIC, jet production in mid-pseudorapidity, $|\eta| &lt;$ 1, is dominated by quark-gluon and gluon-gluon scattering processes. Therefore jets at RHIC are direct probes of the gluon parton distribution functions (PDFs) for momentum fractions 0.01 $&lt;x&lt;$ 0.5. Moreover, $W$ boson cross section ratio, $\sigma(W^+)/\sigma(W^-)$, in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 510$~GeV, is an effective tool to explore anti-quark PDFs, $\bar{d}/\bar{u}$. Last but not least, di-$\pi^{0}$ correlation in forward pseudorapidity, $2.6 &lt; \eta &lt;4.0$, is an important indication of the non-linear gluon dynamics at low $x$ where the gluon density is high in protons and nuclei. In this proceeding, we present recent STAR results of mid-pseudorapidity inclusive jet cross-sections at $\sqrt{s} =$~200 and 510 GeV in $pp$ collisions, $W$ boson cross-section ratios at $\sqrt{s} = 510$~GeV in $pp$ collisions, and forward di-$\pi^0$ correlations in $pp$, $p\textrm{Al}$ and $p\textrm{Au}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\textrm{\tiny NN}}} = 200$~GeV.</description>
