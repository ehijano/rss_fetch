      <title>Bourgain-uo sequential completeness in vector lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit Bourgain's 1981 counterexample to the sequential completeness of the 'pointwise plus domination' convergence on $\ell_1$ from the perspective of vector lattices. In this setting, we show that for sequences the associated notion of Bourgain-uo convergence coincides with ordinary order convergence. Motivated by Bourgain's construction, we introduce a strengthened, subsequence-invariant notion of Cauchy sequence: a sequence $(x_n)$ in a vector lattice $E$ is called Buo-Cauchy if for every strictly increasing sequence $(n_k)$ the differences $x_{n_{k+1}}-x_{n_k}$ converge to $0$ in order in $E$. We study the resulting sequential completeness problem in several concrete Banach lattices.
  Our main results are twofold. On the positive side, we prove that the classical sequence lattices $c_0$ and $\ell_\infty$ are sequentially Buo-complete: every Buo-Cauchy sequence converges in order, and hence in the Buo sense. In addition, we establish a sharp metric characterisation for bounded Lipschitz function lattices: the vector lattice $\mathrm{Lip}_b(X)$ of bounded Lipschitz functions on a metric space $(X,d)$ is sequentially \Buo-complete if and only if $X$ is uniformly discrete.
  On the negative side, we show that vector lattices of continuous or Lipschitz functions over metric spaces with non-isolated points fail sequential Buo-completeness. In particular, $C(X)$, $C_b(X)$, $C_0(X)$ and $Lip_b(X)$ are not sequentially Buo-complete whenever $X$ is not uniformly discrete.</description>

      <title>On the uniform continuity of homeomorphisms between the spheres of $\ell_\infty^k$ and $\ell_1^k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of whether there is a sequence of homeomorphisms $(F_k)_k$ between the unit spheres of the $k$-dimensional Banach spaces $\ell_\infty^k$ and $\ell_1^k$ which is also equi-uniformly continuous. We prove that this cannot be the case if the sequence $(F_k)_k$ either (1) does not increase support sizes (which is a property strictly weaker than support preservation) or (2) is step preserving (which is a property strictly weaker than being equivariant with respect to permutations of the canonical basis). We also provide quantitative estimates relating the moduli of uniform continuity of the maps to the dimension of the spaces. This gives partial answers to a question of W. B. Johnson and it is related to the problem of whether $c_0$ has Kasparov and Yu's Property (H). Our results also apply to more general spaces other than $\ell_1$ such as spaces with unconditional bases which are not equivalent to the standard $c_0$ basis. Finally, we derive an asymptotic concentration inequality that must be satisfied by step preserving equi-uniformly continuous maps defined on the positive parts of these unit spheres.</description>

      <title>On Bhatia-\v{S}emrl Property, Strong Subdifferentiability and Essential Norm of Operators on Banach Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay among three key properties of bounded linear operators between Banach spaces: the Bhatia-\v{S}emrl property, strong subdifferentiability and the condition that the essential norm is strictly less than the operator norm. For a Hilbert space $H$ and for $1&lt;p,q&lt;\infty$, we show that for any operator in $B(H)$ and $B(\ell_p, \ell_q)$, the essential norm is strictly less than the operator norm if and only if it is the point of strong subdifferentiability of the norm and its norm-attainment set is compact. Moreover, for operators in these spaces that satisfy the Bhatia-\v{S}emrl property, we show that their essential norm must be strictly less than their operator norm. We also study norm one projections satisfying the Bhatia-\v{S}emrl property and provide examples of operators that possess this property.</description>

      <title>Bochkarev's inequalities in the Anisotropic grand Lorentz Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main aim of this paper is to obtain Bochkarev-type inequalities for the anisotropic grand Lorentz spaces. In the classical setting, Bochkarev obtained inequalities of the Hardy--Littlewood type, which reveal the connection between the integral properties of functions and the summability of their Fourier coefficients. His results describe the behavior of trigonometric series in the Lorentz spaces $L_{2,r}$ for $2 &lt; r \le \infty$. In this work, we extend these ideas to the framework of anisotropic grand Lorentz spaces. Using an approach based on the extrapolation of linear operators, we derive new Bochkarev-type inequalities that generalize the classical results to the case of anisotropic grand Lorentz spaces and arbitrary orthonormal systems. We investigate the summability properties of the Fourier coefficients of functions from anisotropic grand Lorentz spaces.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider evolutionary equations as introduced by R.\ Picard in 2009 and develop a general theory for approximation which can be seen as a theoretical foundation for numerical analysis for evolutionary equations. To demonstrate the approximation result, we apply it to a spatial discretisation of the heat equation using spectral methods.</description>

      <title>Polynomial local functionals on convex functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We shown that every continuous local functional on the space of finite convex functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a valuation. This relation is used to establish a homogeneous decomposition for the class of polynomial local functionals as well as a classification of translation or rigid motion invariant polynomial local functionals. In addition we discuss implications for the compact-open topology on the space of polynomial local functionals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Replacing operators with continuous operator-valued functions, we prove time-dependent versions of well-known results on compressions and diagonals of bounded operators. The setting of smooth functions is also addressed. Our results have no analogues in the literature and rely on a new technique. The results are especially transparent for selfadjoint operators.</description>

      <title>Global Integrability of the Reciprocal of Jacobians for Homeomorphisms of Finite Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a homeomorphism with $p$-integrable distortion, we obtain the optimal global degree of integrability for the reciprocal of its Jacobian determinant. As an application, we strengthen the result of Dole\v{z}alov\'a, Hencl and Mal\'y concerning weak limits of Sobolev homeomorphisms with finite distortion. Such limits represent physically admissible deformations, as they remain injective almost everywhere and thus adhere as closely as possible to the principle of non-interpenetration of matter in mathematical models of nonlinear elasticity.</description>

      <title>A cheap way to closed operator sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ and $B$ be sectorial operators in a Banach space $X$ of angles $\omega_A$ and $\omega_B$, respectively, where $\omega_A+\omega_B&lt;\pi$. We present a simple and common approach to results on closedness of the operator sum $A+B$, based on Littlewood-Paley type norms and tools from several interpolation theories. This allows us to give short proofs for the well-known results due to Da~Prato-Grisvard and Kalton-Weis. We prove a new result in $\ell^q$-interpolation spaces and illustrate it with a maximal regularity result for abstract parabolic equations. Our approach also yields a new proof for the Dore-Venni result.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we characterize the boundedness and the compactness of weighted composition operators acting on a de Branges-Rovnyak space $\mathcal H(b)$, where the symbol $b$ is a rational function in the unit ball of $H^\infty$ that is not a finite Blaschke product. Our results extend those of [2] by exploiting a close relationship between weighted composition operators on $\mathcal H(b)$ and their counterparts on the Hardy space $H^2$.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic trigonometric functions as approximation kernels and their properties II: Wavelets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous paper we have introduced a new class of radial basis functions that are powerful means to approximate functions by quasi-interpolation. In this article we extend the results to create new ways of approximating functions by prewavelets that are constructed from spaced spanned of the new hyperbolic radial basis functions. They consist of highly localised time-frequency decompositions that are suitable for analysis and filtering. The construction is sufficiently general to apply for large classes of other radial basis functions too - such as multiquadrics and their generalisations and thin-plate splines -, as well as, for example, polynomial splines.</description>

      <title>Estimates for convolution operators on Hardy spaces associated with ball quasi-Banach function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $0 \leq \alpha &lt; n$, $N \in \mathbb{N}$, and let $X$ and $Y$ be ball quasi-Banach function spaces on $\mathbb{R}^n$. We consider operators $T_{\alpha}$ defined by convolution with kernels of type $(\alpha, N)$. Assuming that the powered Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator satisfies some Fefferman-Stein vector-valued maximal inequality on $X$ and is bounded on the associated space, we prove that $T_0$, $\alpha = 0$, extends to a bounded operator $H_{X}(\mathbb{R}^n) \to X$ and $H_{X}(\mathbb{R}^n) \to H_{X}(\mathbb{R}^n)$; and, under certain additional assumptions on $X$ and $Y$, $T_{\alpha}$, $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; n$, extends to a bounded operator $H_{X}(\mathbb{R}^n) \to Y$ and $H_{X}(\mathbb{R}^n) \to H_{Y}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. In particular, from these results, it follows that singular integrals and the Riesz potential satisfy such estimates, respectively. We also provide an off-diagonal Fefferman-Stein vector-valued inequality for the fractional maximal operator on the $p$-convexification of ball quasi-Banach function spaces.</description>

Abstract: This paper develops a fixed point version of the well-known Nehari manifold method from critical point theory. The main result is formulated for systems of operator equations, relying on the fixed point theorems of Schauder and Schaefer. The framework also allows for potential extensions combining our Nehari type approach with other fixed point principles. To demonstrate the applicability of the method, an example involving a system of nonlinear integral equations is provided.</description>

      <title>Runge type approximation results for spaces of smooth Whitney jets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove Runge type approximation results for linear partial differential operators with constant coefficients on spaces of smooth Whitney jets. Among others, we characterize when for a constant coefficient linear partial differential operator $P(D)$ and for closed subsets $F_1\subset F_2$ of $\mathbb{R}^d$ the restrictions to $F_1$ of smooth Whitney jets $f$ on $F_2$ satisfying $P(D)f=0$ on $F_2$ are dense in the space of smooth Whitney jets on $F_1$ satisfying the same partial differential equation on $F_1$. For elliptic operators we give a geometric evaluation of this characterization. Additionally, for differential operators with a single characteristic direction, like parabolic operators, we give a sufficient geometric condition for the above density to hold. Under mild additional assumptions on $\partial F_1$ and for $F_2=\mathbb{R}^d$ this sufficient conditions is also necessary. As an application of our work, we characterize those open subsets $\Omega$ of the complex plane satisfying $\Omega=\operatorname{int}\overline{\Omega}$ for which the set of holomorphic polynomials are dense in $A^\infty(\Omega)$, under the mild additional hypothesis that $\overline{\Omega}$ satisfies the strong regularity condition. Furthermore, for the wave operator in one spatial variable, a simple sufficient geometric condition on $F_1, F_2\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ is given for the above density to hold. For the special case of $F_2=\mathbb{R}^2$ this sufficient condition is also necessary under mild additional hypotheses on $F_1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate discrete regularity estimates for a broad class of temporal numerical schemes for parabolic stochastic evolution equations. We provide a characterization of discrete stochastic maximal $\ell^p$-regularity in terms of its continuous counterpart, thereby establishing a unified framework that yields numerous new discrete regularity results. Moreover, as a consequence of the continuous-time theory, we establish several important properties of discrete stochastic maximal regularity such as extrapolation in the exponent $p$ and with respect to a power weight. Furthermore, employing the $H^\infty$-functional calculus, we derive a powerful discrete maximal estimate in the trace space norm $D_A(1-\frac1p,p)$ for $p \in [2,\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Gaussian approximation on the Skorokhod space via Malliavin calculus and regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a carr\'e du champ operator for Banach-valued random elements, taking values in the projective tensor product, and use it to control the bounded Lipschitz distance between a Malliavin-smooth random element satisfying mild regularity assumptions and a Radon Gaussian taking values in the Skorokhod space equipped with the uniform topology. In the case where the random element is a Banach-valued multiple integral, the carr\'e du champ expression is further bounded by norms of the contracted integral kernel. The main technical tool is an integration by parts formula, which might be of independent interest. As a by-product, we recover a bound obtained recently by D\"uker and Zoubouloglou in the Hilbert space setting and complement it by providing contraction bounds.</description>
