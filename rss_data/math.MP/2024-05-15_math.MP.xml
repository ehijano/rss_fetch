      <title>Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory for Ginzburg-Landau dynamics with long range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Focusing on a famous class of interacting diffusion processes called Ginzburg-Landau (GL) dynamics, we extend the Macroscopic Fluctuations Theory (MFT) to these systems in the case where the interactions are long-range, and consequently, the macroscopic effective equations are described by non-linear fractional diffusion equations.</description>

      <title>On Long Range Ising Models with Random Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider polynomial long-range Ising models in one dimension, with ferromagnetic pair interactions decaying with power $2-\alpha$ (for $0 \leq \alpha &lt; 1$), and prepared with randomly chosen boundary conditions. We show that at low temperatures in the thermodynamic limit the finite-volume Gibbs measures do not converge, but have a distributional limit, the so-called metastate. We find that there is a distinction between the values of $\alpha$ less than or larger than $\frac{1}{2}$. For moderate, or intermediate, decay $\alpha &lt; \frac{1}{2}$, the metastate is very dispersed and supported on the set of all Gibbs measures, both extremal and non-extremal, whereas for slow decays $\alpha &gt; \frac{1}{2}$ the metastate is still dispersed, but has its support just on the set of the two extremal Gibbs measures, the plus measure and the minus measure.
  The former, moderate decays case, appears to be new and is due to the occurrence of almost sure boundedness of the random variable which is the sum of all interaction (free) energies between random and ordered half-lines, when the decay is fast enough, but still slow enough to get a phase transition ($\alpha&gt;0$); while the latter, slow decays case, is more reminiscent of and similar to the behaviour of higher-dimensional nearest-neighbour Ising models with diverging boundary (free) energies.
  We leave the threshold case $\alpha=\frac{1}{2}$ for further studies.</description>

      <title>Gaussian measure on the dual of $\mathrm{U}(N)$, random partitions, and topological expansion of the partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a Gaussian measure with parameter $q\in(0,1)$ on the dual of the unitary group of size $N$: we prove that a random highest weight under this measure is the coupling of two independent $q$-uniform random partitions $\alpha,\beta$ and a random highest weight of $\mathrm{U}(1)$. We prove deviation inequalities for the $q$-uniform measure, and use them to show that the coupling of random partitions under the Gaussian measure vanishes in the limit $N\to\infty$. We also prove that the partition function of this measure admits an asymptotic expansion in powers of $1/N$, and that this expansion is topological, in the sense that its coefficients are related to the enumeration of ramified coverings of elliptic curves. It provides a rigorous proof of the gauge/string duality for the Yang-Mills theory on a 2D torus with gauge group $\mathrm{U}(N),$ advocated by Gross and Taylor \cite{GT,GT2}.</description>

      <title>Rogers-Ramanujan identities in Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the story of the Rogers-Ramanujan identities; being known for 85 years and having about 130 pure mathematics proofs, suddenly entering physics when Rodney Baxter solved the Hard Hexagon Model in Statistical Mechanics in 1980. We next cover the accompanying proofs by George E Andrews of other related Baxter identities arisen of Rogers-Ramanujan type, leading into a new flourishing partnership of Physics and Mathematics. Our narrative goes into the subsequent 44 years, explaining the progress in physics and mathematical analysis. Finally we show some related crossovers with regard to the Elliptic q-gamma function and some Vector Partition generating functional equations; the latter of which may be new. The present paper is essentially chapter 11 of a 32 chapter book to appear in June 2024.</description>

      <title>The one-dimensional Coulomb Hamiltonian: Properties of its Birman-Schwinger operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Birman-Schwinger operator for a self-adjoint realisation of the one-dimensional Hamiltonian with the Coulomb potential. We study both the case in which this Hamiltonian is defined on the whole real line and when it is only defined on the positive semiaxis. In both cases, the Birman-Schwinger operator is Hilbert-Schmidt, even though it is not trace class. Then, we have considered some approximations to the Hamiltonian depending on a positive parameter, under given conditions, and proved the convergence of the Birman-Schwinger operators of these approximations to the original Hamiltonian as the parameter goes to zero. Further comments and results have been included.</description>

      <title>Ruijsenaars duality for B, C, D Toda chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Hamiltonian reduction method to construct the Ruijsenaars dual systems to generalized Toda chains associated with the classical Lie algebras of types $B, C, D$. The dual systems turn out to be the $B, C$ and $D$ analogues of the rational Goldfish model, which is, as in the type $A$ case, the strong coupling limit of rational Ruijsenaars systems. We explain how both types of systems emerge in the reduction of the cotangent bundle of a Lie group and provide the formulae for dual Hamiltonians. We compute explicitly the higher Hamiltonians of Goldfish models using the Cauchy--Binet theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It shown that if a vector space carries commuting actions of two Clifford algebras, then the quadratic monomials using generators from either Clifford algebra determine a spinor representation of an orthogonal Lie algebra.
  Examples of this construction have applications to high energy physics, particularly to the standard model and unification. It is shown how to use Clifford data to construct spectral triples for the Pati-Salam model that admit an action of Spin(10).</description>

      <title>Quantum Integrable Systems arising from Separation of Variables on S3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the family of quantum integrable systems that arise from separating the Schr\"odinger equation in all 6 separable orthogonal coordinates on the 3 sphere: ellipsoidal, prolate, oblate, Lam\'{e}, spherical and cylindrical. On the one hand each separating coordinate system gives rise to a quantum integrable system on S2 x S2, on the other hand it also leads to families of harmonic polynomials in R4. We show that separation in ellipsoidal coordinates yields a generalised Lam\'{e} equation - a Fuchsian ODE with 5 regular singular points. We seek polynomial solutions so that the eigenfunctions are analytic at all finite singularities. We classify eigenfunctions by their discrete symmetry and compute the joint spectrum for each symmetry class. The latter 5 separable coordinate systems are all degenerations of the ellipsoidal coordinates. We perform similar analyses on these systems and show how the ODEs degenerate in a fashion akin to their respective coordinates. For the prolate system we show that there exists a defect in the joint spectrum which prohibits a global assignment of quantum numbers: the system has quantum monodromy. This is a companion paper to our previous work where the respective classical systems were studied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $4$-dimensional semi-holomorphic Chern-Simons theory of Costello and Yamazaki provides a gauge-theoretic origin for the Lax connection of $2$-dimensional integrable field theories. The purpose of this paper is to extend this framework to the setting of $3$-dimensional integrable field theories by considering a $5$-dimensional semi-holomorphic higher Chern-Simons theory for a higher connection $(A,B)$ on $\mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{C}P^1$. The input data for this theory are the choice of a meromorphic $1$-form $\omega$ on $\mathbb{C}P^1$ and a strict Lie $2$-group with cyclic structure on its underlying Lie $2$-algebra. Integrable field theories on $\mathbb{R}^3$ are constructed by imposing suitable boundary conditions on the connection $(A,B)$ at the $3$-dimensional defects located at the poles of $\omega$ and choosing certain admissible meromorphic solutions of the bulk equations of motion. The latter provides a natural notion of higher Lax connection for $3$-dimensional integrable field theories, including a $2$-form component $B$ which can be integrated over Cauchy surfaces to produce conserved charges. As a first application of this approach, we show how to construct a generalization of Ward's $(2+1)$-dimensional integrable chiral model from a suitable choice of data in the $5$-dimensional theory.</description>

      <title>Defining subsystems in Hilbert spaces with non-Euclidean metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well established that pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics is a trivial extension of regular quantum mechanics. The modified inner-product space defined through the so-called metric operator, turns out to be the most natural way to represent certain phenomena such as those involving balanced gain and loss. However, for composite systems undergoing pseudo-Hermitian evolution, defining the subsystems is generally considered feasible only when the metric operator is chosen to have a tensor product. In this work, we use arguments from algebraic quantum mechanics to show that the subsystems can be well-defined in every metric space -- irrespective of whether or not the metric is of tensor product form. This is done by identifying subsystems with a decomposition of the underlying algebra into sub-algebras. In fact, we show that different decompositions of the underlying $C^*-$algebra correspond to choosing different equivalence classes of metric operators. We show how each of the subsystems, defined this way, can be tomographically constructed and that these subsystems satisfy the no-signaling principle. Therefore, we put all the choices of the metric on an equal footing.</description>

      <title>From Entanglement to Universality: A Multiparticle Spacetime Algebra Approach to Quantum Computational Gates Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alternative mathematical explorations in quantum computing can be of great scientific interest, especially if they come with penetrating physical insights. In this paper, we present a critical revisitation of our geometric (Clifford) algebras (GAs) application in quantum computing as originally presented in [C. Cafaro and S. Mancini, Adv. Appl. Clifford Algebras 21, 493 (2011)]. Our focus is on testing the usefulness of geometric algebras (GAs) techniques in two applications to quantum computing. First, making use of the geometric algebra of a relativistic configuration space (a.k.a., multiparticle spacetime algebra or MSTA), we offer an explicit algebraic characterization of one- and two-qubit quantum states together with a MSTA description of one- and two-qubit quantum computational gates. In this first application, we devote special attention to the concept of entanglement, focusing on entangled quantum states and two-qubit entangling quantum gates. Second, exploiting the previously mentioned MSTA characterization together with the GA depiction of the Lie algebras SO(3;R) and SU(2;C) depending on the rotor group formalism, we focus our attention to the concept of universality in quantum computing by reevaluating Boykin's proof on the identification of a suitable set of universal quantum gates. At the end of our mathematical exploration, we arrive at two main conclusions. Firstly, the MSTA perspective leads to a powerful conceptual unification between quantum states and quantum operators. More specifically, the complex qubit space and the complex space of unitary operators acting on them merge in a single multivectorial real space. Secondly, the GA viewpoint on rotations based on the rotor group carries both conceptual and computational upper hands compared to conventional vectorial and matricial methods.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Framework for Self-Gravitating k-Form Boson Stars with Internal Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current boson star models are largely restricted to global symmetries and lower spin fields. In this work, we generalize these systems of self-gravitating bosonic fields to allow for arbitrary totally antisymmetric tensor fields and arbitrary internal gauge symmetries. We construct a generalized formalism for Yang-Mills-like theories, which allows for arbitrary k-form fields, instead of just vector fields. The k-form fields have gauge symmetries described by semisimple, compact Lie groups. We further derive equations of motion for the k-form fields and connection coefficients of the Lie group. Extensions and applications are also discussed. We present a novel way to fix the group connection using a spacetime connection. As an example, we derive explicitly the connection coefficients for SU(2) in a spherically symmetric spacetime using rectangular vielbeins. The combination of methods presented leads to a powerful, adaptable and practical framework. As a proof of concept, we derive ordinary differential equations for a 0-form field with a SU(2) symmetry. Our framework can be used to model self-gravitating (multi) particle states with internal symmetries, such as pion condensates or dark matter. It is also suited as a tool to approach open problems in modified gravity and string theory.</description>

      <title>Generating quantum dissonance via local operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlations may arise in quantum systems through various means, of which the most remarkable one is quantum entanglement. Additionally, there are systems that exhibit non-classical correlations even in the absence of entanglement. Quantum dissonance refers to how quantum discord (QD) -- the difference between the total correlation and the classical correlation in a given quantum state -- appears as a non-classical correlation in a system without entanglement. It could be said that QD has the potential to provide a more inclusive viewpoint for discerning the non-classical correlations. In this work, we address the problem of manipulating the QD between two subsystems through local operations. We propose two explicit procedures for obtaining separable Werner states, a type of mixed state with nonzero QD. Both approaches involve performing local operations on classically correlated states and offers a step-by-step method for obtaining separable Werner states with nonzero discord, providing an alternative (explicit and user-friendly) to existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the conformal scattering operator for the scalar wave equation on the Vaidya spacetime using vector field methods. The spacetime we consider is Schwarzschild, near both past and future timelike infinities, in order to use existing decay results for the scalar field, ensuring our energy estimates. These estimates guarantee the injectivity of the trace operator and the closure of its range. Finally, we solve a Goursat problem for the scalar waves on null infinities, demonstrating that the range of the trace operator is dense. Consequently, this implies that the scattering operator is an isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Generalized uncertainty principle distorted quintessence dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we invoke a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) in the symmetry-reduced cosmological Hamiltonian for a universe driven by a quintessence scalar field with potential. Our study focuses on semi-classical regime. In particular, we derive the GUP-distorted Friedmann, Raychaudhuri, and the Klein-Gordon equation. This is followed by a systematic analysis of the qualitative dynamics for the choice of potential $V(\phi)= V_0 \sinh^{-n}{(\mu \phi)}$. This involves constructing an autonomous dynamical system of equations by choosing appropriate dynamical variables, followed by a qualitative study using linear stability theory. Our analysis shows that incorporating GUP significantly changes the existing fixed points compared to the limiting case without quantum effects by switching off the GUP.</description>

Abstract: We propose a counterpart of the classical Rollnik-class of potentials for fractional and massive relativistic Laplacians, and describe this space in terms of appropriate Riesz potentials. These definitions rely on precise resolvent estimates. We show that Coulomb-type potentials are elements of fractional Rollnik-class up to but not including the critical singularity of the Hardy potential. For the operators with fractional exponent $\alpha = 1$ there exists no fractional Rollnik potential, however, in low dimensions we make sense of these classes as limiting cases by using $\Gamma$-convergence. In a second part of the paper we derive detailed results on the self-adjointness and spectral properties of relativistic Schr\"odinger operators obtained under perturbations by fractional Rollnik potentials. We also define an extended fractional Rollnik-class which is the maximal space for the Hilbert-Schmidt property of the related Birman-Schwinger operators.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian for the Hilbert-P\'olya Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00405v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a Hamiltonian to address the Hilbert-P\'olya conjecture. The eigenfunctions of the introduced Hamiltonian, subject to the Dirichlet boundary conditions on the positive half-line, vanish at the origin by the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Consequently, the eigenvalues are determined by these nontrivial Riemann zeros. If the Riemann hypothesis (RH) is true, the eigenvalues become real and represent the imaginary parts of the nontrivial zeros. Conversely, if the Hamiltonian is self-adjoint, or more generally, admits only real eigenvalues, then the RH follows. In our attempt to demonstrate the latter, we establish the existence of a similarity transformation of the introduced Hamiltonian that is self-adjoint on the domain specified by an appropriate boundary condition, which is satisfied by the eigenfunctions through the vanishing of the Riemann zeta function. Our result can be extended to a broader class of functions whose zeros lie on the critical line.</description>

      <title>New Partial Trace Inequalities and Distillability of Werner States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05726v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the oldest problems in quantum information theory is to study whether any undistillable state has a positive partial transpose (PPT). This problem has been open for almost 30 years, and still no one has been able to give a complete answer to it. This work presents a new strategy to try to solve this problem by translating the distillability condition on the family of Werner states into a problem of partial trace inequalities. We present our two main results and a new bound for the 2-distillability, $\alpha \geq -\frac{1}{4}$. Moreover, we present throughout this work numerous partial trace inequalities, which are valid for many families of matrices.</description>

      <title>Edgeworth-type expansion for the one-point distribution of the KPZ fixed point with a large height at a prior location</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04999v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) fixed point $\mathrm{H}(x,\tau)$ with the step initial condition and investigate the distribution of $\mathrm{H}(x,\tau)$ conditioned on a large height at an earlier space-time point $\mathrm{H}(x',\tau')$. As $\mathrm{H}(x',\tau')$ tends to infinity, we prove that the conditional one-point distribution of $\mathrm{H}(x,\tau)$ in the regime $\tau&gt;\tau'$ converges to the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) Tracy-Widom distribution and the next two lower-order error terms can be expressed as derivatives of the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution, which is a conceptual analogue to the Edgeworth expansion in the central limit theorem. These KPZ-type limiting behaviors are different from the Gaussian-type ones obtained in \cite{Liu-Wang22} where they study the finite-dimensional distribution of $\mathrm{H}(x,\tau)$ conditioned on a large height at a later space-time point $\mathrm{H}(x',\tau')$. They show, with the step initial condition, that the conditional random field $\mathrm{H}(x,\tau)$ in the regime $\tau&lt;\tau'$ converges to the minimum of two independent Brownian bridges modified by linear drifts as $\mathrm{H}(x',\tau')$ goes to infinity. The two results stated above provide the phase diagram of the asymptotic behaviors of a conditional law of KPZ fixed point in the regimes $\tau&gt;\tau'$ and $\tau&lt;\tau'$ when $\mathrm{H}(x',\tau')$ goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>Magic of quantum hypergraph states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magic, or nonstabilizerness, characterizes the deviation of a quantum state from the set of stabilizer states and plays a fundamental role from quantum state complexity to universal fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, analytical or even numerical characterizations of magic are very challenging, especially in the multi-qubit system, even with a moderate qubit number. Here we systemically and analytically investigate the magic resource of archetypal multipartite quantum states -- quantum hypergraph states, which can be generated by multi-qubit Controlled-phase gates encoded by hypergraphs. We first give the magic formula in terms of the stabilizer R$\mathrm{\acute{e}}$nyi-$\alpha$ entropies for general quantum hypergraph states and prove the magic can not reach the maximal value, if the average degree of the corresponding hypergraph is constant. Then we investigate the statistical behaviors of random hypergraph states and prove the concentration result that typically random hypergraph states can reach the maximal magic. This also suggests an efficient way to generate maximal magic states with random diagonal circuits. Finally, we study some highly symmetric hypergraph states with permutation-symmetry, such as the one whose associated hypergraph is $3$-complete, i.e., any three vertices are connected by a hyperedge. Counterintuitively, such states can only possess constant or even exponentially small magic for $\alpha\geq 2$. Our study advances the understanding of multipartite quantum magic and could lead to applications in quantum computing and quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <title>In-in correlators and scattering amplitudes on a causal set</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal set theory is an approach to quantum gravity in which spacetime is fundamentally discrete at the Planck scale and takes the form of a Lorentzian lattice, or "causal set", from which continuum spacetime emerges in a large-scale (low-energy) approximation. In this work, we present new developments in the framework of interacting quantum field theory on causal sets. We derive a diagrammatic expansion for in-in correlators in local scalar field theories with finite polynomial interactions. We outline how these same correlators can be computed using the double-path integral which acts as a generating functional for the in-in correlators. We modify the in-in generating functional to obtain a generating functional for in-out correlators. We define a notion of scattering amplitudes on causal sets with non-interacting past and future regions and verify that they are given by S-matrix elements (matrix elements of the time-evolution operator). We describe how these formal developments can be implemented to compute early universe observables under the assumption that spacetime is fundamentally discrete.</description>

      <title>Weak Hopf symmetry and tube algebra of the generalized multifusion string-net model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the multifusion generalization of string-net ground states and lattice Hamiltonians, delving into its associated weak Hopf symmetry. For the multifusion string-net, the gauge symmetry manifests as a general weak Hopf algebra, leading to a reducible vacuum string label; the charge symmetry, serving as a quantum double of gauge symmetry, constitutes a connected weak Hopf algebra. This implies that the associated topological phase retains its characterization by a unitary modular tensor category (UMTC). The bulk charge symmetry can also be captured by a weak Hopf tube algebra. We offer an explicit construction of the weak Hopf tube algebra structure and thoroughly discuss its properties. The gapped boundary and domain wall models are extensively discussed, with these $1d$ phases characterized by unitary multifusion categories (UMFCs). We delve into the gauge and charge symmetries of these $1d$ phases, as well as the construction of the boundary and domain wall tube algebras. Additionally, we illustrate that the domain wall tube algebra can be regarded as a cross product of two boundary tube algebras. As an application of our model, we elucidate how to interpret the defective string-net as a restricted multifusion string-net.</description>

      <title>Exact solution for the collective non-Markovian decay of two fully excited quantum emitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics constitutes a modern paradigm for the interaction of light and matter, in which strong coupling, bath structure, and propagation delays can break the radiative conditions that quantum emitters typically encounter in free space. These characteristics intertwine the excitations of quantum emitters and guided radiation modes to form complex multiphoton dynamics. So far, combining the collective decay of the emitters with the non-Markovian effects induced by the modes has escaped a full solution and the detailed physics behind these systems remains unknown. Here we analyze such a collective non-Markovian decay in a minimal system of two excited emitters coupled to a one-dimensional single-band waveguide. We develop an exact solution for this system in terms of elementary functions that unveils hidden symmetries and predicts new forms of spontaneous decay. The collective non-Markovian dynamics, which are strongly dependent on the vacuum coupling and the detuning from the center of the band, show exotic features that can be characterized with a simple and readily available criterion. Our analytic methods shed light on the complexity of collective light-matter interactions and open up a pathway for understanding multiparticle open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Complex Stochastic Optimal Control Foundation of Quantum Mechanics</title>

Abstract: Recent studies have extended the use of the stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation to include complex variables for deriving quantum mechanical equations. However, these studies often assume that it is valid to apply the HJB equation directly to complex numbers, an approach that overlooks the fundamental problem of comparing complex numbers to find optimal controls. This paper explores how to correctly apply the HJB equation in the context of complex variables. Our findings significantly reevaluate the stochastic movement of quantum particles within the framework of stochastic optimal control theory. We derived the complex diffusion coefficient in the stochastic equation of motion using the Cauchy-Riemann theorem, considering that the particle's stochastic movement is described by two perfectly correlated real and imaginary stochastic processes. We demonstrated that the derived diffusion coefficient took a form that allowed the HJB equation to be linearized, thereby leading to the derivation of the Dirac equations. These insights deepen our understanding of quantum dynamics and enhance the mathematical rigor of the framework for applying stochastic optimal control to quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Casimir force within Ising chain with competing interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive exact results for the critical Casimir force (CCF) within the one-dimensional Ising model with periodic boundary conditions (PBC's) and long-range equivalent-neighbor ferromagnetic interactions of strength $J_{l}/N&gt;0$ superimposed on the nearest-neighbor interactions of strength $J_{s}$ which could be either ferromagnetic ($J_{s}&gt;0$) or antiferromagnetic ($J_{s}&lt;0$). In the infinite system limit the model, also known as the Nagle-Kardar model, exhibits in the plane $(K_s=\beta J_s,K_l=\beta J_l)$ a critical line $2 K_l=\exp{\left(-2 K_s\right)}, K_s&gt;-\ln3/4$, which ends at a tricritical point $(K_l=-\sqrt{3}/2, K_s=-\ln3/4)$. The critical Casimir amplitudes are: $\Delta_{\rm Cas}^{\rm (cr)}=1/4$ at the critical line, and $\Delta_{\rm Cas}^{\rm (tr)}=1/3$ at the tricritical point. Quite unexpectedly, with the imposed PBC's the CCF exhibits very unusual behavior as a function of temperature and magnetic field. It is repulsive near the critical line and tricritical point, decaying rapidly with separation from those two singular regimes fast away from them and becoming attractive, displaying in which the maximum amplitude of the attraction exceeds the maximum amplitude of repulsion. This represents a violation of the widely-accepted "boundary condition rule", which holds that the CCF is attractive for equivalent BC's and repulsive for conflicting BC's independently of the actual bulk universality class of the phase transition under investigation.</description>

Abstract: The connection formulae provide a systematic way to compute physical quantities, such as the quasinormal modes, Green functions, in blackhole perturbation theories. In this work, we test whether it is possible to consistently take the collision limit, which bring two or more regular singularities into an irregular one, of the connection formulae, and we provide some supportive evidence for it.</description>
