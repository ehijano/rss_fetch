      <title>xMem: A CPU-Based Approach for Accurate Estimation of GPU Memory in Deep Learning Training Workloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global scarcity of GPUs necessitates more sophisticated strategies for Deep Learning jobs in shared cluster environments. Accurate estimation of how much GPU memory a job will require is fundamental to enabling advanced scheduling and GPU sharing, which helps prevent out-of-memory (OOM) errors and resource underutilization. However, existing estimation methods have limitations. Approaches relying on static analysis or historical data with machine learning often fail to accurately capture runtime dynamics. Furthermore, direct GPU analysis consumes scarce resources, and some techniques require intrusive code modifications. Thus, the key challenge lies in precisely estimating dynamic memory requirements, including memory allocator nuances, without consuming GPU resources and non-intrusive code changes. To address this challenge, we propose xMem, a novel framework that leverages CPU-only dynamic analysis to accurately estimate peak GPU memory requirements a priori. We conducted a thorough evaluation of xMem against state-of-the-art solutions using workloads from 25 different models, including architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks and Transformers. The analysis of 5209 runs, which includes ANOVA and Monte Carlo results, highlights xMem's benefits: it decreases the median relative error by 91% and significantly reduces the probability of estimation failure as safe OOM thresholds by 75%, meaning that the estimated value can often be used directly without causing OOM. Ultimately, these improvements lead to a 368% increase in memory conservation potential over current solutions.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Mobile Inference through Fine-Grained CPU-GPU Co-Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks on mobile devices is increasingly important but remains challenging due to limited computing resources. On the other hand, their unified memory architecture and narrower gap between CPU and GPU performance provide an opportunity to reduce inference latency by assigning tasks to both CPU and GPU. The main obstacles for such collaborative execution are the significant synchronization overhead required to combine partial results, and the difficulty of predicting execution times of tasks assigned to CPU and GPU (due to the dynamic selection of implementations and parallelism level). To overcome these obstacles, we propose both a lightweight synchronization mechanism based on OpenCL fine-grained shared virtual memory (SVM) and machine learning models to accurately predict execution times. Notably, these models capture the performance characteristics of GPU kernels and account for their dispatch times. A comprehensive evaluation on four mobile platforms shows that our approach can quickly select CPU-GPU co-execution strategies achieving up to 1.89x speedup for linear layers and 1.75x speedup for convolutional layers (close to the achievable maximum values of 2.01x and 1.87x, respectively, found by exhaustive grid search on a Pixel~5 smartphone).</description>

      <title>GreenMalloc: Allocator Optimisation for Industrial Workloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present GreenMalloc, a multi objective search-based framework for automatically configuring memory allocators. Our approach uses NSGA II and rand_malloc as a lightweight proxy benchmarking tool. We efficiently explore allocator parameters from execution traces and transfer the best configurations to gem5, a large system simulator, in a case study on two allocators: the GNU C/CPP compiler's glibc malloc and Google's TCMalloc. Across diverse workloads, our empirical results show up to 4.1 percantage reduction in average heap usage without loss of runtime efficiency; indeed, we get a 0.25 percantage reduction.</description>

      <title>Selective Parallel Loading of Large-Scale Compressed Graphs with ParaGrapher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19735v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Comprehensive evaluation is one of the basis of experimental science. In High-Performance Graph Processing, a thorough evaluation of contributions becomes more achievable by supporting common input formats over different frameworks. However, each framework creates its specific format, which may not support reading large-scale real-world graph datasets. This shows a demand for high-performance libraries capable of loading graphs to (i) accelerate designing new graph algorithms, (ii) to evaluate the contributions on a wide range of graph algorithms, and (iii) to facilitate easy and fast comparison over different graph frameworks.
  To that end, we present ParaGrapher, a high-performance API and library for loading large-scale and compressed graphs. ParaGrapher supports different types of requests for accessing graphs in shared- and distributed-memory and out-of-core graph processing. We explain the design of ParaGrapher and present a performance model of graph decompression, which is used for evaluation of ParaGrapher over three storage types. Our evaluation shows that by decompressing compressed graphs in WebGraph format, ParaGrapher delivers up to 3.2 times speedup in loading and up to 5.2 times speedup in end-to-end execution in comparison to the binary and textual formats.
  ParaGrapher is available online on https://blogs.qub.ac.uk/DIPSA/ParaGrapher/.</description>
