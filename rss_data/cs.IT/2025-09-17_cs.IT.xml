      <title>Exploring the entropic region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper explores three known methods, their variants and limitations, that can be used to obtain new entropy inequalities. The Copy Lemma was distilled from the original Zhang-Yeung construction which produced the first non-Shannon inequality. Its iterated version, effects of symmetrizations, and connections with polyhedral vertex enumeration are discussed. Another method, derived from the principle of maximum entropy, has the Copy Lemma as a special case. Nevertheless, none of the two presented variants is known to generate more inequalities than the iterated Copy Lemma. Finally, the Ahlswede-K\"orner method is shown to employ a hidden application of the Copy Lemma - the underlying lemma alone cannot generate new inequalities -, which makes this method strictly weaker than the Copy Lemma. The paper is written in a tutorial style and concludes with a list of open questions and research problems.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) offers a new solution for the evolution of wireless transceiver architecture, promising unprecedented sensitivity and immunity to thermal noise. However, RAQRs introduce a unique non-linear signal model based on biased phase retrieval, which complicates fundamental channel estimation tasks. Traditional iterative algorithms often struggle in low signal-to-noise regimes and fail to capture complex and non-ideal system characteristics. To address this, we propose a novel model-driven deep learning framework for channel estimation in RAQRs. Specifically, we propose a Transformer-based unrolling architecture, termed URformer, which is derived by unrolling a stabilized variant of the expectation-maximization Gerchberg-Saxton (EM-GS) algorithm. Specifically, each layer of the proposed URformer incorporates three trainable modules: 1) a learnable filter implemented by a neural network that replaces the fixed Bessel function ratio in the classic EM-GS algorithm; 2) a trainable gating mechanism that adaptively combines classic and model-based updates to ensure training stability; and 3) a efficient channel Transformer block that learns to correct residual errors by capturing non-local dependencies across the channel matrix. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed URformer significantly outperforms classic iterative algorithms and conventional black-box neural networks with less pilot overhead.</description>

      <title>Three Classes of Twisted Gabidulin Codes with Different Twists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted Gabidulin codes are an extension of Gabidulin codes and have recently attracted great attention. In this paper, we study three classes of twisted Gabidulin codes with different twists. Moreover, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for them to be maximum rank distance (MRD) codes, determine the conditions under which they are not MRD codes, and construct several classes of MRD codes via twisted Gabidulin codes. In addition, considering these codes in the Hamming metric, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for them to be maximum distance separable (MDS), almost MDS, or near MDS. Finally, we investigate the covering radii and deep holes of twisted Gabidulin codes.</description>

      <title>Linear Complexity Computation of Code Distance and Minimum Size of Trapping Sets for LDPC Codes with Bounded Treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that, given \(b\ge 0\), finding an $(a,b)$-trapping set with the minimum \(a\) in a binary linear code is NP-hard. In this paper, we demonstrate that this problem can be solved with linear complexity with respect to the code length for codes with bounded treewidth. Furthermore, suppose a tree decomposition corresponding to the treewidth of the binary linear code is known. In that case, we also provide a specific algorithm to compute the minimum \(a\) and the number of the corresponding \((a, b)\)-trapping sets for a given \(b\) with linear complexity. Simulation experiments are presented to verify the correctness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Sharp mean-field analysis of permutation mixtures and permutation-invariant decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop sharp bounds on the statistical distance between high-dimensional permutation mixtures and their i.i.d. counterparts. Our approach establishes a new geometric link between the spectrum of a complex channel overlap matrix and the information geometry of the channel, yielding tight dimension-independent bounds that close gaps left by previous work. Within this geometric framework, we also derive dimension-dependent bounds that uncover phase transitions in dimensionality for Gaussian and Poisson families. Applied to compound decision problems, this refined control of permutation mixtures enables sharper mean-field analyses of permutation-invariant decision rules, yielding strong non-asymptotic equivalence results between two notions of compound regret in Gaussian and Poisson models.</description>

      <title>Sustainable LSTM-Based Precoding for RIS-Aided mmWave MIMO Systems with Implicit CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a sustainable long short-term memory (LSTM)-based precoding framework for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems. Instead of explicit channel state information (CSI) estimation, the framework exploits uplink pilot sequences to implicitly learn channel characteristics, reducing both pilot overhead and inference complexity. Practical hardware constraints are addressed by incorporating the phase-dependent amplitude model of RIS elements, while a multi-label training strategy improves robustness when multiple near-optimal codewords yield comparable performance. Simulations show that the proposed design achieves over 90% of the spectral efficiency of exhaustive search (ES) with only 2.2% of its computation time, cutting energy consumption by nearly two orders of magnitude. The method also demonstrates resilience under distribution mismatch and scalability to larger RIS arrays, making it a practical and energy-efficient solution for sustainable 6G wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Low-Altitude UAV Tracking via Sensing-Assisted Predictive Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensing-assisted predictive beamforming, as one of the enabling technologies for emerging integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) paradigm, shows significant promise for enhancing various future unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications. However, current works predominately emphasized on spectral efficiency enhancement, while the impact of such beamforming techniques on the communication reliability was largely unexplored and challenging to characterize. To fill this research gap and tackle this issue, this paper investigates outage capacity maximization for UAV tracking under the sensing-assisted predictive beamforming scheme. Specifically, a cellular-connected UAV tracking scheme is proposed leveraging extended Kalman filtering (EKF), where the predicted UAV trajectory, sensing duration ratio, and target constant received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are jointly optimized to maximize the outage capacity at each time slot. To address the implicit nature of the objective function, closed-form approximations of the outage probabilities (OPs) at both prediction and measurement stages of each time slot are proposed based on second-order Taylor expansions, providing an efficient and full characterization of outage capacity. Subsequently, an efficient algorithm is proposed based on a combination of bisection search and successive convex approximation (SCA) to address the non-convex optimization problem with guaranteed convergence. To further reduce computational complexity, a second efficient algorithm is developed based on alternating optimization (AO). Simulation results validate the accuracy of the derived OP approximations, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, and the significant outage capacity enhancement over various benchmarks, while also indicating a trade-off between decreasing path loss and enjoying wide beam coverage for outage capacity maximization.</description>

      <title>Several new classes of MDS symbol-pair codes derived from matrix-product codes</title>

Abstract: In order to correct the pair-errors generated during the transmission of modern high-density data storage that the outputs of the channels consist of overlapping pairs of symbols, a new coding scheme named symbol-pair code is proposed. The error-correcting capability of the symbol-pair code is determined by its minimum symbol-pair distance. For such codes, the larger the minimum symbol-pair distance, the better. It is a challenging task to construct symbol-pair codes with optimal parameters, especially, maximum-distance-separable (MDS) symbol-pair codes. In this paper, the permutation equivalence codes of matrix-product codes with underlying matrices of orders $3$ and $4$ are used to extend the minimum symbol-pair distance, four new classes of MDS symbol-pair codes and a new class of AMDS symbol-pair codes are derived.</description>

      <title>Chernoff Information as a Privacy Constraint for Adversarial Classification and Membership Advantage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10307v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work inspects a privacy metric based on Chernoff information, namely Chernoff differential privacy, due to its significance in characterization of the optimal classifier's performance. Adversarial classification, as any other classification problem is built around minimization of the (average or correct detection) probability of error in deciding on either of the classes in the case of binary classification. Unlike the classical hypothesis testing problem, where the false alarm and mis-detection probabilities are handled separately resulting in an asymmetric behavior of the best error exponent, in this work, we characterize the relationship between $\varepsilon\textrm{-}$differential privacy, the best error exponent of one of the errors (when the other is fixed) and the best average error exponent. Accordingly, we re-derive Chernoff differential privacy in connection with $\varepsilon\textrm{-}$differential privacy using the Radon-Nikodym derivative, and prove its relation with Kullback-Leibler (KL) differential privacy. Subsequently, we present numerical evaluation results, which demonstrates that Chernoff information outperforms Kullback-Leibler divergence as a function of the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$ and the impact of the adversary's attack in Laplace mechanisms. Lastly, we introduce a new upper bound on adversary's membership advantage in membership inference attacks using Chernoff DP and numerically compare its performance with existing alternatives based on $(\varepsilon, \delta)\textrm{-}$differential privacy in the literature.</description>

Abstract: It is known that sparse recovery by measurements from random circulant matrices provides good recovery bounds. We generalize this to measurements that arise as a random orbit of a group representation for some finite group G. We derive estimates for the number of measurements required to guarantee the restricted isometry property with high probability. Following this, we present several examples highlighting the role of appropriate representation-theoretic assumptions.</description>

      <title>The dimension and Bose distance of certain primitive BCH codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: BCH codes are a significant class of cyclic codes that play an important role in both theoretical research and practical applications. Their strong error-correcting abilities and efficient encoding and decoding methods make BCH codes widely applicable in various areas, including communication systems, data storage devices, and consumer electronics. Although BCH codes have been extensively studied, the parameters of BCH codes are not known in general.
  Let $q$ be a prime power and $m$ be a positive integer. Denote by $\mathcal{C}_{\left(q,m,\delta)\right)}$ the narrow-sense primitive BCH code with length $q^m-1$ and designed distance $\delta$. As of now, the dimensions of
  $\mathcal{C}_{(q,m,\delta)}$ are fully understood only for $m \leq 2$. For $m \geq 4$, the dimensions of $\mathcal{C}_{(q,m,\delta)}$ are known only for
  the range $2 \leq \delta \leq q^{\lfloor (m+1)/2 \rfloor +1}$ and for a limited number of special cases. In this paper, we determined the dimension and Bose distance of $\mathcal{C}_{(q,m,\delta)}$ for $m\geq 4$ and
  $\delta\in [2, q^{\lfloor ( 2m-1)/{3}\rfloor+1}]. $ Additionally, we have also extended our results to some primitive BCH codes that are not necessarily narrow-sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Bounded-Degree Low-Rank Parity-Check (BD-LRPC) code is a rank-metric code that admits a parity-check matrix whose support is generated by a set of powers of an element. This specific structure of the parity-check matrix was employed to enhance the first phase of the decoding algorithm through the expansion of the syndrome support. However, this expansion decreases the probability of recovering the error support in the second phase of the decoding algorithm. This paper introduces a novel method based on successive intersections to recover the error support. This method offers two key advantages: it increases the probability of successful decoding and enables the decoding of a greater number of errors.</description>

      <title>Introducing Meta-Fiber into Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces for MIMO Communications: A Low-Complexity Design with only Two Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs), which integrate multiple programmable metasurface layers, have recently emerged as a promising technology for advanced wave-domain signal processing. SIMs benefit from flexible spatial degree-of-freedom (DoF) while reducing the requirement for costly radio-frequency (RF) chains. However, current state-of-the-art SIM designs face challenges such as complex phase shift optimization and energy attenuation from multiple layers. To address these aspects, we propose incorporating meta-fibers into SIMs, with the aim of reducing the number of layers and enhancing the energy efficiency. First, we introduce a meta-fiber-connected 2-layer SIM that exhibits the same flexible signal processing capabilities as conventional multi-layer structures, and explains the operating principle. Subsequently, we formulate and solve the optimization problem of minimizing the mean square error (MSE) between the SIM channel and the desired channel matrices. Specifically, by designing the phase shifts of the meta-atoms associated with the transmitting-SIM and receiving-SIM, a non-interference system with parallel subchannels is established. In order to reduce the computational complexity, a closed-form expression for each phase shift at each iteration of an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed. We show that the proposed algorithm is applicable to conventional multi-layer SIMs. The channel capacity bound and computational complexity are analyzed to provide design insights. Finally, numerical results are illustrated, demonstrating that the proposed two-layer SIM with meta-fiber achieves over a 25% improvement in channel capacity while reducing the total number of meta-atoms by 59% as compared with a conventional seven-layer SIM.</description>

      <title>Sum Capacity Characterization of Pinching Antennas-assisted Multiple Access Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05309v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pinching antenna system (PASS) has recently shown its promising ability to flexibly reconfigure wireless channels via dynamically adjusting the positions of pinching antennas over a dielectric waveguide, termed as pinching beamforming. This paper studies the fundamental limit of the sum rate for a PASS-assisted multiple access channel, where multiple users transmit individual messages to a base station under the average power constraint. To this end, a dynamic pinching beamforming setup is conceived, where multiple pinching beamforming vectors are employed in a transmission period and the capacity-achieving non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based scheme is considered. For the ideal case with an asymptotically large number of pinching beamforming vectors, the optimal transmission scheme is unveiled to carry out alternating transmission among each user whose channel power gain is maximized with the tailored pinching beamforming. This implies that NOMA is not needed for achieving the sum capacity and the required optimal number of pinching beamforming vectors is equal to the number of users. With this insight, the corresponding sum rate is derived in closed-form expression, which serves as the upper bound of the sum rate. Inspired by this result, a lower bound of the sum rate under an arbitrarily finite number of pinching beamforming vectors is obtained. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and also illustrate the practical significance of using dynamic pinching beamforming to improve the sum rate.</description>

Abstract: Blumer et al. (1987, 1989) showed that any concept class that is learnable by Occam algorithms is PAC learnable. Board and Pitt (1990) showed a partial converse of this theorem: for concept classes that are closed under exception lists, any class that is PAC learnable is learnable by an Occam algorithm. However, their Occam algorithm outputs a hypothesis whose complexity is $\delta$-dependent, which is an important limitation. In this paper, we show that their partial converse applies to Occam algorithms with $\delta$-independent complexities as well. Thus, we provide a posteriori justification of various theoretical results and algorithm design methods which use the partial converse as a basis for their work.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Fault-Tolerance to Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard approach to universal fault-tolerant quantum computing is to develop a general purpose quantum error correction mechanism that can implement a universal set of logical gates fault-tolerantly. Given such a scheme, any quantum algorithm can be realized fault-tolerantly by composing the relevant logical gates from this set. However, we know that quantum computers provide a significant quantum advantage only for specific quantum algorithms. Hence, a universal quantum computer can likely gain from compiling such specific algorithms using tailored quantum error correction schemes. In this work, we take the first steps towards such algorithm-tailored quantum fault-tolerance. We consider Trotter circuits in quantum simulation, which is an important application of quantum computing. We develop a solve-and-stitch algorithm to systematically synthesize physical realizations of Clifford Trotter circuits on the well-known $\llbr n,n-2,2 \rrbr$ error-detecting code family. Our analysis shows that this family implements Trotter circuits with essentially optimal depth under reasonable assumptions, thereby serving as an illuminating example of tailored quantum error correction. We achieve fault-tolerance for these circuits using flag gadgets, which add minimal overhead. Importantly, the solve-and-stitch algorithm has the potential to scale beyond this specific example, as illustrated by a generalization to the four-qubit logical Clifford Trotter circuit on the $\llbr 20,4,2 \rrbr$ hypergraph product code, thereby providing a principled approach to tailored fault-tolerance in quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Approximate independence of permutation mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09341v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove bounds on statistical distances between high-dimensional exchangeable mixture distributions (which we call \emph{permutation mixtures}) and their i.i.d. counterparts. Our results are based on a novel method for controlling $\chi^2$ divergences between exchangeable mixtures, which is tighter than the existing methods of moments or cumulants. At a technical level, a key innovation in our proofs is a new Maclaurin-type inequality for elementary symmetric polynomials of variables that sum to zero and an upper bound on permanents of doubly-stochastic positive semidefinite matrices. We obtain as a corollary a new de Finetti-style theorem (in the language of Diaconis and Freedman, 1987), as well as several new statistical results, including a differential privacy guarantee for the ``shuffled privacy model'' with Gaussian noise and improved generic consistency guarantees for empirical Bayes procedures in compound decision problems.</description>

      <title>Training-free Adjustable Polynomial Graph Filtering for Ultra-fast Multimodal Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal recommender systems improve the performance of canonical recommender systems with no item features by utilizing diverse content types such as text, images, and videos, while alleviating inherent sparsity of user-item interactions and accelerating user engagement. However, current neural network-based models often incur significant computational overhead due to the complex training process required to learn and integrate information from multiple modalities. To address this challenge,we propose MultiModal-Graph Filtering (MM-GF), a training-free method grounded in graph filtering (GF) for efficient and accurate multimodal recommendations. Specifically, MM-GF first constructs multiple similarity graphs for two distinct modalities as well as user-item interaction data. Then, MM-GF optimally fuses these multimodal signals using a polynomial graph filter that allows for precise control of the frequency response by adjusting frequency bounds. Furthermore, the filter coefficients are treated as hyperparameters, enabling flexible and data-driven adaptation. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that MM-GF not only improves recommendation accuracy by up to 22.25% compared to the best competitor but also dramatically reduces computational costs by achieving the runtime of less than 10 seconds.</description>

      <title>Agentic DDQN-Based Scheduling for Licensed and Unlicensed Band Allocation in Sidelink Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an agentic double deep Q-network (DDQN) scheduler for licensed/unlicensed band allocation in New Radio (NR) sidelink (SL) networks. Beyond conventional reward-seeking reinforcement learning (RL), the agent perceives and reasons over a multi-dimensional context that jointly captures queueing delay, link quality, coexistence intensity, and switching stability. A capacity-aware, quality of service (QoS)-constrained reward aligns the agent with goal-oriented scheduling rather than static thresholding. Under constrained licensed bandwidth, the proposed design reduces blocking by up to 87.5% versus threshold policies while preserving throughput, highlighting the value of context-driven decisions in coexistence-limited NR SL systems.</description>

      <title>Vendi Information Gain for Active Learning and its Application to Ecology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10390v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While monitoring biodiversity through camera traps has become an important endeavor for ecological research, identifying species in the captured image data remains a major bottleneck due to limited labeling resources. Active learning -- a machine learning paradigm that selects the most informative data to label and train a predictive model -- offers a promising solution, but typically focuses on uncertainty in the individual predictions without considering uncertainty across the entire dataset. We introduce a new active learning policy, Vendi information gain (VIG), that selects images based on their impact on dataset-wide prediction uncertainty, capturing both informativeness and diversity. We applied VIG to the Snapshot Serengeti dataset and compared it against common active learning methods. VIG needs only 3% of the available data to reach 75% accuracy, a level that baselines require more than 10% of the data to achieve. With 10% of the data, VIG attains 88% predictive accuracy, 12% higher than the best of the baselines. This improvement in performance is consistent across metrics and batch sizes, and we show that VIG also collects more diverse data in the feature space. VIG has broad applicability beyond ecology, and our results highlight its value for biodiversity monitoring in data-limited environments.</description>
