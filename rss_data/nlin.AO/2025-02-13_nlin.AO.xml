      <title>Extreme vulnerability to intruder attacks destabilizes network dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consensus, synchronization, formation control, and power grid balance are all examples of virtuous dynamical states that may arise in networks. Here we focus on how such states can be destabilized from a fundamental perspective; namely, we address the question of how one or a few intruder agents within an otherwise functioning network may compromise its dynamics. We show that a single adversarial node coupled via adversarial couplings to one or more other nodes is sufficient to destabilize the entire network, which we prove to be more efficient than targeting multiple nodes. Then, we show that concentrating the attack on a single low-indegree node induces the greatest instability, challenging the common assumption that hubs are the most critical nodes. This leads to a new characterization of the vulnerability of a node, which contrasts with previous work, and identifies low-indegree nodes (as opposed to the hubs) as the most vulnerable components of a network. Our results are derived for linear systems but hold true for nonlinear networks, including those described by the Kuramoto model. Finally, we derive scaling laws showing that larger networks are less susceptible, on average, to single-node attacks. Overall, these findings highlight an intrinsic vulnerability of technological systems such as autonomous networks, sensor networks, power grids, and the internet of things, which also extend to the realm of complex social and biological networks.</description>

      <title>A universal route from avalanches in mean-field models with random fields to stochastic Poisson branching events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08526v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Avalanches in mean-field models can be mapped to memoryless branching processes defining a universality class. We present a reduced expression mapping a broad family of critical and subcriticial avalanches in mean-field models at the thermodynamic limit to rooted trees in a memoryless Poisson branching processes with random occurrence times. We derive the exact mapping for the athermal random field Ising model and the democratic fiber bundle model, where avalanche statistics progress towards criticality, and as an approximation for the self-organized criticality in slip mean-field theory. Avalanche dynamics and statistics in the three models differ only on the evolution of the field density, interaction strength, and the product of both terms determining the branching number.</description>

      <title>Interacting Particle Systems Modeling Self-Propelled Motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In non-equilibrium statistical physics, active matters in both living and non-living systems have been extensively studied. In particular, self-propelled particle systems provide challenging research subjects in experimental and theoretical physics, since individual and collective behaviors of units performing persistent motions can not be described by usual fluctuation theory for equilibrium systems. A typical example of man-made self-propelled systems which can be easily handled in small-sized experiments is a system of camphor floats put on the surface of water. Based on the experimental and theoretical studied by Nishimori et al. (J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 86 (2017) 101012), we propose a new type of mathematical models for complex motions of camphor disks on the surface of water. In the previous mathematical models introduced by Nishimori et al. are coupled systems of the equations of motion for camphor disks described by ordinary differential equations and the partial differential equation for the concentration field of camphor molecules in water. Here we consider coupled systems of equation of motions of camphor disks and random walks representing individual camphor molecules in water. In other words, we take into account non-equilibrium fluctuations by introducing stochastic processes into the deterministic models. Numerical simulation shows that our models can represent self-propelled motions of individual camphor disk as well as repulsive interactions among them. We focus on the one-dimensional models in which viscosity is dominant, and derive a dynamical system of a camphor disk by taking the average of random variables of our stochastic system. By studying both of stochastic models and dynamical systems, we clarify the transitions between three phases of motions for a camphor disk depending on parameters.</description>

      <title>Rhythmic sharing: A bio-inspired paradigm for zero-shot adaptation and learning in neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08644v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The brain can rapidly adapt to new contexts and learn from limited data, a coveted characteristic that artificial intelligence algorithms have struggled to mimic. Inspired by oscillatory rhythms of the mechanical structures of neural cells, we developed a learning paradigm that is based on oscillations in link strengths and associates learning with the coordination of these oscillations. We find that this paradigm yields rapid adaptation and learning in artificial neural networks. Link oscillations can rapidly change coordination, endowing the network with the ability to sense subtle context changes in an unsupervised manner. In other words, the network generates the missing contextual tokens required to perform as a generalist AI architecture capable of predicting dynamics in multiple contexts. Oscillations also allow the network to extrapolate dynamics to never-seen-before contexts. These capabilities make our learning paradigm a powerful starting point for novel models of learning and cognition. Furthermore, learning through link coordination is agnostic to the specifics of the neural network architecture, hence our study opens the door for introducing rapid adaptation and learning capabilities into leading AI models.</description>
