      <title>SAT-Based Search for Minwise Independent Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proposed for rapid document similarity estimation in web search engines, the celebrated property of minwise independence imposes highly symmetric constraints on a family $\mathcal{F}$ of permutations of $\{1,\ldots, n\}$: The property is fulfilled by $\mathcal{F}$ if for each $j\in \{1,\ldots,n\}$, any cardinality-$j$ subset $X\subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$, and any fixed element $x^\ast\in X$, it occurs with probability $1/j$ that a randomly drawn permutation $\pi$ from $\mathcal{F}$ satisfies $\pi(x^\ast)=\min \{\pi(x) : x\in X\}$. The central interest is to find a family with fewest possible members meeting the stated constraints. We provide a framework that, firstly, is realized as a pure SAT model and, secondly, generalizes a heuristic of Mathon and van Trung to the search of these families. Originally, the latter enforces an underlying group-theoretic decomposition to achieve a significant speed-up for the computer-aided search of structures which can be identified with so-called rankwise independent families. We observe that this approach is suitable to find provenly optimal new representatives of minwise independent families while yielding a decisive speed-up, too. As the problem has a naive search space of size at least $(n!)^n$, we also carefully address symmetry breaking. Finally, we add a bijective proof for a problem encountered by Bargachev when deriving a lower bound on the number of members in a minimal rankwise independent family.</description>

      <title>An Integer Linear Program for Periodic Scheduling in Universities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient scheduling of periodic meetings is a critical challenge in various service-oriented domains, including academic settings, healthcare, and legal consultancy. This study presents a robust Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model to optimize the scheduling of faculty-student meetings. The proposed model incorporates practical constraints such as minimum intervals between consecutive meetings, differing time requirements for undergraduate, masters, and PhD students, and dedicated emergency time slots for unplanned visits. The objective function aims to achieve an equitable distribution of meetings throughout the planning period while prioritizing earlier time slots and seamlessly integrating emergency appointments. To validate the effectiveness of the model, both numerical examples and a case study are examined. The results highlight the ability of the model ability to generate optimal schedules within a computationally efficient framework, leveraging the power of Gurobi optimization software. The model demonstrates significant versatility, extending its applicability beyond academic settings to any scenario requiring periodic scheduling of services, such as patient visits in healthcare or client consultations in legal practices. Future extensions of the model may include dynamic scheduling to adapt to real-time changes in availability and the coordination of schedules across multiple service providers.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Barrier: A Polynomial-Time Polylogarithmic Approximation for Directed Steiner Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Directed Steiner Tree (DST) problem is defined on a directed graph $G=(V,E)$, where we are given a designated root vertex $r$ and a set of $k$ terminals $K \subseteq V \setminus {r}$. The goal is to find a minimum-cost subgraph that provides directed $r \rightarrow t$ paths for all terminals $t \in K$.
  The approximability of DST has long been a central open problem in network design. Although there exist polylogarithmic-approximation algorithms with quasi-polynomial running times (Charikar et al. 1998; Grandoni, Laekhanukit, and Li 2019; Ghuge and Nagarajan 2020), the best-known polynomial-time approximation until now has remained at $k^\epsilon$ for any constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$. Whether a polynomial-time algorithm achieving a polylogarithmic approximation exists has been a longstanding mystery.
  In this paper, we resolve this question by presenting a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves an $O(\log^3 k)$-approximation for DST on arbitrary directed graphs. This result nearly matches the state-of-the-art $O(\log^2 k / \log\log k)$ approximations known only via quasi-polynomial-time algorithms. The resulting gap -- $O(\log^3 k)$ versus $O(\log^2 k / \log\log k)$ -- mirrors the known complexity landscape for the Group Steiner Tree problem. This parallel suggests intriguing new directions: Is there a hardness result that provably separates the power of polynomial-time and quasi-polynomial-time algorithms for DST?</description>

      <title>Greedy Sets and Greedy Numerical Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the change-making problem, we extend the notion of greediness to sets of positive integers not containing the element $1$, and from there to numerical semigroups. We provide an algorithm to determine if a given set (not necessarily containing the number $1$) is greedy. We also give specific conditions for sets of cardinality three, and we prove that numerical semigroups generated by three consecutive integers are greedy.</description>

      <title>Partitions of planar (oriented) graphs into a connected acyclic and an independent set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A question at the intersection of Barnette's Hamiltonicity and Neumann-Lara's dicoloring conjecture is: Can every Eulerian oriented planar graph be vertex-partitioned into two acyclic sets? A CAI-partition of an undirected/oriented graph is a partition into a tree/connected acyclic subgraph and an independent set. Consider any plane Eulerian oriented triangulation together with its unique tripartition, i.e. partition into three independent sets. If two of these three sets induce a subgraph G that has a CAI-partition, then the above question has a positive answer. We show that if G is subcubic, then it has a CAI-partition, i.e. oriented planar bipartite subcubic 2-vertex-connected graphs admit CAI-partitions. We also show that series-parallel 2-vertex-connected graphs admit CAI-partitions. Finally, we present a Eulerian oriented triangulation such that no two sets of its tripartition induce a graph with a CAI-partition. This generalizes a result of Alt, Payne, Schmidt, and Wood to the oriented setting.</description>

      <title>Completely independent spanning trees in the hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We say two spanning trees of a graph are completely independent if their edge sets are disjoint, and for each pair of vertices, the paths between them in each spanning tree do not have any other vertex in common. Pai and Chang constructed two such spanning trees in the hypercube $Q_n$ for sufficiently large $n$, while Kandekar and Mane recently showed there are $3$ pairwise completely independent spanning trees in hypercubes $Q_n$ for sufficiently large $n$. We prove that for each $k$, there exist $k$ completely independent spanning trees in $Q_n$ for sufficiently large $n$. In fact, we show that there are $(\frac{1}{12}+o(1))n$ spanning trees in $Q_n$, each with diameter $(2+o(1))n$. As the minimal diameter of any spanning tree of $Q_n$ is $2n-1$, this diameter is asymptotically optimal. We prove a similar result for the powers $H^n$ of any fixed graph $H$.</description>

Abstract: Dumitru Popa found asymptotic expansions for certain nonlinear recurrences, but left open the numerical evaluation of associated constants. We address this issue. A change of variables involving reciprocals and the algorithm of Mavecha &amp; Laohakosol play a key role in our computations.</description>

      <title>The Selection Problem in Multi-Query Optimization: a Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: View materialization, index selection, and plan caching are well-known techniques for optimization of query processing in database systems. The essence of these tasks is to select and save a subset of the most useful candidates (views/indexes/plans) for reuse within given space/time budget constraints. In this paper, based on the View Selection Problem, we propose a unified view on these problems. We identify the root causes of the complexity of these selection problems and provide a detailed analysis of techniques to cope with them. Our survey provides a modern classification of selection algorithms known in the literature, including the latest ones based on Machine Learning. We provide a ground for the reuse of the selection techniques between different optimization scenarios and highlight challenges and promising directions in the field.</description>

      <title>Maximum $k$- vs. $\ell$-colourings of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00440v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present polynomial-time SDP-based algorithms for the following problem: For fixed $k \leq \ell$, given a real number $\epsilon&gt;0$ and a graph $G$ that admits a $k$-colouring with a $\rho$-fraction of the edges coloured properly, it returns an $\ell$-colouring of $G$ with an $(\alpha \rho - \epsilon)$-fraction of the edges coloured properly in polynomial time in $G$ and $1 / \epsilon$. Our algorithms are based on the algorithms of Frieze and Jerrum [Algorithmica'97] and of Karger, Motwani and Sudan [JACM'98].
  When $k$ is fixed and $\ell$ grows large, our algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of $\alpha = 1 - o(1 / \ell)$. When $k, \ell$ are both large, our algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of $\alpha = 1 - 1 / \ell + 2 \ln \ell / k \ell - o(\ln \ell / k \ell) - O(1 / k^2)$; if we fix $d = \ell - k$ and allow $k, \ell$ to grow large, this is $\alpha = 1 - 1 / \ell + 2 \ln \ell / k \ell - o(\ln \ell / k \ell)$.
  By extending the results of Khot, Kindler, Mossel and O'Donnell [SICOMP'07] to the promise setting, we show that for large $k$ and $\ell$, assuming Khot's Unique Games Conjecture (\UGC), it is \NP-hard to achieve an approximation ratio $\alpha$ greater than $1 - 1 / \ell + 2 \ln \ell / k \ell + o(\ln \ell / k \ell)$, provided that $\ell$ is bounded by a function that is $o(\exp(\sqrt[3]{k}))$. For the case where $d = \ell - k$ is fixed, this bound matches the performance of our algorithm up to $o(\ln \ell / k \ell)$. Furthermore, by extending the results of Guruswami and Sinop [ToC'13] to the promise setting, we prove that it is \NP-hard to achieve an approximation ratio greater than $1 - 1 / \ell + 8 \ln \ell / k \ell + o(\ln \ell / k \ell)$, provided again that $\ell$ is bounded as before (but this time without assuming the \UGC).</description>

      <title>Analysis of Corrected Graph Convolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning for node classification on graphs is a prominent area driven by applications such as recommendation systems. State-of-the-art models often use multiple graph convolutions on the data, as empirical evidence suggests they can enhance performance. However, it has been shown empirically and theoretically, that too many graph convolutions can degrade performance significantly, a phenomenon known as oversmoothing. In this paper, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, based on the two-class contextual stochastic block model (CSBM), of the performance of vanilla graph convolution from which we remove the principal eigenvector to avoid oversmoothing. We perform a spectral analysis for $k$ rounds of corrected graph convolutions, and we provide results for partial and exact classification. For partial classification, we show that each round of convolution can reduce the misclassification error exponentially up to a saturation level, after which performance does not worsen. We also extend this analysis to the multi-class setting with features distributed according to a Gaussian mixture model. For exact classification, we show that the separability threshold can be improved exponentially up to $O({\log{n}}/{\log\log{n}})$ corrected convolutions.</description>
