      <title>Protocol to evaluate the viscoelastic response of a polymer suspension to an active agent via oscillatory shear rheometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microorganisms inhabit viscoelastic environments, where their locomotion can deform polymers and trigger local complex viscoelastic responses. However, a systematic approach to quantify such responses remains lacking. Here, we propose a protocol that maps the shear effect induced by an active agent to oscillatory shear rheometry. The central idea is to establish a correspondence between the mean shear rate generated by swimming and that produced by an oscillating plate. In this mapping, the swimming velocity and active stress are translated into an effective oscillation frequency and strain amplitude. The resulting viscoelastic response can then be evaluated by standard oscillatory rheometry. The protocol is validated using lattice Boltzmann simulations of a squirmer embedded in polymer solutions. Our framework is generic and can be naturally extended to active microrheology, providing a pathway to quantify swimmer-induced viscoelasticity.</description>

      <title>Compression-driven jamming in porous cohesive aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I investigate the compression-driven jamming behavior of two-dimensional porous aggregates composed of cohesive, frictionless disks. Three types of initial aggregates are prepared using different aggregation procedures, namely, reaction-limited aggregation (RLA), ballistic particle-cluster aggregation (BPCA), and diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA), to elucidate the influence of aggregate morphology. Using distinct-element-method simulations with a shrinking circular boundary, I numerically obtain the pressure as a function of the packing fraction $\phi$. For the densest RLA and the intermediate BPCA aggregates, a clear jamming transition is observed at a critical packing fraction $\phi_{\rm J}$, below which the pressure vanishes and above which a finite pressure emerges; the transition is less distinct for the most porous DLA aggregates. The jamming threshold depends on the initial structure and, when extrapolated to infinite system size, approaches $\phi_{\rm J} = 0.765 \pm 0.004$ for RLA, $0.727 \pm 0.004$ for BPCA, and $0.602 \pm 0.023$ for DLA, where the errors denote the standard error. Above $\phi_{\rm J}$, the pressure follows $P \approx A {( \phi - \phi_{\rm J} )}^{2}$, which implies that the bulk modulus $K$ of jammed aggregates is proportional to $\phi - \phi_{\rm J}$. Rigid-cluster analysis of jammed aggregates shows that the average coordination number within the largest rigid cluster increases linearly with $\phi - \phi_{\rm J}$. Taken together, these relations suggest that the elastic response of compressed porous aggregates is analogous to that of random spring networks.</description>

      <title>Surface energy-driven crumpling transition in a thin sheet under compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our common experience, crumpling a sheet requires external compressive force and leads to a random network of folds. However, thin sheets have been theoretically predicted to spontaneously transition from a flat to a crumpled state driven by thermal fluctuations, a phenomenon that has been elusive in experiments. We report the first observation of a similar crumpling transition driven instead by surface energy. Using a sensitive experimental protocol, when we gently compress a thin polymer sheet weakly adhered to a hydrogel substrate it transitions to a self-crumpling state at a well defined critical compression independent of system details. The transition is marked by the percolation of a fold network, and a power law increase in fold density. Most remarkably, the crumpled state shows a tunable order of folds establishing the phenomenon's potential as a simple and scalable technique to do origami with extremely thin sheets.</description>

      <title>Residual Force Determines Surface Tension in Active Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical tension at the interface of motility-induced phase separating active Brownian particles (ABPs) remains an open question. Here, we determine the surface tension by analyzing the spatial distribution of forces at the molecular level in a slab-confined system of ABPs exhibiting high and low density regions separated by a one-dimensional active interface. Unlike previous approaches that evaluate active and interaction stresses independently - often producing near-zero or negative surface tension - we show that on average, interaction forces act antagonistically to active propulsion, reducing the net force experienced by particles. By evaluating the work required to bring a particle to the interface using this total-force framework, we find a positive and physically consistent surface tension. These results reframe the mechanical interpretation of local stresses and provide a generalizable method for connecting microscopic force distributions to emergent interfacial properties in nonequilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Surface-directed spinodal decomposition in binary fluid mixtures on an amorphous wall: A molecular dynamics study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present molecular dynamics (MD) results to discuss wetting kinetics in binary fluid mixtures ($A:B=50:50$) undergoing surface-directed spinodal decomposition (SDSD) on an amorphous wall. Our simulations show the formation of a wetting layer rich in the preferred $A$-type particles and bicontinuous domain morphology in the bulk. In addition, the mixture maintains connectivity between the bulk and the wetting layer through $A$-rich tubes throughout the depletion region. The wetting layer thickness coarsens as a power law, $R_1(t)\sim t^{\alpha}$, with two distinct growth regimes of $\alpha=1/3$ and $\alpha=1$ active for at least a decade. The computed crossover time for $\alpha=1/3 \to 1$ equaled the reported bulk crossover time, and the corresponding crossover length scale $R_c$ agrees well with the expression $\Lambda = \sqrt{2k/\gamma_0}$ given by Scholten et al.~[\emph{Macromolecules}2005, 38, 3515] for bicontinuous domains in aqueous polymer mixtures in the presence of only one dominant length scale. This agreement supports a hydrodynamic picture of diffusive growth for the interconnected wetting layer and bulk domains, where the bending contribution ($k$) of curvature-dependent $AB$ interfacial tension ($\gamma$) governs small-scale coarsening, producing $t^{1/3}$ growth. For length scales beyond $\Lambda$, capillary flows yield the viscous hydrodynamic regime ($\sim t$). Our results show no orientational effects on the domain coarsening parallel and perpendicular to the wall, contrasting many continuum models, including combinations with Flory-Huggins theory.</description>

      <title>Symmetry, Invariant Manifolds and Flow Reversals in Active Nematic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how symmetry, exact coherent structures (ECSs), and their invariant manifolds organize spontaneous flow reversals in a 2D active nematic confined to a periodic channel. In minimal flow units commensurate with the intrinsic active vortex scale, we use equivariant bifurcation theory to trace the origin of dynamically relevant ECSs via a sequence of symmetry-constrained local and global bifurcations. At low activity level, we identify relative periodic orbits, created via a sequence of SNIPER, homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations, whose invariant manifolds provide robust heteroclinic pathways between left- and right-flowing nearly uniaxial states. These result in several symmetry-dictated reversal mechanisms in the preturbulent regime, with and without vortex-lattice intermediate states. In the active turbulent regime, this ECS skeleton persists and organizes chaotic attractors exhibiting persistent two-way reversals. By classifying ECSs through their symmetry signatures, we relate a small set of ECSs embedded in turbulence back to the preturbulent branches, and show that typical turbulent trajectories repeatedly shadow these ECSs and their unstable manifolds, resulting in near-heteroclinic transitions between opposite-flow states. Our results establish that channel confined active nematic turbulence is organized by a low-dimensional, symmetry-governed network of invariant solutions and their manifolds, and identify dynamical mechanisms that could be exploited to design, promote, or suppress flow reversals in active matter microfluidic devices.</description>

      <title>Simple models for the trapping of charged particles and macromolecules by diffusiophoresis in salt gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the trapping of charged particles and macromolecules (such as DNA) in salt gradients in aqueous solutions. The source for the salt gradient can be as simple as a dissolving ionic crystal, as shown by McDermott et al. [Langmuir 28, 15491 (2012)]. Trapping is due to a competition between localisation due to diffusiophoresis in the salt gradient, and spreading out by diffusion. The size of the trap is typically 1 to 100 micrometres. We further predict that at steady state, the particle (macromolecule) number density is a power law of the salt concentration, with an exponent that is the ratio of the diffusiophoretic mobility to the diffusion coefficient of the trapped species. This ratio increases with size and typically becomes much greater than 1 for particles or macromolecules with hydrodynamic radii of hundreds of nanometres and above. Thus large particles or macromolecules are easily caught and trapped at steady state by salt gradients.</description>

      <title>Static Dielectric Permittivity Profiles and Coarse-graining Approaches for Water in Graphene Slit Pores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dielectric response of nano-confined fluids is crucial across technologies and biological systems, yet its calculation and interpretation from molecular simulations are often muddled by unclear boundary conditions. We re-derive the Green--Kubo relation for the spatially resolved linear dielectric response of fluids in planar confinement, explicitly accounting for boundary conditions and showing that equilibrium-derived profiles agree with those obtained from external fields. We identify common misconceptions in the literature and outline how microscopic dielectric behavior can be coarse-grained to connect with experimental observables. Simulations show that water retains a bulk-like dielectric response down to $\sim 1\,\mathrm{nm}$ confinement. The reduced \emph{effective} dielectric response that governs capacitance arises from the placement of the dielectric interface. Using effective-medium theory, we demonstrate that long-range reductions reported in experiments and theory are consistent with bulk-like behavior beyond about $1\,\mathrm{nm}$ from the surface. The effective response naturally maps onto an interfacial capacitance, and the dielectric properties of simulated water are robust across simulation setups and water models, reflecting universal polarization correlations.</description>

      <title>Concentration Matters: Enhancing Particle Settling in Narrow Tilted Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particles are known to sediment faster in containers with tilted walls than in vertical ones, a phenomenon known as the Boycott effect. In this work, we investigate how the tilt angle influences sedimentation in narrow channels across different particle volume fractions. Using particle-resolved computational fluid dynamics simulations, we reveal that there exists a concentration-dependent optimal tilt angle that maximizes sedimentation rates. Furthermore, at large tilt angles, the flow profiles across the channel deviate from the classical parabolic shape. We show that these non-parabolic profiles can be accurately captured by a one-dimensional Brinkman model, providing a predictive framework for understanding and tuning sedimentation in tilted geometries. Our findings demonstrate the potential to control and optimize particle settling by adjusting the channel tilt according to particle concentration, opening new possibilities for design in industrial and laboratory processes.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic Screening in Nanotubes: A Tubular Response Function Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure and transport of electrolytes in nanoscale channels are known to be affected by the electronic properties of the confining walls. This influence is particularly pronounced in quasi-one-dimensional nanotubes, where the high surface-to-volume ratio makes the wall the dominant source of electrostatic screening. For instance, ideal metallic tubes suppress long-range Coulomb interactions between ions exponentially. Yet, there exists no generic framework for evaluating electrostatic interactions in tubular confinement. Here, we introduce tubular response functions - a generalisation of surface response functions that captures how nanotubes with arbitrary electronic properties screen Coulomb interactions. Using this framework, we evaluate the interaction potential of ions confined in a metallic carbon nanotube, treating its electronic properties exactly within a Luttinger liquid model. We demonstrate that the long-range exponential screening characteristic of ideal metals persists in realistic metallic nanotubes, regardless of their electron density. We trace the origin of this perfect screening property to the quantum confinement of electrons along the tube circumference. Our framework opens the way for quantitative descriptions of ionic correlations and charge storage in nanotube-based electrodes, and can be further extended to address confined ion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Local Reversibility and Divergent Markov Length in 1+1-D Directed Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in open many-body quantum systems has highlighted the importance of the Markov length, the characteristic scale over which conditional correlations decay. It has been proposed that non-equilibrium phases of matter can be defined as equivalence classes of states connected by short-time evolution while maintaining a finite Markov length, a notion called local reversibility. A natural question is whether well-known classical models of non-equilibrium criticality fit within this framework. Here we investigate the Domany--Kinzel model -- which exhibits an active phase and an absorbing phase separated by a 1+1-D directed-percolation transition -- from this information-theoretic perspective. Using tensor network simulations, we provide evidence for local reversibility within the active phase. Notably, the Markov length diverges upon approaching the critical point, unlike classical equilibrium transitions where Markov length is zero due to their Gibbs character. Correspondingly, the conditional mutual information exhibits scaling consistent with directed percolation universality. Further, we analytically study the case of 1+1-D compact directed percolation, where the Markov length diverges throughout the phase diagram due to spontaneous breaking of domain-wall parity symmetry from strong to weak. Nevertheless, the conditional mutual information continues to faithfully detect the corresponding phase transition.</description>

      <title>Towards probing velocity distributions in dense granular matter: Utilizing Fiber Bragg Gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Granular gases are commonly characterized through their velocity distribution, which provides access to the granular temperature. In experiments, velocity distributions are typically obtained by particle tracking, which however becomes limited at moderate and high particle densities. As a way forward, we propose a new technique for measuring particle velocities in situ by using a Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensor, which remains applicable at significantly higher particle densities.The FBG sensor detects strain pulses induced by particle-fiber collisions, from which the velocity of the impacting particle can be derived. Applying this method to an ensemble of granular particles allows to extract its velocity distributions as we present for a granular system excited by a vibrational shaker. We validate the extracted velocity distribution against conventional particle-tracking measurements, confirming the reliability of the FBG-based technique.</description>

      <title>Interface Fragmentation via Horizontal Vibration: A Pathway to Scalable Monodisperse Emulsification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a scalable method for producing monodisperse micro-scale emulsions in a rectangular container holding two stably stratified layers of immiscible liquids by applying horizontal vibration. This setup enables the excitation of a single line of ordered Faraday waves along each end wall when viscous forces dominate interfacial dynamics. Our experiments and theoretical modelling show that the critical non-dimensional acceleration for the breakup of the wave tips in a regular array of droplets scales as $N^{-1/2} \omega^{*3/2}$, where $N$ is the kinematic viscosity ratio and $\omega^{*}$ is the frequency of forcing on the viscous-capillary scale. The droplet diameter can be easily tuned by varying the forcing parameters, and the number of droplets generated per cycle is proportional to the width of the container.</description>

      <title>Wetting and Pattern Formation in Non-Reciprocal Ternary Phase Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions are among the simplest mechanisms that drive a physical system out of thermal equilibrium, leading to novel phenomena such as oscillatory pattern formation. In this paper, we introduce a ternary phase separation model, with non-reciprocal interactions between two of the three phases and a spectator phase that mimics a boundary. Through numerical simulations, we uncover three distinct phase behaviours: a quasi-static regime, characterized by well-defined non-equilibrium contact angles at the three phase contact line; a limit cycle regime, with the three bulk phases rotating around the three phase contact line; and a travelling wave regime, featuring persistent directional motion. We complement our numerical findings with analytical examination of linear stability and the wave propagation speed near equilibrium. Our model provides a minimal framework for extending classical equilibrium wetting theory to active and non-equilibrium systems.</description>

Abstract: The ability to precisely control surface charge using charged polymers is fundamental to many nanotechnology applications, enabling the design and fabrication of materials with tailored properties and functionalities. Here, we study the effect of charge regulation (CR) on the interaction between two nanoparticles (NPs) mediated by an oppositely charged polyelectrolyte (PE) in an electrolyte solution. To this end, we employ a hybrid CR Monte Carlo / molecular dynamics simulation framework to systematically explore the effects of pH, salt concentration, and polymer chain length on NP surface charge behavior. For comparison, we also conduct molecular simulations under constant charge (CC) conditions. Our results reveal that CR enhances PE adsorption onto NP surfaces compared to the CC case, where polymer bridging dominates across a wide range of NP intersurface separations. This enhanced adsorption under CR leads to a weak net repulsion driven by osmotic forces. In contrast, the CC model yields a stronger net attraction due to the bridging force. Furthermore, we find that the CR effects are more pronounced at low salt concentration, whereas at high salt concentration, counterion screening dominates in both CR and CC cases, diminishing the CR effect. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating charge regulation in characterizing nanoparticle interactions within a complex biochemical environment, particularly in low salt concentrations.</description>

      <title>Effective permeability conditions for diffusive transport through impermeable membranes with gaps</title>

Abstract: Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of industrial and biological applications. The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture.</description>

      <title>Capillarity in Stationary Random Granular Media: Distribution-Aware Screening and Quantitative Supercell Sizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a quantitative framework to determine the minimal periodic supercell required for representative simulations of capillarity-screened Darcy flow in stationary random, polydisperse granular media. The microstructure is characterized by two-point statistics (covariance and spectral density) that govern finite-size fluctuations. Capillarity is modeled as a screened, modified-Helmholtz problem with phase-dependent transport under periodic boundary conditions; periodic homogenization yields an apparent conductivity, an apparent screening parameter, and a macroscopic capillary decay length. Because screening imparts a spatial low-pass response, we introduce a distribution-aware treatment of polydispersity consisting of a capillarity-weighted volume fraction and a screened analogue of the integral range that preserves variance units and recovers classical descriptors in the appropriate limits. These descriptors lead to two sizing rules: (i) a length criterion on the shortest cell edge controlled by a microstructural correlation length, the macroscopic decay length, and a high quantile of grain size; and (ii) a volume criterion that links the target coefficient of variation to the screened integral range and the phase contrast. The framework couples statistical microstructure information to capillary response and yields reproducible, distribution-aware supercell selection for image-based finite-element or fast-Fourier-transform solvers.</description>

      <title>Structural and Compositional Complexities of Hierarchical Self-Assembly: a Hypergraph Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Programmable self-assembly enables the construction of complex molecular, supramolecular, and crystalline architectures from well-designed building blocks. We introduce a hypergraph-based formalism, Blocks &amp; Bonds (B&amp;B), that generalizes classical chemical graph theory by incorporating directed and multicolored interactions, internal symmetries, and hierarchical organization. Within this framework, we develop the Structure Code (SC), a compact and versatile language for describing self-assembled architectures. We define a Kolmogorov-style Structural Complexity as the total information content of SC, obtained through its tokenization and Shannon information assignment. Complementing this encoding-based measure, we introduce a much simpler quantity, the Compositional Complexity, which depends only on the number and cumulative usage of block and bond types in the construction set. A central result of this work is a strong empirical correlation between the token-based Structural Complexity and the Compositional Complexity across all examined systems. Owing to this agreement, the Compositional Complexity emerges as the most practical and broadly applicable measure: it is easy to compute, requires no explicit encoding, and yet closely tracks the actual information content of structurally diverse architectures. Applications to molecular systems (ethylene glycol, glucose), DNA-origami lattices, and crystalline assemblies show that B\&amp;B hypergraphs provide a unified, scalable, and information-efficient representation of structural organization, naturally capturing symmetry, modularity, and stereochemistry. This framework establishes a quantitative foundation for complexity-aware classification and inverse design of programmable matter.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Topological Defects in Ferroelectric Nematic Fluids</title>

Abstract: Field theories predict that phase transitions sequentially breaking continuous and discrete symmetries can generate hybrid topological structures in which defects of different dimensionalities merge. We report experimental and numerical studies of hybrid defects in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, which undergo a cascaded transition from isotropic liquid to a high-symmetry apolar, and then to a low-symmetry polar nematic phase. By imposing surface anchoring to preset disclination configurations, we directly track the transformation of topological defects across the transition. We show that simple disclinations reproducibly evolve into complex hybrid states, including domain walls terminated by surface disclinations, domain walls decorated with monopoles, and merons-mediated boojums and monopoles. These results provide definitive experimental validation of hybrid defects in a soft matter system and establish ferroelectric nematics as a model platform for exploring and engineering polar defect structures.</description>

      <title>Onsager Condensation in Chiral Active Matter: Universality of Supersonic Topological Gas Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01884v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To explain how dissipative active turbulence sustains inertial cascades, we construct a chiral model mapping overdamped agents to supersonic topological gas dynamics. Here, Mach cones function as acoustic horizons, shielding defect cores from the sound radiation of shallow water flows. We show that disorder activates a topological heat pump driving an inverse cascade toward a negative-temperature Onsager dipole, unless arrested into a vortex glass by insufficient dispersion. This mapping identifies a universality class unifying active swarms with the statistical mechanics of classical inviscid fluids.</description>

      <title>Memory-induced current reversal of Brownian motors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kinetics of biological motors such as kinesin or dynein is notably influenced by viscoelastic intracellular environment. The characteristic relaxation time of the cytosol is not separable from the colloidal timescale and therefore their dynamics is inherently non-Markovian. In this paper we consider a variant of a Brownian motor model, namely a Brownian ratchet immersed in a correlated thermal bath and analyze how memory influences its dynamics. In particular, we demonstrate the memory-induced current reversal effect and explain this phenomenon by applying the effective mass approximation as well as uncovering the memory-induced dynamical localization of the motor trajectories in the phase space. Our results reveal new aspects of the role of memory in microscopic systems out of thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Linearized instability of Couette flow in stress-power law fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the linearized stability of plane Couette flow for stress-power law fluids, which exhibit non-monotonic stress-strain rate behavior. The constitutive model is derived from a thermodynamic framework using a non-convex rate of dissipation potential. Under velocity boundary conditions, the system may admit three steady-state solutions. Linearized stability analysis reveals that the two solutions on ascending constitutive branches are unconditionally stable, while the solution on the descending branch is unconditionally unstable. For mixed traction-velocity boundary conditions, the base state is unique. Stability depends solely on whether the prescribed traction lies on an ascending (stable) or descending (unstable) branch of the constitutive curve. The results demonstrate that flow stability in these complex fluids is fundamentally governed by both boundary conditions and constitutive non-monotonicity.</description>
