      <title>The Existence and Role of Quantum-State Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.0130</link>
      <description>arXiv:1005.0130v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The key observation about quantum reality is that it often appears as if, at some moment, the probability of a quantum event becomes a definite outcome for us. A careful analysis suggests, however, that what we perceive as a definite state -- the observed outcome of a quantum experiment -- is not strictly definite. From this, we conclude that the quantum world is active: its influence extends beyond a merely statistical and permanently fixed determination of reality as we experience it.</description>

      <title>Excited states of coherent harmonic qubits with long-range photon coupling and dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that ensembles of interacting oscillators or qubits can exhibit the phenomenon of quantum synchronization. In this work we consider a set of $N$ identical two-state systems that we call ``harmonic qubits'', because the kinetic part of their Hamiltonian is of the form $\omega_0 \sum_i a^\dagger_i a_i$, coupled through a multi-state ``photon'' mode subject to dissipation. It has been proven numerically that when the coupling between the qubits and the photon is sufficiently strong, the ensemble condenses into a ground state with negative energy, the energy gap is proportional to $N$ and there are clear cross correlations $\langle a^\dagger_i a_j \rangle$. Here we are interested into the energy spectrum of the excited states of this system. In order to obtain information on the coherent transitions we introduce a weak coupling of each qubit with an external oscillator of variable frequency $\omega$ and we check via Monte Carlo time evolution for which values of $\omega$ variations in the occupation of the external oscillator occur. After adding a second external oscillator coupled to the first only through the $N$ qubits, we also look at the energy transfer between the two external oscillators in dependence on their frequency, a transfer which is possible only through the excited states of the qubits. Above threshold (when $E_0&lt;0$) we find resonant transfer at frequencies which are definitely higher, and growing with $N$. This signals the presence of collective excited states, separated by large energy gaps, which are absent below threshold.</description>

      <title>Simple and accurate complete elliptic integrals for the full range of modulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17159v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complete elliptic integral of the first and second kind, K(k) and E(k), appear in a multitude of physics and engineering applications. Because there is no known closed-form, the exact values have to be computed numerically. Here, approximations for the integrals are proposed based on their asymptotic behaviors. An inverse of K is also presented. As a result, the proposed K(k) and E(k) reproduce the exact analytical forms both in the zero and asymptotic limits, while in the mid-range of modulus maintain average error of 0.06% and 0.01% respectively. The key finding is the ability to compute the integrals with exceptional accuracy on both limits of elliptical conditions. An accuracy of 1 in 1,000 should be sufficient for practical or prototyping engineering and architecture designs. The simplicity should facilitate discussions of advanced physics topics in introductory physics classes, and enable broader collaborations among researchers from other fields of expertise. For example, the phase space of energy-conserving nonlinear pendulum using only elementary functions is discussed. The proposed inverse of K is shown to be Never Failing Newton Initialization and is an important step for the computation of the exact inverse. An algorithm based on Arithmetic-Geometric Mean for computing exact integrals and their derivatives are also presented, which should be useful in a platform that special functions are not accessible such as web-based and firmware developments. Comparisons with sharp bounds from the mathematical inequalities literature further highlight the competitiveness of the proposed approximations.</description>
