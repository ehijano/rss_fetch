      <title>Early Light Curve Excess in Type IIb Supernovae Observed by the ATLAS Survey: Qualitative Constraints on Progenitor Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type IIb supernovae (SNe IIb) often exhibit an early light curve excess (EE) preceding the main peak powered by radioactive nickel decay. The physical origin of this early emission remains an open question. Among the proposed scenarios, shock cooling emission-resulting from the interaction between the shockwave and extended envelopes-is considered the most plausible mechanism. The frequency of these events remains unconstrained. This study aims to quantify the frequency of EE in SNe IIb and investigate its physical origin by analyzing optical light curves from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey. We selected 74 SNe IIb from 153 spectroscopically classified events in the Transient Name Server (TNS) database, observed by ATLAS, with peak fluxes exceeding 150 {\mu}Jy and explosion epoch uncertainties lower than six days. Using light curve model fitting and outlier analysis, we identified SNe IIb exhibiting EE and analyzed their photometric properties. We found 21 SNe IIb with EE, corresponding to a frequency of approximately 28-40%, with the higher value obtained under the most stringent data cuts. The EE's duration and color evolution are consistent with shock cooling in extended hydrogen-rich envelopes. We also found that EE SNe IIb have longer rise times and faster post-peak decline rates than non-EE SNe IIb, while both groups share similar peak absolute magnitudes. Our findings suggest that EE and non-EE SNe IIb likely share similar initial progenitor masses but differ in ejecta mass properties, potentially due to varying degrees of binary interaction. This study provides constraints on the evolutionary pathways of SNe IIb progenitors as compact stars with and without extended hydrogen envelopes.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Oscillations in Core-Collapse Supernovae and Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate neutrino transport is crucial for reliably modeling explosive astrophysical events like core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and neutron star mergers (NSMs). However, in these extremely neutrino-dense systems, flavor oscillations exhibit challenging nonlinear effects rooted in neutrino-neutrino forward scattering. Evidence is quickly accumulating that these collective phenomena can substantially affect explosion dynamics, neutrino signals, nucleosynthesis, and kilonova light curves. We review the progress made so far on the difficult and conceptually deep question of how to correctly include this physics in simulations of CCSNe and NSMs. Our aim is to take a broad view of where the problem stands, and so provide a critical assessment of where it is headed.</description>

      <title>Gyromagnetic Angular Momentum Interconversion in Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06068v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism for angular momentum (AM) exchange between the crust and core of a neutron star (NS) via the gyromagnetic effect. Using extended hydrodynamics, we model the star by incorporating macroscopic AM and microscopic AM originating from neutron orbital and spin AM. We reveal that macroscopic dynamics in the crust can inform microscopic AM in the core leading to neutron spin polarization, and offer alternative scenario of (anti-)glitches. This work highlights the overlooked multi-scale AM interconversions in NS physics, paving the way for gyromagnetic astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Study of mass outflows from magnetized accretion disks around rotating black holes with thermal conduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine mass outflows from a relativistic, viscous, advective, and magnetized accretion disk around a rotating black hole in presence of thermal conduction. We consider the disk is primarily threaded by the toroidal component of the magnetic field and an effective potential satisfactorily mimicked the spacetime geometry around the rotating black hole. With this, we self-consistently solve the coupled governing equations for inflow and outflow and compute the mass outflow rate $R_{\dot \rm m}$ (ratio of mass flux of inflow to outflow) in terms of the inflow parameters, namely energy ($\mathcal{E}$), angular momentum ($\lambda$), plasma-$\beta$ and conduction parameter ($\Upsilon_{\rm s}$) around weakly rotating ($a_{\rm k} \rightarrow 0$) as well as rapidly rotating ($a_{\rm k} =0.99$) black holes. Our findings reveal that the present formalism admits coupled inflow-outflow solutions across a wide range of inflow parameters yielding substantial mass loss. We observe that $R_{\dot{\rm m}}$ monotonically increases with $\Upsilon_{\rm s}$, irrespective of black hole spin. We also find that for a fixed $\Upsilon_{\rm s}$, when energy, angular momentum, and magnetic field strength of the inflowing matter is increased, $R_{\dot{\rm m}}$ is enhanced resulting the outflows even more pronounced. We further estimate the maximum outflow rate ($R^{\rm max}_{\dot{\rm m}}$) by varying the inflow parameters and find that thermal conduction leads to maximum mass outflow rate $R^{\rm max}_{\dot{\rm m}} \sim 24\%$ for rapidly rotating black hole of spin $a_{\rm k} = 0.99$. Finally, we employ our formalism to explain the kinetic jet power of $68$ radio-loud low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs), indicating that it is potentially promising to account for the observed jet power of substantial number of LLAGNs.</description>

      <title>Polarization Estimation for Radio Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number of polarization estimators have been developed for a variety of astrophysical applications to compensate measurements of linear polarization for a bias contributed by the instrumental noise. Most derivations of the estimators assume that the amplitude and orientation of the polarization vector are constant. This assumption generally is not valid for the radio emission from pulsars that fluctuates from pulse to pulse. The radio emission from pulsars, fast radio bursts, and magnetars can be elliptically polarized, and estimators of the total polarization and absolute value of the circular polarization are used in their observations. However, these estimators have not been formally developed to a level that is commensurate with those of linear polarization. Estimators are derived for circular, linear, and total polarization when the amplitude of the polarization vector is a constant or a random variable. Hybrid estimators are proposed for general application to pulsar polarization observations. They are shown to be more effective at removing instrumental noise than their commonly used counterparts.</description>

      <title>The Correspondence Between Leaky-Box and Diffusion Models of Cosmic-Ray Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The leaky-box model and the attendant concept of path-length distribution of cosmic rays were invented in the mid-1960's. Even though versatile computational packages such as GALPROP and DRAGON with the diffusion approach are now available for analyzing cosmic ray data, the concepts of the leaky-box and path-length distribution continue to be adopted extensively. We show here mathematically that there is a close correspondence between the two approaches: The path-length or resident-time of the leaky-box models are similar to 'impulse response functions' of complex dynamical systems and are intuitively transparent. The results provided by the leaky-box model are valid when used judiciously.</description>

      <title>Core Collapse Supernova Gravitational Wave Sourcing and Characterization based on Three-Dimensional Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present for the first time an analysis of high-frequency gravitational wave (GW) emission from proto-neutron stars (PNS) in core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) that combines spatial decomposition and modal decomposition to both source and characterize the emission. Our analysis is based on three-dimensional CCSN simulations initiated from two progenitors with differing mass and metallicity. We spatially decompose GW strains into five regions and show they are initially largest in the PNS surface layers from accretion and later largest from the Ledoux convective and convective overshoot regions within the PNS. We compute the fractional GW luminosity and observe that the majority of the luminosity moves from the same outer layers to deep within the PNS at comparable times. Using a self-consistent perturbative analysis, we investigate the evolution of the oscillation modes of the PNS. We find that the frequency of the evolving high-frequency component of the GW signal is well matched to the ${}^2g_2$-mode, the ${}^2g_1$-mode, and the ${}^2f$-mode over time. We show that the ${}^2g$-modes emit most of their power in GWs initially from the PNS surface region, but within a few 100 ms after bounce, it is the convective overshoot region of the PNS that emits the most GW power for the ${}^2g_1$-mode. Eventually, the ${}^2f$-mode is the dominant mode producing GWs, and they are emitted primarily from the convective overshoot region. Thus, with three interconnected analyses, we show that, while the GW emission is global, stemming from multiple regions in and around the PNS, we are able to source the dominant contributions to it. We find that high-frequency GW emission from the PNS in CCSNe is more complex than assessed by other methods, and dependent, first emitted mainly by ${}^2g$-modes driven by accretion onto the PNS and later emitted by the ${}^2f$-mode driven by sustained Ledoux convection.</description>

      <title>Properties of low angular momentum general relativistic MHD accretion flows around black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this proceeding, we provide a novel approach to study the General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) accretion flows around rotating black holes (BHs). In doing so, we choose a sub-Keplerian distribution of angular momentum of the flow, which is necessary for the accreting matter to reach the event horizon of the BH. Further, we consider the convergent flow to be confined about the disk mid-plane and is threaded by both radial ($b^r$) and toroidal ($b^\phi$) magnetic field components. For simplicity, we neglect any motion along the vertical ($\theta$) direction, maintaining a vertical (hydrostatic) equilibrium about the midplane. With this, we describe the family of multi-trans-magnetosonic accretion solutions around rotating BHs and examine how the conserved magnetic flux ($\Phi$) and BH spin ($a_{\rm k}$) affect the accretion flow properties. Finally, we provide an insight into the thermal emissions from the magnetized disk for a specific set of accretion solutions.</description>

      <title>Picking-up Local GRB Candidates Based on Their Host Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid identification of candidates of high-value gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), including both high-$z$ and local events, is crucial for outlining subsequent observational strategy. In this paper, we present a model that enables an on-duty astronomer to rapidly identify candidates of local GRBs prior to spectroscopy, provided that these events have been localized at an arcseconds precision. After taking into account the mass distribution of the host galaxies of GRBs, the model calculates the two-dimensional cross-match probabilities between a localized GRB and its surrounding nearby galaxies, and then returns the best match with the highest probability. The model is evaluated not only by the observed GRB sample with redshifts up to $z=4$, but also through the simulated GRB samples. By using the recently published GLADE+ galaxies catalog with a completeness of 95\% up to 500Mpc, along with the NED-LVS catalog, the Precision and Recall of the model are determined to be 0.23-0.33 and 0.75, respectively, at the best performance. A dedicated web service, which will be integrated into the SVOM Science User Support System, has been developed to deploy the model.</description>

      <title>Analytical description for light propagation with the source inside the black hole photon sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photon sphere defines the unstable circular orbit of photons in a black hole spacetime. Photons emitted by a source located inside the photon sphere can be gravitationally lensed by the black hole and have time delays when reaching the observer. These delays may lead to light echoes produced in the light curve if an accretion event in the vicinity of the horizon can be observed. In this work, we present fully analytical formulas with high accuracy to describe the change of the azimuthal angle and the travel time of those photons. By employing the analytical approaches, we find that the time delay between photons emitted from the interior of the photon sphere has a typical time scale of $2(\pi - \phi_\mathrm{S}) u_\mathrm{m}$ with $\phi_\mathrm{S}$ and $u_\mathrm{m}$ being respectively the azimuthal angle of the source and the impact parameter evaluated at the photon sphere, which can provide some clues on the future search for gravitational lensing signatures in the accretion inflow event.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray bubbles from nova super remnants and their contribution to local cosmic ray spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Several new phenomena have been surrounding the area of study of the repeating thermonuclear explosions called novae. For example, recurrent novae have been proven to be efficient cosmic ray hadronic accelerators thanks to the recent observations of RS Ophiuchi by different gamma-ray instruments. Novae have also demonstrated to have the ability to carve large cavities into the Interstellar Medium with parallelisms with the remnants of supernovae. We aim at calculating what is the effect of novae in their surrounding media and to which distances these effects dominate over the average quantities that are measured in the ISM. We calculate the filling factor of novae and their contribution to cosmic ray fluxes using cosmic ray propagation codes. To limit what is the atomic density of the Interstellar Medium (ISM) surrounding the region around RS Oph, we use Fermi-LAT observations of the region. The filling factor of novae in the Galaxy is not significant under all assumptions done in the paper. They do not dominate over the local cosmic ray fluxes, even at the lowest energies, for distances larger than a few parsec. The particle density of the ISM surrounding them is, however, very much modified, lowering it more than one order of magnitude with respect to galactic averages, confirming estimates done using other observatories. As a conclusion, even though at global galactic distances, novae do not seem to be dominating cosmic ray transport, they have the power to modify the conditions of their surrounding ISM over parsec distances.</description>

      <title>Exploring $\Delta$-resonance in neutron stars: implications from astrophysical and nuclear observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the first comprehensive Bayesian inference of neutron star matter, incorporating $\Delta$-resonances alongside hyperons and nucleons within a density-dependent relativistic hadron (DDRH) framework. Using constraints from nuclear saturation properties, chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT), NICER radius measurements, and tidal deformability data from GW170817, we systematically explore the impact of $\Delta$-resonances on the equation of state (EoS) of dense matter and neutron star observables. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of $\Delta$-baryons softens the EoS at low densities while maintaining sufficient stiffness at high densities to support $2M_{\odot}$ neutron stars. This naturally reconciles neutron star radius constraints with the recent observation of the low-mass compact object in HESS J1731-347 while simultaneously exhibiting excellent agreement with GW170817 tidal deformability constraints, reinforcing the astrophysical viability of $\Delta$-admixed neutron stars. Additionally, $\Delta$-resonances are found to populate the outer layers of the neutron star core, which may have implications for neutron star mergers and their cooling. Furthermore, we show that the presence of $\Delta$-baryons might significantly influence neutron star cooling via the direct Urca process. We also investigate quasi-normal $f$-mode oscillations within a fully general relativistic framework, revealing strong correlations between the $f$-mode frequency, neutron star compactness, and tidal deformability. With the inclusion of $\Delta$-resonances and adherence to astrophysical constraints, we obtain $f_{1.4} = 1.97^{+0.17}_{-0.22}$ kHz and the damping time $\tau_{f_{1.4}} = 0.19^{+0.05}_{-0.03}$ s at the $1\sigma$ confidence level.</description>

      <title>Predicted Neutrino Signal Features of Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the neutrino signals from 24 initially non-rotating, three-dimensional core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations carried to late times. We find that not only does the neutrino luminosity signal encode information about each stage of the CCSN process, but that the monotonic dependence of the luminosity peak height with compactness enables one to infer the progenitor core structure from the neutrino signal. We highlight a systematic relationship between the luminosity peak height with its timing. Additionally, we emphasize that the total energy radiated in neutrinos is monotonic with progenitor compactness, and that the mean neutrino energy contains a unique spiral SASI signature for nonexploding, BH-forming models. We also find that neutrino emissions are not isotropic and that the anisotropy increases roughly with progenitor compactness. To assess the detectability of these neutrino signal features, we provide examples of the event rates for our models for the JUNO, DUNE, SK, and IceCube detectors using the SNEWPY software, and find that many of the trends in the luminosity signal can be detectable across several detectors and oscillation models. Finally, we discuss correlations between the radiated neutrino energy and the evolution of the gravitational-wave f-mode.</description>

      <title>Beyond first light: global monitoring for high-energy neutrino astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decades of progress have culminated in first light for high-energy neutrino astronomy: the identification of the first astrophysical sources of TeV-PeV neutrinos by the IceCube neutrino telescope, the active galactic nuclei NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056. Today, the prospect of going beyond first light to build high-energy neutrino astronomy in earnest by discovering many more neutrino sources is hampered by the relatively low rate of neutrino detection and the limited view of the sky afforded by IceCube, the single cubic-kilometer-scale neutrino telescope in operation. Yet, this will not stand for much longer. Already today, and over the next 10-20 years, the combined observations of new neutrino telescopes, larger and distributed around the world, will have the potential for transformative progress. Together, they will increase the global rate of neutrino detection by up to 30 times and continuously monitor the entire sky. Within a new joint analysis network - the Planetary Neutrino Monitoring network (PLEnuM) - we make detailed forecasts for the discovery of steady-state astrophysical sources of high-energy neutrinos. We show that a combined analysis of global data will expedite source discovery - in some cases, by decades - and enable the detection of fainter sources anywhere in the sky, discovering up to tens of new neutrino sources.</description>

      <title>Probing the axial symmetry of gamma-ray burst jets using afterglow polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarisation measurements of gamma-ray burst afterglows provide a powerful tool for probing the structure of relativistic jets. In this study, we revisit polarisation signals observed in gamma-ray burst afterglows, focusing on the effects of non-axisymmetric jet structures. To characterize these non-axisymmetric jets, we adopt a simple elliptical jet head model and investigate how deviations from axisymmetry influence the temporal evolution of polarisation properties, particularly around the jet break. Our results show that the polarisation degree curve typically exhibits two peaks for top-hat jets or a single peak for structured jets, even in the presence of an elliptical jet head. In non-axisymmetric jets, a complete drop in polarisation between peaks is generally absent, and the position angle rotation between the peaks can deviate significantly from 90 degrees. In single-peak cases, the polarisation position angle evolves gradually, contrasting with the constant position angle expected in axisymmetric jets. We also explore the implications of these findings for recent GRB events, including GRB 121024A, GRB 091018, GRB 020813, and GRB 210610B.</description>

      <title>10 Years of Archival High-Resolution NIR Spectra: The Raw and Reduced IGRINS Spectral Archive (RRISA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) is a compact, high-resolution (R~45,000) near-infrared spectrograph spanning 1.45 to 2.45 um in a single exposure. We introduce the Raw and Reduced IGRINS Spectral Archive (RRISA), which provides public data access for all non-proprietary IGRINS data taken at McDonald Observatory's Harlan J. Smith Telescope, the Lowell Discovery Telescope (formerly Discovery Channel Telescope), and Gemini South. RRISA provides access to raw files, reduced data products, and cross-matched IGRINS targets with the SIMBAD, 2MASS, Gaia DR3, APOGEE2 DR17, and PASTEL catalogs. We also introduce version 3 of the IGRINS data reduction pipeline, IGRINS PLP v3, which implements an improved cosmic ray correction, pattern noise removal, and a new flexure correction that reduces telluric residuals. RRISA and supporting information can be found at http://igrinscontact.github.io.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Annihilation from Pulsating Dark Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A strongly self-interacting component of asymmetric dark matter can collapse and form compact objects, provided there is an efficient mechanism of energy evacuation. If the dark matter quantum number is not completely conserved but it is slightly violated due to some new physics e.g. at the Planck scale, dark matter particles can annihilate into Standard Model particles. Even tiny annihilation cross sections are sufficient to create observable luminosities. We demonstrate that these dark matter annihilations can trigger radial pulsations, causing a characteristic time modulation of the luminosities produced. We argue that in this scenario, the spectral features along with the properties of the oscillation can create a unique discovery signal for such objects in the sky.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in the inner crust of neutron stars within the superfluid band theory: Competition between $^1\text{S}_0$ pairing and spin polarization under finite temperature and magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase transitions of matter under changes of external environment such as temperature and magnetic field have attracted great interests to various quantum many-body systems. Several phase transitions must have occurred in neutron stars as well such as transitions from normal to superfluid/superconducting phases and crust formation. In this work, we extend the superfluid band theory, which has been formulated in our previous work [K. Yoshimura and K. Sekizawa, Phys. Rev. C 109, 065804 (2024)] based on the Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) for superfluid systems, into the finite temperature and finite magnetic field systems. As a result of the finite temperature calculations, we find that the superfluidity of neutrons dissapears at around $k_\text{B}T=0.6$--$0.9\,$ MeV, and ``melting'' of nuclear slabs, that is, a structural change into the uniform matter, takes place at around $k_\text{B}T=2.5$--$4.5\,$ MeV. We also reveal that these transition temperatures exhibit a systematical dependence on the baryon densities. By turning on the magnetic field, we find that protons' spin gets polarized at around $B=10^{16}\,$G, whereas neutrons' spin is kept unpolarized on average up to around $B=10^{17}\,$G. Intriguingly, our microscopic calculations reveal that neutrons' spin is actually polarized locally inside and outside of the slab already at $B\sim10^{16}\,$G, while keeping the system unpolarized in total. As a conclusion, we have demonstrated validity and usefulness of the fully self-consistent superfluid nuclear band theory for describing neutron star matter under arbitrary temperature and magnetic field. Critical temperatures and magnetic fields have been predicted for 1) superfluid to normal transition, 2) crust formation, and 3) spin polarization, under conditions relevant to realistic neutron star environments.</description>

      <title>Optical photon-counting observation of the Crab pulsar with Kanata telescope using prototype IMONY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed an optical photon-counting imaging system, IMONY, as an instrument for short-scale time-domain astronomy. In this study, we utilized a Geiger avalanche photodiode array with a $4\times 4$ pixel configuration, with each pixel measuring \SI{100}{\micro m}. We developed a dedicated analog frontend board and constructed a data acquisition system with an FPGA to time-stamp each photon with a time resolution of \SI{100}{\ns}. We mounted a prototype model of the system on the 1.5-m Kanata telescope, intending to observe the Crab pulsar and conduct joint observations with Iitate and Usuda radio telescopes in Japan. We successfully demonstrated that IMONY could image the Crab pulsar as an expected point source and acquire the well-known pulse shape. We found that the time lag between the optical and radio main pulses was $304\pm$\SI{35}{\mu s}, consistent with previous studies.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Black Hole Spin and Plasma Acceleration in Jet Polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the polarization of black hole jets on scales of $10-10^3\,GM/c^2$ and show that large spatial swings in the polarization occur at three characteristic distances from the black hole: the radius where the counter-jet dims, the radius where the magnetic field becomes azimuthally dominated (the light cylinder), and the radius where the plasma reaches its terminal Lorentz factor. To demonstrate the existence of these swings, we derive a correspondence between axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic outflows and their force-free limits, which allows us to analytically compute the plasma kinematics and magnetic field structure of collimated, general relativistic jets. We then use this method to ray trace polarized images of black hole jets with a wide range of physical parameters, focusing on roughly face-on jets like that of M87. We show that the location of the polarization swings is strongly tied to the location of the light cylinder and thus to the black hole's spin, illustrating a new method of measuring spin from polarized images of the jet. This signature of black hole spin should be observable by future interferometric arrays like the (Next Generation) Event Horizon Telescope, which will be able to resolve the polarized emission of the jet down to the near-horizon region at high dynamic range.</description>

      <title>SIROCCO: A Publicly Available Monte Carlo Ionization and Radiative Transfer Code for Astrophysical Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Outflows are critical components of many astrophysical systems, including accreting compact binaries and active galactic nuclei (AGN). These outflows can significantly affect a system's evolution and alter its observational appearance by reprocessing the radiation produced by the central engine. Sirocco (Simulating Ionization and Radiation in Outflows Created by Compact Objects - or "the code formerly known as Python") is a Sobolev-based Monte Carlo ionization and radiative transfer code. It is designed to simulate the spectra produced by any system with an azimuthally-symmetric outflow, from spherical stellar winds to rotating, biconical accretion disc winds. Wind models can either be parametrized or imported, e.g. from hydrodynamical simulations. The radiation sources include an optically thick accretion disc and various central sources with flexible spectra and geometries. The code tracks the "photon packets" produced by the sources in any given simulation as they traverse and interact with the wind. The code assumes radiative near-equilibrium, so the thermal and ionization state can be determined iteratively from these interactions. Once the physical properties in the wind have converged, Sirocco can be used to generate synthetic spectra at a series of observer sightlines. Here, we describe the physical assumptions, operation, performance and limitations of the code. We validate it against tardis, cmfgen and cloudy, finding good agreement, and present illustrative synthetic spectra from disc winds in cataclysmic variables, tidal disruption events, AGN and X-ray binaries. Sirocco is publicly available on GitHub, alongside its associated data, documentation and sample input files covering a wide range of astrophysical applications.</description>

      <title>Fast Transients from Magnetic Disks Around Non-Spinning Collapsar Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22401v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most black holes (BHs) formed in collapsing stars have low spin, though some are expected to acquire a magnetic accretion disk during the collapse. While such BH disks can launch magnetically driven winds, their physics and observational signatures have remained unexplored. We present global 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of collapsing stars that form slowly spinning BHs with accretion disks. As the disk transitions to a magnetically arrested state, it drives mildly relativistic, wobbling, collimated magnetic outflows through two mechanisms: steady outflows along vertical magnetic field lines (''Blandford-Payne jets'') and magnetic flux eruptions. With an isotropic-equivalent energy of $E_{\rm iso}\approx10^{52}\,{\rm erg}$, exceeding that of relativistic jets from BHs with spin $a\lesssim 0.25$, the disk outflows unbind the star, ultimately capping the final BH mass at $ M_{\rm BH} \approx 4\,M_\odot$. Once the outflows emerge from the star, they produce mildly relativistic shock breakout, cooling, and $^{56}{\rm Ni}$-decay emission. Our cooling emission estimates suggest a bright near-ultraviolet and optical signal at absolute magnitude $M_{\rm AB}\approx-16$ lasting for several days. This indicates that disk winds could be responsible for the first peak in the double-peaked light curves observed in Type Ib/c supernovae (SNe) or power another class of transients. The detection rate in the upcoming Rubin Observatory and ULTRASAT/UVEX will enable us to differentiate between competing models for the origin of the first SN peak and provide constraints on the physics and formation rate of accretion disks in core-collapse SNe.</description>

Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are radio signals that last milliseconds. They originate from cosmological distances and have relatively high dispersion measures (DMs), making them being excellent distance indicators. However, the origins of the FRB remain to be resolved. With its wide field of view and excellent sensitivity, CHIME/FRB has discovered more than half of all known FRBs. As more and more FRBs are located within or connected with their host galaxies, the study of FRB progenitors is becoming more important. In this work, we collect the currently available information related to the host galaxies of FRBs, and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis about limited localized samples reveals no significant difference in the median of $\mathrm{DM_{host}}$ between repeaters and non-repeaters. After examining and selecting CHIME/FRB samples, we estimate the local volumetric rate density of repeaters and non-repeaters, accounting for different $\mathrm{DM_{host}}$ contributions, and compare with rates of predicted origin models and transient events. Our results indicate that $\mathrm{DM_{host}}$ significantly affects volumetric rates and offer insights into the origin mechanisms of FRB populations.</description>

      <title>A Counterintuitive Correlation Between Neutron-Star Radii Inferred from Pulse Modeling and Surface Emission Beaming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal X-ray emission from rotation-powered millisecond pulsars, shaped by gravitational lensing and the beaming of the surface radiation, provides critical insights into neutron star properties. This approach has been the focus of observations with the NICER mission. Using a semi-analytic model to calculate pulse profiles, we investigate the effects of adopting incorrect beaming models on the inferred compactness of neutron stars. We demonstrate that assuming a more centrally peaked beaming pattern when fitting data from a more isotropic emitter leads to an underestimation of compactness in the case of two antipodal polar caps. We present a detailed analysis of this counterintuitive result, offering both qualitative insights and quantitative estimates. If the atmospheric heating in the millisecond pulsars observed with NICER is shallow, the inferred radii for these sources could be significantly overestimated, with important implications for neutron star structure and equation-of-state constraints.</description>

      <title>Characterising Candidate Blazar Counterparts of the Ultra-High-Energy Event KM3-230213A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The KM3NeT experiment reported the detection of an ultra-high-energy neutrino with an energy estimate of ~ 220 PeV, the most energetic yet observed. The neutrino arrival direction has a 99% confidence region of 3{\deg} radius centred at RA 94.3{\deg}, Dec -7.8{\deg} (J2000). High-energy astrophysical neutrinos are a crucial messenger for understanding hadronic acceleration processes in the Universe and for identifying the origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. Among the most powerful cosmic accelerators, blazars are proposed as promising neutrino sources. A sample of seventeen candidate blazars located in this region is selected through their multiwavelength properties, and studied using archival data and dedicated observations. One of the candidate counterparts exhibits a radio flare coinciding with the neutrino arrival time, with a pre-trial chance probability of 0.26%. Another candidate counterpart exhibits a rising trend in the X-ray flux in a one-year window around the neutrino arrival time. A third candidate undergoes a gamma-ray flare during the same period. While none of these candidates can conclusively be linked to the neutrino, the implications of a possible blazar origin for the KM3NeT event are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12944v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram's complexities, including quark deconfinement transitions, liquid-gas phase changes, and critical points, using the chiral mean-field (CMF) model that is able to capture all these features. We introduce a vector meson renormalization within the CMF framework, enabling precise adjustments of meson masses and coupling strengths related to vector meson interactions. Performing a new fit to the deconfinement potential, we are able to replicate recent lattice QCD results, low energy nuclear physics properties, neutron star observational data, and key phase diagram features as per modern constraints. This approach enhances our understanding of vector mesons' roles in mediating nuclear interactions and their impact on the equation of state, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the QCD phase diagram and its implications for nuclear and astrophysical phenomena.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBH), while still constituting a viable dark matter component, are expected to evaporate through Hawking radiation. Assuming the semi-classical approximation holds up to near the Planck scale, PBHs are expected to evaporate by the present time, emitting a significant flux of particles in their final moments, if produced in the early Universe with an initial mass of $\sim 10^{15}$ g. These ``exploding'' black holes will release a burst of Standard Model particles alongside any additional degrees of freedom, should they exist. We explore the possibility that heavy neutral leptons (HNL), mixing with active neutrinos, are emitted in the final evaporation stages. We perform a multimessenger analysis. We calculate the expected number of active neutrinos from such an event, including contributions due to the HNL decay for different assumptions on the mixings, that could be visible in IceCube. We also estimate the number of gamma-ray events expected at HAWC. By combining the two signals, we infer sensitivities on the active-sterile neutrino mixing and on the sterile neutrino mass. We find that, for instance, for the scenario where $U_{\tau 4}\neq 0$, IceCube and HAWC could improve current constraints by a few orders of magnitude, for HNLs masses between 0.1 - 1 GeV, and a PBH explosion occurring at a distance of $\sim 10^{-4}$ pc from Earth.</description>

      <title>Detecting kHz gravitons from a neutron star merger with a multi-mode resonant mass detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a multi-mode bar consisting of mass elements of decreasing size for the implementation of a gravitational version of the photo-electric effect through the stimulated absorption of up to kHz gravitons from a binary neutron star merger and post-merger. We find that the multi-mode detector has normal modes that retain the coupling strength to the gravitational wave of the largest mass-element, while only having an effective mass comparable to the mass of the smallest element. This allows the normal modes to have graviton absorption rates due to the tonne-scale largest mass, while the single graviton absorption process in the normal mode could be resolved through energy measurements of a mass-element in-principle smaller than pico-gram scale. We argue the feasibility of directly counting gravito-phonons in the bar through energy measurements of the end mass. This improves the transduction of the single-graviton signal, enhancing the feasibility of detecting single gravitons.</description>

      <title>Quantum maximum entropy closure for small flavor coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum angular moment transport schemes are an important avenue toward describing neutrino flavor mixing phenomena in dense astrophysical environments such as supernovae and merging neutron stars. Successful implementation will require new closure relations that go beyond those used in classical transport. In this paper, we derive the first analytic expression for a quantum M1 closure, valid in the limit of small flavor coherence, based on the maximum entropy principle. We verify that the resulting closure relation has the appropriate limits and characteristic speeds in the diffusive and free-streaming regimes. We then use this new closure in a moment linear stability analysis to search for fast flavor instabilities in a binary neutron star merger simulation and find better results as compared with previously designed, ad hoc, semiclassical closures.</description>

      <title>Implications of latest NICER data for the neutron star equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As an update to our previously performed Bayesian inference analyses of the neutron star matter equation-of-state and related quantities, the additional impact of the recently published NICER data of PSR J0437-4751 is examined. Including the mass and radius distributions of this pulsar in our data base results in modest shifts from previously inferred median posterior values of radii $R$ and central densities $n_c$ for representative $1.4\,M_\odot$ and $2.1\,M_\odot$ neutron stars: radii are reduced by about $0.2-0.3$ km to values of $R_{1.4} = 12.1\pm 0.5$ km and $R_{2.1} = 11.9^{+0.5}_{-0.6}$ km (at the 68\% level), and central densities increase slightly to values of $n_c(1.4\,M_\odot)/n_0 = 2.8\pm 0.3$ and $n_c(2.1\,M_\odot)/n_0 = 3.8_{-0.7}^{+0.6}$ (in units of equilibrium nuclear matter density, $n_0 = 0.16$ fm$^{-3}$), i.e., they still fall below five times nuclear saturation density at the 68\% level. As a further significant result, the evidence established by analyzing Bayes factors for a negative trace anomaly measure, $\Delta = 1/3-P/\varepsilon &lt; 0$, inside heavy neutron stars is raised to strong.</description>

      <title>Axion effects on quark matter and quark-matter cores in massive hybrid stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a three-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model to describe the charge-parity violating effects through axion field, we investigate the axion effects on quark matter and quark-matter cores in massive hybrid stars. The properties of quark matter vary with the scaled axion field $a/f_a$ in a periodic manner, with a period of $2\pi$. Within the range from 0 to $\pi $, axion field decrease the baryon chemical potential of the first-order phase transition, leading to an increase in normalized pressure and stiffening of the quark matter equation of state. The effect of axions on hybrid star matter that includes the hadron-quark phase transition is contrary to expectations. The axion field shifts the onset of the hadron-quark mixed phase to lower densities but slightly softens the equation of state of the mixed phase matter, which also results in a slight decrease in the maximum mass and corresponding radius of the hybrid stars. However, we also find that the lowering of the onset of the mixed phase significantly increases the radius and mass of the quark-matter core in the hybrid star. Therefore, our results indicate with axion effects, a sizable quark-matter core can appear in $2M_{\odot}$ massive neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Bayesian model selection for equation of state of cold neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a computational framework, Bayesian Evidence calculation fOr Model Selection (BEOMS) to evaluate multiple Bayesian model selection methods in the context of determining the equation of state (EOS) for cold neutron star (NS), focusing on their performance with current and next-generation gravitational wave (GW) observatories. We conduct a systematic comparison of various EOS models by using posterior distributions obtained from EOS-agnostic Bayesian inference of binary parameters applied to GWs from a population of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. The cumulative evidence for each model is calculated in a multi-dimensional parameter space characterized by neutron star masses and tidal deformabilities. Our findings indicate that Bayesian model selection is most effective when performed in the two-dimensional subspace of component mass and tidal deformability, requiring fewer events to distinguish between EOS models with high confidence. Furthermore, we establish a relationship between the precision of tidal deformability measurements and the accuracy of model selection, taking into account the evolving sensitivities of current and planned GW observatories. BEOMS offers computational efficiency and can be adapted to execute model selection for gravitational wave data from other sources.</description>
