      <title>Quantum Teleportation using Quantum Candies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Candies or Qandies provide us with a lucid way of understanding the concepts of quantum information and quantum science in the language of candies. The critical idea of qandies is intuitively depicting quantum science to the general public, making sense as most of the research in this domain is funded by the taxpayers. The qandies model is already used to explain the essential concepts of quantum science and quantum cryptography. However, teleportation and related concepts are yet to be explained. Motivated by this fact, we investigate and extend the idea of Jacobs and Lin-Mor-Shapira to explain teleportation using qandies. Here, we explicitly design the teleportation protocol and perform a circuit model using qandy gates. The protocol is successful when the correlated qandies are appropriately pre-shared and use of some local operations at both ends. The model we develop can be a valuable tool for science and engineering educators who want to help the general public to gain more insights into quantum science and technology.</description>

      <title>A computational materials science paradigm for a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) bring the excitement of research into the classroom to improve learning and the sense of belonging in the field. They can reach more students, earlier in their studies, than typical undergraduate research. Key aspects are: students learn and use research methods, give input into the project, generate new research data, and analyze it to draw conclusions that are not known beforehand. CUREs are common in other fields but have been rare in materials science and engineering. I propose a paradigm for computational material science CUREs, enabled by web-based simulation tools from nanoHUB.org that require minimal computational skills. After preparatory exercises, students each calculate part of a set of closely related materials, following a defined protocol to contribute to a novel class dataset which they analyze, and also calculate an additional property of their choice. This approach has been used successfully in several class projects.</description>
