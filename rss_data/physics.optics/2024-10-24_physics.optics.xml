      <title>Directionally asymmetric nonlinear optics in planar chiral MnTiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planar chiral structures possess a two dimensional handedness that is associated with broken mirror symmetry. Such motifs span vast length scales; examples include certain pinwheel molecules, nautilus shells, cyclone wind patterns and spiral galaxies. Although pervasive in nature, it has only recently been found that condensed matter systems can exhibit a form of planar chirality through toroidal arrangements of electric dipoles, known as ferro-rotational (FR) order. A key characteristic of such order is that enantiomorph conversion occurs when the solid is flipped by 180 degrees about an in-plane axis. Consequently, ferro-rotationally ordered materials may exhibit directionally asymmetric response functions, even while preserving inversion and time-reversal symmetry. Such an effect, however, has yet to be observed. Using second harmonic interferometry, we show here that when circularly polarized light is incident on MnTiO$_3$, the generated nonlinear signal exhibits directional asymmetry. Depending on whether the incident light is parallel or anti-parallel to the FR axis, we observe a different conversion efficiency of two right (left) circularly polarized photons into a frequency-doubled left (right) circularly polarized photon. Our work uncovers a fundamentally new optical effect in ordered solids and opens up the possibility for developing novel nonlinear and directionally asymmetric optical devices.</description>

      <title>Wavefront distortions of a laser beam reflected from a diffraction grating with imperfect surface and groove pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A formula for the wavefront of a wave reflected from a diffraction grating with an arbitrary surface profile, as well as with arbitrary non-equidistant and non-parallel grooves was obtained. It was shown that the wavefront of the reflected wave can change significantly when the grating is rotated by 180 degrees around the normal. Surface imperfection and groove pattern imperfection are equivalent for monochromatic radiation; whereas for broadband radiation, the two imperfections lead to similar but different space-time coupling effects. For holographic diffraction gratings, wavefront distortions are the sum of distortions caused by grating surface imperfection and the total surface imperfections of the optics used for writing the grating. The second summand is inversely proportional to the frequency of the radiation used to write the grating. The requirements for the flatness of the optics used to write the grating are always more stringent than the requirements for the flatness of the grating.</description>

      <title>Separating edges from microstructure in X-ray dark-field imaging: Evolving and devolving perspectives via the X-ray Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key contribution to X-ray dark-field (XDF) is X-ray diffusion by sample structures smaller than the imaging system's spatial resolution. However, some XDF techniques report that resolvable sample edges also generate XDF. Speckle-based X-ray imaging (SBXI) extracts XDF by analyzing sample-imposed changes to a reference speckle pattern's visibility. We present an algorithm for SBXI (a variant of our Multimodal Intrinsic Speckle-Tracking (MIST) algorithm) capable of separating these two distinct XDF contrast mechanisms. The algorithm uses the 'devolving' X-ray Imaging Fokker-Planck equation as its forward model and then solves the associated multimodal inverse problem, to retrieve sample attenuation, phase, and XDF. Previous MIST variants were based on the evolving Fokker-Planck equation, which considers how a reference-speckle image is modified by introducing a sample. The devolving perspective instead considers how the image collected in the presence of the sample and speckle membrane optically flows in reverse, to generate the reference-speckle image when the sample is removed from the system. We compare single- and multiple-exposure multimodal retrieval algorithms from the two Fokker-Planck perspectives. We demonstrate that the devolving perspective can distinguish between two physically different XDF contrast mechanisms; unresolved microstructure- and sharp-edge-induced XDF. This was verified by applying the retrieval algorithms to two experimental data sets. We anticipate that this work will be useful in: Yielding a pair of complementary XDF images that separate sharp-edge diffuse scatter from unresolved microstructure diffuse scatter. XDF computed tomography, where the strong edge XDF can lead to tainting streaking artefacts. Sample preparation, as samples will not need to be embedded since the strong XDF edge signal seen between the sample and air can be separated out.</description>

      <title>EP restoration and fast-light edge states in photonic crystal waveguide with glide and time reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) in the propagation states give rise to the emergence of intriguing properties with the divergence of the group velocity. However, there have been no experimental reports due to the necessity of maintaining high levels of fabrication precision and the requisite high group velocity contrast. In our study, we propose a design of photonic crystal waveguide with glide and time reversal symmetry, and derive an effective Hamiltonian for edge states to realize fast-light edge states. We adopt a systematic method to generate EPs in edge states by introducing non-Hermitian perturbations to Dirac points guaranteed by glide symmetry, which ensures that EP modes are free from out-of-plane radiation losses. Then, our study reveals the conditions for the exact EP restoration and provides an analytical solution to offset the EP smoothing due to symmetry breaking, which drastically reduces the group velocity contrast. A good symmetry property of the photonic crystal waveguide allows us to derive the effective Hamiltonian as a simple form, and the EPs can be restored by adjusting the real part of the permittivity. Furthermore, we design a feasible photonic crystal slab waveguide incorporating graphene as the absorbing material, and numerically demonstrate a group velocity reaching $v_g = 3.3c$ near the EP, which is up to 25 times that of the original structure. Thanks to the short periodicity of photonic crystals, it's possible to reach the speed of light in vacuum with group velocity contrasts on the order of one digit. Our study paves an innovative way to manipulate the group velocity of light.</description>

      <title>High-resolution x-ray scanning with a diffuse, Huffman-patterned probe to minimise radiation damage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning objects with a more tightly focused beam (for example of photons or electrons) can provide higher-resolution images. However the stronger localisation of energy deposition can damage tissues in organic samples or may rearrange the chemical structure or physical properties of inorganic materials. Scanning an object with a broad beam can deliver an equivalent probe energy but spreads it over a much wider footprint. Sharp images can be reconstructed from the diffuse implanted signal when a decoding step can recover a delta-like impulse response. Huffman sequences, by design, have the optimal delta-like autocorrelation for aperiodic (non-cyclic) convolution and are well-conditioned. Here we adapt 1D Huffman sequences to design 2D Huffman-like discrete arrays that have spatially broad, relatively thin and uniform intensity profiles that retain excellent aperiodic autocorrelation metrics. Examples of broad shaped diffuse beams were developed for the case of x-ray imaging. A variety of masks were fabricated by the deposition of finely structured layers of tantalum on a silicon oxide wafer. The layers form a pattern of discrete pixels that modify the shape of an incident uniform beam of low energy x-rays as it passes through the mask. The intensity profiles of the x-ray beams after transmission through these masks were validated, first by acquiring direct-detector x-ray images of the masks, and second by raster scanning a pinhole over each mask pattern, pixel-by-pixel, collecting "bucket" signals as applied in traditional ghost imaging. The masks were then used to raster scan the shaped x-ray beam over several simple binary and "gray" test objects, again producing bucket signals, from which sharp reconstructed object images were obtained by deconvolving their bucket images.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast single-photon detection using nanophotonic parametric amplifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated photonic quantum information processing (QIP) has advanced rapidly due to progress in various nanophotonic platforms. Single photon detectors have been the subject of intense study due to their ubiquity in QIP systems, yet many state-of-the art detectors operate at cryogenic temperatures under vacuum and suffer from long dead times. We propose and demonstrate a single photon detection scheme based on optical parametric amplification in nanophotonic lithium niobate (LN) combined with a classical photodetector. We use quantum detector tomography and experimentally demonstrate an efficiency of 26.5% with a 2.2% dark count rate. We show that by improving the nonlinearity-to-loss ratio in nanophotonics and using homodyne detection on a squeezed pump, the detector can achieve 69% efficiency with 0.9% dark count rate. The detector operates at room temperature, has no intrinsic dead time, and is readily integrated in LN nanophotonics, in which many other components of photonic QIP are available. Our results represent a step towards all-optical ultrafast photon detection for scalable nanophotonic QIP.</description>

      <title>Picocavity-enhanced near-field optical microscopy with 1 nm resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) allows for the observation of the optical response of material surfaces with a resolution far below the diffraction limit. A spatial resolution of 10-100 nm is routinely achieved in s-SNOM based on amplitude-modulation atomic force microscopy (AM-AFM) with tapping amplitudes of tens of nanometers. However, optical imaging and spectroscopy of structures that are localized to the atomic scale remain a significant challenge. This can be overcome by combining the field enhancement localized at the atomic-scale structure of the tip apex, namely a plasmonic picocavity, with frequency-modulationAFM (FM-AFM), namely non-contact AFM, in a stable cryogenic ultrahigh vacuum environment. Here, we developed picocavityenhanced SNOM (PE-SNOM) under visible laser illumination based on the integration of a quartz tuning fork sensor with small-amplitude oscillations of 1 nm or less. In addition, the use of a focused ion beam-polished silver tip mounted on the sensor leads to strong field enhancement in the picocavity and ensures minimal background scattering from the tip shaft. PE-SNOM allows us to obtain a material-contrast image of silicon islands on a silver surface with 1-nm lateral resolution, which surpasses the conventional limits of s-SNOM. PE-SNOM paves the way for the acquisition of optical information from atomic-scale targets, such as single photo-active defects and molecules.</description>

      <title>Room temperature spin-layer locking of exciton-polariton nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have unveiled exceptional optical and electronic characteristics, opened up new opportunities, and provided a unique platform for exploring light-matter interactions under the strong coupling regime. The exploitation of exciton-polaritons, with their peculiar hybrid light-matter properties, for the development of spintronic customizable devices that enhance both the information capacity and functionality at ambient temperatures is often suggested as a promising route. However, although TMD polaritons have shown promising potential, the microscopic mechanisms leading to nonlinearities in TMD polaritons are complex and their spin-anisotropy, a crucial requirement for many proposed polaritonic devices, has been missing. Here, we demonstrate the absence of spin-anisotropic interaction in a monolayer WS2 microcavity (at room temperature) and show how spin-dependent interactions can be controlled and spin anisotropy recovered by engineering double WS2 layer structures with varied interlayer spacing. We attribute this phenomenon to a distinctive feature in exciton-polariton physics: layer-dependent polariton-phonon coupling. We use theoretical calculations of the phonon electrostatic potentials finding a drastically different coupling strength for single and double monolayer samples and discuss qualitatively how this explains the observed spin-anisotropic response. This is further consistent with experiments on multi WS2 layer samples and the identification of a critical separation distance, above which an effective single monolayer spin-anisotropic response is recovered, both in experiment and theory. Our work lays the groundwork for the development of spin-optronic polaritonic devices at room temperature.</description>

      <title>On the localisation of the high-intensity region of simultaneous space-time foci</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous space-time focusing (SSTF) is often claimed to reduce the longitudinal extent of the high-intensity region near the focus, in contradiction to the original work on this topic. Here we seek to address this confusion by using numerical and analytic methods to investigate the degree of localisation of the spatio-spectral and spatio-temporal amplitudes and intensities of a SSTF pulse. The analytic method yields, for bi-Gaussian input pulses, expressions for the on-axis bandwidth, pulse duration, and pulse-front tilt (PFT) of the SSTF pulse, and is found to be in excellent agreement with numerical calculations. To provide further insight, we propose a method for determining the transverse input profile of a non-SSTF pulse with equivalent spatial focusing. We find that the longitudinal variations of the peak axial intensities of the SSTF and spatially equivalent (SE) pulses are the same, apart from a constant factor, and hence that SSTF does not constrain the region of high intensity more than a non-SSTF pulse with equivalent focusing. We demonstrate that one possible cause of confusion in the literature arises from the fact that a simplistic method for calculating the pulse intensity exaggerates the degree of intensity localisation owing to its failure to account for the spatio-temporal and spatio-spectral couplings inherent to SSTF pulses.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Optical-to-Microwave Conversion Using Si Photonic Integrated Circuit Ge Photodiodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated circuit technology enables the scaling of circuit complexity and functionality while maintaining manufacturability and reliability. Integration is expected to play an important role in quantum information technologies, including in the highly demanding task of producing the classical signals to control and measure quantum circuits at scales needed for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here we experimentally characterize the cryogenic performance of a miniaturized photonic integrated circuit fabricated by a commercial foundry that down-converts classical optical signals to microwave signals. The circuit consists of waveguide-integrated germanium PIN photodiodes packaged using a scalable photonic wire bonding approach to a multi-channel optical fiber array that provides the optical excitation. We find the peak optical-to-microwave conversion response to be $\sim 150 \pm 13$ mA/W in the O-band at 4.2 K, well below the temperature the circuit was designed for and tested at in the past, for two different diode designs. The second diode design operates to over 6 GHz of 3 dB bandwidth making it suitable for controlling quantum circuits, with improvements in bandwidth and response expected from improved packaging. The demonstrated miniaturization and integration offers new perspectives for wavelength-division multiplexed control of microwave quantum circuits and scalable processors using light delivered by optical fiber arrays.</description>

      <title>Causality and instability in wave propagation in random time-varying media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical model to investigate wave propagation in media with random time-varying properties, where temporal fluctuations lead to complex scattering dynamics. Focusing on the ensemble-averaged field, we derive an exact expression for the average Green's function in the presence of finite temporal disorder, and extend our analysis to the thermodynamic limit. In contrast to spatial disorder, causality prevents recurrent scattering, allowing us to achieve a non-perturbative solution. We identify two distinct propagation regimes: one where the field oscillates with constant amplitude, and another where it grows exponentially at long times. Our findings offer new insights into wave dynamics in temporally disordered media, with potential applications in time-varying metamaterials, dynamic sensing, and imaging in turbulent or chaotic environments.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Cladding Elasticity to Enhance Sensitivity in Silicon Photonic Ultrasound Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound is widely used in medical imaging, and emerging photo-acoustic imaging is crucial for disease diagnosis. Currently, high-end photo-acoustic imaging systems rely on piezo-electric materials for detecting ultrasound waves, which come with sensitivity, noise, and bandwidth limitations. Advanced applications demand a large matrix of broadband, high-resolution, and scalable ultrasound sensors. Silicon photonic circuits have been introduced to meet these requirements by detecting ultrasound-induced deformation and stress in silicon waveguides. Although higher sensitivities could facilitate the exploration of new applications, the high stiffness of the waveguide materials constrains the intrinsic sensitivity of the silicon photonic circuits to ultrasound signals. Here, we explore the impact of the mechanical properties of a polymer cladding on the sensitivity of silicon photonic ultrasound sensors. Our model and experiments reveal that optimizing the polymer cladding's stiffness enhances the resonance wavelength sensitivity. Experimentally, we show a fourfold increase in the sensitivity compared to the sensors without a cladding polymer and, a twofold sensitivity increase compared to the sensors with a cladding polymer of saturated cross-linking density. Interestingly, comparing experiments with the optomechanical model suggests that the change in Young's Modulus alone cannot explain the sensitivity increase. In conclusion, polymer-coated silicon photonic ultrasound sensors exhibit potential for advanced photo-acoustic imaging applications. It offers the prospect of increasing the ultrasound detection sensitivity of silicon photonic ultrasound sensors while using CMOS-compatible processes. This paves the way to integrate the polymer-coated silicon photonic ultrasound sensors with electronics to utilize the sensors in advanced medical imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Chiral Nonlinear Polaritonics with van der Waals Metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the strong-coupling regime, the interaction between light and matter reaches a hybridization state where the photonic and material components become inseparably linked. Using tailored states of light to break symmetries in such systems can underpin the development of novel non-equilibrium quantum materials. Chiral optical cavities offer a promising way for this, enabling either temporal or spatial symmetry-breaking, both of which are unachievable with conventional mirror cavities. For spatial symmetry-breaking a cavity needs to discriminate the handedness of circularly polarized light, a functionality that can only be achieved with metamaterials. Here, we suggest and demonstrate experimentally a chiral transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) metasurface with broken out-of-plane symmetry, allowing for a selective formation of self-hybridized exciton-polaritons with specific chirality. Our metasurface cavity maintains maximum chirality for oblique incidence up to 20{\deg}, significantly outperforming all previously known designs, thereby turning the angle of incidence from a constraint to a new degree of freedom for sub-nanometer precise control of resonance wavelengths. Moreover, we study the chiral strong-coupling regime in nonlinear experiments and show the polariton-driven nature of chiral third-harmonic generation. Our results demonstrate a clear pathway towards novel quantum material engineering with implications in a wide range of photonics research, such as superconductivity and valleytronics.</description>

      <title>Single-Shot Phase Diversity Wavefront Sensing in Deep Turbulence via Metasurface Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free-space optical communication (FSOC) systems offer high-bandwidth and secure communication with minimal capital costs. Adaptive optics (AO) are typically added to these systems to decrease atmospheric channel losses; however, the performance of traditional AO wavefront sensors degrades in long-range, deep turbulence conditions. Alternative wavefront sensors using phase diversity can successfully reconstruct wavefronts in deep turbulence, but current implementations require bulky setups with high latency. In this work, we employ a nanostructured birefringent metasurface optic that enables low-latency phase diversity wavefront sensing in a compact form factor. We prove the effectiveness of this approach in mid-to-high turbulence (Rytov numbers from 0.2 to 0.6) through simulation and experimental demonstration. In both cases an average 16-fold increase in signal from the corrected beam is obtained. Our approach opens a pathway for compact, robust wavefront sensing that enhances range and accuracy of FSOC systems.</description>

      <title>Scale-tailored localization and its observation in non-Hermitian electrical circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anderson localization and non-Hermitian skin effect are two paradigmatic wave localization phenomena, resulting from wave interference and the intrinsic non-Hermitian point gap, respectively. In this study, we unveil a novel localization phenomenon associated with long-range asymmetric coupling, termed scale-tailored localization, where the number of induced localized modes and their localization lengths scale exclusively with the coupling range. We show that the long-range coupling fundamentally reshapes the energy spectra and eigenstates by creating multiple connected paths on the lattice. Furthermore, we present experimental observations of scale-tailored localization in non-Hermitian electrical circuits utilizing adjustable voltage followers and switches. The circuit admittance spectra possess separate point-shaped and loop-shaped components in the complex energy plane, corresponding respectively to skin modes and scale-tailored localized states. Our findings not only expand and deepen the understanding of peculiar effects induced by non-Hermiticity but also offer a feasible experimental platform for exploring and controlling wave localizations.</description>

      <title>Beyond Electric-Dipole Treatment of Light-Matter Interactions in Materials: Nondipole Harmonic Generation in Bulk Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A beyond electric-dipole light-matter theory is needed to describe emerging X-ray and THz applications for characterization and control of quantum materials but inaccessible as nondipole lattice-aperiodic terms impede on the use of Bloch's theorem. To circumvent this, we derive a formalism that captures dominant nondipole effects in intense electromagnetic fields while conserving lattice translational symmetry. Our approach enables the first accurate nondipole first-principles microscopic simulation of nonperturbative harmonic generation in Si. We reveal nondipole-induced transverse currents generating perturbative even-ordered harmonics and display the onset of nondipole high harmonic generation near the laser damage threshold.</description>

      <title>Topological Order in the Spectral Riemann Surfaces of Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show topologically ordered states in the complex-valued spectra of non-Hermitian systems. These arise when the distinctive exceptional points in the energy Riemann surfaces of such models are annihilated after threading them across the boundary of the Brillouin zone. This process results in a non-trivially closed branch cut that can be identified with a Fermi arc. Building on an analogy to Kitaev's toric code, these cut lines form non-contractible loops, which parallel the defect lines of the toric-code ground states. Their presence or absence establishes topological order for fully non-degenerate non-Hermitian systems. Excitations above these ground-state analogs are characterized by the occurrence of additional exceptional points. We illustrate the characteristics of the topologically protected states in a non-Hermitian two-band model and provide an outlook toward experimental realizations in metasurfaces and single-photon interferometry.</description>

      <title>Spatial averaging for light reflection and transmission through cold atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically and computationally investigate the role that the spatial spread of atoms plays in the transmission and reflection of weak light from atom arrays. In particular, we investigate whether coherent wave functions for the atoms' positions leads to different results from a thermal distribution with the same spatial spread. We find that the coherence is not relevant when the light is weak and the electronic states evolve on time scales shorter than the oscillation period of the atoms in their traps. Full numerical calculations and derivations using the sudden approximation show that reflection and transmission agree with the simple averaging over atom positions. For parameters outside these restrictions, the simple spatial averaging my lead to inaccurate results.</description>

      <title>Optical next generation reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks with internal dynamics exhibit remarkable capability in processing information. Reservoir computing (RC) is a canonical example that features rich computing expressivity and compatibility with physical implementations for enhanced efficiency. Recently, a new RC paradigm known as next generation reservoir computing (NGRC) further improves expressivity but compromises its physical openness, posing challenges for realizations in physical systems. Here we demonstrate optical NGRC with computations performed by light scattering through disordered media. In contrast to conventional optical RC implementations, we drive our optical reservoir directly with time-delayed inputs. Much like digital NGRC that relies on polynomial features of delayed inputs, our optical reservoir also implicitly generates these polynomial features for desired functionalities. By leveraging the domain knowledge of the reservoir inputs, we show that the optical NGRC not only predicts the short-term dynamics of the low-dimensional Lorenz63 and large-scale Kuramoto-Sivashinsky chaotic time series, but also replicates their long-term ergodic properties. Optical NGRC shows superiority in shorter training length, increased interpretability and fewer hyperparameters compared to conventional optical RC based on scattering media, while achieving better forecasting performance. Our optical NGRC framework may inspire the realization of NGRC in other physical RC systems, new applications beyond time-series processing, and the development of deep and parallel architectures broadly.</description>

      <title>Quantum Diamond Microscope for Narrowband Magnetic Imaging with High Spatial and Spectral Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum diamond microscope (QDM) is a recently developed technology for near-field imaging of magnetic fields with micron-scale spatial resolution. In the present work, we integrate a QDM with a narrowband measurement protocol and a lock-in camera; and demonstrate imaging of radiofrequency (RF) magnetic field patterns produced by microcoils, with spectral resolution $\approx1$\,Hz. This RF-QDM provides multi-frequency imaging with a central detection frequency that is easily tunable over the MHz-scale, allowing spatial discrimination of both crowded spectral peaks and spectrally well-separated signals. The present instrument has spatial resolution $\approx2\,\mathrm{\mu m}$, field-of-view $\approx300\times300\,\mathrm{\mu m^2}$, and per-pixel sensitivity to narrowband fields $\sim{1}\,$nT$\cdot$Hz$^{-1/2}$. Spatial noise can be reduced to the picotesla scale by signal averaging and/or spatial binning. The RF-QDM enables simultaneous imaging of the amplitude, frequency, and phase of narrowband magnetic field patterns at the micron-scale, with potential applications in real-space NMR imaging, AC susceptibility mapping, impedance tomography, analysis of electronic circuits, and spatial eddy-current-based inspection.</description>

      <title>An integrated photonic engine for programmable atomic control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.06732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solutions for scalable, high-performance optical control are important for the development of scaled atom-based quantum technologies. Modulation of many individual optical beams is central to the application of arbitrary gate and control sequences on arrays of atoms or atom-like systems. At telecom wavelengths, miniaturization of optical components via photonic integration has pushed the scale and performance of classical and quantum optics far beyond the limitations of bulk devices. However, these material platforms for high-speed telecom integrated photonics are not transparent at the short wavelengths required by leading atomic systems. Here, we propose and implement a scalable and reconfigurable photonic architecture for multi-channel quantum control using integrated, visible-light modulators based on thin-film lithium niobate. Our approach combines techniques in free-space optics, holography, and control theory together with a sixteen-channel integrated photonic device to stabilize temporal and cross-channel power deviations and enable precise and uniform control. Applying this device to a homogeneous constellation of silicon-vacancy artificial atoms in diamond, we present techniques to spatially and spectrally address a dynamically-selectable set of these stochastically-positioned point emitters. We anticipate that this scalable and reconfigurable optical architecture will lead to systems that could enable parallel individual programmability of large many-body atomic systems, which is a critical step towards universal quantum computation on such hardware.</description>

      <title>Programmable integrated source of polarization and frequency-bin hyperentangled photon pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17313v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a system of four ring resonators capable of generating programmable polarization and frequency-bin entangled photon pairs on an integrated photonic device. Each ring is pumped with a continuous wave, generating photon pairs with the same polarization in two pairs of frequency bins via spontaneous fourwave mixing. We show that the density operator of the generated state represents a hyperentangled state in the polarization and frequency bin degrees of freedom. We also calculate the generation rate of the state.</description>
