      <title>Physical Insights into Electromagnetic Efficiency of Wireless Implantable Bioelectronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous implantable bioelectronics rely on wireless connectivity, necessitating highly efficient electromagnetic (EM) radiation systems. However, limitations in power, safety, and data transmission currently impede the advancement of innovative wireless medical devices, such as tetherless neural interfaces, electroceuticals, and surgical microrobots. To overcome these challenges and ensure sufficient link and power budgets for wireless implantable systems, this study explores the mechanisms behind EM radiation and losses, offering strategies to enhance radiation efficiency in wireless implantable bioelectronics. Using analytical modeling, the EM waves emitted by the implant are expanded as a series of spherical harmonics, enabling a detailed analysis of the radiation mechanisms. This framework is then extended to approximate absorption losses caused by the lossy and dispersive properties of tissues through derived analytical expressions. The radiation efficiency and in-body path loss are quantified and compared in terms of three primary loss mechanisms. The impact of various parameters on the EM efficiency of implantable devices is analyzed and quantified, including operating frequency, implant size, body-air interface curvature, and implantation location. Additionally, a rapid estimation technique is introduced to determine the optimal operating frequency for specific scenarios, along with a set of design principles aimed at improving radiation performance. The design strategies derived in this work - validated through numerical and experimental demonstrations on realistic implants - reveal a potential improvement in implant radiation efficiency or gain by a factor of five to ten, leading to a corresponding increase in overall link efficiency compared to conventional designs.</description>

      <title>Choice of Reference Surfaces to assess Plant Health through leaf scale temperature monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use infrared thermal imaging to remotely monitor the temperature of the leaves and plant which in turn is an indicative of their health and stress; in particular water stress. A series of experiments were conducted using Fluke TiX580 thermal imager on tomato plants to correlate the leaf temperature to different stages such as healthy, dying/wilted, and completely dead/dry. The leaf temperature was compared to a series of paper-based reference surface temperatures; these are of different colors and some are dry while some are wet. All the reference surfaces were insulated at the bottom ensuring the heat interaction between their top surfaces and ambient only. The surfaces were kept sufficiently far from one another. The healthy leaf temperature was found to be close to that of white dry and black wet reference surfaces whereas the wilted and dying leaves temperature were observed to range between yellow and red signifying that this temperature range can better predict the onset of water stress in the leaves. The completely dead/dry leaves were observed to range between green and blue dry surfaces, respectively. However, most of the dead leaf temperature data was found to be accumulated closer to the green surface signifying green dry surface can better indicate a dead leaf condition. The dying leaves were observed to exhibit 8-10 degree centigrade higher temperatures as compared to the healthy leaves in similar ambient conditions. Temperature-based health assessment provides us with a timely intervention to prevent leaf death compared to the optical monitoring since IR images revealed elevated leaf temperature 2-3 days before the optical unhealthiness (appearance of yellowness on the leaf) was noticed.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic swelling due to hydration constrains anisotropic elasticity in biomaterial fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Naturally occurring protein fibers often undergo anisotropic swelling when hydrated. Within a tendon, a hydrated collagen fibril's radius expands by 40% but its length only increases by 5%. The same effect, with a similar relative magnitude, is observed for single hair shafts. Fiber hydration is known to affect elastic properties. Here we show that anisotropic swelling constrains the anisotropic linear elastic properties of fibers. First we show, using data from disparate previously reported studies, that anisotropic swelling can be described as an approximately linear function of water content. Then, under the observation that the elastic energy of swelling can be minimized by the anisotropic shape, we relate swelling anisotropy to elastic anisotropy -- assuming radial (transverse) symmetry within a cylindrical geometry. We find an upper bound for the commonly measured axial Poisson ratio $\nu_{zx}&lt;1/2$. This is significantly below recently estimated values for collagen fibrils extracted from tissue-level measurements, but is consistent with both single hair shaft and single collagen fibril mechanical and hydration studies. Using $\nu_{zx}$, we can then constrain the product $\gamma \equiv (1-\nu_{xy}) E_z/E_x$ -- where $\nu_{xy}$ is the seldom measured transverse Poisson ratio and $E_z/E_x$ is the ratio of axial to radial Young's moduli.</description>

      <title>Infection fronts in randomly varying transmission-rate media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the geometry and transport properties of infection fronts within the spatial SIR model in two dimensions. The model incorporates short-range correlated quenched random transmission rates. Our findings reveal that the critical average transmission rate for the steady-state propagation of the infection is overestimated by the naive mean-field homogenization. Furthermore, we observe that the velocity, profile, and harmfulness of the fronts, given a specific average transmission, are sensitive to the details of randomness. In particular, we find that the harmfulness of the front is larger the more uniform the transmission-rate is, suggesting potential optimization in vaccination strategies under constraints like fixed average-transmission-rates or limited vaccine resources. The large-scale geometry of the advancing fronts presents nevertheless robust universal features and, for a statistically isotropic and short-range correlated disorder, we get a roughness exponent $\alpha\approx 0.42 \pm 0.10$ and a dynamical exponent $z\approx 1.6 \pm 0.10$, which are roughly compatible with the one-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. We find that the KPZ term and the disorder-induced effective noise are present and have a kinematic origin.</description>
