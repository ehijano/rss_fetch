      <title>Can Moran Eigenvectors Improve Machine Learning of Spatial Data? Insights from Synthetic Data Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moran Eigenvector Spatial Filtering (ESF) approaches have shown promise in accounting for spatial effects in statistical models. Can this extend to machine learning? This paper examines the effectiveness of using Moran Eigenvectors as additional spatial features in machine learning models. We generate synthetic datasets with known processes involving spatially varying and nonlinear effects across two different geometries. Moran Eigenvectors calculated from different spatial weights matrices, with and without a priori eigenvector selection, are tested. We assess the performance of popular machine learning models, including Random Forests, LightGBM, XGBoost, and TabNet, and benchmark their accuracies in terms of cross-validated R2 values against models that use only coordinates as features. We also extract coefficients and functions from the models using GeoShapley and compare them with the true processes. Results show that machine learning models using only location coordinates achieve better accuracies than eigenvector-based approaches across various experiments and datasets. Furthermore, we discuss that while these findings are relevant for spatial processes that exhibit positive spatial autocorrelation, they do not necessarily apply when modeling network autocorrelation and cases with negative spatial autocorrelation, where Moran Eigenvectors would still be useful.</description>

      <title>Anemia, weight, and height among children under five in Peru from 2007 to 2022: A Panel Data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Econometrics in general, and Panel Data methods in particular, are becoming crucial in Public Health Economics and Social Policy analysis. In this discussion paper, we employ a helpful approach of Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS) to assess if there are statistically relevant relationships between hemoglobin (adjusted to sea-level), weight, and height from 2007 to 2022 in children up to five years of age in Peru. By using this method, we may find a tool that allows us to confirm if the relationships considered between the target variables by the Peruvian agencies and authorities are in the right direction to fight against chronic malnutrition and stunting.</description>

      <title>How to Detect Network Dependence in Latent Factor Models? A Bias-Corrected CD Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.00408v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper Juodis and Reese (2022) (JR) show that the application of the CD test proposed by Pesaran (2004) to residuals from panels with latent factors results in over-rejection. They propose a randomized test statistic to correct for over-rejection, and add a screening component to achieve power. This paper considers the same problem but from a different perspective, and shows that the standard CD test remains valid if the latent factors are weak in the sense the strength is less than half. In the case where latent factors are strong, we propose a bias-corrected version, CD*, which is shown to be asymptotically standard normal under the null of error cross-sectional independence and have power against network type alternatives. This result is shown to hold for pure latent factor models as well as for panel regression models with latent factors. The case where the errors are serially correlated is also considered. Small sample properties of the CD* test are investigated by Monte Carlo experiments and are shown to have the correct size for strong and weak factors as well as for Gaussian and non-Gaussian errors. In contrast, it is found that JR's test tends to over-reject in the case of panels with non-Gaussian errors, and has low power against spatial network alternatives. In an empirical application, using the CD* test, it is shown that there remains spatial error dependence in a panel data model for real house price changes across 377 Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the U.S., even after the effects of latent factors are filtered out.</description>

      <title>Was Javert right to be suspicious? Marginal Treatment Effects with Duration Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13969v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify the distributional and quantile marginal treatment effect functions when the outcome is right-censored. Our method requires a conditionally exogenous instrument and random censoring. We propose asymptotically consistent semi-parametric estimators and valid inferential procedures for the target functions. To illustrate, we evaluate the effect of alternative sentences (fines and community service vs. no punishment) on recidivism in Brazil. Our results highlight substantial treatment effect heterogeneity: we find that people whom most judges would punish take longer to recidivate, while people who would be punished only by strict judges recidivate at an earlier date than if they were not punished.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive OOS Evaluation of Predictive Algorithms with Statistical Decision Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11016v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that comprehensive out-of-sample (OOS) evaluation using statistical decision theory (SDT) should replace the current practice of K-fold and Common Task Framework validation in machine learning (ML) research on prediction. SDT provides a formal frequentist framework for performing comprehensive OOS evaluation across all possible (1) training samples, (2) populations that may generate training data, and (3) populations of prediction interest. Regarding feature (3), we emphasize that SDT requires the practitioner to directly confront the possibility that the future may not look like the past and to account for a possible need to extrapolate from one population to another when building a predictive algorithm. For specificity, we consider treatment choice using conditional predictions with alternative restrictions on the state space of possible populations that may generate training data. We discuss application of SDT to the problem of predicting patient illness to inform clinical decision making. SDT is simple in abstraction, but it is often computationally demanding to implement. We call on ML researchers, econometricians, and statisticians to expand the domain within which implementation of SDT is tractable.</description>
