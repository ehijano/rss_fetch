      <title>Dynamics of Topological Defects in a Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupled Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quench dynamics of a two-dimensional Rashba spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate. Our study focuses on quenching the system from a zero-momentum phase to a plane-wave phase. During this quench, topological defects emerge in the form of vortices. These vortices and anti-vortices exhibit a random spatial distribution with equal numbers, mirroring the core principles of Kosterlitz-Thouless physics. In a uniform system, we observe an exponential scaling of both the vortex production time and the vortex number with the quench rate, consistent with the conventional Kibble-Zurek mechanism. The decay of which adheres to a logarithmic law, aligning with experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Experimental particle production in time-dependent spacetimes: a one-dimensional scattering problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally study cosmological particle production in a two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate, whose density excitations map to an analog cosmology. The expansion of spacetime is realized with tunable interactions. The particle spectrum can be understood through an analogy to quantum mechanical scattering, in which the dynamics of the spacetime metric determine the shape of the scattering potential. Hallmark scattering phenomena such as resonant forward scattering and Bragg reflection are connected to their cosmological counterparts, namely linearly expanding space and bouncing universes. We compare our findings to a theoretical description that extends beyond the acoustic approximation, which enables us to apply the model to high-momentum excitations.</description>

      <title>Collective modes of two-species Bose-Einstein condensates in a Josephson junction barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultracold atoms are an ideal platform to implement atomtronics and Josephson junctions analogous to superconducting circuits. The collective modes of a Bose gas split by a potential barrier have been known. However, the role of barriers in the interspecies correlation of ultracold atomic mixtures has not been examined. Here, we examine the low-lying collective modes of (an)harmonically trapped quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates in a Josephson barrier by employing the variational approach and the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov formalism. We first reveal the increase in barrier strength of mode softening due to anharmonicity in a single-species condensate. The Josephson barrier drives the softening of in-phase and out-of-phase dipole modes of two-species Bose-Einstein condensates, and consequently leads to two additional Goldstone modes in the miscible phase, in agreement with the variational approach. Furthermore, the sandwich immiscible state results in an additional Goldstone mode due to the barrier, in contrast to the spatial symmetry-broken side-by-side profile. Our results unveil the distinct collective response of the Josephson barrier in binary mixtures owing to interspecies atomic correlations.</description>

      <title>Thermal amplification and melting of phases in spin-orbit-coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory with Popov approximation for a homogeneous Raman-induced spin-orbit-coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate and investigate the effects of finite temperature ($T$) on the ground-state phase diagram. We calculate the roton gap as a function of Raman coupling ($\Omega$) or quadratic Zeeman field strength ($\epsilon$) to extract the critical points separating the supersolid stripe phase from the plane wave or zero-momentum phase at finite temperatures. We present a few representative finite-temperature phase diagrams for the system in the $T-\Omega$ and $T-\epsilon$ planes. Our observations indicate that the supersolid stripe phase melts at finite temperatures. We also discuss the contrasting roles of quantum and thermal fluctuations in shifting the phase boundary separating the supersolid stripe from the plane-wave phase.</description>

      <title>Transferring vibrational states of trapped atoms via a Rydberg electron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show theoretically that it is possible to coherently transfer vibrational excitation between trapped neutral atoms over a micrometer apart. To this end we consider three atoms, where two are in the electronic ground state and one is excited to a Rydberg state whose electronic orbital overlaps with the positional wave functions of the two ground-state atoms. The resulting scattering of the Rydberg electron with the ground-state atoms provides the interaction required to transfer vibrational excitation from one trapped atom to the other. By numerically investigating the dependence of the transfer dynamics on the distance between traps and their relative frequencies we find that there is a "sweet spot" where the transfer of a vibrational excitation is nearly perfect and fast compared to the Rydberg lifetime. We investigate the robustness of this scenario with respect to changes of the parameters. In addition, we derive a intuitive effective Hamiltonian which explains the observed dynamics.</description>

      <title>Competing order in two-band Bose-Hubbard chains with extended-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01121v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent progress in realizing and controlling extended Bose-Hubbard systems using excitonic or atomic devices, the present Letter theoretically investigates the case of a two-band Bose-Hubbard chain with nearest-neighbor interactions. Specifically, this study concentrates on the scenario where, due to the interactions, one band supports a density wave phase, i.e. a correlated insulating phase with spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry in the lattice, while the other band supports superfluid behavior. Using the density matrix renormalization group method, we show that supersolid order can emerge from such a combination, that is, an elusive quantum state that combines crystalline order with long-range phase coherence. Depending on the filling of the bands and the interband interaction strength, the supersolid phase competes with phase-separation, superfluid order, or Mott insulating density-wave order. As a possible setup to observe supersolidity, we propose the combination of a lower band supporting density-wave order and a thermally excited band that supports superfluidity due to weaker lattice confinement.</description>

      <title>Exact Solution of Bipartite Fluctuations in One-Dimensional Fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18523v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emergence of hydrodynamics in quantum many-body systems has recently garnered growing interest. The recent experiment of ultracold atoms [J. F. Wienand {\it et al.}, Nat. Phys. (2024), doi:10.1038/s41567-024-02611-z] studied emergent hydrodynamics in hard-core bosons using a bipartite fluctuation, which quantifies how the particle number fluctuates in a subsystem. In this Letter, we theoretically study the variance of a bipartite fluctuation in one-dimensional noninteracting fermionic dynamics starting from an alternating state, deriving the exact solution of the variance and its asymptotic linear growth law for the long-time dynamics. To compare the theoretical prediction with the experiment, we generalize our exact solution by incorporating the incompleteness of the initial alternating state, deriving the general linear growth law analytically. We find that it shows good agreement with the experimentally observed variance growth without any fitting parameters. Furthermore, we estimate a time scale for the local equilibration using our exact solution, finding that the time scale is independent of the initial incompleteness. To investigate the interaction effect, we implement numerical studies for the variance growth in interacting fermions, which has yet to be explored experimentally. As a result, we find that the presence of interactions breaks the linear variance growth derived in the noninteracting fermions. Our exact solutions and numerical findings here lay a foundation for growing bipartite fluctuations in quantum many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Generalised BBGKY hierarchy for near-integrable dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00593v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum or classical many-body Hamiltonian systems characterized by integrable contact interactions supplemented by a generic two-body potential, potentially long-range. We show how the dynamics of local observables is given in terms of a generalised version of Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon hierarchy, which we denote as gBBGKY, which is built for the densities, and their correlations, of the quasiparticles of the underlying integrable model. Unlike the usual cases of perturbation theory from free gases, the presence of local interactions in the integrable model "lifts" the so-called kinetic blocking, and the second layer of the hierarchy reproduces the dynamics at all time-scales. The latter consists of a fast pre-equilibration to a non-thermal steady state, and its subsequent thermalisation to a Gibbs ensemble. We show how the final relaxation is encoded into a Boltzmann scattering integral involving three or higher body-scatterings, and which, remarkably, is entirely determined by the diffusion constants of the underlying integrable model. We check our results with exact molecular dynamics simulations, finding perfect agreement. Our results show how gBBGKY can be successfully employed in quantum systems to compute scattering integrals and Fermi's golden rule transition rates.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Framework for Engineering Arbitrary Floquet Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic perturbative framework to engineer an arbitrary target Hamiltonian in the Floquet phase space of a periodically driven oscillator based on Floquet-Magnus expansion. The high-order errors in the engineered Floquet Hamiltonian are mitigated by adding high-order driving potentials perturbatively. We introduce a transformation method that allows us to obtain an analytical expression of the leading-order correction drive for engineering a target Hamiltonian with discrete rotational and chiral symmetries in phase space. We also provide a numerically efficient procedure to calculate high-order correction drives and apply it to engineer the target Hamiltonian with degenerate eigenstates of multi-component cat states that are important for fault-tolerant hardware-efficiency bosonic quantum computation.</description>
