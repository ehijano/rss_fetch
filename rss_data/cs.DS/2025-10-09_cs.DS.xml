      <title>Quantum matrix arithmetics with Hamiltonian evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficient implementation of matrix arithmetic operations underpins the speedups of many quantum algorithms. We develop a suite of methods to perform matrix arithmetics -- with the result encoded in the off-diagonal blocks of a Hamiltonian -- using Hamiltonian evolutions of input operators. We show how to maintain this $\textit{Hamiltonian block encoding}$, so that matrix operations can be composed one after another, and the entire quantum computation takes $\leq 2$ ancilla qubits. We achieve this for matrix multiplication, matrix addition, matrix inversion, Hermitian conjugation, fractional scaling, integer scaling, complex phase scaling, as well as singular value transformation for both odd and even polynomials. We also present an overlap estimation algorithm to extract classical properties of Hamiltonian block encoded operators, analogous to the well known Hadmard test, at no extra cost of qubit. Our Hamiltonian matrix multiplication uses the Lie group commutator product formula and its higher-order generalizations due to Childs and Wiebe. Our Hamiltonian singular value transformation employs a dominated polynomial approximation, where the approximation holds within the domain of interest, while the constructed polynomial is upper bounded by the target function over the entire unit interval. We describe a circuit for simulating a class of sum-of-squares Hamiltonians, attaining a commutator scaling in step count, while leveraging the power of matrix arithmetics to reduce the cost of each simulation step. In particular, we apply this to the doubly factorized tensor hypercontracted Hamiltonians from recent studies of quantum chemistry, obtaining further improvements for initial states with a fixed number of particles. We achieve this with $1$ ancilla qubit.</description>

      <title>Making and Evaluating Calibrated Forecasts</title>

Abstract: Calibrated predictions can be reliably interpreted as probabilities. An important step towards achieving better calibration is to design an appropriate calibration measure to meaningfully assess the miscalibration level of a predictor. A recent line of work initiated by Haghtalab et al. [2024] studies the design of truthful calibration measures: a truthful measure is minimized when a predictor outputs the true probabilities, whereas a non-truthful measure incentivizes the predictor to lie so as to appear more calibrated. All previous calibration measures were non-truthful until Hartline et al. [2025] introduced the first perfectly truthful calibration measures for binary prediction tasks in the batch setting.
  We introduce a perfectly truthful calibration measure for multi-class prediction tasks, generalizing the work of Hartline et al. [2025] beyond binary prediction. We study common methods of extending calibration measures from binary to multi-class prediction and identify ones that do or do not preserve truthfulness. In addition to truthfulness, we mathematically prove and empirically verify that our calibration measure exhibits superior robustness: it robustly preserves the ordering between dominant and dominated predictors, regardless of the choice of hyperparameters (bin sizes). This result addresses the non-robustness issue of binned ECE, which has been observed repeatedly in prior work.</description>

      <title>Trickle-down Theorems via C-Lorentzian Polynomials II: Pairwise Spectral Influence and Improved Dobrushin's Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mu$ be a probability distribution on a multi-state spin system on a set $V$ of sites. Equivalently, we can think of this as a $d$-partite simplical complex with distribution $\mu$ on maximal faces. For any pair of vertices $u,v\in V$, define the pairwise spectral influence $\mathcal{I}_{u,v}$ as follows. Let $\sigma$ be a choice of spins $s_w\in S_w$ for every $w\in V \setminus \{u,v\}$, and construct a matrix in $\mathbb{R}^{(S_u\cup S_v)\times (S_u\cup S_v)}$ where for any $s_u\in S_u, s_v\in S_v$, the $(us_u,vs_v)$-entry is the probability that $s_v$ is the spin of $v$ conditioned on $s_u$ being the spin of $u$ and on $\sigma$. Then $\mathcal{I}_{u,v}$ is the maximal second eigenvalue of this matrix, over all choices of spins for all $w \in V \setminus \{u,v\}$. Equivalently, $\mathcal{I}_{u,v}$ is the maximum local spectral expansion of links of codimension $2$ that include a spin for every $w \in V \setminus \{u,v\}$.
  We show that if the largest eigenvalue of the pairwise spectral influence matrix with entries $\mathcal{I}_{u,v}$ is bounded away from 1, i.e. $\lambda_{\max}(\mathcal{I})\leq 1-\epsilon$ (and $X$ is connected), then the Glauber dynamics mixes rapidly and generate samples from $\mu$. This improves/generalizes the classical Dobrushin's influence matrix as the $\mathcal{I}_{u,v}$ lower-bounds the classical influence of $u\to v$. As a by-product, we also prove improved/almost optimal trickle-down theorems for partite simplicial complexes. The proof builds on the trickle-down theorems via $\mathcal{C}$-Lorentzian polynomials machinery recently developed by the authors and Lindberg.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Treewidth Barrier in Quantum Circuit Simulation with Decision Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical simulation of quantum circuits is a critical tool for validating quantum hardware and probing the boundary between classical and quantum computational power. Existing state-of-the-art methods, notably tensor network approaches, have computational costs governed by the treewidth of the underlying circuit graph, making circuits with large treewidth intractable. This work rigorously analyzes FeynmanDD, a decision diagram-based simulation method proposed in CAV 2025 by a subset of the authors, and shows that the size of the multi-terminal decision diagram used in FeynmanDD is exponential in the linear rank-width of the circuit graph. As linear rank-width can be substantially smaller than treewidth and is at most larger than the treewidth by a logarithmic factor, our analysis demonstrates that FeynmanDD outperforms all tensor network-based methods for certain circuit families. We also show that the method remains efficient if we use the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm to expand arbitrary single-qubit gates to sequences of Hadamard and T gates, essentially removing the gate-set restriction posed by the method.</description>

      <title>Reconquering Bell sampling on qudits: stabilizer learning and testing, quantum pseudorandomness bounds, and more</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bell sampling is a simple yet powerful tool based on measuring two copies of a quantum state in the Bell basis, and has found applications in a plethora of problems related to stabiliser states and measures of magic. However, it was not known how to generalise the procedure from qubits to $d$-level systems -- qudits -- for all dimensions $d &gt; 2$ in a useful way. Indeed, a prior work of the authors (arXiv'24) showed that the natural extension of Bell sampling to arbitrary dimensions fails to provide meaningful information about the quantum states being measured. In this paper, we overcome the difficulties encountered in previous works and develop a useful generalisation of Bell sampling to qudits of all $d\geq 2$. At the heart of our primitive is a new unitary, based on Lagrange's four-square theorem, that maps four copies of any stabiliser state $|\mathcal{S}\rangle$ to four copies of its complex conjugate $|\mathcal{S}^\ast\rangle$ (up to some Pauli operator), which may be of independent interest. We then demonstrate the utility of our new Bell sampling technique by lifting several known results from qubits to qudits for any $d\geq 2$:
  1. Learning stabiliser states in $O(n^3)$ time with $O(n)$ samples;
  2. Solving the Hidden Stabiliser Group Problem in $\tilde{O}(n^3/\varepsilon)$ time with $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ samples;
  3. Testing whether $|\psi\rangle$ has stabiliser size at least $d^t$ or is $\varepsilon$-far from all such states in $\tilde{O}(n^3/\varepsilon)$ time with $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ samples;
  4. Clifford circuits with at most $n/2$ single-qudit non-Clifford gates cannot prepare pseudorandom states;
  5. Testing whether $|\psi\rangle$ has stabiliser fidelity at least $1-\varepsilon_1$ or at most $1-\varepsilon_2$ with $O(d^2/\varepsilon_2)$ samples if $\varepsilon_1 = 0$ or $O(d^2/\varepsilon_2^2)$ samples if $\varepsilon_1 = O(d^{-2})$.</description>

      <title>Extending Ghouila-Houri's Characterization of Comparability Graphs to Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An orientation of a given static graph is called transitive if for any three vertices $a,b,c$, the presence of arcs $(a,b)$ and $(b,c)$ forces the presence of the arc $(a,c)$. If only the presence of an arc between $a$ and $c$ is required, but its orientation is unconstrained, the orientation is called quasi-transitive. A fundamental result presented by Ghouila-Houri guarantees that any static graph admitting a quasi-transitive orientation also admits a transitive orientation. In a seminal work, Mertzios et al. introduced the notion of temporal transitivity in order to model information flows in simple temporal networks. We revisit the model introduced by Mertzios et al. and propose an analogous to Ghouila-Houri's characterization for the temporal scenario. We present a structure theorem that will allow us to express by a 2-SAT formula all the constraints imposed by temporal transitive orientations. The latter produces an efficient recognition algorithm for graphs admitting such orientations. Additionally, we extend the temporal transitivity model to temporal graphs having multiple time-labels associated to their edges and claim that the previous results hold in the multilabel setting. Finally, we propose a characterization of temporal comparability graphs via forbidden temporal ordered patterns.</description>

      <title>Randomized Quantum Singular Value Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the first randomized algorithms for Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT), a unifying framework for many quantum algorithms. Standard implementations of QSVT rely on block encodings of the Hamiltonian, which are costly to construct, requiring a logarithmic number of ancilla qubits, intricate multi-qubit control, and circuit depth scaling linearly with the number of Hamiltonian terms. In contrast, our algorithms use only a single ancilla qubit and entirely avoid block encodings. We develop two methods: (i) a direct randomization of QSVT, where block encodings are replaced by importance sampling, and (ii) an approach that integrates qDRIFT into the generalized quantum signal processing framework, with the dependence on precision exponentially improved through classical extrapolation. Both algorithms achieve gate complexity independent of the number of Hamiltonian terms, a hallmark of randomized methods, while incurring only quadratic dependence on the degree of the target polynomial. We identify natural parameter regimes where our methods outperform even standard QSVT, making them promising for early fault-tolerant quantum devices. We also establish a fundamental lower bound showing that the quadratic dependence on the polynomial degree is optimal within this framework. We apply our framework to two fundamental tasks: solving quantum linear systems and estimating ground-state properties of Hamiltonians, obtaining polynomial advantages over prior randomized algorithms. Finally, we benchmark our ground-state property estimation algorithm on electronic structure Hamiltonians and the transverse-field Ising model with long-range interactions. In both cases, our approach outperforms prior work by several orders of magnitude in circuit depth, establishing randomized QSVT as a practical and resource-efficient alternative for early fault-tolerant quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sparse Recovery and Quantum Orthogonal Matching Pursuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum sparse recovery in non-orthogonal, overcomplete dictionaries: given coherent quantum access to a state and a dictionary of vectors, the goal is to reconstruct the state up to $\ell_2$ error using as few vectors as possible. We first show that the general recovery problem is NP-hard, ruling out efficient exact algorithms in full generality. To overcome this, we introduce Quantum Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (QOMP), the first quantum analogue of the classical OMP greedy algorithm. QOMP combines quantum subroutines for inner product estimation, maximum finding, and block-encoded projections with an error-resetting design that avoids iteration-to-iteration error accumulation. Under standard mutual incoherence and well-conditioned sparsity assumptions, QOMP provably recovers the exact support of a $K$-sparse state in polynomial time. As an application, we give the first framework for sparse quantum tomography with non-orthogonal dictionaries in $\ell_2$ norm, achieving query complexity $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{N}/\epsilon)$ in favorable regimes and reducing tomography to estimating only $K$ coefficients instead of $N$ amplitudes. In particular, for pure-state tomography with $m=O(N)$ dictionary vectors and sparsity $K=\widetilde{O}(1)$ on a well-conditioned subdictionary, this circumvents the $\widetilde{\Omega}(N/\epsilon)$ lower bound that holds in the dense, orthonormal-dictionary setting, without contradiction, by leveraging sparsity together with non-orthogonality. Beyond tomography, we analyze QOMP in the QRAM model, where it yields polynomial speedups over classical OMP implementations, and provide a quantum algorithm to estimate the mutual incoherence of a dictionary of $m$ vectors in $O(m/\epsilon)$ queries, improving over both deterministic and quantum-inspired classical methods.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Complexity of s-Club Cluster Edge Deletion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the parameterized and classical complexity of the s-Club Cluster Edge Deletion problem: given a graph G = (V, E) and integers k and s, determine whether it is possible to delete at most k edges so that every connected component of the resulting graph has diameter at most s. This problem generalizes Cluster Edge Deletion (the case s = 1) and captures a variety of distance-bounded graph modification tasks.
  Montecchiani, Ortali, Piselli, and Tappini (Information and Computation, 2023) showed that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by s plus the treewidth of G, and asked whether the dependence on s is necessary; that is, whether the problem is FPT when parameterized by treewidth alone. We resolve this by proving that the problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized by pathwidth, and hence by treewidth.
  On the algorithmic side, we show that the problem is FPT when parameterized by neighborhood diversity, twin cover, or cluster vertex deletion number, thereby extending to all s &gt;= 1 the results of Italiano, Konstantinidis, and Papadopoulos (Algorithmica, 2023), who established FPT algorithms for the case s = 1 under the neighborhood diversity and twin cover parameters.
  From a classical perspective, we prove that the problem is NP-hard on split graphs already for s = 2, complementing the polynomial-time solvability for s = 1 due to Bonomo, Duran, and Valencia-Pabon (Theoretical Computer Science, 2015) and the trivial case s = 3.
  Finally, while the problem is FPT when parameterized by s + k, its complexity for the solution size k alone remains open. We make progress on this front by designing an FPT bicriteria approximation algorithm, which runs in time f(k, 1/epsilon) * n^{O(1)} and, for graphs excluding long induced cycles, outputs a solution of size at most k whose connected components have diameter at most (1 + epsilon) * s.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of Clifford testing, which asks whether a black-box $n$-qubit unitary is a Clifford unitary or at least $\varepsilon$-far from every Clifford unitary. We give the first 4-query Clifford tester, which decides this problem with probability $\mathrm{poly}(\varepsilon)$. This contrasts with the minimum of 6 copies required for the closely-related task of stabilizer testing. We show that our tester is tolerant, by adapting techniques from tolerant stabilizer testing to our setting. In doing so, we settle in the positive a conjecture of Bu, Gu and Jaffe, by proving a polynomial inverse theorem for a non-commutative Gowers 3-uniformity norm. We also consider the restricted setting of single-copy access, where we give an $O(n)$-query Clifford tester that requires no auxiliary memory qubits or adaptivity. We complement this with a lower bound, proving that any such, potentially adaptive, single-copy algorithm needs at least $\Omega(n^{1/4})$ queries. To obtain our results, we leverage the structure of the commutant of the Clifford group, obtaining several technical statements that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On quantum to classical comparison for Davies generators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive study, our understanding of quantum Markov chains remains far less complete than that of their classical counterparts. [Temme'13] observed that the Davies Lindbladian, a well-studied model of quantum Markov dynamics, contains an embedded classical Markov generator, raising the natural question of how the convergence properties of the quantum and classical dynamics are related. While [Temme'13] showed that the spectral gap of the Davies Lindbladian can be much smaller than that of the embedded classical generator for certain highly structured Hamiltonians, we show that if the spectrum of the Hamiltonian does not contain long arithmetic progressions, then the two spectral gaps must be comparable. As a consequence, we prove that for a large class of Hamiltonians, including those obtained by perturbing a fixed Hamiltonian with a generic external field, the quantum spectral gap remains within a constant factor of the classical spectral gap. Our result aligns with physical intuition and enables the application of classical Markov chain techniques to the quantum setting.
  The proof is based on showing that any ``off-diagonal'' eigenvector of the Davies generator can be used to construct an observable which commutes with the Hamiltonian and has a Lindbladian Rayleigh quotient which can be upper bounded in terms of that of the original eigenvector's Lindbladian Rayleigh quotient. Thus, a spectral gap for such observables implies a spectral gap for the full Davies generator.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Reachability Times on Temporal Graphs via Shifting Labels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.08797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how we can accelerate the spreading of information in temporal graphs via shifting operations; a problem that captures real-world applications varying from information flows to distribution schedules. In a temporal graph there is a set of fixed vertices and the available connections between them change over time in a predefined manner. We observe that, in some cases, shifting some connections, i.e., advancing or delaying them, can decrease the travel time from some vertex (source) to another vertex. We study how we can minimize the maximum time a set of sources needs to reach every vertex, when we are allowed to shift some of the connections. If we restrict the allowed number of changes, we prove that, already for a single source, the problem is NP-hard, and W[2]-hard when parameterized by the number of changes. Then we focus on unconstrained number of changes. We derive a polynomial-time algorithm when there is a single source. When there are two sources, we show that the problem becomes NP-hard; on the other hand, we design an FPT algorithm parameterized by the treewidth of the graph plus the lifetime of the optimal solution, that works for any number of sources.

      <title>Testing Support Size More Efficiently Than Learning Histograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18915v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider two problems about an unknown probability distribution $p$:
  1. How many samples from $p$ are required to test if $p$ is supported on $n$ elements or not? Specifically, given samples from $p$, determine whether it is supported on at most $n$ elements, or it is "$\epsilon$-far" (in total variation distance) from being supported on $n$ elements.
  2. Given $m$ samples from $p$, what is the largest lower bound on its support size that we can produce?
  The best known upper bound for problem (1) uses a general algorithm for learning the histogram of the distribution $p$, which requires $\Theta(\tfrac{n}{\epsilon^2 \log n})$ samples. We show that testing can be done more efficiently than learning the histogram, using only $O(\tfrac{n}{\epsilon \log n} \log(1/\epsilon))$ samples, nearly matching the best known lower bound of $\Omega(\tfrac{n}{\epsilon \log n})$. This algorithm also provides a better solution to problem (2), producing larger lower bounds on support size than what follows from previous work. The proof relies on an analysis of Chebyshev polynomial approximations outside the range where they are designed to be good approximations, and the paper is intended as an accessible self-contained exposition of the Chebyshev polynomial method.</description>

      <title>Parallel Complexity of Depth-First-Search and Maximal path in restricted graph classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constructing a Depth First Search (DFS) tree is a fundamental graph problem, whose parallel complexity is still not settled. Reif showed parallel intractability of lex-first DFS. In contrast, randomized parallel algorithms (and more recently, deterministic quasipolynomial parallel algorithms) are known for constructing a DFS tree in general (di)graphs. However a deterministic parallel algorithm for DFS in general graphs remains an elusive goal. Working towards this, a series of works gave deterministic NC algorithms for DFS in planar graphs and digraphs. We further extend these results to more general graph classes, by providing NC algorithms for (di)graphs of bounded genus, and for undirected H-minor-free graphs where H is a fixed graph with at most one crossing. For the case of (di)graphs of bounded tree-width, we further improve the complexity to a Logspace bound. Constructing a maximal path is a simpler problem (that reduces to DFS) for which no deterministic parallel bounds are known for general graphs. For planar graphs a bound of O(log n) parallel time on a CREW PRAM (thus in NC2) is known. We improve this bound to Logspace.</description>

      <title>On the (In)Approximability of the Monitoring Edge Geodetic Set Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00708v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the minimum \emph{Monitoring Edge Geodetic Set} (\megset) problem introduced in [Foucaud et al., CALDAM'23]: given a graph $G$, we say that an edge is monitored by a pair $u,v$ of vertices if \emph{all} shortest paths between $u$ and $v$ traverse $e$; the goal of the problem consists in finding a subset $M$ of vertices of $G$ such that each edge of $G$ is monitored by at least one pair of vertices in $M$, and $|M|$ is minimized.
  In this paper, we prove that all polynomial-time approximation algorithms for the minimum \megset problem must have an approximation ratio of $\Omega(\log n)$, unless \p = \np. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-constant inapproximability result known for this problem. We also strengthen the known \np-hardness of the problem on $2$-apex graphs by showing that the same result holds for $1$-apex graphs. This leaves open the problem of determining whether the problem remains \np-hard on planar (i.e., $0$-apex) graphs.
  On the positive side, we design an algorithm that computes good approximate solutions for hereditary graph classes that admit efficiently computable balanced separators of truly sublinear size. This immediately results in polynomial-time approximation algorithms achieving an approximation ratio of $O(n^{\frac{1}{4}} \sqrt{\log n})$ on planar graphs, graphs with bounded genus, and $k$-apex graphs with $k=O(n^{\frac{1}{4}})$. On graphs with bounded treewidth, we obtain an approximation ratio of $O(\log^{3/2} n)$ for any constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. This compares favorably with the best-known approximation algorithm for general graphs, which achieves an approximation ratio of $O(\sqrt{n \log n})$ via a simple reduction to the \textsc{Set Cover} problem.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithms for Disjoint Shortest Paths Problem and its Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the 2-Disjoint Shortest Paths (2-DSP) problem: given a directed weighted graph and two terminal pairs $(s_1,t_1)$ and $(s_2,t_2)$, decide whether there exist vertex-disjoint shortest paths between each pair.
  Building on recent advances in disjoint shortest paths for DAGs and undirected graphs (Akmal et al. 2024), we present an $O(mn \log n)$ time algorithm for this problem in weighted directed graphs that do not contain negative or zero weight cycles. This algorithm presents a significant improvement over the previously known $O(m^5n)$ time bound (Berczi et al. 2017). Our approach exploits the algebraic structure of polynomials that enumerate shortest paths between terminal pairs. A key insight is that these polynomials admit a recursive decomposition, enabling efficient evaluation via dynamic programming over fields of characteristic two. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to report the corresponding paths in $O(mn^2 \log n)$ time.
  In addition, we extend our techniques to a more general setting: given two terminal pairs $(s_1, t_1)$ and $(s_2, t_2)$ in a directed graph, find the minimum possible number of vertex intersections between any shortest path from $s_1$ to $t_1$ and $s_2$ to $t_2$. We call this the Minimum 2-Disjoint Shortest Paths (Min-2-DSP) problem. We provide in this paper the first efficient algorithm for this problem, including an $O(m^2 n^3)$ time algorithm for directed graphs with positive edge weights, and an $O(m+n)$ time algorithm for DAGs and undirected graphs. Moreover, if the number of intersecting vertices is at least one, we show that it is possible to report the paths in the same $O(m+n)$ time. This is somewhat surprising, as there is no known $o(mn)$ time algorithm for explicitly reporting the paths if they are vertex-disjoint, and is left as an open problem in (Akmal et al. 2024).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We improve the Solovay--Kitaev theorem and algorithm for a general finite, inverse-closed generating set acting on a qudit. Prior versions of the algorithm efficiently find a word of length $O(n^{3+\delta})$ to approximate an arbitrary target gate to $n$ bits of precision. Using two new ideas, each of which reduces the exponent separately, our new bound on the word length is $O(n^{1.44042\ldots+\delta})$. Our result holds more generally for any finite set that densely generates any connected, semisimple real Lie group, with an extra length term in the noncompact case to reach group elements far away from the identity.</description>

      <title>Fair Division in a Variable Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the classic problem of fairly dividing a set of indivisible items among a set of agents and consider the popular fairness notion of envy-freeness up to one item (EF1). While in reality, the set of agents and items may vary, previous works have studied static settings, where no change can occur in the system. We initiate and develop a formal model to understand fair division under the variable input setting: here, there is an EF1 allocation that gets disrupted because of the loss/deletion of an item, or the arrival of a new agent, resulting in a near-EF1 allocation. The objective is to perform a sequence of transfers of items between agents to regain EF1 fairness by traversing only via near-EF1 allocations. We refer to this as the EF1-Restoration problem.
  In this work, we present algorithms for the above problem when agents have identical monotone valuations, and items are either all goods or all chores. Both of these algorithms achieve an optimal number of transfers (at most $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are the number of items and agents respectively) for identical additive valuations. Next, we consider a valuation class with graphical structure, introduced by Christodoulou et al. (EC'23), where each item is valued by at most two agents, and hence can be seen as an edge between these two agents in a graph. Here, we consider EF1 orientations on (multi)graphs - allocations in which each item is allocated to an agent who values it. While considering EF1 orientations on multi-graphs with additive binary valuations, we present an optimal algorithm for the EF1-Restoration problem. Finally, for monotone binary valuations, we show that the problem of deciding whether EF1-Restoration is possible is PSPACE-complete.</description>

      <title>Sliding Squares in Parallel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider algorithmic problems motivated by modular robotic reconfiguration in the sliding square model, in which we are given $n$ square-shaped modules in a (labeled or unlabeled) start configuration and need to find a schedule of sliding moves to transform it into a desired goal configuration, maintaining connectivity of the configuration at all times. Recent work has aimed at minimizing the total number of moves, resulting in fully sequential schedules that perform reconfiguration in $\mathcal{O}(nP)$ moves for arrangements of bounding box perimeter size $P$, or a number of moves linear in the sum of module coordinates in the start and target arrangements.
  We extend the model to leverage the possibility of parallel motion, thereby reducing worst-case makespans by a factor linear in $n$. Our work presents tight results both in terms of complexity and algorithms: We show that deciding the existence of a single parallel reconfiguration step that solves an instance is NP-complete for unlabeled modules, but can be solved efficiently in the labeled setting. Nevertheless, deciding whether a labeled instance can be solved in two parallel steps is NP-complete. Finally, we describe an algorithm to perform in-place reconfiguration in worst-case optimal $\mathcal{O}(P)$ parallel steps for the unlabeled setting. This algorithm has a straight-forward extension to the labeled setting with slight relaxations to either the reconfiguration time or space constraint.</description>

      <title>Approximately Envy-free and Equitable Allocations of Indivisible Items for Non-monotone Valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the setting of fair allocation of indivisible items among agents with heterogeneous, non-monotone valuations. We explore the existence and efficient computation of allocations that approximately satisfy either envy-freeness or equity constraints. Approximate envy-freeness ensures that each agent values her bundle at least as much as those given to the others, after some (or any) item removal, while approximate equity guarantees roughly equal valuations among agents, under similar adjustments. As a key technical contribution of this work, by leveraging fixed-point theorems (such as Sperner's Lemma and its variants), we establish the existence of {\em envy-free-up-to-one-good-and-one-chore} ($\text{EF1}^c_g$) and {\em equitable-up-to-one-good-and-one-chore} ($\text{EQ1}^c_g$) allocations, for non-monotone valuations that are always either non-negative or non-positive. These notions represent slight relaxations of the well-studied {\em envy-free-up-to-one-item} (EF1) and {\em equitable-up-to-one-item} (EQ1) guarantees, respectively. Our existential results hold even when items are arranged in a path and bundles must form connected sub-paths. The case of non-positive valuations, in particular, has been solved by proving a novel multi-coloring variant of Sperner's Lemma that constitutes a combinatorial result of independent interest. In addition, we also design a polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm that computes an $\text{EQ1}^c_g$ allocation. For monotone non-increasing valuations and path-connected bundles, all the above results can be extended to EF1 and EQ1 guarantees as well. Finally, we provide existential and computational results for certain stronger {\em up-to-any-item} equity notions under objective valuations, where items are partitioned into goods and chores.</description>
