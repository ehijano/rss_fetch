      <title>Relating insplittings of 2-graphs and of textile systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The graphical operation of insplitting is key to understanding conjugacy of shifts of finite type (SFTs) in both one and two dimensions. In this paper, we consider two approaches to studying 2-dimensional SFTs: textile systems and rank-2 graphs. Nasu's textile systems describe all two-sided 2D SFTs up to conjugacy, whereas the 2-graphs (higher-rank graphs of rank 2) introduced by Kumjian and Pask yield associated C*-algebras. Both models have a naturally-associated notion of insplitting. We show that these notions do not coincide, raising the question of whether insplitting a 2-graph induces a conjugacy of the associated one-sided 2-dimensional SFTs.
  Our first main result shows how to reconstruct 2-graph insplitting using textile-system insplits and inversions, and consequently proves that 2-graph insplitting induces a conjugacy of dynamical systems. We also present several other facets of the relationship between 2-graph insplitting and textile-system insplitting. Incorporating an insplit of the bottom graph of the textile system turns out to be key to this relationship. By articulating the connection between operator-algebraic and dynamical notions of insplitting in two dimensions, this article lays the groundwork for a C*-algebraic framework for classifying one-sided conjugacy in higher-dimensional SFTs.</description>

      <title>Trace Formulas in Noncommutative Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trace formulas appear in many forms in noncommutative geometry (NCG). In the first part of this thesis, we obtain results for asymptotic expansions of trace formulas like heat trace expansions by adapting the theory of Multiple Operator Integration to NCG. More broadly, this construction provides a natural language for operator integrals in NCG, which systematises and simplifies operator integral arguments throughout the literature. Towards this end, we construct a functional calculus for abstract pseudodifferential operators and generalise Peller's construction of multiple operator integrals to this abstract pseudodifferential calculus. In the process, we obtain a noncommutative Taylor formula.
  In the second part of this thesis, we shift our attention to Dixmier trace formulas. First, we provide an approximation of the noncommutative integral for spectrally truncated spectral triples in the Connes--Van Suijlekom paradigm of operator system spectral triples. Our approximation has a close link to Quantum Ergodicity, which we will use to state an NCG analogue of the fundamental result that ergodic geodesic flow implies quantum ergodicity. Furthermore, we provide a Szeg\H{o} limit theorem in NCG. Next, we provide a Dixmier trace formula for the density of states, a measure originating in solid state physics that can be associated with an operator on a geometric space. We first provide this formula in the setting of discrete metric spaces, and then in the setting of manifolds of bounded geometry. The latter leads to a Dixmier trace formula for Roe's index on open manifolds.</description>

      <title>C*-diagonals with Cantor spectrum in Cuntz algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that there exists a C*-diagonal with Cantor spectrum in the Cuntz algebra $\mathcal{O}_k$ for $2 \le k &lt; \infty$. Our method generalises to an uncountable family of UCT Kirchberg algebras with distinct K-theory. Moreover, we construct principal \'etale groupoid models for these Cuntz algebras and UCT Kirchberg algebras.</description>

      <title>Katsura-Exel-Pardo self-similar actions, Putnam's binary factors and their limit spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the dynamical system associated by Putnam to a pair of graph embeddings is identical to the shift map on the limit space of a self-similar groupoid action on a graph. Moreover, performing a certain out-split on said graph gives rise to a Katsura-Exel-Pardo groupoid action on the out-split graph whose associated limit space dynamical system is conjugate to the previous one. We characterise the self-similar properties of these groupoids in terms of properties of their defining data, two matrices $A$, $B$. We prove a large class of the associated limit spaces are bundles of circles and points which fibre over a totally disconnected space, and the dynamics restricted to each circle is of the form $z\to z^{n}$. Moreover, we find a planar embedding of these spaces, thereby answering a question Putnam posed in his paper.</description>
