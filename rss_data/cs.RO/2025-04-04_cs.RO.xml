      <title>Information Gain Is Not All You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous exploration in mobile robotics is driven by two competing objectives: coverage, to exhaustively observe the environment; and path length, to do so with the shortest path possible. Though it is difficult to evaluate the best course of action without knowing the unknown, the unknown can often be understood through models, maps, or common sense. However, previous work has shown that improving estimates of information gain through such prior knowledge leads to greedy behavior and ultimately causes backtracking, which degrades coverage performance. In fact, any information gain maximization will exhibit this behavior, even without prior knowledge. Information gained at task completion is constant, and cannot be maximized for. It is therefore an unsuitable choice as an optimization objective. Instead, information gain is a decision criterion for determining which candidate states should still be considered for exploration. The task therefore becomes to reach completion with the shortest total path. Since determining the shortest path is typically intractable, it is necessary to rely on a heuristic or estimate to identify candidate states that minimize the total path length. To address this, we propose a heuristic that reduces backtracking by preferring candidate states that are close to the robot, but far away from other candidate states. We evaluate the performance of the proposed heuristic in simulation against an information gain-based approach and frontier exploration, and show that our method significantly decreases total path length, both with and without prior knowledge of the environment.</description>

      <title>Multi-Dimensional AGV Path Planning in 3D Warehouses Using Ant Colony Optimization and Advanced Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within modern warehouse scenarios, the rapid expansion of e-commerce and increasingly complex, multi-level storage environments have exposed the limitations of traditional AGV (Automated Guided Vehicle) path planning methods--often reliant on static 2D models and expert-tuned heuristics that struggle to handle dynamic traffic and congestion. Addressing these limitations, this paper introduces a novel AGV path planning approach for 3D warehouse environments that leverages a hybrid framework combining ACO (Ant Colony Optimization) with deep learning models, called NAHACO (Neural Adaptive Heuristic Ant Colony Optimization). NAHACO integrates three key innovations: first, an innovative heuristic algorithm for 3D warehouse cargo modeling using multidimensional tensors, which addresses the challenge of achieving superior heuristic accuracy; second, integration of a congestion-aware loss function within the ACO framework to adjust path costs based on traffic and capacity constraints, called CARL (Congestion-Aware Reinforce Loss), enabling dynamic heuristic calibration for optimizing ACO-based path planning; and third, an adaptive attention mechanism that captures multi-scale spatial features, thereby addressing dynamic heuristic calibration for further optimization of ACO-based path planning and AGV navigation. NAHACO significantly boosts path planning efficiency, yielding faster computation times and superior performance over both vanilla and state-of-the-art methods, while automatically adapting to warehouse constraints for real-time optimization. NAHACO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, lowering the total cost by up to 24.7% on TSP benchmarks. In warehouse tests, NAHACO cuts cost by up to 41.5% and congestion by up to 56.1% compared to previous methods.</description>

      <title>CaLiV: LiDAR-to-Vehicle Calibration of Arbitrary Sensor Setups via Object Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In autonomous systems, sensor calibration is essential for a safe and efficient navigation in dynamic environments. Accurate calibration is a prerequisite for reliable perception and planning tasks such as object detection and obstacle avoidance. Many existing LiDAR calibration methods require overlapping fields of view, while others use external sensing devices or postulate a feature-rich environment. In addition, Sensor-to-Vehicle calibration is not supported by the vast majority of calibration algorithms. In this work, we propose a novel target-based technique for extrinsic Sensor-to-Sensor and Sensor-to-Vehicle calibration of multi-LiDAR systems called CaLiV. This algorithm works for non-overlapping FoVs, as well as arbitrary calibration targets, and does not require any external sensing devices. First, we apply motion to produce FoV overlaps and utilize a simple unscented Kalman filter to obtain vehicle poses. Then, we use the Gaussian mixture model-based registration framework GMMCalib to align the point clouds in a common calibration frame. Finally, we reduce the task of recovering the sensor extrinsics to a minimization problem. We show that both translational and rotational Sensor-to-Sensor errors can be solved accurately by our method. In addition, all Sensor-to-Vehicle rotation angles can also be calibrated with high accuracy. We validate the simulation results in real-world experiments. The code is open source and available on https://github.com/TUMFTM/CaLiV.</description>

      <title>Distance Estimation to Support Assistive Drones for the Visually Impaired using Robust Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous navigation by drones using onboard sensors, combined with deep learning and computer vision algorithms, is impacting a number of domains. We examine the use of drones to autonomously assist Visually Impaired People (VIPs) in navigating outdoor environments while avoiding obstacles. Here, we present NOVA, a robust calibration technique using depth maps to estimate absolute distances to obstacles in a campus environment. NOVA uses a dynamic-update method that can adapt to adversarial scenarios. We compare NOVA with SOTA depth map approaches, and with geometric and regression-based baseline models, for distance estimation to VIPs and other obstacles in diverse and dynamic conditions. We also provide exhaustive evaluations to validate the robustness and generalizability of our methods. NOVA predicts distances to VIP with an error &lt;30cm and to different obstacles like cars and bicycles with a maximum of 60cm error, which are better than the baselines. NOVA also clearly out-performs SOTA depth map methods, by upto 5.3-14.6x.</description>

      <title>A Concise Survey on Lane Topology Reasoning for HD Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lane topology reasoning techniques play a crucial role in high-definition (HD) mapping and autonomous driving applications. While recent years have witnessed significant advances in this field, there has been limited effort to consolidate these works into a comprehensive overview. This survey systematically reviews the evolution and current state of lane topology reasoning methods, categorizing them into three major paradigms: procedural modeling-based methods, aerial imagery-based methods, and onboard sensors-based methods. We analyze the progression from early rule-based approaches to modern learning-based solutions utilizing transformers, graph neural networks (GNNs), and other deep learning architectures. The paper examines standardized evaluation metrics, including road-level measures (APLS and TLTS score), and lane-level metrics (DET and TOP score), along with performance comparisons on benchmark datasets such as OpenLane-V2. We identify key technical challenges, including dataset availability and model efficiency, and outline promising directions for future research. This comprehensive review provides researchers and practitioners with insights into the theoretical frameworks, practical implementations, and emerging trends in lane topology reasoning for HD mapping applications.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Navigation for Autonomous Aerial Vehicles Using Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most applications in autonomous navigation using mounted cameras rely on the construction and processing of geometric 3D point clouds, which is an expensive process. However, there is another simpler way to make a space navigable quickly: to use semantic information (e.g., traffic signs) to guide the agent. However, detecting and acting on semantic information involves Computer Vision~(CV) algorithms such as object detection, which themselves are demanding for agents such as aerial drones with limited onboard resources. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel Markov Decision Process~(MDP) framework to reduce the workload of these CV approaches. We apply our proposed framework to both feature-based and neural-network-based object-detection tasks, using open-loop and closed-loop simulations as well as hardware-in-the-loop emulations. These holistic tests show significant benefits in energy consumption and speed with only a limited loss in accuracy compared to models based on static features and neural networks.</description>

      <title>Semantic SLAM with Rolling-Shutter Cameras and Low-Precision INS in Outdoor Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate localization and mapping in outdoor environments remains challenging when using consumer-grade hardware, particularly with rolling-shutter cameras and low-precision inertial navigation systems (INS). We present a novel semantic SLAM approach that leverages road elements such as lane boundaries, traffic signs, and road markings to enhance localization accuracy. Our system integrates real-time semantic feature detection with a graph optimization framework, effectively handling both rolling-shutter effects and INS drift. Using a practical hardware setup which consists of a rolling-shutter camera (3840*2160@30fps), IMU (100Hz), and wheel encoder (50Hz), we demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves higher recall (up to 5.35\%) and precision (up to 2.79\%) in semantic element detection, while maintaining mean relative error (MRE) within 10cm and mean absolute error (MAE) around 1m. Extensive experiments in diverse urban environments demonstrate the robust performance of our system under varying lighting conditions and complex traffic scenarios, making it particularly suitable for autonomous driving applications. The proposed approach provides a practical solution for high-precision localization using affordable hardware, bridging the gap between consumer-grade sensors and production-level performance requirements.</description>

      <title>RoboAct-CLIP: Video-Driven Pre-training of Atomic Action Understanding for Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as pivotal tools for robotic systems, enabling cross-task generalization, dynamic environmental interaction, and long-horizon planning through multimodal perception and semantic reasoning. However, existing open-source VLMs predominantly trained for generic vision-language alignment tasks fail to model temporally correlated action semantics that are crucial for robotic manipulation effectively. While current image-based fine-tuning methods partially adapt VLMs to robotic applications, they fundamentally disregard temporal evolution patterns in video sequences and suffer from visual feature entanglement between robotic agents, manipulated objects, and environmental contexts, thereby limiting semantic decoupling capability for atomic actions and compromising model generalizability.To overcome these challenges, this work presents RoboAct-CLIP with dual technical contributions: 1) A dataset reconstruction framework that performs semantic-constrained action unit segmentation and re-annotation on open-source robotic videos, constructing purified training sets containing singular atomic actions (e.g., "grasp"); 2) A temporal-decoupling fine-tuning strategy based on Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) architecture, which disentangles temporal action features across video frames from object-centric characteristics to achieve hierarchical representation learning of robotic atomic actions.Experimental results in simulated environments demonstrate that the RoboAct-CLIP pretrained model achieves a 12% higher success rate than baseline VLMs, along with superior generalization in multi-object manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Flight Parameters in UAV-based 3D Reconstruction for Rooftop Infrastructure Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rooftop 3D reconstruction using UAV-based photogrammetry offers a promising solution for infrastructure assessment, but existing methods often require high percentages of image overlap and extended flight times to ensure model accuracy when using autonomous flight paths. This study systematically evaluates key flight parameters-ground sampling distance (GSD) and image overlap-to optimize the 3D reconstruction of complex rooftop infrastructure. Controlled UAV flights were conducted over a multi-segment rooftop at Queen's University using a DJI Phantom 4 Pro V2, with varied GSD and overlap settings. The collected data were processed using Reality Capture software and evaluated against ground truth models generated from UAV-based LiDAR and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). Experimental results indicate that a GSD range of 0.75-1.26 cm combined with 85% image overlap achieves a high degree of model accuracy, while minimizing images collected and flight time. These findings provide guidance for planning autonomous UAV flight paths for efficient rooftop assessments.</description>

      <title>A Chefs KISS -- Utilizing semantic information in both ICP and SLAM framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For utilizing autonomous vehicle in urban areas a reliable localization is needed. Especially when HD maps are used, a precise and repeatable method has to be chosen. Therefore accurate map generation but also re-localization against these maps is necessary. Due to best 3D reconstruction of the surrounding, LiDAR has become a reliable modality for localization. The latest LiDAR odometry estimation are based on iterative closest point (ICP) approaches, namely KISS-ICP and SAGE-ICP. We extend the capabilities of KISS-ICP by incorporating semantic information into the point alignment process using a generalizable approach with minimal parameter tuning. This enhancement allows us to surpass KISS-ICP in terms of absolute trajectory error (ATE), the primary metric for map accuracy. Additionally, we improve the Cartographer mapping framework to handle semantic information. Cartographer facilitates loop closure detection over larger areas, mitigating odometry drift and further enhancing ATE accuracy. By integrating semantic information into the mapping process, we enable the filtering of specific classes, such as parked vehicles, from the resulting map. This filtering improves relocalization quality by addressing temporal changes, such as vehicles being moved.</description>

      <title>Let's move on: Topic Change in Robot-Facilitated Group Discussions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robot-moderated group discussions have the potential to facilitate engaging and productive interactions among human participants. Previous work on topic management in conversational agents has predominantly focused on human engagement and topic personalization, with the agent having an active role in the discussion. Also, studies have shown the usefulness of including robots in groups, yet further exploration is still needed for robots to learn when to change the topic while facilitating discussions. Accordingly, our work investigates the suitability of machine-learning models and audiovisual non-verbal features in predicting appropriate topic changes. We utilized interactions between a robot moderator and human participants, which we annotated and used for extracting acoustic and body language-related features. We provide a detailed analysis of the performance of machine learning approaches using sequential and non-sequential data with different sets of features. The results indicate promising performance in classifying inappropriate topic changes, outperforming rule-based approaches. Additionally, acoustic features exhibited comparable performance and robustness compared to the complete set of multimodal features. Our annotated data is publicly available at https://github.com/ghadj/topic-change-robot-discussions-data-2024.</description>

      <title>Preference-Driven Active 3D Scene Representation for Robotic Inspection in Nuclear Decommissioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active 3D scene representation is pivotal in modern robotics applications, including remote inspection, manipulation, and telepresence. Traditional methods primarily optimize geometric fidelity or rendering accuracy, but often overlook operator-specific objectives, such as safety-critical coverage or task-driven viewpoints. This limitation leads to suboptimal viewpoint selection, particularly in constrained environments such as nuclear decommissioning. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel framework that integrates expert operator preferences into the active 3D scene representation pipeline. Specifically, we employ Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to guide robotic path planning, reshaping the reward function based on expert input. To capture operator-specific priorities, we conduct interactive choice experiments that evaluate user preferences in 3D scene representation. We validate our framework using a UR3e robotic arm for reactor tile inspection in a nuclear decommissioning scenario. Compared to baseline methods, our approach enhances scene representation while optimizing trajectory efficiency. The RLHF-based policy consistently outperforms random selection, prioritizing task-critical details. By unifying explicit 3D geometric modeling with implicit human-in-the-loop optimization, this work establishes a foundation for adaptive, safety-critical robotic perception systems, paving the way for enhanced automation in nuclear decommissioning, remote maintenance, and other high-risk environments.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control with Visibility Graphs for Humanoid Path Planning and Tracking Against Adversarial Opponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we detail the methods used for obstacle avoidance, path planning, and trajectory tracking that helped us win the adult-sized, autonomous humanoid soccer league in RoboCup 2024. Our team was undefeated for all seated matches and scored 45 goals over 6 games, winning the championship game 6 to 1. During the competition, a major challenge for collision avoidance was the measurement noise coming from bipedal locomotion and a limited field of view (FOV). Furthermore, obstacles would sporadically jump in and out of our planned trajectory. At times our estimator would place our robot inside a hard constraint. Any planner in this competition must also be be computationally efficient enough to re-plan and react in real time. This motivated our approach to trajectory generation and tracking. In many scenarios long-term and short-term planning is needed. To efficiently find a long-term general path that avoids all obstacles we developed DAVG (Dynamic Augmented Visibility Graphs). DAVG focuses on essential path planning by setting certain regions to be active based on obstacles and the desired goal pose. By augmenting the states in the graph, turning angles are considered, which is crucial for a large soccer playing robot as turning may be more costly. A trajectory is formed by linearly interpolating between discrete points generated by DAVG. A modified version of model predictive control (MPC) is used to then track this trajectory called cf-MPC (Collision-Free MPC). This ensures short-term planning. Without having to switch formulations cf-MPC takes into account the robot dynamics and collision free constraints. Without a hard switch the control input can smoothly transition in cases where the noise places our robot inside a constraint boundary. The nonlinear formulation runs at approximately 120 Hz, while the quadratic version achieves around 400 Hz.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an enhanced theoretical formulation for bipedal hierarchical control frameworks under uneven terrain conditions. Specifically, owing to the inherent limitations of the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM) in handling terrain elevation variations, we develop a Piecewise Slope LIPM (PS-LIPM). This innovative model enables dynamic adjustment of the Center of Mass (CoM) height to align with topographical undulations during single-step cycles. Another contribution is proposed a generalized Angular Momentum-based LIPM (G-ALIP) for CoM velocity compensation using Centroidal Angular Momentum (CAM) regulation. Building upon these advancements, we derive the DCM step-to-step dynamics for Model Predictive Control MPC formulation, enabling simultaneous optimization of step position and step duration. A hierarchical control framework integrating MPC with a Whole-Body Controller (WBC) is implemented for bipedal locomotion across uneven stepping stones. The results validate the efficacy of the proposed hierarchical control framework and the theoretical formulation.</description>

      <title>On learning racing policies with reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully autonomous vehicles promise enhanced safety and efficiency. However, ensuring reliable operation in challenging corner cases requires control algorithms capable of performing at the vehicle limits. We address this requirement by considering the task of autonomous racing and propose solving it by learning a racing policy using Reinforcement Learning (RL). Our approach leverages domain randomization, actuator dynamics modeling, and policy architecture design to enable reliable and safe zero-shot deployment on a real platform. Evaluated on the F1TENTH race car, our RL policy not only surpasses a state-of-the-art Model Predictive Control (MPC), but, to the best of our knowledge, also represents the first instance of an RL policy outperforming expert human drivers in RC racing. This work identifies the key factors driving this performance improvement, providing critical insights for the design of robust RL-based control strategies for autonomous vehicles.</description>

      <title>Estimating Scene Flow in Robot Surroundings with Distributed Miniaturized Time-of-Flight Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracking motions of humans or objects in the surroundings of the robot is essential to improve safe robot motions and reactions. In this work, we present an approach for scene flow estimation from low-density and noisy point clouds acquired from miniaturized Time of Flight (ToF) sensors distributed on the robot body. The proposed method clusters points from consecutive frames and applies Iterative Closest Point (ICP) to estimate a dense motion flow, with additional steps introduced to mitigate the impact of sensor noise and low-density data points. Specifically, we employ a fitness-based classification to distinguish between stationary and moving points and an inlier removal strategy to refine geometric correspondences. The proposed approach is validated in an experimental setup where 24 ToF are used to estimate the velocity of an object moving at different controlled speeds. Experimental results show that the method consistently approximates the direction of the motion and its magnitude with an error which is in line with sensor noise.</description>

      <title>CHARMS: Cognitive Hierarchical Agent with Reasoning and Motion Styles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the current challenges of low intelligence and simplistic vehicle behavior modeling in autonomous driving simulation scenarios, this paper proposes the Cognitive Hierarchical Agent with Reasoning and Motion Styles (CHARMS). The model can reason about the behavior of other vehicles like a human driver and respond with different decision-making styles, thereby improving the intelligence and diversity of the surrounding vehicles in the driving scenario. By introducing the Level-k behavioral game theory, the paper models the decision-making process of human drivers and employs deep reinforcement learning to train the models with diverse decision styles, simulating different reasoning approaches and behavioral characteristics. Building on the Poisson cognitive hierarchy theory, this paper also presents a novel driving scenario generation method. The method controls the proportion of vehicles with different driving styles in the scenario using Poisson and binomial distributions, thus generating controllable and diverse driving environments. Experimental results demonstrate that CHARMS not only exhibits superior decision-making capabilities as ego vehicles, but also generates more complex and diverse driving scenarios as surrounding vehicles. We will release code for CHARMS at https://github.com/WUTAD-Wjy/CHARMS.</description>

      <title>Adaptive path planning for efficient object search by UAVs in agricultural fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive path planner for object search in agricultural fields using UAVs. The path planner uses a high-altitude coverage flight path and plans additional low-altitude inspections when the detection network is uncertain. The path planner was evaluated in an offline simulation environment containing real-world images. We trained a YOLOv8 detection network to detect artificial plants placed in grass fields to showcase the potential of our path planner. We evaluated the effect of different detection certainty measures, optimized the path planning parameters, investigated the effects of localization errors and different numbers of objects in the field. The YOLOv8 detection confidence worked best to differentiate between true and false positive detections and was therefore used in the adaptive planner. The optimal parameters of the path planner depended on the distribution of objects in the field, when the objects were uniformly distributed, more low-altitude inspections were needed compared to a non-uniform distribution of objects, resulting in a longer path length. The adaptive planner proved to be robust against localization uncertainty. When increasing the number of objects, the flight path length increased, especially when the objects were uniformly distributed. When the objects were non-uniformly distributed, the adaptive path planner yielded a shorter path than a low-altitude coverage path, even with high number of objects. Overall, the presented adaptive path planner allowed to find non-uniformly distributed objects in a field faster than a coverage path planner and resulted in a compatible detection accuracy. The path planner is made available at https://github.com/wur-abe/uav_adaptive_planner.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Fusion and Vision-Language Models: A Survey for Robot Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robot vision has greatly benefited from advancements in multimodal fusion techniques and vision-language models (VLMs). We systematically review the applications of multimodal fusion in key robotic vision tasks, including semantic scene understanding, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), 3D object detection, navigation and localization, and robot manipulation. We compare VLMs based on large language models (LLMs) with traditional multimodal fusion methods, analyzing their advantages, limitations, and synergies. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of commonly used datasets, evaluating their applicability and challenges in real-world robotic scenarios. Furthermore, we identify critical research challenges such as cross-modal alignment, efficient fusion strategies, real-time deployment, and domain adaptation, and propose future research directions, including self-supervised learning for robust multimodal representations, transformer-based fusion architectures, and scalable multimodal frameworks. Through a comprehensive review, comparative analysis, and forward-looking discussion, we provide a valuable reference for advancing multimodal perception and interaction in robotic vision. A comprehensive list of studies in this survey is available at https://github.com/Xiaofeng-Han-Res/MF-RV.</description>

      <title>Industrial Internet Robot Collaboration System and Edge Computing Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a complex environment, for a mobile robot to safely and collision - free avoid all obstacles, it poses high requirements for its intelligence level. Given that the information such as the position and geometric characteristics of obstacles is random, the control parameters of the robot, such as velocity and angular velocity, are also prone to random deviations. To address this issue in the framework of the Industrial Internet Robot Collaboration System, this paper proposes a global path control scheme for mobile robots based on deep learning. First of all, the dynamic equation of the mobile robot is established. According to the linear velocity and angular velocity of the mobile robot, its motion behaviors are divided into obstacle - avoidance behavior, target - turning behavior, and target approaching behavior. Subsequently, the neural network method in deep learning is used to build a global path planning model for the robot. On this basis, a fuzzy controller is designed with the help of a fuzzy control algorithm to correct the deviations that occur during path planning, thereby achieving optimized control of the robot's global path. In addition, considering edge computing optimization, the proposed model can process local data at the edge device, reducing the communication burden between the robot and the central server, and improving the real time performance of path planning. The experimental results show that for the mobile robot controlled by the research method in this paper, the deviation distance of the path angle is within 5 cm, the deviation convergence can be completed within 10 ms, and the planned path is shorter. This indicates that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the global path planning ability of mobile robots in the industrial Internet environment and promote the collaborative operation of robots through edge computing optimization.</description>

      <title>A Planning Framework for Stable Robust Multi-Contact Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While modeling multi-contact manipulation as a quasi-static mechanical process transitioning between different contact equilibria, we propose formulating it as a planning and optimization problem, explicitly evaluating (i) contact stability and (ii) robustness to sensor noise. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive study on multi-manipulator control strategies, focusing on dual-arm execution in a planar peg-in-hole task and extending it to the Multi-Manipulator Multiple Peg-in-Hole (MMPiH) problem to explore increased task complexity. Our framework employs Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) to parameterize desired trajectories and Black-Box Optimization (BBO) with a comprehensive cost function incorporating friction cone constraints, squeeze forces, and stability considerations. By integrating parallel scenario training, we enhance the robustness of the learned policies. To evaluate the friction cone cost in experiments, we test the optimal trajectories computed for various contact surfaces, i.e., with different coefficients of friction. The stability cost is analytical explained and tested its necessity in simulation. The robustness performance is quantified through variations of hole pose and chamfer size in simulation and experiment. Results demonstrate that our approach achieves consistently high success rates in both the single peg-in-hole and multiple peg-in-hole tasks, confirming its effectiveness and generalizability.

      <title>Autonomous Human-Robot Interaction via Operator Imitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teleoperated robotic characters can perform expressive interactions with humans, relying on the operators' experience and social intuition. In this work, we propose to create autonomous interactive robots, by training a model to imitate operator data. Our model is trained on a dataset of human-robot interactions, where an expert operator is asked to vary the interactions and mood of the robot, while the operator commands as well as the pose of the human and robot are recorded. Our approach learns to predict continuous operator commands through a diffusion process and discrete commands through a classifier, all unified within a single transformer architecture. We evaluate the resulting model in simulation and with a user study on the real system. We show that our method enables simple autonomous human-robot interactions that are comparable to the expert-operator baseline, and that users can recognize the different robot moods as generated by our model. Finally, we demonstrate a zero-shot transfer of our model onto a different robotic platform with the same operator interface.</description>

      <title>Robot-Led Vision Language Model Wellbeing Assessment of Children</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel robot-led approach to assessing children's mental wellbeing using a Vision Language Model (VLM). Inspired by the Child Apperception Test (CAT), the social robot NAO presented children with pictorial stimuli to elicit their verbal narratives of the images, which were then evaluated by a VLM in accordance with CAT assessment guidelines. The VLM's assessments were systematically compared to those provided by a trained psychologist. The results reveal that while the VLM demonstrates moderate reliability in identifying cases with no wellbeing concerns, its ability to accurately classify assessments with clinical concern remains limited. Moreover, although the model's performance was generally consistent when prompted with varying demographic factors such as age and gender, a significantly higher false positive rate was observed for girls, indicating potential sensitivity to gender attribute. These findings highlight both the promise and the challenges of integrating VLMs into robot-led assessments of children's wellbeing.</description>

      <title>BT-ACTION: A Test-Driven Approach for Modular Understanding of User Instruction Leveraging Behaviour Trees and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural language instructions are often abstract and complex, requiring robots to execute multiple subtasks even for seemingly simple queries. For example, when a user asks a robot to prepare avocado toast, the task involves several sequential steps. Moreover, such instructions can be ambiguous or infeasible for the robot or may exceed the robot's existing knowledge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong language reasoning capabilities to handle these challenges, effectively integrating them into robotic systems remains a key challenge. To address this, we propose BT-ACTION, a test-driven approach that combines the modular structure of Behavior Trees (BT) with LLMs to generate coherent sequences of robot actions for following complex user instructions, specifically in the context of preparing recipes in a kitchen-assistance setting. We evaluated BT-ACTION in a comprehensive user study with 45 participants, comparing its performance to direct LLM prompting. Results demonstrate that the modular design of BT-ACTION helped the robot make fewer mistakes and increased user trust, and participants showed a significant preference for the robot leveraging BT-ACTION. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/1Eggbert7/BT_LLM.</description>

      <title>Unified World Models: Coupling Video and Action Diffusion for Pretraining on Large Robotic Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation learning has emerged as a promising approach towards building generalist robots. However, scaling imitation learning for large robot foundation models remains challenging due to its reliance on high-quality expert demonstrations. Meanwhile, large amounts of video data depicting a wide range of environments and diverse behaviors are readily available. This data provides a rich source of information about real-world dynamics and agent-environment interactions. Leveraging this data directly for imitation learning, however, has proven difficult due to the lack of action annotation required for most contemporary methods. In this work, we present Unified World Models (UWM), a framework that allows for leveraging both video and action data for policy learning. Specifically, a UWM integrates an action diffusion process and a video diffusion process within a unified transformer architecture, where independent diffusion timesteps govern each modality. We show that by simply controlling each diffusion timestep, UWM can flexibly represent a policy, a forward dynamics, an inverse dynamics, and a video generator. Through simulated and real-world experiments, we show that: (1) UWM enables effective pretraining on large-scale multitask robot datasets with both dynamics and action predictions, resulting in more generalizable and robust policies than imitation learning, (2) UWM naturally facilitates learning from action-free video data through independent control of modality-specific diffusion timesteps, further improving the performance of finetuned policies. Our results suggest that UWM offers a promising step toward harnessing large, heterogeneous datasets for scalable robot learning, and provides a simple unification between the often disparate paradigms of imitation learning and world modeling.

      <title>Impedance and Stability Targeted Adaptation for Aerial Manipulator with Unknown Coupling Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stable aerial manipulation during dynamic tasks such as object catching, perching, or contact with rigid surfaces necessarily requires compliant behavior, which is often achieved via impedance control. Successful manipulation depends on how effectively the impedance control can tackle the unavoidable coupling forces between the aerial vehicle and the manipulator. However, the existing impedance controllers for aerial manipulator either ignore these coupling forces (in partitioned system compliance methods) or require their precise knowledge (in complete system compliance methods). Unfortunately, such forces are very difficult to model, if at all possible. To solve this long-standing control challenge, we introduce an impedance controller for aerial manipulator which does not rely on a priori knowledge of the system dynamics and of the coupling forces. The impedance control design can address unknown coupling forces, along with system parametric uncertainties, via suitably designed adaptive laws. The closed-loop system stability is proved analytically and experimental results with a payload-catching scenario demonstrate significant improvements in overall stability and tracking over the state-of-the-art impedance controllers using either partitioned or complete system compliance.</description>

Abstract: This paper reports an attempt to model the system dynamics and estimate both the unknown internal control input and the state of a recently developed marine autonomous vehicle, the Jaiabot. Although the Jaiabot has shown promise in many applications, process and sensor noise necessitates state estimation and noise filtering. In this work, we present the first surge and heading linear dynamical model for Jaiabots derived from real data collected during field testing. An adaptive input estimation algorithm is implemented to accurately estimate the control input and hence the state. For validation, this approach is compared to the classical Kalman filter, highlighting its advantages in handling unknown control inputs.</description>

      <title>Designing Effective Human-Swarm Interaction Interfaces: Insights from a User Study on Task Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a systematic method of design for human-swarm interaction interfaces, combining theoretical insights with empirical evaluation. We first derive ten design principles from existing literature, apply them to key information dimensions identified through goal-directed task analysis and developed a tablet-based interface for a target search task. We then conducted a user study with 31 participants where humans were required to guide a robotic swarm to a target in the presence of three types of hazards that pose a risk to the robots: Distributed, Moving, and Spreading. Performance was measured based on the proximity of the robots to the target and the number of deactivated robots at the end of the task. Results indicate that at least one robot was bought closer to the target in 98% of tasks, demonstrating the interface's success fulfilling the primary objective of the task. Additionally, in nearly 67% of tasks, more than 50% of the robots reached the target. Moreover, particularly better performance was noted in moving hazards. Additionally, the interface appeared to help minimize robot deactivation, as evidenced by nearly 94% of tasks where participants managed to keep more than 50% of the robots active, ensuring that most of the swarm remained operational. However, its effectiveness varied across hazards, with robot deactivation being lowest in distributed hazard scenarios, suggesting that the interface provided the most support in these conditions.</description>

      <title>Adapting World Models with Latent-State Dynamics Residuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation-to-reality reinforcement learning (RL) faces the critical challenge of reconciling discrepancies between simulated and real-world dynamics, which can severely degrade agent performance. A promising approach involves learning corrections to simulator forward dynamics represented as a residual error function, however this operation is impractical with high-dimensional states such as images. To overcome this, we propose ReDRAW, a latent-state autoregressive world model pretrained in simulation and calibrated to target environments through residual corrections of latent-state dynamics rather than of explicit observed states. Using this adapted world model, ReDRAW enables RL agents to be optimized with imagined rollouts under corrected dynamics and then deployed in the real world. In multiple vision-based MuJoCo domains and a physical robot visual lane-following task, ReDRAW effectively models changes to dynamics and avoids overfitting in low data regimes where traditional transfer methods fail.</description>

      <title>MinkOcc: Towards real-time label-efficient semantic occupancy prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing 3D semantic occupancy prediction models often relies on dense 3D annotations for supervised learning, a process that is both labor and resource-intensive, underscoring the need for label-efficient or even label-free approaches. To address this, we introduce MinkOcc, a multi-modal 3D semantic occupancy prediction framework for cameras and LiDARs that proposes a two-step semi-supervised training procedure. Here, a small dataset of explicitly 3D annotations warm-starts the training process; then, the supervision is continued by simpler-to-annotate accumulated LiDAR sweeps and images -- semantically labelled through vision foundational models. MinkOcc effectively utilizes these sensor-rich supervisory cues and reduces reliance on manual labeling by 90\% while maintaining competitive accuracy. In addition, the proposed model incorporates information from LiDAR and camera data through early fusion and leverages sparse convolution networks for real-time prediction. With its efficiency in both supervision and computation, we aim to extend MinkOcc beyond curated datasets, enabling broader real-world deployment of 3D semantic occupancy prediction in autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>X-Capture: An Open-Source Portable Device for Multi-Sensory Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding objects through multiple sensory modalities is fundamental to human perception, enabling cross-sensory integration and richer comprehension. For AI and robotic systems to replicate this ability, access to diverse, high-quality multi-sensory data is critical. Existing datasets are often limited by their focus on controlled environments, simulated objects, or restricted modality pairings. We introduce X-Capture, an open-source, portable, and cost-effective device for real-world multi-sensory data collection, capable of capturing correlated RGBD images, tactile readings, and impact audio. With a build cost under $1,000, X-Capture democratizes the creation of multi-sensory datasets, requiring only consumer-grade tools for assembly. Using X-Capture, we curate a sample dataset of 3,000 total points on 500 everyday objects from diverse, real-world environments, offering both richness and variety. Our experiments demonstrate the value of both the quantity and the sensory breadth of our data for both pretraining and fine-tuning multi-modal representations for object-centric tasks such as cross-sensory retrieval and reconstruction. X-Capture lays the groundwork for advancing human-like sensory representations in AI, emphasizing scalability, accessibility, and real-world applicability.</description>

      <title>All-day Depth Completion via Thermal-LiDAR Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depth completion, which estimates dense depth from sparse LiDAR and RGB images, has demonstrated outstanding performance in well-lit conditions. However, due to the limitations of RGB sensors, existing methods often struggle to achieve reliable performance in harsh environments, such as heavy rain and low-light conditions. Furthermore, we observe that ground truth depth maps often suffer from large missing measurements in adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, leading to insufficient supervision. In contrast, thermal cameras are known for providing clear and reliable visibility in such conditions, yet research on thermal-LiDAR depth completion remains underexplored. Moreover, the characteristics of thermal images, such as blurriness, low contrast, and noise, bring unclear depth boundary problems. To address these challenges, we first evaluate the feasibility and robustness of thermal-LiDAR depth completion across diverse lighting (eg., well-lit, low-light), weather (eg., clear-sky, rainy), and environment (eg., indoor, outdoor) conditions, by conducting extensive benchmarks on the MS$^2$ and ViViD datasets. In addition, we propose a framework that utilizes COntrastive learning and Pseudo-Supervision (COPS) to enhance depth boundary clarity and improve completion accuracy by leveraging a depth foundation model in two key ways. First, COPS enforces a depth-aware contrastive loss between different depth points by mining positive and negative samples using a monocular depth foundation model to sharpen depth boundaries. Second, it mitigates the issue of incomplete supervision from ground truth depth maps by leveraging foundation model predictions as dense depth priors. We also provide in-depth analyses of the key challenges in thermal-LiDAR depth completion to aid in understanding the task and encourage future research.</description>

      <title>A Memory-Augmented LLM-Driven Method for Autonomous Merging of 3D Printing Work Orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of 3D printing, the demand for personalized and customized production on the manufacturing line is steadily increasing. Efficient merging of printing workpieces can significantly enhance the processing efficiency of the production line. Addressing the challenge, a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven method is established in this paper for the autonomous merging of 3D printing work orders, integrated with a memory-augmented learning strategy. In industrial scenarios, both device and order features are modeled into LLM-readable natural language prompt templates, and develop an order-device matching tool along with a merging interference checking module. By incorporating a self-memory learning strategy, an intelligent agent for autonomous order merging is constructed, resulting in improved accuracy and precision in order allocation. The proposed method effectively leverages the strengths of LLMs in industrial applications while reducing hallucination.</description>

      <title>HEROS: Hierarchical Exploration with Online Subregion Updating for 3D Environment Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11326v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an autonomous exploration system for efficient coverage of unknown environments. First, a rapid environment preprocessing method is introduced to provide environmental information for subsequent exploration planning. Then, the whole exploration space is divided into multiple subregion cells, each with varying levels of detail. The subregion cells are capable of decomposition and updating online, effectively characterizing dynamic unknown regions with variable resolution. Finally, the hierarchical planning strategy treats subregions as basic planning units and computes an efficient global coverage path. Guided by the global path, the local path that sequentially visits the viewpoint set is refined to provide an executable path for the robot. This hierarchical planning from coarse to fine steps reduces the complexity of the planning scheme while improving exploration efficiency. The proposed method is compared with state-of-art methods in benchmark environments. Our approach demonstrates superior efficiency in completing exploration while using lower computational resources.</description>

      <title>R+X: Retrieval and Execution from Everyday Human Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present R+X, a framework which enables robots to learn skills from long, unlabelled, first-person videos of humans performing everyday tasks. Given a language command from a human, R+X first retrieves short video clips containing relevant behaviour, and then executes the skill by conditioning an in-context imitation learning method (KAT) on this behaviour. By leveraging a Vision Language Model (VLM) for retrieval, R+X does not require any manual annotation of the videos, and by leveraging in-context learning for execution, robots can perform commanded skills immediately, without requiring a period of training on the retrieved videos. Experiments studying a range of everyday household tasks show that R+X succeeds at translating unlabelled human videos into robust robot skills, and that R+X outperforms several recent alternative methods. Videos and code are available at https://www.robot-learning.uk/r-plus-x.</description>

      <title>MI-HGNN: Morphology-Informed Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Legged Robot Contact Perception</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Morphology-Informed Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (MI-HGNN) for learning-based contact perception. The architecture and connectivity of the MI-HGNN are constructed from the robot morphology, in which nodes and edges are robot joints and links, respectively. By incorporating the morphology-informed constraints into a neural network, we improve a learning-based approach using model-based knowledge. We apply the proposed MI-HGNN to two contact perception problems, and conduct extensive experiments using both real-world and simulated data collected using two quadruped robots. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of effectiveness, generalization ability, model efficiency, and sample efficiency. Our MI-HGNN improved the performance of a state-of-the-art model that leverages robot morphological symmetry by 8.4% with only 0.21% of its parameters. Although MI-HGNN is applied to contact perception problems for legged robots in this work, it can be seamlessly applied to other types of multi-body dynamical systems and has the potential to improve other robot learning frameworks. Our code is made publicly available at https://github.com/lunarlab-gatech/Morphology-Informed-HGNN.</description>

      <title>GRACE: Generating Socially Appropriate Robot Actions Leveraging LLMs and Human Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When operating in human environments, robots need to handle complex tasks while both adhering to social norms and accommodating individual preferences. For instance, based on common sense knowledge, a household robot can predict that it should avoid vacuuming during a social gathering, but it may still be uncertain whether it should vacuum before or after having guests. In such cases, integrating common-sense knowledge with human preferences, often conveyed through human explanations, is fundamental yet a challenge for existing systems. In this paper, we introduce GRACE, a novel approach addressing this while generating socially appropriate robot actions. GRACE leverages common sense knowledge from LLMs, and it integrates this knowledge with human explanations through a generative network. The bidirectional structure of GRACE enables robots to refine and enhance LLM predictions by utilizing human explanations and makes robots capable of generating such explanations for human-specified actions. Our evaluations show that integrating human explanations boosts GRACE's performance, where it outperforms several baselines and provides sensible explanations.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Adapting Human-Robot Interaction to Diverse User Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To facilitate natural and intuitive interactions with diverse user groups in real-world settings, social robots must be capable of addressing the varying requirements and expectations of these groups while adapting their behavior based on user feedback. While previous research often focuses on specific demographics, we present a novel framework for adaptive Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) that tailors interactions to different user groups and enables individual users to modulate interactions through both minor and major interruptions. Our primary contributions include the development of an adaptive, ROS-based HRI framework with an open-source code base. This framework supports natural interactions through advanced speech recognition and voice activity detection, and leverages a large language model (LLM) as a dialogue bridge. We validate the efficiency of our framework through module tests and system trials, demonstrating its high accuracy in age recognition and its robustness to repeated user inputs and plan changes.</description>

      <title>STEAK: Streaming Network for Continual Learning of Object Relocations under Household Context Drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In real-world settings, robots are expected to assist humans across diverse tasks and still continuously adapt to dynamic changes over time. For example, in domestic environments, robots can proactively help users by fetching needed objects based on learned routines, which they infer by observing how objects move over time. However, data from these interactions are inherently non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-i.i.d.), e.g., a robot assisting multiple users may encounter varying data distributions as individuals follow distinct habits. This creates a challenge: integrating new knowledge without catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose STREAK (Spatio Temporal RElocation with Adaptive Knowledge retention), a continual learning framework for real-world robotic learning. It leverages a streaming graph neural network with regularization and rehearsal techniques to mitigate context drifts while retaining past knowledge. Our method is time- and memory-efficient, enabling long-term learning without retraining on all past data, which becomes infeasible as data grows in real-world interactions. We evaluate STREAK on the task of incrementally predicting human routines over 50+ days across different households. Results show that it effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting while maintaining generalization, making it a scalable solution for long-term human-robot interactions.</description>

      <title>Online Hybrid-Belief POMDP with Coupled Semantic-Geometric Models and Semantic Safety Awareness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11202v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robots operating in complex and unknown environments frequently require geometric-semantic representations of the environment to safely perform their tasks. While inferring the environment, they must account for many possible scenarios when planning future actions. Since objects' class types are discrete and the robot's self-pose and the objects' poses are continuous, the environment can be represented by a hybrid discrete-continuous belief which is updated according to models and incoming data. Prior probabilities and observation models representing the environment can be learned from data using deep learning algorithms. Such models often couple environmental semantic and geometric properties. As a result, semantic variables are interconnected, causing semantic state space dimensionality to increase exponentially. In this paper, we consider planning under uncertainty using partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with hybrid semantic-geometric beliefs. The models and priors consider the coupling between semantic and geometric variables. Within POMDP, we introduce the concept of semantically aware safety. Obtaining representative samples of the theoretical hybrid belief, required for estimating the value function, is very challenging. As a key contribution, we develop a novel form of the hybrid belief and leverage it to sample representative samples. We show that under certain conditions, the value function and probability of safety can be calculated efficiently with an explicit expectation over all possible semantic mappings. Our simulations show that our estimates of the objective function and probability of safety achieve similar levels of accuracy compared to estimators that run exhaustively on the entire semantic state-space using samples from the theoretical hybrid belief. Nevertheless, the complexity of our estimators is polynomial rather than exponential.</description>

      <title>AutoEval: Autonomous Evaluation of Generalist Robot Manipulation Policies in the Real World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalable and reproducible policy evaluation has been a long-standing challenge in robot learning. Evaluations are critical to assess progress and build better policies, but evaluation in the real world, especially at a scale that would provide statistically reliable results, is costly in terms of human time and hard to obtain. Evaluation of increasingly generalist robot policies requires an increasingly diverse repertoire of evaluation environments, making the evaluation bottleneck even more pronounced. To make real-world evaluation of robotic policies more practical, we propose AutoEval, a system to autonomously evaluate generalist robot policies around the clock with minimal human intervention. Users interact with AutoEval by submitting evaluation jobs to the AutoEval queue, much like how software jobs are submitted with a cluster scheduling system, and AutoEval will schedule the policies for evaluation within a framework supplying automatic success detection and automatic scene resets. We show that AutoEval can nearly fully eliminate human involvement in the evaluation process, permitting around the clock evaluations, and the evaluation results correspond closely to ground truth evaluations conducted by hand. To facilitate the evaluation of generalist policies in the robotics community, we provide public access to multiple AutoEval scenes in the popular BridgeData robot setup with WidowX robot arms. In the future, we hope that AutoEval scenes can be set up across institutions to form a diverse and distributed evaluation network.</description>

      <title>6DOPE-GS: Online 6D Object Pose Estimation using Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient and accurate object pose estimation is an essential component for modern vision systems in many applications such as Augmented Reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. While research in model-based 6D object pose estimation has delivered promising results, model-free methods are hindered by the high computational load in rendering and inferring consistent poses of arbitrary objects in a live RGB-D video stream. To address this issue, we present 6DOPE-GS, a novel method for online 6D object pose estimation \&amp; tracking with a single RGB-D camera by effectively leveraging advances in Gaussian Splatting. Thanks to the fast differentiable rendering capabilities of Gaussian Splatting, 6DOPE-GS can simultaneously optimize for 6D object poses and 3D object reconstruction. To achieve the necessary efficiency and accuracy for live tracking, our method uses incremental 2D Gaussian Splatting with an intelligent dynamic keyframe selection procedure to achieve high spatial object coverage and prevent erroneous pose updates. We also propose an opacity statistic-based pruning mechanism for adaptive Gaussian density control, to ensure training stability and efficiency. We evaluate our method on the HO3D and YCBInEOAT datasets and show that 6DOPE-GS matches the performance of state-of-the-art baselines for model-free simultaneous 6D pose tracking and reconstruction while providing a 5$\times$ speedup. We also demonstrate the method's suitability for live, dynamic object tracking and reconstruction in a real-world setting.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for modeling and conditional generation of 3D articulated objects. Troubled by flexibility-quality tradeoffs, existing methods are often limited to using predefined structures or retrieving shapes from static datasets. To address these challenges, we parameterize an articulated object as a tree of tokens and employ a transformer to generate both the object's high-level geometry code and its kinematic relations. Subsequently, each sub-part's geometry is further decoded using a signed-distance-function (SDF) shape prior, facilitating the synthesis of high-quality 3D shapes. Our approach enables the generation of diverse objects with high-quality geometry and varying number of parts. Comprehensive experiments on conditional generation from text descriptions demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our method.</description>

      <title>SAT: Dynamic Spatial Aptitude Training for Multimodal Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reasoning about motion and space is a fundamental cognitive capability that is required by multiple real-world applications. While many studies highlight that large multimodal language models (MLMs) struggle to reason about space, they only focus on static spatial relationships, and not dynamic awareness of motion and space, i.e., reasoning about the effect of egocentric and object motions on spatial relationships. Manually annotating such object and camera movements is expensive. Hence, we introduce SAT, a simulated spatial aptitude training dataset comprising both static and dynamic spatial reasoning across 175K question-answer (QA) pairs and 20K scenes. Complementing this, we also construct a small (150 image-QAs) yet challenging dynamic spatial test set using real-world images. Leveraging our SAT datasets and 6 existing static spatial benchmarks, we systematically investigate what improves both static and dynamic spatial awareness. Our results reveal that simulations are surprisingly effective at imparting spatial aptitude to MLMs that translate to real images. We show that perfect annotations in simulation are more effective than existing approaches of pseudo-annotating real images. For instance, SAT training improves a LLaVA-13B model by an average 11% and a LLaVA-Video-7B model by an average 8% on multiple spatial benchmarks, including our real-image dynamic test set and spatial reasoning on long videos -- even outperforming some large proprietary models. While reasoning over static relationships improves with synthetic training data, there is still considerable room for improvement for dynamic reasoning questions.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear real time capable motion cueing algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10419v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In motion simulation, motion cueing algorithms are used for the trajectory planning of the motion simulator platform, where workspace limitations prevent direct reproduction of reference trajectories. Strategies such as motion washout, which return the platform to its center, are crucial in these settings. For serial robotic MSPs with highly nonlinear workspaces, it is essential to maximize the efficient utilization of the MSPs kinematic and dynamic capabilities. Traditional approaches, including classical washout filtering and linear model predictive control, fail to consider platform-specific, nonlinear properties, while nonlinear model predictive control, though comprehensive, imposes high computational demands that hinder real-time, pilot-in-the-loop application without further simplification. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning for motion cueing, demonstrated here for the first time in a 6-degree-of-freedom setting with full consideration of the MSPs kinematic nonlinearities. Previous work by the authors successfully demonstrated the application of DRL to a simplified 2-DOF setup, which did not consider kinematic or dynamic constraints. This approach has been extended to all 6 DOF by incorporating a complete kinematic model of the MSP into the algorithm, a crucial step for enabling its application on a real motion simulator. The training of the DRL-MCA is based on Proximal Policy Optimization in an actor-critic implementation combined with an automated hyperparameter optimization. After detailing the necessary training framework and the algorithm itself, we provide a comprehensive validation, demonstrating that the DRL MCA achieves competitive performance against established algorithms. Moreover, it generates feasible trajectories by respecting all system constraints and meets all real-time requirements with low...</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws in Scientific Discovery with AI and Robot Scientists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientific discovery is poised for rapid advancement through advanced robotics and artificial intelligence. Current scientific practices face substantial limitations as manual experimentation remains time-consuming and resource-intensive, while multidisciplinary research demands knowledge integration beyond individual researchers' expertise boundaries. Here, we envision an autonomous generalist scientist (AGS) concept combines agentic AI and embodied robotics to automate the entire research lifecycle. This system could dynamically interact with both physical and virtual environments while facilitating the integration of knowledge across diverse scientific disciplines. By deploying these technologies throughout every research stage -- spanning literature review, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and manuscript writing -- and incorporating internal reflection alongside external feedback, this system aims to significantly reduce the time and resources needed for scientific discovery. Building on the evolution from virtual AI scientists to versatile generalist AI-based robot scientists, AGS promises groundbreaking potential. As these autonomous systems become increasingly integrated into the research process, we hypothesize that scientific discovery might adhere to new scaling laws, potentially shaped by the number and capabilities of these autonomous systems, offering novel perspectives on how knowledge is generated and evolves. The adaptability of embodied robots to extreme environments, paired with the flywheel effect of accumulating scientific knowledge, holds the promise of continually pushing beyond both physical and intellectual frontiers.</description>

      <title>Beyond Non-Expert Demonstrations: Outcome-Driven Action Constraint for Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of offline reinforcement learning using realistic data, specifically non-expert data collected through sub-optimal behavior policies. Under such circumstance, the learned policy must be safe enough to manage distribution shift while maintaining sufficient flexibility to deal with non-expert (bad) demonstrations from offline data.To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel method called Outcome-Driven Action Flexibility (ODAF), which seeks to reduce reliance on the empirical action distribution of the behavior policy, hence reducing the negative impact of those bad demonstrations.To be specific, a new conservative reward mechanism is developed to deal with distribution shift by evaluating actions according to whether their outcomes meet safety requirements - remaining within the state support area, rather than solely depending on the actions' likelihood based on offline data.Besides theoretical justification, we provide empirical evidence on widely used MuJoCo and various maze benchmarks, demonstrating that our ODAF method, implemented using uncertainty quantification techniques, effectively tolerates unseen transitions for improved "trajectory stitching," while enhancing the agent's ability to learn from realistic non-expert data.</description>
