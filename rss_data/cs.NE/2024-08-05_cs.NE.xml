      <title>SpikeVoice: High-Quality Text-to-Speech Via Efficient Spiking Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Network (SNN) has demonstrated its effectiveness and efficiency in vision, natural language, and speech understanding tasks, indicating their capacity to "see", "listen", and "read". In this paper, we design \textbf{SpikeVoice}, which performs high-quality Text-To-Speech (TTS) via SNN, to explore the potential of SNN to "speak". A major obstacle to using SNN for such generative tasks lies in the demand for models to grasp long-term dependencies. The serial nature of spiking neurons, however, leads to the invisibility of information at future spiking time steps, limiting SNN models to capture sequence dependencies solely within the same time step. We term this phenomenon "partial-time dependency". To address this issue, we introduce Spiking Temporal-Sequential Attention STSA in the SpikeVoice. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeVoice is the first TTS work in the SNN field. We perform experiments using four well-established datasets that cover both Chinese and English languages, encompassing scenarios with both single-speaker and multi-speaker configurations. The results demonstrate that SpikeVoice can achieve results comparable to Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with only 10.5 energy consumption of ANN.</description>

      <title>Improving Air Mobility for Pre-Disaster Planning with Neural Network Accelerated Genetic Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weather disaster related emergency operations pose a great challenge to air mobility in both aircraft and airport operations, especially when the impact is gradually approaching. We propose an optimized framework for adjusting airport operational schedules for such pre-disaster scenarios. We first, aggregate operational data from multiple airports and then determine the optimal count of evacuation flights to maximize the impacted airport's outgoing capacity without impeding regular air traffic. We then propose a novel Neural Network (NN) accelerated Genetic Algorithm(GA) for evacuation planning. Our experiments show that integration yielded comparable results but with smaller computational overhead. We find that the utilization of a NN enhances the efficiency of a GA, facilitating more rapid convergence even when operating with a reduced population size. This effectiveness persists even when the model is trained on data from airports different from those under test.</description>

      <title>CCSRP: Robust Pruning of Spiking Neural Networks through Cooperative Coevolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have shown promise in various dynamic visual tasks, yet those ready for practical deployment often lack the compactness and robustness essential in resource-limited and safety-critical settings. Prior research has predominantly concentrated on enhancing the compactness or robustness of artificial neural networks through strategies like network pruning and adversarial training, with little exploration into similar methodologies for SNNs. Robust pruning of SNNs aims to reduce computational overhead while preserving both accuracy and robustness. Current robust pruning approaches generally necessitate expert knowledge and iterative experimentation to establish suitable pruning criteria or auxiliary modules, thus constraining their broader application. Concurrently, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been employed to automate the pruning of artificial neural networks, delivering remarkable outcomes yet overlooking the aspect of robustness. In this work, we propose CCSRP, an innovative robust pruning method for SNNs, underpinned by cooperative co-evolution. Robust pruning is articulated as a tri-objective optimization challenge, striving to balance accuracy, robustness, and compactness concurrently, resolved through a cooperative co-evolutionary pruning framework that independently prunes filters across layers using EAs. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and SVHN demonstrate that CCSRP can match or exceed the performance of the latest methodologies.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Time Neural Networks Can Stably Memorize Random Spike Trains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper explores the capability of continuous-time recurrent neural networks to store and recall precisely timed spike patterns. We show (by numerical experiments) that this is indeed possible: within some range of parameters, any random score of spike trains (for all neurons in the network) can be robustly memorized and autonomously reproduced with stable accurate relative timing of all spikes, with probability close to one. We also demonstrate associative recall under noisy conditions.
  In these experiments, the required synaptic weights are computed offline, to satisfy a template that encourages temporal stability.</description>

      <title>General-purpose Dataflow Model with Neuromorphic Primitives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing exhibits great potential to provide high-performance benefits in various applications beyond neural networks. However, a general-purpose program execution model that aligns with the features of neuromorphic computing is required to bridge the gap between program versatility and neuromorphic hardware efficiency. The dataflow model offers a potential solution, but it faces high graph complexity and incompatibility with neuromorphic hardware when dealing with control flow programs, which decreases the programmability and performance. Here, we present a dataflow model tailored for neuromorphic hardware, called neuromorphic dataflow, which provides a compact, concise, and neuromorphic-compatible program representation for control logic. The neuromorphic dataflow introduces "when" and "where" primitives, which restructure the view of control. The neuromorphic dataflow embeds these primitives in the dataflow schema with the plasticity inherited from the spiking algorithms. Our method enables the deployment of general-purpose programs on neuromorphic hardware with both programmability and plasticity, while fully utilizing the hardware's potential.</description>

      <title>Breaching the Bottleneck: Evolutionary Transition from Reward-Driven Learning to Reward-Agnostic Domain-Adapted Learning in Neuromodulated Neural Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advanced biological intelligence learns efficiently from an information-rich stream of stimulus information, even when feedback on behaviour quality is sparse or absent. Such learning exploits implicit assumptions about task domains. We refer to such learning as Domain-Adapted Learning (DAL). In contrast, AI learning algorithms rely on explicit externally provided measures of behaviour quality to acquire fit behaviour. This imposes an information bottleneck that precludes learning from diverse non-reward stimulus information, limiting learning efficiency. We consider the question of how biological evolution circumvents this bottleneck to produce DAL. We propose that species first evolve the ability to learn from reward signals, providing inefficient (bottlenecked) but broad adaptivity. From there, integration of non-reward information into the learning process can proceed via gradual accumulation of biases induced by such information on specific task domains. This scenario provides a biologically plausible pathway towards bottleneck-free, domain-adapted learning. Focusing on the second phase of this scenario, we set up a population of NNs with reward-driven learning modelled as Reinforcement Learning (A2C), and allow evolution to improve learning efficiency by integrating non-reward information into the learning process using a neuromodulatory update mechanism. On a navigation task in continuous 2D space, evolved DAL agents show a 300-fold increase in learning speed compared to pure RL agents. Evolution is found to eliminate reliance on reward information altogether, allowing DAL agents to learn from non-reward information exclusively, using local neuromodulation-based connection weight updates only.

      <title>Computational Life: How Well-formed, Self-replicating Programs Emerge from Simple Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fields of Origin of Life and Artificial Life both question what life is and how it emerges from a distinct set of "pre-life" dynamics. One common feature of most substrates where life emerges is a marked shift in dynamics when self-replication appears. While there are some hypotheses regarding how self-replicators arose in nature, we know very little about the general dynamics, computational principles, and necessary conditions for self-replicators to emerge. This is especially true on "computational substrates" where interactions involve logical, mathematical, or programming rules. In this paper we take a step towards understanding how self-replicators arise by studying several computational substrates based on various simple programming languages and machine instruction sets. We show that when random, non self-replicating programs are placed in an environment lacking any explicit fitness landscape, self-replicators tend to arise. We demonstrate how this occurs due to random interactions and self-modification, and can happen with and without background random mutations. We also show how increasingly complex dynamics continue to emerge following the rise of self-replicators. Finally, we show a counterexample of a minimalistic programming language where self-replicators are possible, but so far have not been observed to arise.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Efficient Event-based Semantic Segmentation Using Adaptive Spiking Encoder-Decoder Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs), known for their low-power, event-driven computation and intrinsic temporal dynamics, are emerging as promising solutions for processing dynamic, asynchronous signals from event-based sensors. Despite their potential, SNNs face challenges in training and architectural design, resulting in limited performance in challenging event-based dense prediction tasks compared to artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this work, we develop an efficient spiking encoder-decoder network (SpikingEDN) for large-scale event-based semantic segmentation tasks. To enhance the learning efficiency from dynamic event streams, we harness the adaptive threshold which improves network accuracy, sparsity and robustness in streaming inference. Moreover, we develop a dual-path Spiking Spatially-Adaptive Modulation module, which is specifically tailored to enhance the representation of sparse events and multi-modal inputs, thereby considerably improving network performance. Our SpikingEDN attains a mean intersection over union (MIoU) of 72.57\% on the DDD17 dataset and 58.32\% on the larger DSEC-Semantic dataset, showing competitive results to the state-of-the-art ANNs while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. Our results shed light on the untapped potential of SNNs in event-based vision applications. The source code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Reservoir computing with logistic map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies on reservoir computing essentially involve a high dimensional dynamical system as the reservoir, which transforms and stores the input as a higher dimensional state, for temporal and nontemporal data processing. We demonstrate here a method to predict temporal and nontemporal tasks by constructing virtual nodes as constituting a reservoir in reservoir computing using a nonlinear map, namely the logistic map, and a simple finite trigonometric series. We predict three nonlinear systems, namely Lorenz, Rossler, and Hindmarsh-Rose, for temporal tasks and a seventh order polynomial for nontemporal tasks with great accuracy. Also, the prediction is made in the presence of noise and found to closely agree with the target. Remarkably, the logistic map performs well and predicts close to the actual or target values. The low values of the root mean square error confirm the accuracy of this method in terms of efficiency. Our approach removes the necessity of continuous dynamical systems for constructing the reservoir in reservoir computing. Moreover, the accurate prediction for the three different nonlinear systems suggests that this method can be considered a general one and can be applied to predict many systems. Finally, we show that the method also accurately anticipates the time series of the all the three variable of Rossler system for the future (self prediction).</description>
