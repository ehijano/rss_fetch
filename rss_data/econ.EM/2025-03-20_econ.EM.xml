      <title>Testing Conditional Stochastic Dominance at Target Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel test for conditional stochastic dominance (CSD) at specific values of the conditioning covariates, referred to as target points. The test is relevant for analyzing income inequality, evaluating treatment effects, and studying discrimination. We propose a Kolmogorov-Smirnov-type test statistic that utilizes induced order statistics from independent samples. Notably, the test features a data-independent critical value, eliminating the need for resampling techniques such as the bootstrap. Our approach avoids kernel smoothing and parametric assumptions, instead relying on a tuning parameter to select relevant observations. We establish the asymptotic properties of our test, showing that the induced order statistics converge to independent draws from the true conditional distributions and that the test controls asymptotic size under weak regularity conditions. While our results apply to both continuous and discrete data, in the discrete case, the critical value only provides a valid upper bound. To address this, we propose a refined critical value that significantly enhances power, requiring only knowledge of the support size of the distributions. Additionally, we analyze the test's behavior in the limit experiment, demonstrating that it reduces to a problem analogous to testing unconditional stochastic dominance in finite samples. This framework allows us to prove the validity of permutation-based tests for stochastic dominance when the random variables are continuous. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the strong finite-sample performance of our method.</description>

      <title>Linear programming approach to partially identified econometric models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sharp bounds on partially identified parameters are often given by the values of linear programs (LPs). This paper introduces a novel estimator of the LP value. Unlike existing procedures, our estimator is root-n-consistent, pointwise in the probability measure, whenever the population LP is feasible and finite. Our estimator is valid under point-identification, over-identifying constraints, and solution multiplicity. Turning to uniformity properties, we prove that the LP value cannot be uniformly consistently estimated without restricting the set of possible distributions. We then show that our estimator achieves uniform consistency under a condition that is minimal for the existence of any such estimator. We obtain computationally efficient, asymptotically normal inference procedure with exact asymptotic coverage at any fixed probability measure. To complement our estimation results, we derive LP sharp bounds in a general identification setting. We apply our findings to estimating returns to education. To that end, we propose the conditionally monotone IV assumption (cMIV) that tightens the classical monotone IV (MIV) bounds and is testable under a mild regularity condition. Under cMIV, university education in Colombia is shown to increase the average wage by at least $5.5\%$, whereas classical conditions fail to yield an informative bound.</description>

      <title>Has the Paris Agreement Shaped Emission Trends? A Panel VECM Analysis of Energy, Growth, and CO$_2$ in 106 Middle-Income Countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rising CO$_2$ emissions remain a critical global challenge, particularly in middle-income countries where economic growth drives environmental degradation. This study examines the long-run and short-run relationships between CO$_2$ emissions, energy use, GDP per capita, and population across 106 middle-income countries from 1980 to 2023. Using a Panel Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), we assess the impact of the Paris Agreement (2015) on emissions while conducting cointegration tests to confirm long-run equilibrium relationships. The findings reveal a strong long-run relationship among the variables, with energy use as the dominant driver of emissions, while GDP per capita has a moderate impact. However, the Paris Agreement has not significantly altered emissions trends in middle-income economies. Granger causality tests indicate that energy use strongly causes emissions, but GDP per capita and population do not exhibit significant short-run causal effects. Variance decomposition confirms that energy shocks have the most persistent effects, and impulse response functions (IRFs) show emissions trajectories are primarily shaped by economic activity rather than climate agreements. Robustness checks, including autocorrelation tests, polynomial root stability, and Yamagata-Pesaran slope homogeneity tests, validate model consistency. These results suggest that while global agreements set emissions reduction goals, their effectiveness remains limited without stronger national climate policies, sectoral energy reforms, and financial incentives for clean energy adoption to ensure sustainable economic growth.</description>

      <title>Spatial Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This handbook chapter provides an essential introduction to the field of spatial econometrics, offering a comprehensive overview of techniques and methodologies for analysing spatial data in the social sciences. Spatial econometrics addresses the unique challenges posed by spatially dependent observations, where spatial relationships among data points can be of substantive interest or can significantly impact statistical analyses. The chapter begins by exploring the fundamental concepts of spatial dependence and spatial autocorrelation, and highlighting their implications for traditional econometric models. It then introduces a range of spatial econometric models, particularly spatial lag, spatial error, spatial lag of X, and spatial Durbin models, illustrating how these models accommodate spatial relationships and yield accurate and insightful results about the underlying spatial processes. The chapter provides an intuitive guide on how to interpret those different models. A practical example on London house prices demonstrates the application of spatial econometrics, emphasising its relevance in uncovering hidden spatial patterns, addressing endogeneity, and providing robust estimates in the presence of spatial dependence.</description>
