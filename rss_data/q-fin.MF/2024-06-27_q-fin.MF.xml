      <title>Options Pricing under Bayesian MS-VAR Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.05998v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we have studied option pricing methods that are based on a Bayesian Markov-Switching Vector Autoregressive (MS-BVAR) process using a risk-neutral valuation approach. A BVAR process, which is a special case of the Bayesian MS-VAR process is widely used to model interdependencies of economic variables and forecast economic variables. Here we assumed that a regime-switching process is generated by a homogeneous Markov process and a residual process follows a conditional heteroscedastic model. With a direct calculation and change of probability measure, for some frequently used options, we derived pricing formulas. An advantage of our model is it depends on economic variables and is easy to use compared to previous option pricing papers, which depend on regime-switching.</description>

      <title>Equity-Linked Life Insurances on Maximum of Several Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.04038v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Economic variables play important roles in any economic model, and sudden and dramatic changes exist in the financial market and economy. For this reason, to price and hedge equity-linked life insurance products, including segregated funds and unit-linked life insurance products on maximum price of several assets, this paper introduces Bayesian Markov-Switching Vector Autoregressive (MS-VAR) process. By assuming that a regime-switching process is generated by a homogeneous Markov process and a residual process follows a heteroscedastic model, we obtain joint distribution of endogenous variables and insured's future lifetime random variable under risk-neutral probability probability measure. Using the distribution function, we obtain net single premiums and hedging formulas of the equity-linked life insurance products. An advantage of our model is it depends on economic variables and is not complicated as compared to previous papers.</description>

      <title>Augmented Dynamic Gordon Growth Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.06012v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a dynamic Gordon growth model, which is augmented by a time--varying spot interest rate and the Gordon growth model for dividends. Using the risk--neutral valuation method and locally risk--minimizing strategy, we obtain pricing and hedging formulas for the dividend--paying European call and put options and equity--linked life insurance products. Also, we provide ML estimator of the model.</description>
