      <title>Adaptive Human-Robot Collaborative Missions using Hybrid Task Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Producing robust task plans in human-robot collaborative missions is a critical activity in order to increase the likelihood of these missions completing successfully. Despite the broad research body in the area, which considers different classes of constraints and uncertainties, its applicability is confined to relatively simple problems that can be comfortably addressed by the underpinning mathematically-based or heuristic-driven solver engines. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid approach that effectively solves the task planning problem by decomposing it into two intertwined parts, starting with the identification of a feasible plan and followed by its uncertainty augmentation and verification yielding a set of Pareto optimal plans. To enhance its robustness, adaptation tactics are devised for the evolving system requirements and agents' capabilities. We demonstrate our approach through an industrial case study involving workers and robots undertaking activities within a vineyard, showcasing the benefits of our hybrid approach both in the generation of feasible solutions and scalability compared to native planners.</description>

      <title>Extended Version: Multi-Robot Motion Planning with Cooperative Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the uncertain multi-robot motion planning (MRMP) problem with cooperative localization (CL-MRMP), under both motion and measurement noise, where each robot can act as a sensor for its nearby teammates. We formalize CL-MRMP as a chance-constrained motion planning problem, and propose a safety-guaranteed algorithm that explicitly accounts for robot-robot correlations. Our approach extends a sampling-based planner to solve CL-MRMP while preserving probabilistic completeness. To improve efficiency, we introduce novel biasing techniques. We evaluate our method across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating motion plans, with significant performance gains from biasing strategies.</description>

      <title>SDHN: Skewness-Driven Hypergraph Networks for Enhanced Localized Multi-Robot Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning is widely used for multi-robot coordination, where simple graphs typically model pairwise interactions. However, such representations fail to capture higher-order collaborations, limiting effectiveness in complex tasks. While hypergraph-based approaches enhance cooperation, existing methods often generate arbitrary hypergraph structures and lack adaptability to environmental uncertainties. To address these challenges, we propose the Skewness-Driven Hypergraph Network (SDHN), which employs stochastic Bernoulli hyperedges to explicitly model higher-order multi-robot interactions. By introducing a skewness loss, SDHN promotes an efficient structure with Small-Hyperedge Dominant Hypergraph, allowing robots to prioritize localized synchronization while still adhering to the overall information, similar to human coordination. Extensive experiments on Moving Agents in Formation and Robotic Warehouse tasks validate SDHN's effectiveness, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>FJ-MM: The Friedkin-Johnsen Opinion Dynamics Model with Memory and Higher-Order Neighbors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model has been extensively explored and validated, spanning applications in social science, systems and control, game theory, and algorithmic research. In this paper, we introduce an advanced generalization of the FJ model, termed FJ-MM which incorporates both memory effects and multi-hop (higher-order neighbor) influence. This formulation allows agents to naturally incorporate both current and previous opinions at each iteration stage. Our numerical results demonstrate that incorporating memory and multi-hop influence significantly reshapes the opinion landscape; for example, the final opinion profile can exhibit reduced polarization. We analyze the stability and equilibrium properties of the FJ-MM model, showing that these properties can be reduced to those of a comparison model--namely, the standard FJ model with a modified influence matrix. This reduction enables us to leverage established stability results from FJ dynamics. Additionally, we examine the convergence rate of the FJ-MM model and demonstrate that, as can be expected, the time lags introduced by memory and higher-order neighbor influences result in slower convergence.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Consensus: Modeling Multi-Agent Networks with Long-Range Interactions through path-Laplacian Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended connectivity in graphs can be analyzed through k-path Laplacian matrices, which permit the capture of long-range interactions in various real-world networked systems such as social, transportation, and multi-agent networks. In this work, we present several alternative methods based on machine learning methods (LSTM, xLSTM, Transformer, XGBoost, and ConvLSTM) to predict the final consensus value based on directed networks (Erd\"os-Renyi, Watts-Strogatz, and Barab\'asi-Albert) and on the initial state. We highlight how different k-hop interactions affect the performance of the tested methods. This framework opens new avenues for analyzing multi-scale diffusion processes in large-scale, complex networks.</description>

      <title>Review of Case-Based Reasoning for LLM Agents: Theoretical Foundations, Architectural Components, and Cognitive Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in various tasks. Still, they face limitations in tasks requiring specific, structured knowledge, flexibility, or accountable decision-making. While agents are capable of perceiving their environments, forming inferences, planning, and executing actions towards goals, they often face issues such as hallucinations and lack of contextual memory across interactions. This paper explores how Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), a strategy that solves new problems by referencing past experiences, can be integrated into LLM agent frameworks. This integration allows LLMs to leverage explicit knowledge, enhancing their effectiveness. We systematically review the theoretical foundations of these enhanced agents, identify critical framework components, and formulate a mathematical model for the CBR processes of case retrieval, adaptation, and learning. We also evaluate CBR-enhanced agents against other methods like Chain-of-Thought reasoning and standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation, analyzing their relative strengths. Moreover, we explore how leveraging CBR's cognitive dimensions (including self-reflection, introspection, and curiosity) via goal-driven autonomy mechanisms can further enhance the LLM agent capabilities. Contributing to the ongoing research on neuro-symbolic hybrid systems, this work posits CBR as a viable technique for enhancing the reasoning skills and cognitive aspects of autonomous LLM agents.</description>

      <title>Approximate Feedback Nash Equilibria with Sparse Inter-Agent Dependencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feedback Nash equilibrium strategies in multi-agent dynamic games require availability of all players' state information to compute control actions. However, in real-world scenarios, sensing and communication limitations between agents make full state feedback expensive or impractical, and such strategies can become fragile when state information from other agents is inaccurate. To this end, we propose a regularized dynamic programming approach for finding sparse feedback policies that selectively depend on the states of a subset of agents in dynamic games. The proposed approach solves convex adaptive group Lasso problems to compute sparse policies approximating Nash equilibrium solutions. We prove the regularized solutions' asymptotic convergence to a neighborhood of Nash equilibrium policies in linear-quadratic (LQ) games. Further, we extend the proposed approach to general non-LQ games via an iterative algorithm. Simulation results in multi-robot interaction scenarios show that the proposed approach effectively computes feedback policies with varying sparsity levels. When agents have noisy observations of other agents' states, simulation results indicate that the proposed regularized policies consistently achieve lower costs than standard Nash equilibrium policies by up to 77% for all interacting agents whose costs are coupled with other agents' states.</description>
