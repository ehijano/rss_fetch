      <title>Deciphering SCN2A: A comprehensive review of rodent models of Scn2a dysfunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SCN2A encodes the alpha subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.2, which is involved in action potential initiation and backpropagation in glutamatergic neurons. Mutations in the gene lead to SCN2A-related disorders, which are highly heterogeneous and manifest in a variety of diagnoses, such as self-limited familial and non-familial infantile epilepsy (SeLFNIE, previously benign familial infantile seizures or BFNIS), epileptic encephalopathies (EE), infantile spasms, ataxia, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability (ID), and schizophrenia. Researchers have attempted to elucidate the complexity of the SCN2A gene and Nav1.2 channel function through the use and development of non-human mammalian models. These models have been invaluable to uncovering the molecular underpinnings of why changes in SCN2A lead to such a heterogenous group of disorders. This review aims to evaluate and compare the published rodent models to consolidate findings, identify limitations, and highlight future research directions.</description>

      <title>Can EEG resting state data benefit data-driven approaches for motor-imagery decoding?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resting-state EEG data in neuroscience research serve as reliable markers for user identification and reveal individual-specific traits. Despite this, the use of resting-state data in EEG classification models is limited. In this work, we propose a feature concatenation approach to enhance decoding models' generalization by integrating resting-state EEG, aiming to improve motor imagery BCI performance and develop a user-generalized model. Using feature concatenation, we combine the EEGNet model, a standard convolutional neural network for EEG signal classification, with functional connectivity measures derived from resting-state EEG data. The findings suggest that although grounded in neuroscience with data-driven learning, the concatenation approach has limited benefits for generalizing models in within-user and across-user scenarios. While an improvement in mean accuracy for within-user scenarios is observed on two datasets, concatenation doesn't benefit across-user scenarios when compared with random data concatenation. The findings indicate the necessity of further investigation on the model interpretability and the effect of random data concatenation on model robustness.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Neural Dynamics and Classification Accuracy in Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing - information processing based on untrained recurrent neural networks with random connections - is expected to depend on the nonlinear properties of the neurons and the resulting oscillatory, chaotic, or fixpoint dynamics of the network. However, the required degree of nonlinearity and the range of suitable dynamical regimes for a given task are not fully understood. To clarify these questions, we study the accuracy of a reservoir computer in artificial classification tasks of varying complexity, while tuning the neuron's degree of nonlinearity and the reservoir's dynamical regime. We find that, even for activation functions with extremely reduced nonlinearity, weak recurrent interactions and small input signals, the reservoir is able to compute useful representations, detectable only in higher order principal components, that render complex classificiation tasks linearly separable for the readout layer. When increasing the recurrent coupling, the reservoir develops spontaneous dynamical behavior. Nevertheless, the input-related computations can 'ride on top' of oscillatory or fixpoint attractors without much loss of accuracy, whereas chaotic dynamics reduces task performance more drastically. By tuning the system through the full range of dynamical phases, we find that the accuracy peaks both at the oscillatory/chaotic and at the chaotic/fixpoint phase boundaries, thus supporting the 'edge of chaos' hypothesis. Our results, in particular the robust weakly nonlinear operating regime, may offer new perspectives both for technical and biological neural networks with random connectivity.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Brain's Dynamic Response to Targeted Stimulation using Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19737v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative models of brain activity have been instrumental in testing hypothesized mechanisms underlying brain dynamics against experimental datasets. Beyond capturing the key mechanisms underlying spontaneous brain dynamics, these models hold an exciting potential for understanding the mechanisms underlying the dynamics evoked by targeted brain-stimulation techniques. This paper delves into this emerging application, using concepts from dynamical systems theory to argue that the stimulus-evoked dynamics in such experiments may be shaped by new types of mechanisms distinct from those that dominate spontaneous dynamics. We review and discuss: (i) the targeted experimental techniques across spatial scales that can both perturb the brain to novel states and resolve its relaxation trajectory back to spontaneous dynamics; and (ii) how we can understand these dynamics in terms of mechanisms using physiological, phenomenological, and data-driven models. A tight integration of targeted stimulation experiments with generative quantitative modeling provides an important opportunity to uncover novel mechanisms of brain dynamics that are difficult to detect in spontaneous settings.</description>
