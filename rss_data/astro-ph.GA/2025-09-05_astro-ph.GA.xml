      <title>Probing dense environments around Sgr A* with S-stars dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbits of stars around Sgr A*, the Milky Way's supermassive black hole, provide a unique laboratory for testing its environment with unprecedented precision. In this work, we compute the apsidal precession induced by extended matter distributions through Lagrange's equations and compare it with the measured precession of S2, reproducing and extending GRAVITY's constraints. In particular, we push bounds on boson clouds to larger gravitational couplings $\alpha$ and to the second-fastest superradiant mode. We also show that environments with mass of order $1\%$ of Sgr A* drive stellar orbits to decay by dynamical friction within a few Myr. The inner star cluster is however efficiently replenished, masking this effect observationally. We also show that orbital resonances from boson clouds have no impact on relevant timescales. While S2 currently provides the cleanest dataset, our framework is readily applicable to other stars that we identify as particularly promising, whose orbits will be measured with increasing accuracy, opening up new opportunities to probe the environment of Sgr A*.</description>

      <title>Do Little Red Dots Vary?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Little red dots (LRDs), high-redshift, compact, red objects with V-shaped spectra, are one of the most exciting and perplexing discoveries made by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). While the simplest explanation for LRDs is that they are high redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN), due to their compactness and frequent association with broad line emission, the lack of corresponding X-ray emission and observed variability cast doubt on this picture. Here, we simulate LRD light curves using both traditional models for sub-Eddington AGN variability derived empirically from lower-redshift AGN observations and moderately super-Eddington AGN disk models from radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations to examine the reason for the lack of variability. We find that even though most LRDs have only been observed 2--4 times in a given waveband, we should still be detecting significantly more variability if traditional sub-Eddington AGN variability models can be applied to LRDs. Instead, our super-Eddington model light curves are consistent with the lack of observed LRD variability. In addition, the ongoing high-cadence {\sc nexus} campaign will detect changes in magnitude, $\Delta m&gt;1$, for traditional sub-Eddington models, but will only observe significant continuum variability for the lowest mass LRDs for our super-Eddington AGN models. Even if LRDs lack continuum variability, we find that the ongoing spectroscopic JWST campaign {\sc twinkle} should observe broad emission line variability as long as soft X-ray irradiation manages to reach the broad line region from the inner disk. Our models show that super-Eddington accretion can easily explain the lack of continuum variability in LRDs.</description>

      <title>How similar are narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies and high-z type 1 AGN?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent observations of highly accreting supermassive black holes (SMBH) at very high redshift ($&gt;$4) with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allowed us to shed light for the very first time on the early evolutionary phases of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Perhaps unsurprisingly, several of the physical properties observed in these new objects, including those known as little red dots (LRDs), are closely reminiscent of the low-mass and high-Eddington AGN in the local Universe, and in particular of the class of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies. However, some differences also emerged, likely due to the radically different evolutionary path and the environment where LRDs and NLS1s live. In this work, we review the multiwavelength properties of local NLS1s and compare them with type 1 AGN found at high-$z$, showing that despite some differences, the study of NLS1s can be extremely useful to better understand the extreme accretion physics of high-$z$ quasars and the early stages of AGN evolution.</description>

      <title>The clustering of C IV and Si IV at the end of reionisation: A perspective from the E-XQR-30 survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to study the clustering of metal absorption lines and the structures that they arise in as a function of cosmic time. We focus on C IV and Si IV absorption features that are identified along a given quasar sightline. We exploit the two-point correlation function (2PCF) to investigate the clustering of these structures as a function of their separation. We utilise the E-XQR-30 data to perform a novel analysis at z&gt;5. We also draw on literature surveys (including XQ-100) of lower redshift quasars to investigate the possible evolution of this clustering towards cosmic noon (i.e., z~2-3). We find no significant evolution with redshift when considering the separation of absorbers in velocity space. Since we are comparing data across a large interval of cosmic time, we also consider the separation between absorbers in the reference frame of physical distances. In this reference frame, we find that the amplitude of the clustering increases with cosmic time for both C IV and Si IV on the scales of &lt;1500 physical kpc. For the first time, we assess the 2PCF of C IV and Si IV close to the epoch of reionisation utilising the absorber catalogue from the E-XQR-30 survey. We compare this with lower redshift data and find that, on small scales, the clustering of these structures grows with cosmic time. We compare these results to the clustering of galaxies in the GAEA simulations. It appears that the structures traced by C IV are broadly comparable to the galaxies from the considered simulations. The clustering is most similar to that of the galaxies with virial masses M~10^10.5 M_sun. We require tailor-made simulations to investigate the full range of factors contributing to the observed clustering. Future ground-based spectrographs will further facilitate surveys of absorbers at this epoch with increased sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Fueling, Evolution, and Diversity of AGN in Dwarf Galaxies: Insights from Star Formation and Black Hole Scaling Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the star formation activity and black hole scaling relations in a sample of 1451 AGN hosted by dwarf galaxies at redshift 0.5 to 0.9, drawn from the VIPERS survey. The sample comprises Seyferts and LINERs identified through emission-line diagnostics, as well as IR-selected AGN based on WISE colors. Using the parameter SFRnorm, defined as the ratio of the SFR of a galaxy hosting an AGN to the median SFR of star-forming galaxies of similar stellar mass and redshift, we compare AGN hosts to a control sample of non-AGN star-forming galaxies. We examine how SFRnorm varies with AGN power ([O III] luminosity), black hole mass, local environment, and stellar population age. We also analyze the MBH-Mstar relation and the evolution of the MBH/Mstar ratio, incorporating comparisons to X-ray AGN and high-redshift quasars (z &gt; 4). Our key findings are: (i) all AGN populations show suppressed star formation at low AGN luminosities, with SFRnorm rising above unity at different luminosity thresholds depending on AGN type; (ii) LINERs show flat SFRnorm trends with MBH, remaining broadly consistent with unity; Seyferts display a mild increase with MBH, while IR AGN show a more pronounced positive trend; (iii) LINERs exhibit older stellar populations than Seyferts; (iv) at fixed stellar mass, Seyferts host more massive black holes than LINERs, with IR AGN falling in between; (v) the MBH/Mstar ratio is elevated relative to local scaling relations and remains approximately constant with redshift, in agreement with high-z AGN; (vi) the ratio decreases with stellar mass up to log(Mstar/Msun) approximately 11, beyond which it flattens toward values consistent with those of local, inactive galaxies, with this trend clearest for Seyferts and IR AGN. These results suggest that AGN in dwarf galaxies follow diverse evolutionary pathways shaped by gas availability, feedback, and selection effects.</description>

      <title>Breaking Down the $\textsf{CosmoGEMS}$: Toward Modeling and Understanding Globular Cluster Stellar Streams in a Fully Cosmological Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation surveys are expected to uncover thousands of globular cluster (GC) stellar streams, motivating the need for a theoretical framework that produces realistic GC streams in a fully cosmological, Milky Way-like environment. We present $\textsf{CosmoGEMS}$, a star-by-star cosmological GC stream framework that self-consistently links small-scale cluster physics with large-scale Galactic dynamics. The initial phase-space positions of stream stars are informed by post-processed GC populations within the FIRE cosmological simulation. Escaped stars are orbit-integrated from their time of escape to the present day in a time-evolving Galactic potential extracted from the same simulation using a basis function expansion. We explore two example streams on different orbits. One forms a long, thin stream with a velocity dispersion consistent with Milky Way GC streams. However, it exhibits a clump and orbital-phase-dependent misalignments due to the evolving potential. The other stream develops both a thin component and a diffuse, shell-like structure, similar to features observed in streams like Jhelum. These results highlight the power of fully cosmological models in producing realistic stream morphologies and kinematics. Unlike idealized simulations, our models naturally incorporate time-dependent changes in the progenitor's orbit, including orbital plane evolution, which significantly affects stream structure. This challenges common assumptions in stream-finding algorithms and interpretation. $\textsf{CosmoGEMS}$ provides a key step toward connecting future stellar stream observations with the physics of globular cluster evolution and hierarchical galaxy formation in a cosmological context.</description>

      <title>Deciphering galaxy images using machine vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a machine vision approach to quantify galaxy structure combining a variational autoencoder (VAE) framework with principal component analysis (PCA). Using mock gri-band images from the EAGLE simulation, the VAE finds that 35 features are needed to describe images. Adding the PCA, we identify an optimal range of 10-12 features needed to capture 99.9 per cent of the variance in galaxy morphology. The exact optimal number varies with galaxy complexity: disk-dominated galaxies require 12 features, bulge-dominated galaxies need 9, and intermediate systems require 10-11 features. Correlations between extracted PCA features and structural measurements reveal that the VAE prioritizes galaxy size during reconstruction, with half-light radius strongly correlating with the highest-ranked principal components. Subsequent features capture morphology-dependent characteristics: disk-dominated galaxies emphasize size, asymmetry, and position angle; bulge-dominated systems focus on size, concentration, and axis ratio; while intermediate galaxies show enhanced attention to S\'ersic index, indicating greater emphasis on accurately reproducing both disk and bulge structures. The PCA process significantly reduces the entanglement of the features compared to the raw VAE latent features, decreasing the correlations with the half-light radius and the S\'ersic index from 14.5\pm1.0 and 6.0\pm1.5 features, respectively, to only 2.0\pm1.0 components after PCA. Using UMAP technique, we construct 2D visualizations that preserve neighborhood relationships from the high-dimensional feature space. This demonstrates that machine vision can effectively distinguish galaxy populations across different morphological types, including systems with atypical structures that may be overlooked by traditional classification methods, providing a data-driven complement to conventional structural measurements.</description>

      <title>New Interpretation for the Orientation of the LMC's Gaseous Arms B and E using ULLYSES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) experiences disruption from tidal and ram-pressure forces as it travels through the halo of the Milky Way. In this project, we combine radio emission-line observations from the GASS and GASKAP surveys with UV absorption-line observations from the HST Ultraviolet Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) program to trace the material in front of the LMC. Along our 8 stellar sightlines near 30 Doradus, we observe gaseous structures likely associated with two arm-like features flowing in and around the LMC's disk. We detect the nearside gas in neutral, low, and medium ionization species. The lower-ionization species likely undergo both thermal and non-thermal broadening while the moderately-ionized phase is influenced by more non-thermal processes. The total integrated column density of AlIII decreases with increasing angular offset from 30 Doradus, with sightlines within 0.25 degrees containing more moderately ionized gas. We demonstrate from a Gaussian decomposition technique on the HI emission that both arms likely trace an additional 1.0 degree in Galactic longitude toward the 30 Doradus region than previously predicted. We constrain the orientation of the arms by suggesting that they likely converge around (l,b) =(280.5$^\circ$, -31.2$^\circ$) and at least partially cross in front of the LMC. Our observations are consistent with two competing origins of the arms: 1) outflowing material is swept back by tidal and ram-pressure forces or 2) tidally stripped inflows fuel the ongoing stellar activity inside the LMC. Future studies are needed to distinguish between these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Universal Structure of Turbulent Radiative Mixing Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent radiative mixing layers (TRMLs), where shear-driven turbulence between dense and diffuse phases produces intermediate-temperature gas with short cooling times, are ubiquitous in the interstellar and circumgalactic media. Drawing an analogy with Reynolds' decomposition, we perform a quasi-steady-state analysis of TRMLs, separating fields into mean and turbulent components. In the quasi-isobaric TRML, upstream gas cools and compresses before streamwise momentum is fully mixed across the shear layer, which exhibits the expected negative turbulent shear stress $R_{xz}$ that steadily spreads into the cold phase. The thermal pressure reaches a minimum within the TRML, compensated by a positive vertical compressive stress $R_{zz}$. The sum of upstream ram and thermal pressures balances the downstream thermal pressure. Radiative losses are offset by enthalpy dissipation, with a negative turbulent heat flux $Q_{z}$ indicating thermal transport within the TRML. The volume-averaged temperature profile is well fit by a tanh function -- an emergent property that, for the first time, enables a predictive theory for TRMLs consistent with numerical experiments, including the universality of their temperature-dependent emissivity distributions.</description>

      <title>Confirming lensed-quasar candidates with DESI and P200 spectroscopy I. 14 lensed quasars and 8 lensed galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lensed quasars are powerful probes of cosmology, the co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies, and the distribution of dark matter. We cross-match 1,724 previously identified candidates from HSC, KiDS, and the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DESI-LS) with DESI DR1, obtaining 937 DESI spectra for 677 unique systems. Combining DESI spectroscopy with observations from the Palomar 200-inch Double Spectrograph (P200/DBSP), we confirm three lensed quasars with source redshifts of 1.71, 1.93, and 3.23 and Einstein radii of 0.96, 0.39, and 1.07 arcsec, respectively. We further identify 11 high-confidence candidates that are well reproduced by a simple singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) model, exhibit lens galaxies in the image modeling, and have at least one available spectrum; across these, the Einstein radius spans 0.39 to 2.34 arcsec and the source redshift spans 1.13 to 2.88. In 8 of the 11 cases, the systems already satisfy our lensing criteria except that only one quasar image currently has a spectrum; obtaining a second spectrum for the other image would enable immediate confirmation. As by-products, we report eight new lensed galaxies spanning galaxy- to group-scale lenses. These results provide valuable targets for follow-up studies and underscore the efficiency of wide-field spectroscopic surveys such as DESI in confirming gravitationally lensed quasars and galaxies.</description>

      <title>A large thermal energy reservoir in the nascent intracluster medium at a redshift of 4.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most baryons in present-day galaxy clusters exist as hot gas ($\boldsymbol{\gtrsim10^7\,\rm}\mathrm{K}$), forming the intracluster medium (ICM). Cosmological simulations predict that the mass and temperature of the ICM rapidly decrease with increasing cosmological redshift, as intracluster gas in younger clusters is still accumulating and being heated. The thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect arises when cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons are scattered to higher energies through interactions with energetic electrons in hot ICM, leaving a localized decrement in the CMB at a long wavelength. The depth of this decrement is a measure of the thermal energy and pressure of the gas. To date, the effect has been detected in only three systems at or above $z\sim2$, when the Universe was 4 billion years old, making the time and mechanism of ICM assembly uncertain. Here, we report observations of this effect in the protocluster SPT2349$-$56 with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). SPT2349$-$56 contains a large molecular gas reservoir, with at least 30 dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) and three radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) in a 100-kpc region at $z=4.3$, corresponding to 1.4 billion years after the Big Bang. The observed tSZ signal implies a thermal energy of $\mathbf{\sim 10^{61}\,\mathrm{erg}}$, exceeding the possible energy of a virialized ICM by an order of magnitude. Contrary to current theoretical expectations, the strong tSZ decrement in SPT2349$-$56 demonstrates that substantial heating can occur and deposit a large amount of thermal energy within growing galaxy clusters, overheating the nascent ICM in unrelaxed structures, two billion years before the first mature clusters emerged at $\mathbf{z \sim 2}$.</description>

      <title>COLIBRE: calibrating subgrid feedback in cosmological simulations that include a cold gas phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the calibration of stellar and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback in the subgrid model for the new COLIBRE hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. COLIBRE directly simulates the multi-phase interstellar medium and the evolution of dust grains, which is coupled to the chemistry. COLIBRE is calibrated at three resolutions: particle masses of $m_{\rm gas} \approx m_{\rm dm} \sim 10^7$ (m7), $10^6$ (m6), and $10^5~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ (m5). To calibrate the COLIBRE feedback at m7 resolution, we run Latin hypercubes of $\approx 200$ simulations that vary up to four subgrid parameters in cosmological volumes of ($50~\mathrm{cMpc}$)$^{3}$. We train Gaussian process emulators on these simulations to predict the $z=0$ galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) and size - stellar mass relation (SSMR) as functions of the model parameters, which we then fit to observations. The trained emulators not only provide the best-fitting parameter values but also enable us to investigate how different aspects of the prescriptions for supernova and AGN feedback affect the predictions. In particular, we demonstrate that while the observed $z=0$ GSMF and SSMR can be matched individually with a relatively simple supernova feedback model, simultaneously reproducing both necessitates a more sophisticated prescription. We show that the calibrated m7 COLIBRE model not only reproduces the calibration target observables, but also matches various other galaxy properties to which the model was not calibrated. Finally, we apply the calibrated m7 model to the m6 and m5 resolutions and, after slight manual adjustments of the subgrid parameters, achieve a similar level of agreement with the observed $z=0$ GSMF and SSMR.</description>

      <title>Reduced Gas Accretion onto Galaxies due to Effects of External Giant Radio Lobes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppression effects of giant radio lobes from supermassive black holes on gas accretion onto galaxies in the surrounding regions are quantified using cosmological magneto-hydrodynamic simulations. With an appropriate amount of radio jet energy injected into the intergalactic medium following the formation peak of supermassive black holes at redshift two, we find that galaxies in the greater neighborhood of the jet-launching massive galaxies subsequently experience a significant reduction in the amount of accreted gas. The distribution of the resulting magnetic field in the intergalactic medium is highly inhomogeneous, due to the highly biased nature of the most massive supermassive black holes. In regions with magnetic field strength $B&gt;10^{-2}\mu$G, the baryon fraction is on average reduced by 17%, 14%, and 12%, respectively, for halos of mass in the range of $[10^{11}-10^{12})\msun$, $[10^{12}-10^{13})\msun$, and $[10^{13}-10^{14})\msun$. A proper inclusion of this new, external, global, preventive feedback mechanism from AGN in the next generation of cosmological simulation may be necessary.</description>

      <title>SISSI: Supernovae in a stratified, shearing interstellar medium. II. Star formation near the Sun is quenched by expansion of the Local Bubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The age of the Local Bubble (LB) can be used to constrain the timescales, on which the interstellar medium in the solar neighborhood is evolving. Previous estimates have put the age of the LB at $\gtrsim 14\,\text{Myr}$, and suggested that its expansion was powered by $\sim 15-20$ SNe, yet in a companion paper we have seen hints that this age might be too high. Following up on these hints, we aim to place new constraints on the age of the LB. We reconstruct the geometry and momentum of the LB using publicly available 3D dust maps to compare its geometry to that of the high-quality sample of simulated supernova remnants in the SISSI project. We find that, in contrast to previous estimates, $\gtrsim 20$ SNe over $\sim 4\,\text{Myr}$ are required to explain both the momentum and the size of the LB. The julia source-code for our analysis is made available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17054923. Previous estimates of the age of the LB have seemingly overestimated its age and underestimated the number of SNe powering its expansion. Our results are in tension with the assumption that the LB is powered solely by SNe associated with the nearby Scorpius-Centraurus OB association, which appears to have stopped forming stars at about the same time as the LB began to expand. In light of this new evidence, our results cast serious doubts on the claim that star formation in the solar neighborhood was driven by the expansion of the LB, and might have instead quenched it.</description>

      <title>A fast machine learning tool to predict the composition of astronomical ices from infrared absorption spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current observations taken by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allow us to observe the absorption features of icy mantles that cover interstellar dust grains, which are mainly composed of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO}$, and $\mathrm{CO_2}$, along with other minor species. Thanks to its sensitivity and spectral resolution, JWST has the potential to observe ice features towards hundreds of sources at different stages along the process of star formation. However, identifying the spectral features of the different species and quantifying the ice composition is not trivial and requires complex spectroscopic analysis. We present Automatic Ice Composition Estimator (AICE), a new tool based on artificial neural networks. Based on the infrared (IR) ice absorption spectrum between 2.5 and 10 microns, AICE predicts the ice fractional composition in terms of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO}$, $\mathrm{CO_2}$, $\mathrm{CH_3OH}$, $\mathrm{NH_3}$, and $\mathrm{CH_4}$. To train the model, we used hundreds of laboratory experiments of ice mixtures from different databases, which were reprocessed with baseline subtraction and normalisation. Once trained, AICE takes less than one second on a conventional computer to predict the ice composition associated with the observed IR absorption spectrum, with typical errors of $\sim$3 $\%$ in the species fraction. We tested its performance on two spectra reported towards the NIR38 and J110621 background stars observed within the JWST Ice Age program, demonstrating a good agreement with previous estimations of the ice composition. The fast and accurate performance of AICE enables the systematic analysis of hundreds of different ice spectra with a modest time investment. In addition, this model can be enhanced and re-trained with more laboratory data, improving the precision of the predictions and expanding the list of predicted species.</description>

      <title>J-PAS: Discovery of RaJav, a bright spatially extended Ly$\alpha$ Nebula at z=2.25</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a massive and potentially largest Ly$\alpha$ Nebula, RaJav, at z=2.25, associated with a quasar pair: the bright SDSS~J162029.07+433451.1 (hereafter J1620+4334) and the faint newly discovered quasar JPAS-9600-10844, at 2.265 $\pm$ 0.021 using the early data release (17 deg$^{2}$) of the J-PAS. The quasar JPAS-9600-10844 embedded in the nebula is located at ~ 60.2 kpc (7.3'') from J1620+4334, and shows a compact structure with broad emission lines (&gt; 3000 km/s), typical of active galactic nuclei. At a 2$\sigma$ surface brightness (SB) contour of $\sim 1.86 \times 10^{-16}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$, the nebula extends &gt; 100 kpcs and has a total Ly$\alpha$ luminosity of $\sim 7.7 \pm 0.6 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ signify the presence of a giant Enormous Ly$\alpha$ Nebula (ELAN). The nebula traces an over density of quasars at redshift of 2.2-2.3 consistent with the progenitor of a massive galaxy cluster. The extended CIV emission indicates that the circum-galactic medium (CGM) is metal-enriched and not primordial. The current J-PAS observations suggest photoionization and shocks due to outflows as possible ionization mechanisms. The faint extended FUV and NUV continuum emission likely points to ongoing star formation around the two quasars, suggesting a complex interaction in their environments. These findings provide new insights into the environment of quasars and their role in shaping the dynamics and evolution of the CGM at cosmic noon. Further spectroscopic observations will be required to fully characterize the object's nature and its kinematic properties. This study demonstrates the unique capability of J-PAS to detect massive and rare Ly$\alpha$ nebulae, providing new insights into their properties, environments, and connections to large-scale structures in the cosmic web such as filaments and overdensities in a large cosmological volume.</description>

      <title>Extreme Starlight Polarization Efficiency Toward $\zeta$ Ophiuchi: A Case for Line-of-Sight Foreground Subtraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the pervasive nature of interstellar dust and its impact on nearly all observations, most dust corrections employ line-of-sight averages over large angular scales. This neglects real variations on small angular and distance scales from discrete components of the ISM. We use $V$ band polarimetry, public dust maps, and Gaia DR3 distances of 25 stars along a 50' radius sight line towards the O9.5IV star $\zeta$ Ophiuchi ($d \approx $ 182 pc) to examine both dust and magnetic structures over the range $d = $ 36--1176 pc and angular scales of $&lt; 1$\degr. Polarization and reddening data indicate two discrete dust populations having different magnetic field orientations along the sight line, one at $d \simeq$ 86--127 pc and another at $d\simeq$ 252--287 pc. After removal of the foreground, the more distant component exhibits alignment in polarization angle with 12 $\mu$m PAH striations seen in the field. This more distant dust population exhibits evidence of extreme starlight polarization efficiency with an average of 14.1% mag$^{-1}$, greater than the canonical Serkowski limit of 9% mag$^{-1}$. The spatial coincidence with the PAH striations indicates the PAH-emitting grains and those responsible for the high polarization efficiency may be components of the same dust population. We find no evidence that $\zeta$ Oph's radiative influence affects the polarizing or reddening properties of the surrounding dust. Our study demonstrates that accurate distance-based foreground subtraction is vital to properly understanding superimposed dust and the magnetic field components in the ISM.</description>

      <title>Axion lines from nuclear de-excitations in galactic stellar populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that mono-energetic axions are produced in abundance through nuclear de-excitations in nearby galaxies such as M87, which is the central galaxy of the Virgo cluster, and the starburst galaxy M82. If the axion couples to both nucleons and photons and is ultralight, then monochromatic hard X-ray signatures are induced by the subsequent axion-to-photon conversion in the magnetic fields permeating these systems. We search for evidence of such signals using NuSTAR data, focusing specifically on the $^{57}$Fe de-excitation line at 14.4 keV, and we catalog other potentially relevant nuclear lines. We find no evidence for axions from M87 or M82 and set leading constraints on the combined axion-nucleon and axion-photon coupling at the level of $|g_{ann} \times g_{a\gamma \gamma}| \lesssim 1.1 \times 10^{-22}$ GeV$^{-1}$ in the limit $m_a \lesssim 10^{-10}$ eV, at 95% confidence.</description>

      <title>A Galactic Perspective on the (Unremarkable) Relative Refractory Depletion Observed in the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last two decades, the Sun has been observed to be depleted in refractory elements as a function of elemental condensation temperature (\tcond) relative to $\sim 80\%$ of its counterparts. We assess the impact of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) on refractory element--\tcond\ trends for 109,500 unique solar analogs from the GALAH, APOGEE, Gaia RVS, and \cite{bedell18} surveys. We find that a star's \feh\ and \alphafe\ are indicators of its \tcond\ slope (\rsq\ = $15 \pm 5$, $23 \pm 10\%$ respectively) while \teff\ and \logg\ contribute more weakly (\rsq\ = $9 \pm 5$, $13 \pm 16\%$). The Sun's abundance pattern resembles that of more metal-rich (0.1 dex) and $\alpha$-depleted stars ($-0.02$ dex), suggesting a connection to broader GCE trends. To more accurately model stars' nucleosynthetic signatures, we apply the K-process model from \cite{Griffith24}, which casts each star's abundance pattern as a linear combination of core-collapse and Type Ia supernovae contributions. We find the Sun appears chemically ordinary in this framework, lying within $0.5\sigma$ of the expected solar analog abundance distribution. We show that refractory element--\tcond\ trends arise because elements with higher \tcond\ have higher contributions from core-collapse supernovae. Refractory element depletion trends primarily reflect nucleosynthetic enrichment patterns shaped by GCE and local ISM inhomogeneities, with these processes accounting for $93\%$ of the observed variation within 2$\sigma$. This work highlights how abundance diversity due to local and global chemical enrichment may often mask and mimic population-scale signatures of planet-related processes.</description>

      <title>The Dark Energy Camera All Data Everywhere cosmic shear project V: Constraints on cosmology and astrophysics from 270 million galaxies across 13,000 deg$^2$ of the sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present constraints on models of cosmology and astrophysics using cosmic shear data vectors from three datasets: the northern and southern Galactic cap of the Dark Energy Camera All Data Everywhere (DECADE) project, and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3. These data vectors combined consist of 270 million galaxies spread across 13,000 ${\rm deg}^2$ of the sky. We first extract constraints for $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and find $S_8= 0.805^{+0.019}_{-0.019}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.262^{+0.023}_{-0.036}$, which is consistent within $1.9 \sigma$ of constraints from the Planck satellite. Extending our analysis to dynamical dark energy models shows that lensing provides some (but still minor) improvements to existing constraints from supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations. Finally, we study six different models for the impact of baryons on the matter power spectrum. We show the different models provide consistent constraints on baryon suppression, and associated cosmology, once the astrophysical priors are sufficiently wide. Current scale-cut approaches for mitigating baryon contamination result in a residual bias of $\approx 0.3\sigma$ in the $S_8, \Omega_{\rm m}$ posterior. Using all scales with dedicated baryon modeling leads to negligible improvement as the new information is used solely to self-calibrate the baryon model on small scales. Additional non-lensing datasets, and/or calibrations of the baryon model, will be required to access the full statistical power of the lensing measurements. The combined dataset in this work represents the largest lensing dataset to date (most galaxies, largest area) and provides an apt testing ground for analyses of upcoming datasets from Stage IV surveys. The DECADE shear catalogs, data vectors, and likelihoods are made publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use archival data from the Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) to map the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) 3.3 $\mu$m emission feature and analyze its correlation with AME in 98 compact sources identified by the Planck collaboration. We find that while FIR thermal dust emission continues to be a better tracer of AME in most of the considered regions, 17% of the AME sources are better correlated with emission from small PAHs as traced by DIRBE. Furthermore, of the 27 sources which were identified as highly significant AME detections in the Planck analysis, 37% prefer PAHs as an AME tracer. Further work is required to understand to what extent local interstellar conditions are affecting PAH emission mechanisms and to reveal the underlying carriers of AME.</description>

      <title>Rubin Data Preview 1: Extending the View of Unresolved Binary Stars in 47 Tucanae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Until now, the study of unresolved main sequence binary stars in globular clusters has been possible almost exclusively in their central regions with deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations. We present the first detection of unresolved main-sequence binary stars in the outer field of 47 Tucanae using Rubin Observatory's Data Preview 1 (DP1). Our analysis exploits deep $i$ vs. $g-i$ colour-magnitude diagrams beyond the cluster's half-light radius, reaching almost to the tidal radius. The high-quality photometry allowed to identify unresolved binaries with mass ratios $q$ larger than 0.7. The derived binary fraction of $f_\mathrm{bin}(q&gt;0.7) = 0.016 \pm 0.005$ stands in contrast to the significantly lower values in the cluster innermost regions, as measured from HST photometry. This result provides new empirical input for testing physical processes that drive the formation and evolution of binary stars in globular clusters. It also demonstrates Rubin's unique wide-field and high-precision photometric capabilities to address a broader range of outstanding questions in star cluster research. Future full data releases will enable to significantly expand the study of dense stellar systems across the Milky Way.</description>

Abstract: The continuous flux of Galactic cosmic rays that bombard Earth's atmosphere creates ionizing radiation that can damage the DNA of living organisms. While this radiation on Earth is relatively constant in the short term, large and long-scale fluctuations are expected with a period of $\sim 63.5$ million years. As the Solar System moves above or below the Galactic plane during its oscillatory motion about the Galactic center, the Galactic magnetic shielding weakens, allowing more cosmic rays to reach Earth and trigger mutations in organisms. We identify a significant correlation (weighted global p-value: $1.25\times 10^{-4}$, or $3.72\sigma$) between the Solar System's Galactic oscillations and the origination of marine zoo- and phyto-microplankton genera over the Phanerozoic. When we restrict the analysis to time intervals during which all four groups coexisted, a post-trial significance of $4.52\sigma$ emerges. Our findings suggest that changes in biodiversity have been significantly influenced by long-term Galactic forcing.</description>

      <title>Cosmography via stellar archaeology of low-redshift early-type galaxies from SDSS</title>

Abstract: Cosmic chronometers offer a model-independent way to trace the expansion history of the Universe via the dating of passively evolving objects. This enables testing the validity of cosmological models without concrete assumptions of their energy content. The main goal of this work is to derive model-independent constraints on the Hubble parameter up to $z \sim 0.4$ using stellar ages from the fitting of Lick index absorption lines in passively evolving galaxies. Contrary to recent related works that rely on finite differences to obtain a discrete measurement of the expansion of the Universe at an average redshift, our goal is to perform a cosmographic fit of $H(z)$ in terms of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the deceleration ($q_0$) and jerk ($j_0$) parameters. We carefully select spectra of massive and passively evolving galaxies from the SDSS Legacy Survey. After applying a stacking procedure to ensure a high signal-to-noise ratio, the strength of Lick indices is fit using two stellar population models (TMJ and Knowles) to derive stellar population parameters. A cosmographic fit to the stellar ages is performed, which in turn enables the sampling of the Hubble parameter within the considered redshift range. The baseline result comes from using the TMJ-modelled ages, and it yields a value of $H_0 = 70.0^{+4.1}_{-7.6} \text{ km s}^{-1} \text{ Mpc}^{-1}$ for the Hubble constant, where uncertainties refer only to the statistical treatment of the data. The sampling of the Hubble parameter at $0.05 &lt; z &lt; 0.35$ is competitive with discreet model-independent measurements from the literature. We finally draw attention to an unexpected oscillating pattern in a number of critical indices with respect to redshift, which translates into a similar behaviour in the $t-z$ relations. These features have never been discussed before, although they are present in previous measurements.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Magnetohydrodynamics: A New Two-Moment Framework with Numerical Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) play a pivotal role in various astrophysical systems, delivering feedback over a broad range of scales. However, modeling CR transport remains challenging due to its inherently multi-scale nature and complex microphysics. Recent advances in two-moment CR hydrodynamics have alleviated some of these challenges, improving understanding of CR feedback. Yet, current two-moment methods may not be able to directly incorporate all relevant CR transport processes, while the outcome of CR feedback sensitively depends on these underlying microphysics. Furthermore, numerical challenges persist, including instabilities from streaming terms and ambiguities in solver design for coupled CR-MHD systems. In this work, we develop a two-moment description for CR hydrodynamics from first principles. Beyond canonical CR streaming, our formulation accounts for CR pressure anisotropy and Alfv\'en waves propagating in both directions along the magnetic field, providing a general framework to incorporate more CR transport physics. We implement this framework as a new CR fluid module in the \textit{Athena}++ code, and validate it through a suite of benchmark tests. In particular, we derive the full dispersion relation of the two-moment CR-MHD system, identifying the CR-acoustic instability as well as other wave branches. These CR-MHD waves serve as rigorous benchmarks and also enable the use of realistic signal speeds in our Riemann solver. We propose a time step guideline to mitigate numerical instabilities arising from streaming source terms.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Multiple Gas Kinematic Drivers in the Perseus Galaxy Cluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters, the Universe's largest halo structures, are filled with 10-100 million degree X-ray-emitting gas. Their evolution is shaped by energetic processes such as feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and mergers with other cosmic structures. The imprints of these processes on gas kinematic properties remain largely unknown, restricting our understanding of gas thermodynamics and energy conversion within clusters. High-resolution spectral mapping across a broad spatial-scale range provides a promising solution to this challenge, enabled by the recent launch of the XRISM X-ray Observatory. Here, we present the kinematic measurements of the X-ray-brightest Perseus cluster with XRISM, radially covering the extent of its cool core. We find direct evidence for the presence of at least two dominant drivers of gas motions operating on distinct physical scales: a small-scale driver in the inner ~60 kpc, likely associated with the SMBH feedback; and a large-scale driver in the outer core, powered by mergers. The inner driver sustains a heating rate at least an order of magnitude higher than the outer one. This finding suggests that, during the active phase, the SMBH feedback generates turbulence, which, if fully dissipated into heat, could play a significant role in offsetting radiative cooling losses in the Perseus core. Our study underscores the necessity of kinematic mapping observations of extended sources for robust conclusions on the properties of the velocity field and their role in the assembly and evolution of massive halos. It further offers a kinematic diagnostic for theoretical models of SMBH feedback.</description>

      <title>Unions with UNIONS: Using galaxy-galaxy lensing to probe galaxy mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use galaxy-galaxy lensing to investigate how the dark matter (DM) haloes and stellar content of galaxies with $0.012 \leq z \leq 0.32$ and $10 \leq \log_{10}(M_\star/\mathrm{M}_\odot) \leq 12$ change as a result of the merger process. To this end, we construct two samples of galaxies obtained from the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS), comprising 1 623 post-mergers and $\sim$30 000 non-merging controls, that live in low-density environments to use as our lenses. These samples are weighted to share the same distributions of stellar mass, redshift, and geometric mean distance to a galaxy's three nearest neighbours to ensure differences in the lensing signal are due to the merger process itself. We do not detect a statistically significant difference in the excess surface density profile of post-mergers and non-merging controls with current data. Fitting haloes composed of a point-like stellar mass component and an extended DM structure described by a Navarro-Frenk-White profile to the lensing measurements yields, for both samples, halo masses of $M_\text{halo} \sim 4\times10^{12}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and a moderately negative correlation between $M_\text{halo}$ and concentration $c$. This allows us to rule out, at the 95% confidence level, merger-induced starbursts in which more than 60% of the stellar mass is formed in the burst. The application of our methods to upcoming surveys that are able to provide samples $\sim$10$\times$ larger than our current catalogue are expected to detect the weak-lensing signatures of mergers and further constrain their properties.</description>

      <title>Much Ado About Nothing: Galaxy Formation and Galactic Outflows in Cosmic Voids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for calculating the volume filling fraction of galactic outflows in cosmic voids by integrating analytical models for the halo mass function (HMF), the halo occupation fraction, the stellar mass-halo mass relation, and outflow sizes. Using RAMSES, we perform a hydrodynamical zoom-in simulation of the central 25 cMpc/h region of a spherical void, identified as the lowest-density region among 1,000 random spheres in a parent 1 Gpc box simulation. This void has a diameter of 120 cMpc/h and a density contrast of $\delta \simeq -0.8$. We find that the properties of void galaxies remain stable when expanding the zoom-in region to 50 cMpc/h, though our relatively low mass resolution impacts the results. Our higher-resolution simulation aligns with the analytical HMF that accounts for the void's underdensity and size. While higher resolution improves stellar mass estimates for low-mass halos, computational constraints necessitate a theoretical framework that enables extrapolation to infinite resolution. Our analytical model, calibrated to our simulations, enables extrapolation down to the filtering mass of star-forming halos. To compare galaxy properties in this void with those in the field, we conduct a companion field simulation of the same box size. At infinite resolution, we predict wind volume filling fractions of $18.6\%$ in the field and $3.1\%$ in our void, with values dependent on cosmic variance, void size, and underdensity. Dwarf galaxies contribute minimally, and resolving halos to $M_{\rm h}=10^{10} M_\odot$ suffices for robust estimates. Applying our framework to the Local Group void ($\delta \simeq -0.5$, $R=20\ \mathrm{cMpc}$), we predict a wind volume filling fraction of $9.6\%\pm3.3\%$.</description>

      <title>The COSMOS-Web Lens Survey (COWLS) I: Discovery of &gt;100 high redshift strong lenses in contiguous JWST imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the COSMOS-Web Lens Survey (COWLS), a sample of over 100 strong lens candidates from the $0.54$\,deg$^2$ COSMOS-Web survey, discovered using exquisite James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging across four wavebands. Following two rounds of visual inspection, over 100 candidates were ranked as `high confidence' or `likely' by at least $50\%$ of inspectors. The COWLS sample has several notable properties: (i) magnified source galaxies spanning redshifts $z \sim 0.1$ to $z \sim 9$, which therefore extend into the epoch of reionisation; (ii) the highest-redshift lens galaxies known, pushing galaxy density profile evolution studies beyond $z \sim 2$; (iii) all lenses are distributed within a contiguous $0.54$\,deg$^2$ region, allowing for joint strong and weak lensing analyses; and (iv) a subset exhibits lensed source emission ray-traced near the lens galaxy centers, enabling studies of supermassive black holes and dust absorption. A key innovation of our approach is the use of lens modelling to aid in identifying lenses that may otherwise be missed. This paper is accompanied by the first COWLS public release, providing JWST NIRCam imaging in four bands, lens models, pixelized source reconstructions and lens redshift estimates : https://github.com/Jammy2211/COWLS_COSMOS_Web_Lens_Survey</description>

      <title>Exploiting synergies between JWST and cosmic 21-cm observations to uncover star formation in the early Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the current era of JWST, we continue to uncover a wealth of information about the Universe deep into the Epoch of Reionization. In this work, we use a suite of simulations with 21cmSPACE, to explore the astrophysical properties of early galaxies and their imprint on high-redshift observables. Our analysis incorporates a range of multi-wavelength datasets including UV luminosity functions (UVLFs) from HST and JWST spanning $z=6-14.5$, the 21-cm global signal and power spectrum limits from SARAS 3 and HERA respectively, as well as present-day diffuse X-ray and radio backgrounds. We constrain a flexible halo-mass and redshift dependent model of star-formation efficiency (SFE), defined as the fraction of gas converted into stars, and find that it is best described by minimal redshift evolution at $z\approx 6-10$, followed by rapid evolution at $z\approx10-15$. Using Bayesian inference, we derive functional posteriors of the SFE, inferring that halos of mass $M_h=10^{10}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ have efficiencies of $\approx 1 - 2\%$ at $z\lesssim10$, $\approx8\%$ at $z=12$ and $\approx21\%$ at $z=15$. We also highlight the synergy between UVLFs and global 21-cm signal from SARAS 3 in constraining the minimum virial conditions required for star-formation in halos. In parallel, we find the X-ray and radio efficiencies of early galaxies to be $f_X = 0.8^{+9.7}_{-0.4}$ and $f_r \lesssim 16.9$ respectively, improving upon previous works that exclude UVLF data. Our results underscore the critical role of UVLFs in constraining early galaxy properties, and their synergy with 21-cm and other multi-wavelength observations.</description>

      <title>Close-knit relatives: reproducing galactic rotation curves with a two-component bosonic dark matter model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bosonic stars,hypothetical astrophysical entities, are generally categorized into two primary classes based on the nature of their constituent particles: Einstein Klein Gordon stars, made up of massive scalar bosons, and Proca stars, their vector ''cousins''. Depending on the boson masses and field frequencies, these objects may exhibit properties of diffuse, massive structures, with sizes comparable to or even exceeding those of galaxies. This concept has inspired the bosonic dark matter halo hypothesis, providing a theoretical framework to effectively model the dark matter content of galactic halos. In this paper we build on our previous work to explore the possibility of using vector and scalar bosons to model the components of galactic dark matter halos and subhalos in order to reproduce the observed rotation curves of galaxies. By employing diverse combinations of those bosonic dark matter models in conjunction with observable data for a sample of galaxies, we show that our two component dark matter approach notably improves the agreement between observations and theoretical predictions with respect to our previous investigation. Our framework may shed new light on the enduring mystery surrounding the apparent matter deficit observed in dwarf and spiral galaxies.</description>

      <title>H3+ in irradiated protoplanetary disks: Linking far-ultraviolet radiation and water vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The likely JWST detection of vibrationally excited H3+ emission in Orion's irradiated disk system d203-506, reported by Schroetter et al., raises an important question: is cosmic-ray ionization enhanced in disks within clustered star-forming regions, or do alternative mechanisms contribute to H3+ formation and excitation? We present a detailed model of the photodissociation region (PDR) component of a protoplanetary disk-comprising the outer disk surface and the photoevaporative wind-exposed to strong external far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation. We investigate key gas-phase reactions involving excited H2 that lead to the formation of H3+ in the PDR, including detailed state-to-state dynamical calculations of reactions H2(v&gt;0) + HOC+ -&gt; H3+ + CO and H2(v&gt;0) + H+ -&gt; H2+ + H. We also consider the effects of photoionization of vibrationally excited H2(v&gt;=4), a process not previously included in PDR or disk models. We find that these FUV-driven reactions dominate the formation of H3+ in the PDR of strongly irradiated disks, largely independently of cosmic-ray ionization. The predicted H3+ abundance in the disk PDR peaks at x(H3+) ~ 1E-8, coinciding with regions of enhanced HOC+ and water vapor abundances, and is linked to the strength of the external FUV field (G_0). The predicted H3+ column density (~1E13 cm^-2) agrees with the presence of H3+ in the PDR of d203-506. We also find that formation pumping, resulting from exoergic reactions between excited H2 and HOC+, drive the vibrational excitation of H3+ in these regions. We expect this photochemistry to be highly active in disks where G_0 &gt; 1E3. The H3+ formation pathways studied here may also be relevant in the inner disk region (near the host star), in exoplanetary ionospheres, and in the early Universe.</description>

Abstract: We present simulations of the supernova-driven turbulent interstellar medium (ISM) in a simulation domain of volume $(256\,{\rm pc})^3$ within which we resolve the formation of protostellar accretion disks and their stellar cores to spatial scales of $\sim 10^{-4}$ au, using the moving-mesh code {\small AREPO}. We perform simulations with no magnetic fields, ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and ambipolar diffusion, and compare the resulting first Larson cores and their associated structures, including the accretion disks, their location within the larger-scale structure and the streamers connecting these. We find that disks of sizes $10-100\,{\rm au}$ form early in the simulations without magnetic fields, while there are no disks larger than 10 au with ideal MHD. Ambipolar diffusion causes large disks to form in a subset of cases (two out of six cores), and generally reduces the strength of outflows, which are seen to play a central role. When they are able to carry away significant angular momentum, they prevent the formation of a rotationally supported disk. Magnetic fields strengths grow from $0.1 - 1$ mG in the protostellar core to more than 10 G in the first Larson core in all simulations with ideal MHD. The rotationally supported disks which form can have rotation speeds $&gt; 1$ km s$^{-1}$ even out to further than 100 au from the centre, become gravitationally unstable and form complex spiral substructures with Toomre $Q &lt; 1$. We conclude that the impact of magnetic fields and non-ideal MHD on the formation of protostellar disks is substantial in realistic formation scenarios from the turbulent ISM.</description>

      <title>Constraints on a dark matter sub-halo near the Sun from pulsar timing</title>

Abstract: Using pulsar accelerations, we identify and constrain the properties of a dark matter sub-halo in the Galaxy for the first time from analyzing the acceleration field of binary and solitary pulsars. The sub-halo is characterized by analyzing a local deviation from a smooth potential. Our MCMC calculations show that this sub-halo has a mass of $2.45^{+1.07}_{-0.96} \times 10^{7}~M_{\odot}$ and is located at Galactocentric coordinates $X = 7.43^{+0.2}_{-0.12}~\rm$ kpc, $Y = 0.38^{+0.11}_{-0.16} ~\rm kpc$, $Z = 0.21^{+0.06}_{-0.11} ~\rm kpc$, using flat, uninformative priors, where we have modeled the sub-halo as a compact object. The Bayes factors for the models are in the range of $\sim$ 20-40, which indicate strong evidence (though not yet decisive) for the sub-halo. Modeling the sub-halo with a NFW profile gives a sub-halo mass of $6.19^{+1.92}_{-2.03} \times 10^{7}$, located at $X = 7.47^{+0.21}_{-0.14}$, $Y=0.38^{+0.11}_{-0.16}$, $Z=0.21^{+0.06}_{-0.11}$. We examine \textit{Gaia} data and the atomic and molecular hydrogen data of our Galaxy and show that the measured deviation from a smooth potential cannot arise from the gas or the stars in our Galaxy. Additionally, by analyzing the full sample of binary pulsars with available acceleration measurements that span 3.4 kpc in Galactocentric radius from the Sun and 3.6 kpc in vertical height, we find that massive (with mass $&gt;10^{8}~M_{\odot}~$) sub-halos are disfavored for the Milky Way within several kiloparsec of the Sun. As the number and precision of direct acceleration measurements continues to grow, we will obtain tighter constraints on dark matter sub-structure in our Galaxy. These measurements now open a new avenue for studying dark matter and have implications across many fields of astrophysics - from understanding the nature of dark matter to galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>Forgotten treasures in the HST/FOC UV imaging polarimetric archives of active galactic nuclei. IV. 5 Orphaned AGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Faint Object Camera (FOC) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) acquired high-resolution spatially resolved polarimetric images of nearby active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the near-ultraviolet (near-UV) band. Eight of the 25 individual targets in the polarized archives had no published analysis until the beginning of this series of papers. We describe the last 5 targets here. In this paper, we finalize the publication of near-UV imaging polarimetry of AGNs in the HST/FOC archives. We render available spatially resolved polarization maps of the [OIII] emission lines for Mrk 3 and Mrk 78, as well as near-UV continuum polarization maps for Mrk 3, NGC 3862, Cygnus A, and 3C 109. We used the generalized reduction pipeline presented in the first paper in this series to homogeneously analyze the five remaining polarized observations of AGNs in the FOC archives. The polarization pattern in Mrk 3 and Mrk 78 in the narrow-line regions is consistent with scattering from an obscured nucleus. For NGC 3862, we confirm marginal UV polarization parallel with the inner radio jet that is related to synchrotron emission. In Cygnus A, we report spatially resolved centro-symmetric polarization patterns in the two opposite outflows, which highlights the scattering origin of the polarized light. Finally, 3C 109 shows high nuclear polarization that is consistent with AGN-dominated emission and parallel with the radio axis, but differs from the polarization from dichroic absorption invoked by previous authors. The imaging polarimetry we obtained for the narrow-line region and the extended scattering medium surrounding the obscured AGNs is aligned with the predictions of the unified AGN model and demonstrates the power of spatially resolved polarimetric observation to decipher the complex morphologies at work in AGNs.</description>

      <title>Stellar Mass Assembly History of Massive Quiescent Galaxies since $z\sim4$: Insights from Spatially Resolved SED Fitting with JWST Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive quiescent galaxies at high redshift show significantly more compact morphology than their local counterparts. To examine their internal structure across a wide redshift range and investigate potential redshift dependence, we performed spatially resolved SED fitting using pixedfit software on massive $(\log(M_*/M_\odot)\sim11)$ quiescent galaxies at $0&lt;z&lt;4$ with public James Webb Space Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope imaging data from the Public Release Imaging for Extragalactic Research and the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey. We find that at $z \sim 3.5$, the half-mass radius is about 5.4 times smaller than at $z \sim 0.5$. This growth is driven by stellar mass buildup in the outskirts ($r &gt; 4$ kpc), while the central regions ($r \sim 1$ kpc) remain largely unchanged, with stellar mass surface density similar to local quiescent galaxies. The estimated star formation rates are too low to explain the stellar mass growth, indicating an additional stellar mass accumulation process, such as mergers, is necessary. We parameterize the size-mass relation of the most massive galaxies in our sample as $\log(R_{e,mass}) \propto \alpha \log(M_*)$, and find $\alpha = 2.67^{+1.14}_{-1.17}$ for $z\lessapprox2$, consistent with growth dominated by minor mergers, and $\alpha = 0.91^{+0.20}_{-0.16}$ for $z\gtrapprox2$, consistent with growth dominated by major mergers. These results indicate that massive quiescent galaxies originate from compact quenched systems and grow through combinations of minor and major mergers.</description>

      <title>Influence of supermassive primordial black holes on ultraviolet luminosity of high-redshift galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have observed an excess of luminous galaxies at high redshifts ($z \gtrsim 10$). In this work, we investigate whether supermassive primordial black holes (SMPBHs) can explain it by their influence on the ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) of high-redshift galaxies. Through Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis, we constrain the parameters relevant with SMPBHs against current JWST observational data. The results reveal that SMPBHs with masses $M_{\rm PBH} \sim 10^{6.3\text{-}8.3} M_\odot$, abundances $f_{\rm PBH} \sim 10^{-7}\text{-}10^{-5}$, and sub-Eddington ratios $\lambda_E \ll 1$ can effectively enhance the bright end of the UV LF, consistent with JWST observations.</description>

      <title>The spectra of a radiative reprocessing outflow model for fast blue optical transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radiation reprocessing model, in which an optically-thick outflow absorbs the high-energy emission from a central source and re-emits in longer wavelengths, has been frequently invoked to explain some optically bright transients, such as fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) whose progenitor and explosion mechanism are still unknown. Previous studies on this model did not take into account the frequency dependence of the opacity. We study the radiative reprocessing and calculate the UV-optical-NIR band spectra from a spherical outflow composed of pure hydrogen gas, for a time-dependent outflowing mass rate. Electron scattering and frequency-dependent bound-free, free-free opacities are considered. The spectrum deviates from the blackbody at NIR and UV frequencies; in particular, it has $\nu L_{\nu} \propto \nu^{1.5}$ at NIR frequencies, because at these frequencies the absorption optical depth from the outflow's outer edge to the so-called photon trapping radius is large and is frequency dependent. We apply our model to the proto-type FBOT AT2018cow by {the spectra} to the observed SED. The best-fit mass loss rate suggests that the total outflow mass in AT2018cow is $M_{\rm out} \approx 5.7^{+0.4}_{-0.4} \, M_{\odot}$. If that equals the total mass lost during an explosion, and if the progenitor is a blue supergiant (with a pre-explosion mass of $\sim 20 \, M_{\odot}$), then it will suggest that the central compact remnant mass is at least $\approx \, \rm{14 \, M_{\odot}}$. This would imply that the central remnant is a black hole.</description>

      <title>Disk-jet coupling across the spectral transition in supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accretion flows in both stellar and supermassive black holes show a distinct spectral transition. This is seen directly in binaries and changing look AGN, and also in a recent sample of eROSITA X-ray selected, unobscured AGN where the stacked spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for a single black hole mass bin (log $M/M_{\odot} =8-8.5$) clearly show the UV bright disk appearing as the luminosity increases. In binaries, this transition is associated with a change in radio jet, from coupling to the X-ray hot flow with $L_R \propto L_X^{0.7}$ (Fundamental Plane relation), to collapsing when the X-ray hot flow collapses into a disc. We explore the radio behaviour across the transition in our AGN sample by stacking VLASS images. We significantly detect weak radio emission even after subtracting the contribution from star formation in the host galaxy. The residual radio emission remains relatively constant across the transition, despite the mean mass accretion rate changing by a factor 6 and UV flux changing by a factor 100. However, the X-rays change by only a factor 2, giving a constant radio to X-ray flux ratio as predicted by the 'fundamental plane'. We show that this is consistent with these AGN having the same compact radio jet coupling to the X-ray hot flow (not the disc) as in the binaries. The most significant difference is the persistence of the coronal X-rays across the spectral transition in AGN, whereas in binaries the coronal X-rays can be very weak in the disc dominated state.</description>

      <title>Stretch to stretch, dust to dust: lower-value local $H_{0}$ measurement from two-population modelling of type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the local Hubble constant measurement from type Ia supernovae calibrated with Cepheids (SH0ES) by remodelling the supernova data using two supernova populations emerging from the observed bimodal distribution of the SALT2 stretch parameter. Our analysis accounts for population differences in both intrinsic properties (related to possible initial conditions, including supernova progenitor channels) and host-galaxy extinction (expected from well-known environmental differences associated observationally with the two populations). Based on a two-population Bayesian hierarchical modelling of the SALT2 light-curve parameters from the Pantheon+ compilation, we simultaneously constrain intrinsic and extrinsic properties of both supernova populations, match probabilistically the calibration supernovae with the corresponding population in the Hubble flow, and derive the Hubble constant. The difference between the two supernova populations is primarily driven by their mean absolute magnitudes and total-to-selective extinction coefficients. This is related but not equivalent to the traditional mass-step correction (including its broadening for reddened supernovae). The mean extinction coefficient of the supernova population used to propagate distances from the calibration galaxies to the Hubble flow is found to be consistent with the Milky Way-like interstellar dust model with R_B~4 and substantially higher than the extinction model assumed in the SH0ES measurement. Allowing for possible differences between reddening in the calibration galaxies and the corresponding population in the Hubble flow, we obtain H_0=70.59+/-1.15 km/s/Mpc. For the most conservative choice assuming equal prior distributions, we find H_0=71.45+/-1.03 km/s/Mpc. Our reanalysis of type Ia supernovae results in a reduction of the discrepancy with the Planck H_0 by at least 30 and up to 50 per cent (3.5-2.2sigma).</description>
