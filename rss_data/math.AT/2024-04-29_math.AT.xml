      <title>Kaledin classes and formality criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general obstruction theory to the formality of algebraic structures over any commutative ground ring. It relies on the construction of Kaledin obstruction classes that faithfully detect the formality of differential graded algebras over operads or properads, possibly colored in groupoids. The present treatment generalizes the previous obstruction classes in two directions: outside characteristic zero and including a wider range of algebraic structures. This enables us to establish novel formality criteria, including formality descent with torsion coefficients, formality in families, intrinsic formality, and criteria in terms of chain-level lifts of homology automorphism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17540v1 Announce Type: new

      <title>The Gysin braid for $S^3$-actions on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a smooth action of the sphere $\mathbb S^3$ on a manifold $M$, we have previously constructed a Gysin sequence relating the cohomology of the manifold $M$ and that of the orbit space $M/\mathbb S^3$. This sequence involves an exotic term depending on the subset $M^{\mathbb S^1}$.
  Notice that the orbit space is a stratified pseudomanifold, a kind of singular spaces where intersection cohomology applies. In the case where the the action is semi-free, the first author has already constructed a Gysin sequence relating the cohomology of $M$ and the intersection cohomology of $M/\mathbb S^3$.
  What happens if the action is not semi-free? This is the goal of this work.
  The situation is more complicated and we do not find a Gysin sequence but a Gysin braid relating the cohomology of $M$ and the intersection cohomology of $M/\mathbb S^3$. This braid also contains an exotic term depending this time on the intersection cohomology of $M^{\mathbb S^1}$.</description>

      <title>Topological finiteness properties of monoids. Part 2: special monoids, one-relator monoids, amalgamated free products, and HNN extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03413</link>
      <description>arXiv:1805.03413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how topological methods developed in a previous article can be applied to prove new results about topological and homological finiteness properties of monoids. A monoid presentation is called special if the right-hand side of each relation is equal to $1$. We prove results which relate the finiteness properties of a monoid defined by a special presentation with those of its group of units. Specifically we show that the monoid inherits the finiteness properties $F_n$ and $FP_n$ from its group of units. We also obtain results which relate the geometric and cohomological dimensions of such a monoid to those of its group of units. We apply these results to prove a Lyndon's Identity Theorem for one-relator monoids of the form $\langle A \mid r=1 \rangle$. In particular we show that all such monoids are of type $F_{\infty}$ (and $FP_{\infty}$), and that when $r$ is not a proper power, then the monoid has geometric and cohomological dimension at most $2$. The first of these results resolves an important case of a question of Kobayashi from 2000 on homological finiteness properties of one-relator monoids. We also show how our topological approach can be used to prove results about the closure properties of various homological and topological finiteness properties for amalgamated free products and HNN-extensions of monoids. To prove these results we introduce new methods for constructing equivariant classifying spaces for monoids, as well as developing a Bass-Serre theory for free constructions of monoids.</description>

      <title>Supersolvable posets and fiber-type abelian arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.11996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a combinatorial analysis of fiber bundles of generalized configuration spaces on connected abelian Lie groups. These bundles are akin to those of Fadell-Neuwirth for configuration spaces, and their existence is detected by a combinatorial property of an associated finite partially ordered set. This is consistent with Terao's fibration theorem connecting bundles of hyperplane arrangements to Stanley's lattice supersolvability. We obtain a combinatorially determined class of K($\pi$,1) toric and elliptic arrangements. Under a stronger combinatorial condition, we prove a factorization of the Poincar\'e polynomial when the Lie group is noncompact. In the case of toric arrangements, this provides an analogue of Falk-Randell's formula relating the Poincar\'e polynomial to the lower central series of the fundamental group.</description>

      <title>The definable content of homological invariants II: \v{C}ech cohomology and homotopy classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11098v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the second installment in a series of papers applying descriptive set theoretic techniques to both analyze and enrich classical functors from homological algebra and algebraic topology. In it, we show that the \v{C}ech cohomology functors $\check{\mathrm{H}}^n$ on the category of locally compact separable metric spaces each factor into (i) what we term their definable version, a functor $\check{\mathrm{H}}^n_{\mathrm{def}}$ taking values in the category $\mathsf{GPC}$ of groups with a Polish cover (a category first introduced in this work's predecessor), followed by (ii) a forgetful functor from $\mathsf{GPC}$ to the category of groups. These definable cohomology functors powerfully refine their classical counterparts: we show that they are complete invariants, for example, of the homotopy types of mapping telescopes of $d$-spheres or $d$-tori for any $d\geq 1$, and, in contrast, that there exist uncountable families of pairwise homotopy inequivalent mapping telescopes of either sort on which the classical cohomology functors are constant. We then apply the functors $\check{\mathrm{H}}^n_{\mathrm{def}}$ to show that a seminal problem in the development of algebraic topology, namely Borsuk and Eilenberg's 1936 problem of classifying, up to homotopy, the maps from a solenoid complement $S^3\backslash\Sigma$ to the $2$-sphere, is essentially hyperfinite but not smooth.
  In the course of this work, we record Borel definable versions of a number of classical results bearing on both the combinatorial and homotopical formulations of \v{C}ech cohomology; in aggregate, this work may be regarded as laying foundations for the descriptive set theoretic study of the homotopy relation on the space of maps from a locally compact Polish space to a polyhedron, a relation which embodies a substantial variety of classification problems arising throughout mathematics.</description>

      <title>Quantum walk on simplicial complexes for simplicial community detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum walks have emerged as a transformative paradigm in quantum information processing and can be applied to various graph problems. This study explores discrete-time quantum walks on simplicial complexes, a higher-order generalization of graph structures. Simplicial complexes, encoding higher-order interactions through simplices, offer a richer topological representation of complex systems. Since the conventional classical random walk cannot directly detect community structures, we present a quantum walk algorithm to detect higher-order community structures called simplicial communities. We utilize the Fourier coin to produce entangled translation states among adjacent simplices in a simplicial complex. The potential of our quantum algorithm is tested on Zachary's karate club network. This study may contribute to understanding complex systems at the intersection of algebraic topology and quantum walk algorithms.</description>
