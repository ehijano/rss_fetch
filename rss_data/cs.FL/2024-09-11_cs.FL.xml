      <title>Proceedings 14th International Workshop on Non-Classical Models of Automata and Applications (NCMA 2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fourteenth International Workshop on Non-Classical Models of Automata and Applications (NCMA 2024) was held in G\"ottingen, Germany, on August 12 and 13, 2024, at the historic Georg-Augustus-Universit\"at, organized by the Theoretical Computer Science research group of the respective university. The NCMA workshop series was established in 2009 as an annual event for researchers working on non-classical and classical models of automata, grammars or related devices. Such models are investigated both as theoretical models and as formal models for applications from various points of view. The goal of the NCMA workshop series is to exchange and develop novel ideas in order to gain deeper and interdisciplinary coverage of this particular area that may foster new insights and substantial progress.</description>

      <title>Monitoring Real-Time Systems under Parametric Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Timed B\"uchi automata provide a very expressive formalism for expressing requirements of real-time systems. Online monitoring of embedded real-time systems can then be achieved by symbolic execution of such automata on the trace observed from the system. This direct construction however only is faithful if observation of the trace is immediate in the sense that the monitor can assign exact time stamps to the actions it observes, which is rarely true in practice due to the substantial and fluctuating parametric delays introduced by the circuitry connecting the observed system to its monitoring device. We present a purely zone-based online monitoring algorithm, which handles such parametric delays exactly without recurrence to costly verification procedures for parametric timed automata. We have implemented our monitoring algorithm on top of the real-time model checking tool UPPAAL, and report on encouraging initial results.</description>
