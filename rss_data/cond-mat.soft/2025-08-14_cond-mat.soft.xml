      <title>Physical Principles of Size and Frequency Scaling of Active Cytoskeletal Spirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cytoskeletal filaments transported by surface immobilized molecular motors with one end pinned to the surface have been observed to spiral in a myosin-driven actin 'gliding assay'. The radius of the spiral was shown to scale with motor density with an exponent of -1/3, while the frequency was theoretically predicted to scale with an exponent of 4/3. While both the spiraling radius and frequency depend on motor density, the theory assumed independence of filament length, and remained to be tested on cytoskeletal systems other than actin-myosin. Here, we reconstitute dynein-driven microtubule spiraling and compare experiments to theory and numerical simulations. We characterize the scaling laws of spiraling MTs and find the radius dependence on force density to be consistent with previous results. Frequency on the other hand scales with force density with an exponent of ~1/3, contrary to previous predictions. We also predict that the spiral radius scales proportionally and the frequency scales inversely with filament length, both with an exponent of ~1/3. A model of variable persistence length best explains the length dependence observed in experiments. Our findings that reconcile theory, simulations, and experiments improve our understanding of the role of cytoskeletal filament elasticity, mechanics of microtubule buckling and motor transport and the physical principles of active filaments.</description>

      <title>Memory effects of a static magnetic field on Brownian motion and the question of the absence of classical magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bohr-van Leeuwen (BvL) theorem, stating the absence of classical magnetization in equilibrium, a fundamental result in the field of magnetic phenomena, was originally proved for an electron gas. In the present work, we deal with the problem of whether this theorem applies to particles undergoing a non-Markovian Brownian motion in a static magnetic field. We consider a charged Brownian particle (BP) immersed in a bath of neutral particles. Generalizing the Zwanzig-Caldeira-Legget theory to the presence of a static external magnetic field, we come to the equation of motion for the BP in the form of a generalized Langevin equation that accounts for memory effects in the dynamics of the system. By using its solutions for the displacement and velocity of the BP, we calculate the angular momentum for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck thermal noise. At long times, when the system should reach equilibrium, this momentum and, consequently, the classical magnetic moment of the BP are nonzero, in contrast to the BvL theorem. With the help of analytical and precise numerical calculations for different sets of system parameters, a simple formula for the angular momentum has been deduced.</description>

      <title>Effective permeability conditions for diffusive transport through impermeable membranes with gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of industrial and biological applications. The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture.</description>

      <title>Collision of surfactant-laden droplets: insights from molecular dynamics simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the collision dynamics of surfactant-laden droplets and compare it with that of pure water droplets, with a focus on the bridge growth rate, energy balance, and disk dynamics, distinguishing the cases of head-on and off-centre collisions. By using molecular dynamics simulation of a coarse-grained model, it is found that initial linear scaling describes the first stage of the collision process, which is followed by power-law dynamics, in contrast to an initial thermal regime and a subsequent power-law behaviour observed for droplet coalescence. The transition between the two regimes occurs faster for surfactant-laden droplets. At higher collision velocities, the linear regime dominates the process with a gradual reduction of the power-law behaviour, reaching a situation in which the bridge growth is fully characterised by linear dynamics. The different behaviour of the droplets is presented in the form of a diagram of different scenarios, namely coalescence, separation, and splattering. In particular, it is found that higher velocities and larger offsets increase the likelihood of separation and splattering, with water droplets producing a greater number of satellite droplets due to reduced viscous damping. Also, a disk-like structure is observed as a result of collision, but it is less pronounced in the case of surfactant-laden droplets, due to higher dissipation of energy.</description>

      <title>Snap-through time of arches is controlled by slenderness and imperfections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Snap-through occurs in elastic structures when a stable equilibrium configuration becomes unstable, resulting in rapid motion towards a new and distinct stable state. While static analyses of snap-through are well documented, the dynamics of snap-through remain under-explored, particularly in structures with natural curvature. Using a combination of finite element simulations and multiple-scales analysis, we show that the snap-through dynamics of an arch under a central point load are controlled by its slenderness and imperfections embedded in the system. As the slenderness increases, the snap-through dynamics slow down, and the mode of snap-through changes from limit-point buckling to bifurcation buckling. When bifurcation buckling occurs, snap-through is preceded by an extended period of oscillatory behaviour. The duration of these pre-snap-through oscillations, and hence the snap-through time, is entirely controlled by imperfections in the system. Increasing the strength of imperfections dramatically reduces the snap-through time. Analytical expressions for the snap-through times are presented for limit point and bifurcation buckling. Our work suggests that natural curvature and deliberately introduced imperfections can be used to tune the snap-through dynamics of new functional materials.</description>

      <title>Ion-Specific Effects at the Surface of Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the interaction between salts and surfactants on the water surface using heterodyne-detected vibrational sum frequency generation (HD-VSFG) spectroscopy. We used sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as a prototype surfactant system at 75 micromolar bulk concentration in water. The vibrational response of the OH band of near-surface oriented water molecules and the CH bands of the hydrophobic tails of the surfactant are measured. We observed a dramatic enhancement of the surface density of the negatively charged SDS (DS-) within a narrow range of added salt concentrations. We demonstrated this increase is strongly ion-specific, and induced by the screening of the lateral Coulomb repulsion of the sulfate headgroups by the added cations, followed by strong hydrophobic interactions (hydrophobic collapse) when the DS- surface density reaches a critical value. For a solution of 75 micromolar SDS, the required concentrations of CsCl, KCl, and NaCl for this transition are 2, 5, and 10 mM, respectively.</description>

      <title>Performance of universal machine-learned potentials with explicit long-range interactions in biomolecular simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal machine-learned potentials promise transferable accuracy across compositional and vibrational degrees of freedom, yet their application to biomolecular simulations remains underexplored. This work systematically evaluates equivariant message-passing architectures trained on the SPICE-v2 dataset with and without explicit long-range dispersion and electrostatics. We assess the impact of model size, training data composition, and electrostatic treatment across in- and out-of-distribution benchmark datasets, as well as molecular simulations of bulk liquid water, aqueous NaCl solutions, and biomolecules, including alanine tripeptide, the mini-protein Trp-cage, and Crambin. While larger models improve accuracy on benchmark datasets, this trend does not consistently extend to properties obtained from simulations. Predicted properties also depend on the composition of the training dataset. Long-range electrostatics show no systematic impact across systems. However, for Trp-cage, their inclusion yields increased conformational variability. Our results suggest that imbalanced datasets and immature evaluation practices currently challenge the applicability of universal machine-learned potentials to biomolecular simulations.</description>

      <title>Minimal mechanism for flocking in phoretically interacting active particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07050v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective motion as a flock is a widely observed phenomenon in active matter systems. We report a flocking transition mechanism in a system of chemically interacting active colloidal particles sustained purely by chemo-repulsive torques at low to medium densities. The basic requirements to maintain the polar liquid flock are excluded volume repulsions and deterministic long-ranged net repulsive torques. The mechanism we report requires that the time scale individual colloids move a unit length to be dominant with respect to the time they deterministically sense chemicals. This can be equivalently interpreted as pair colloids sliding a minimal unit length before deterministically rotating due to chemical interactions. Switching on the translational repulsive forces renders the flock a crystalline structure. We complement these results with an analysis of a continuum hydrodynamic model, with the transition corresponding to destabilization of the flocking state.</description>

      <title>The role of confined water in the emergence of electrostatic strong coupling as revealed by nanoseparated charged lipid layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the interplay between Strong Coupling (SC) attraction and hydration repulsion in nanoconfined water between like-charged phospholipid layers. It challenges the assumption that SC attraction requires multivalent counterions by showing that hydration water can enhance electrostatic interactions. We combine reflectivities with numerical simulations to analyze supported phospholipid layers under different relative humidity and surface charge densities. X-ray fluorescence demonstrates that we can control the valence of the associated counterions. Experimental measurement of the water thickness, combined with precise determination of charged surface positions by numerical simulations, enable us to compare our experiments with a theoretical model. It shows that charge-screening by hydration water induces SC attraction, even at moderate surface charge densities with monovalent counterions. Furthermore, hydration repulsion is stronger for DPPS compared to DPPC. These findings offer insights into the forces that control interactions between phospholipid layers and have important implications for biological and colloidal systems.</description>

      <title>Tension-Induced Soft Stress and Viscoelastic Bending in Liquid Crystal Elastomers for Enhanced Energy Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Architected materials that exploit buckling instabilities to reversibly trap energy have been shown to be effective for impact protection. The energy-absorbing capabilities of these architected materials can be enhanced further by incorporating viscoelastic material behavior into the buckling elements using liquid crystal elastomers (LCE). In addition to conventional viscoelastic behavior, LCEs also exhibit a highly dissipative rate-dependent soft stress response from mesogen rotation under a mechanical load. However, the buckling elements cannot take advantage of this dissipation mechanism because buckling occurs at strains below the threshold for mesogen rotation. In this study, we investigate tension-induced soft stress behavior as an additional dissipation mechanism in horizontal members of lattice structures composed of tilted LCE beams under compression. Viscoelastic properties of LCEs with two crosslinking densities were characterized experimentally, and a nonlinear viscoelastic model was implemented in Abaqus/Standard as a user-defined element to simulate finite-strain behavior of monodomain LCEs, including soft stress response. Simulations and experiments revealed a non-monotonic dependence of energy dissipation on the thickness ratio between horizontal and tilted LCE members. Optimized structures with stretchable horizontal bars dissipated 2-3 times more energy than rigid-bar counterparts by balancing tension-driven soft stress with viscoelastic beam bending. These findings demonstrate a new design strategy for LCE-based architected materials to enhance energy dissipation.</description>

      <title>From Order to Chimeras: Unraveling Dynamic Patterns in Active Fluids with Nonlinear Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore pattern formation in an active fluid system involving two chemical species that regulate active stress: a fast-diffusing species ($A$) and a slow-diffusing species ($I$). The growth of species $A$ is modelled using a nonlinear logistic term. Through linear stability analysis, we derive phase diagrams illustrating the various dynamical regimes in parameter space. Our findings indicate that an increase in the P\'eclet number results in the destabilisation of the uniform steady state. In contrast, counter-intuitively, an increase in the nonlinear growth parameter of $A$ actually stabilises the homogeneous steady-state regime. Additionally, we observe that greater asymmetry between the species leads to three distinct dynamical phases, while low asymmetry fails to produce oscillatory instability. Numerical simulations conducted in instability regimes show patterns that range from irregular, arrhythmic configurations at high P\'eclet numbers to both transient and robust symmetry-breaking chimera states. Notably, these chimera patterns are more prevalent in the oscillatory instability regime, and our stability analysis indicates that this regime is the most extensive for high nonlinear growth parameters and moderately high P\'eclet numbers. Further, we also find soliton-like structures where aggregations of species $A$ merge, and new aggregations spontaneously emerge, and these patterns are prevalent in the phase of stationary instability. Overall, our study illustrates that a diverse array of patterns can emerge in active matter influenced by nonlinear growth in a chemical species, with chimeras being particularly dominant when the nonlinear growth parameter is elevated.</description>

      <title>How individual vs shared coordination governs the degree of correlation in rotational vs residence times in a high-viscosity lithium electrolyte</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02457v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Commercially used carbonate-based electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries are susceptible to many challenges, including flammability, volatility, and lower thermal stability. Solvated ionic liquids of LiTFSI salt (lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-amide) and glyme-based solvents are potential alternative candidates for commonly used electrolytes. We perform classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations study the effect of concentration and temperature on the translational and rotational dynamics. The radial distribution function shows stronger coordination of Li$^+$ ions with tetraglyme(G4), as shown in earlier studies, and forms a stable [Li(G4)]$^+$ cation complex. The self-diffusion coefficients are lower than the values experimentally observed but show better improvement over other classical force fields. An increase in the salt concentrations leads to a higher viscosity of the system and reduces the overall ionic mobility of Li$^{+}$ ions. Diluting the system with a larger number of glyme molecules leads to shorter rotational relaxation times for both TFSI and tetraglyme. Ion-residence times show that Li$^+$ ions form stable and long-lasting complexes with G4 molecules than TFSI anions. The residence time of [Li(G4)]$^+$ complex increases at higher salt concentrations due to the availability of fewer G4 molecules to coordinate with a Li$^+$ ion. G4 is also seen to form polydentate complexes with Li$^+$ without a shared coordination, allowing rotation without breaking coordination, unlike TFSI, which requires coordination disruption for rotation. This distinction explains the poor correlation between rotation and residence time for G4 and the strong correlation for TFSI.</description>

Abstract: Comprehending sound damping is integral to understanding the anomalous low temperature properties of glasses. Despite decades of studies, the underlying mechanism of sound damping in glasses is still debated. In this perspective we review recent work on sound damping in amorphous solids. We focus on the role of defects, heterogeneous elasticity, and damping in model amorphous solids without defects. We review our definition of damping defects and show that they strongly influence sound damping. However, we also find another contribution to sound damping that cannot be attributed to damping defects. We confirm an earlier result of Kapteijns et al. [G. Kapteijns et al., J. Chem. Phys. 154, 081101 (2021)] that heterogeneous elasticity theory predicts relative changes of sound damping in model two-dimensional glasses if the configuration-to-configuration elastic constants fluctuations are used to quantify the heterogeneity. We extend this finding to similar three-dimensional glasses. We end by discussing the Euclidean Random Matrix model, which exhibits Rayleigh scaling of sound damping, but does not have quasi-localized excitations, and thus probably does not have sound damping defects. We propose that the mechanisms behind sound damping can be more fully understood by approaching the problem from two directions, one where the strong influence of defects is studied and another where sound damping is studied in defect free albeit disordered materials.</description>
