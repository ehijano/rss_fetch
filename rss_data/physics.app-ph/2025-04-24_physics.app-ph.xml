      <title>Photolithography-Compatible Three-Terminal Superconducting Switch for Driving CMOS Loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting devices have enabled breakthrough performance in quantum sensing and ultra-low-power computing applications. However, the need for a cryo-electronics platform that can interface superconducting electronics with Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) devices has become increasingly evident in many cutting-edge applications. In this work, we present a three-terminal superconducting switch fabricated using photolithography, which can directly interface with CMOS electronics. We investigate the switching characteristics of this micron-width wire-based cryotron (wTron) by varying its channel and gate dimensions and sweeping its terminal bias currents. The wTron exhibits an output impedance exceeding 1 k$\Omega$ and demonstrates reduced sensitivity to ambient magnetic noise, similar to its nanoscale predecessor, the nanocryotron. In addition, its micron-width wires have switching currents in the mA range, making wTrons well-suited for driving current-hungry resistive loads and highly capacitive CMOS loads. We demonstrate the capability of wTron to drive room-temperature CMOS electronics, including an LED and a MOSFET with a gate capacitance of 500 pF. Finally, we discuss design considerations for optimizing wTron device parameters to drive CMOS loads, such as MOSFETs, HEMTs, and electro-optic modulators. Our analysis shows that wTron will facilitate the interface between superconducting electronics and CMOS, thereby paving the way for the development of foundry-process-compatible cryo-electronics ecosystems to advance next-generation computing and quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Review of the experimental and theoretical landscape of electron transport in noble liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a review of the current experimental and theoretical understanding of electron transport in noble liquids. Special attention is given to recent measurements that coincide with the development of time projection chambers (TPCs) using liquid xenon and argon as detector media. To enable transparent benchmarking of simulations and to facilitate the comparison between early studies and modern TPC data, we introduce a new open-access database of electron mobility and diffusion measurements. In particular, we emphasize the transition to large-scale detector designs which incorporate extended drift distances alongside improved purity control and field uniformity. On the theoretical side, we contrast empirical transport models with ab initio approaches, highlighting our recent efforts to incorporate low-energy, liquid-specific scattering phenomena, including coherent scattering, polarization screening, and bulk potential modifications. While elastic transport has seen substantial theoretical progress, inelastic processes in liquids, including ionization, exciton formation and interband transitions, remain poorly understood due to the lack of experimental cross sections and validated models. We also discuss the applications and challenges of modeling scintillation, doped and mixture-liquid targets, and gas-liquid interface behavior, all of which are critical for the design and optimization of next-generation detectors.</description>

      <title>Novel approach to use the Kelvin Probe method ex-situ for measuring the electron emission yield of insulator materials subjected to electron irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the total electron emission yield of dielectric materials remains a challenging task. Indeed, the charge induced by irradiation and electron emission disturbs the measurement. It is therefore important to quantify this charge during the measurement. Using a Kelvin probe allows both the emission yield and the induced charge to be measured. However, this method requires the probe to be placed inside the vacuum chamber, which is often complicated or even impossible. We propose a complete redesign of this method to overcome this issue. A capacitive coupling now allows the potential probe to be placed outside the chamber, in ambient atmosphere. Beyond this major simplification in implementation, we have also introduced several improvements that simplify the measurement protocol and reduce the overall measurement time. The new method was first validated on a metallic sample (Cu), and subsequently applied to a polymer (Kapton).</description>

      <title>Strongly inhomogeneous spin dynamics induced by ultrashort laser pulses with a gradient intensity profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical pump-probe technique is a common tool for investigation of ultrafast spin dynamics, which usually utilizes single-diode detection averaging the dynamics over the pumped area. Using ultrafast imaging technique, we show experimentally that a femtosecond laser pulse with a gradient distribution of intensity efficiently excites strongly inhomogeneous spin dynamics on spatial scales much smaller than the pump spot size. The mechanism responsible for the inhomogeneous distribution is based on temperature gradients and corresponds to a sign change of the torque derivative in different areas of the pump. We argue that the observed phenomenon is general for the systems with competitive magnetic anisotropies. Overlooking this effect in the majority of pump-probe experiments may result in a dramatic underestimation of the live time and amplitude of the laser-induced spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Cooperative-Memory Photonic Reservoir using Modulation Nonlinearity: Circumventing the Speed Constraints of Nonlinear Silicon Microring Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex dynamics of silicon microring resonators loaded by delayed feedback elements enable high-speed photonic reservoir computing. Implementing feedback is especially challenging when the required delay should match the time scales of silicon's nonlinearities. To increase the computation speed and preclude any need for very long delay lines, we avoid relying on silicon's nonlinearity and merely employ either amplitude or phase modulation along with direct detection. By supplementing its memory with that of the electronic output layer, the proposed photonic reservoir composed of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer and a microring resonator is predicted to perform computations one order of magnitude faster than those based on silicon's nonlinearity with its speed only limited by the modulation/detection bandwidth. This reservoir performs accurately in NARMA-10, Mackey-Glass, and Santa-Fe prediction tasks, and enables signal equalization in optical communication systems.</description>

      <title>Spatially-Controlled Planar Czochralski Growth of Low-Loss Phase Change Materials for Programmable Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic integrated devices are progressively evolving beyond passive components into fully programmable systems, notably driven by the progress in chalcogenide phase-change materials (PCMs) for non-volatile reconfigurable nanophotonics. However, the stochastic nature of their crystal grain formation results in strong spatial and temporal crystalline inhomogeneities. Here, we propose the concept of spatially-controlled planar Czochralski growth, a novel method for programming the quasi-monocrystalline growth of low-loss Sb2S3 PCM, leveraging the seeded directional and progressive crystallization within confined channels. This guided crystallization method is experimentally shown to circumvent the current limitations of conventional PCM-based nanophotonic devices, including a multilevel non-volatile optical phase-shifter exploiting a silicon nitride-based Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and a programmable metasurface with spectrally reconfigurable bound state in the continuum. Precisely controlling the growth of PCMs to ensure uniform crystalline properties across large areas is the cornerstone for the industrial development of non-volatile reconfigurable photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Wafer-Scale Characterization of Al/AlxOy/Al Josephson Junctions at Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions (JJs) are the key element of many devices operating at cryogenic temperatures. Development of time-efficient wafer-scale JJ characterization for process optimization and control of JJ fabrication is essential. Such statistical characterization has to rely on room temperature techniques since cryogenic measurements typically used for JJs are too time consuming and unsuitable for wafer-scale characterization. In this work, we show that from room temperature capacitance and current-voltage measurements, with proper data analysis, we can independently obtain useful parameters of the JJs on wafer-scale, like oxide thickness, tunnel coefficient, and interfacial defect densities. Moreover, based on detailed analysis of current vs voltage characteristics, different charge transport mechanisms across the junctions can be distinguished. We exemplary demonstrate the worth of these methods by studying junctions fabricated on 200 mm wafers with an industrially scale-able concept based on subtractive processing using only CMOS compatible tools. From these studies, we find that our subtractive fabrication approach yields junctions with quite homogeneous average oxide thickness across the full wafers, with a spread of less then 3$\,$%. The analysis also revealed a variation of the tunnel coefficient with oxide thickness, pointing to a stoichiometry gradient across the junctions' oxide width. Moreover, we estimated relatively low interfacial defect densities in the range of 70 - 5000$\,$defects/cm$^2$ for our junctions and established that the density increased with decreasing oxide thickness, indicating that the wet etching process applied in the JJs fabrication for oxide thickness control leads to formation of interfacial trap state</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing with spin defects in boron nitride nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin defects in semiconductors are widely investigated for various applications in quantum sensing. Conventional host materials such as diamond and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) provide bulk or low-dimensional platforms for optically addressable spin systems, but often lack the structural properties needed for chemical sensing. Here, we introduce a new class of quantum sensors based on naturally occurring spin defects in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), which combine high surface area with omnidirectional spin control, key features for enhanced sensing performance. First, we present strong evidence that these defects are carbon-related, akin to recently identified centers in hBN, and demonstrate coherent spin control over ensembles embedded within dense, microscale BNNTs networks. Using dynamical decoupling, we enhance spin coherence times by a factor exceeding 300x and implement high-resolution detection of radiofrequency signals. By integrating the BNNT mesh sensor into a microfluidic platform we demonstrate chemical sensing of paramagnetic ions in solution, with detectable concentrations reaching levels nearly 1000 times lower than previously demonstrated using comparable hBN-based systems. This highly porous and flexible architecture positions BNNTs as a powerful new host material for quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Strain Effect on Rashba Splitting and Phonon Scattering to Improve Thermoelectric Performance of 2D Heterobilayer MoTe$_{2}$/PtS$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rashba spin-orbit coupling significantly modifies the electronic band structure in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) heterobilayers, which may enhance their thermoelectric (TE) properties. In this study, we use first-principles calculations and Boltzmann transport theory to explore the strain effect on the TE performance of the 2D vdW heterobilayer MoTe$_{2}$/PtS$_{2}$. A strong Rashba spin-splitting is observed in the valence band, resulting in an increase in the Seebeck coefficient for p-type. The lattice thermal conductivity of MoTe$_{2}$/PtS$_{2}$ is remarkably low about of 0.6 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at $T = 300$ K due to large anharmonic scattering. Furthermore, biaxial strain enhances the power factor (PF) by introducing band convergence. At a strain of 2\%, the optimal PF for the n-type material reaches 170 $\mu$W/cmK$^{2}$, indicating approximately 84.78\% increase compared to the unstrained state (92 $\mu$W/cmK$^{2}$). Given the low lattice thermal conductivity, the optimized figure of merit $ZT$ achieves up to 0.88 at 900 K for n-type. Our findings indicate that MoTe$_{2}$/PtS$_{2}$ is a highly promising candidate for 2D heterobilayer TE materials, owing to its strong Rashba splitting and significant anharmonicity.</description>

      <title>Enhancing high-order harmonic generation in two-color laser fields: A comparison of single- and two-color schemes</title>

Abstract: We compare the enhancement of high-order harmonic generation in argon using 800--400 and 800--266~nm laser fields with their optimized single-color counterparts. We observe that the two-color fields generally outperform the single-color 800~nm field by factors of 2 to 3800, depending on the photon energy and generation scheme. From this comparison, we determine which scheme is optimal for each photon energy. We also observe that the divergence of HHG produced by the 800--266~nm laser fields is smaller than that of the other single- and two-color driving fields, perhaps suggesting that the 800--266~nm fields optimize the recombination probability of the so-called ``short" electron trajectories.</description>

      <title>High-field Breakdown and Thermal Characterization of Indium Tin Oxide Transistors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amorphous oxide semiconductors are gaining interest for logic and memory transistors compatible with low-temperature fabrication. However, their low thermal conductivity and heterogeneous interfaces suggest that their performance may be severely limited by self-heating, especially at higher power and device densities. Here, we investigate the high-field breakdown of ultrathin (~4 nm) amorphous indium tin oxide (ITO) transistors with scanning thermal microscopy (SThM) and multiphysics simulations. The ITO devices break irreversibly at channel temperatures of ~180 {\deg}C and ~340 {\deg}C on SiO${_2}$ and HfO${_2}$ substrates, respectively, with failure primarily caused by thermally-induced compressive strain near the device contacts. Combining SThM measurements with simulations allows us to estimate a thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of 35 ${\pm}$ 12 MWm${^-}$${^2}$K${^-}$${^1}$ for ITO on SiO${_2}$, and 51 ${\pm}$ 14 MWm${^-}$${^2}$K${^-}$${^1}$ for ITO on HfO${_2}$. The latter also enables significantly higher breakdown power due to better heat dissipation and closer thermal expansion matching. These findings provide insights into the thermo-mechanical limitations of indium-based amorphous oxide transistors, which are important for more reliable and high-performance logic and memory applications.</description>

      <title>Low-Dissipation Nanomechanical Devices from Monocrystalline Silicon Carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13893v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The applications of nanomechanical resonators range from biomolecule mass sensing to hybrid quantum interfaces. Their performance is often limited by internal material damping, which can be greatly reduced by using crystalline materials. Crystalline silicon carbide is appealing due to its exquisite mechanical, electrical and optical properties, but has suffered from high internal damping due to material defects. Here we resolve this by developing nanomechanical resonators fabricated from bulk monocrystalline 4H-silicon carbide. This allows us to achieve damping as low as 2.7 mHz, more than an order-of-magnitude lower than any previous crystalline silicon carbide resonator and corresponding to a quality factor as high as 20 million at room temperature. The volumetric dissipation of our devices reaches the material limit for silicon carbide for the first time. This provides a path to greatly increase the performance of silicon carbide nanomechanical resonators.</description>
