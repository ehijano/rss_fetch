      <title>The Minimal Methanol Economy as a Gap-Filler for High Electrification Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrifying sectors like land transport and building heating is a cost-effective strategy for decarbonisation. For harder-to-abate sectors that require fuels for their density or chemical properties, like long-haul aviation, shipping, backup power or iron ore reduction, electrolytic hydrogen and its derivatives are often proposed as part of a `hydrogen economy'. However, hydrogen itself is challenging to transport and store because of its small molecule size and low volumetric density; the build-up of a pipeline network needs close coordination with demand, supply and storage. We present a `minimal methanol economy' as an alternative concept for filling the gaps that electrification cannot reach. As a liquid at ambient conditions, methanol is easy to transport and store; it scales down to low-volume use cases without the lumpiness of hydrogen pipelines; it is a better drop-in fuel to replace methane; it can help integrate decentralised biomass wastes and residues into the energy system; it is needed anyway in large volumes as a feedstock for industry and transport fuels. We show in an energy system model for Europe that deep decarbonisation has lowest cost when hydrogen can be widely transported and used for backup power and heat, but a methanol-based system is only \bneuro{24} more expensive in the default scenario (3\% of system costs). This small increase is robust across varying assumptions about carbon sequestration, green imports and biomass availability. We argue that this modest expense is justified because methanol avoids many of the challenges in scaling up and regulating hydrogen infrastructure.</description>

      <title>The Geography of Transportation Cybersecurity: Visitor Flows, Industry Clusters, and Spatial Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of the transportation cybersecurity ecosystem, encompassing cybersecurity, automotive, and transportation and logistics sectors, will lead to the formation of distinct spatial clusters and visitor flow patterns across the US. This study examines the spatiotemporal dynamics of visitor flows, analyzing how socioeconomic factors shape industry clustering and workforce distribution within these evolving sectors. To model and predict visitor flow patterns, we develop a BiTransGCN framework, integrating an attention-based Transformer architecture with a Graph Convolutional Network backbone. By integrating AI-enabled forecasting techniques with spatial analysis, this study improves our ability to track, interpret, and anticipate changes in industry clustering and mobility trends, thereby supporting strategic planning for a secure and resilient transportation network. It offers a data-driven foundation for economic planning, workforce development, and targeted investments in the transportation cybersecurity ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Spatial public goods games with queueing and reputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In real-world social and economic systems, the provisioning of public goods generally entails continuous interactions among individuals, with decisions to cooperate or defect being influenced by dynamic factors such as timing, resource availability, and the duration of engagement. However, the traditional public goods game ignores the asynchrony of the strategy adopted by players in the game. To address this problem, we propose a spatial public goods game that integrates an M/M/1 queueing system to simulate the dynamic flow of player interactions. We use a birth-death process to characterize the stochastic dynamics of this queueing system, with players arriving following a Poisson process and service times being exponentially distributed under a first-come-first-served basis with finite queue capacity. We also incorporate reputation so that players who have cooperated in the past are more likely to be chosen for future interactions. Our research shows that a high arrival rate, low service rate, and the reputation mechanism jointly facilitate the emergence of cooperative individuals in the network, which thus provides an interesting and new perspective for the provisioning of public goods.</description>

      <title>Quantifying world geography as seen through the lens of Soviet propaganda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cultural data typically contains a variety of biases. In particular, geographical locations are unequally portrayed in media, creating a distorted representation of the world. Identifying and measuring such biases is crucial to understand both the data and the socio-cultural processes that have produced them. Here we suggest to measure geographical biases in a large historical news media corpus by studying the representation of cities. Leveraging ideas of quantitative urban science, we develop a mixed quantitative-qualitative procedure, which allows us to get robust quantitative estimates of the biases. These biases can be further qualitatively interpreted resulting in a hermeneutic feedback loop. We apply this procedure to a corpus of the Soviet newsreel series 'Novosti Dnya' (News of the Day) and show that city representation grows super-linearly with city size, and is further biased by city specialization and geographical location. This allows to systematically identify geographical regions which are explicitly or sneakily emphasized by Soviet propaganda and quantify their importance.</description>
