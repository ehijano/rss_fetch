      <title>Exclusive-or encoded algebraic structure for efficient quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a formalism that captures the algebraic structure of many-body two-level quantum systems, and directly motivates an efficient numerical method. This formalism is based on the binary representation of the enumeration-indices of the elements of the corresponding Lie algebra. The action of arbitrarily large elements of that algebra reduces to a few bit-wise exclusive-or operations. This formalism naturally produces sparse representations of many-body density operators, the size of which we control through a dynamic truncation method. We demonstrate how this formalism applies to real-time evolution, dissipative Lindblad action, imaginary-time evolution, and projective measurement processes. We find that this approach to calculating quantum dynamics scales close to linearly with the number of non-zero components in the density operator. We refer to this exclusive-or represented quantum algebra as ORQA. As a proof of concept, we provide a numerical demonstration of this formalism by simulating quantum annealing processes for the maximum independent set problem for up to 22 two-level systems.</description>

      <title>Four center integrals for Coulomb interactions in small molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we make some progress on studying four center integrals for the Coulomb energy for both Hartree Fock (HF) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations for small molecules. We consider basis wave functions of the form of an arbitrary radial wave function multiplied by a spherical harmonic and study four center Coulomb integrals for them. We reformulated these Coulomb four center integrals in terms of some derivatives of integrals of nearly factorable functions which then depend on the Bessel transform of the radial wave functions considered.</description>

      <title>Modeling Stochastic Chemical Kinetics on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Chemical Master Equation (CME) provides a highly accurate, yet extremely resource-intensive representation of a stochastic chemical reaction network and its kinetics due to the exponential scaling of its possible states with the number of reacting species. In this work, we demonstrate how quantum algorithms and hardware can be employed to model stochastic chemical kinetics as described by the CME using the Schl\"ogl Model of a trimolecular reaction network as an illustrative example. To ground our study of the performance of our quantum algorithms, we first determine a range of suitable parameters for constructing the stochastic Schl\"ogl operator in the mono- and bistable regimes of the model using a classical computer and then discuss the appropriateness of our parameter choices for modeling approximate kinetics on a quantum computer. We then apply the Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) algorithm to evaluate the smallest-magnitude eigenvalues, $\lambda_0$ and $\lambda_1$, which describe the transition rates of both the mono- and bi-stable systems, and the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm combined with the Variational Quantum Singular Value Decomposition (VQSVD) algorithm to estimate the zeromode (ground state) of the bistable case. Our quantum computed results from both noisy and noiseless quantum simulations agree within a few percent with the classically computed eigenvalues and zeromode. Altogether, our work outlines a practical path toward the quantum solution of exponentially complex stochastic chemical kinetics problems and other related stochastic differential equations.</description>

      <title>Mode-Shell correspondence, a unifying phase space theory in topological physics -- Part I: Chiral number of zero-modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a theory, that we call the \textit{mode-shell correspondence}, which relates the topological zero-modes localised in phase space to a \textit{shell} invariant defined on the surface forming a shell enclosing these zero-modes. We show that the mode-shell formalism provides a general framework unifying important results of topological physics, such as the bulk-edge correspondence, higher-order topological insulators, but also the Atiyah-Singer and the Callias index theories. In this paper, we discuss the already rich phenomenology of chiral symmetric Hamiltonians where the topological quantity is the chiral number of zero-dimensionial zero-energy modes. We explain how, in a lot of cases, the shell-invariant has a semi-classical limit expressed as a generalised winding number on the shell, which makes it accessible to analytical computations.</description>

      <title>The influence of the phase and structural state on the low-temperature elastic properties of molybdenum-alloyed non-equiatomic high-entropy alloys of the Fe-Co-Ni-Cr system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mechanical properties and microstructural evolution of a medium-entropy alloy Co$_{17.5}$Cr$_{12.5}$Fe$_{55}$Ni$_{10}$Mo$_{5}$ (at%) in a low temperature range (including the record low temperatures region down to 0.5 K) were investigated. It has been established that low-temperature plastic deformation initiates martensitic phase transformations in this alloy, and the values of the dynamic modulus of elasticity correlate with the degree of phase transformations.</description>
