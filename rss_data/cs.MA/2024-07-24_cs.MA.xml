      <title>Faster Optimal Coalition Structure Generation via Offline Coalition Selection and Graph-Based Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coalition formation is a key capability in multi-agent systems. An important problem in coalition formation is coalition structure generation: partitioning agents into coalitions to optimize the social welfare. This is a challenging problem that has been the subject of active research for the past three decades. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm, SMART, for the problem based on a hybridization of three innovative techniques. Two of these techniques are based on dynamic programming, where we show a powerful connection between the coalitions selected for evaluation and the performance of the algorithms. These algorithms use offline phases to optimize the choice of coalitions to evaluate. The third one uses branch-and-bound and integer partition graph search to explore the solution space. Our techniques bring a new way of approaching the problem and a new level of precision to the field. In experiments over several common value distributions, we show that the hybridization of these techniques in SMART is faster than the fastest prior algorithms (ODP-IP, BOSS) in generating optimal solutions across all the value distributions.</description>

      <title>(Demo) Systematic Experimentation Using Scenarios in Agent Simulation: Going Beyond Parameter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates a disconnected ABM architecture that enables domain experts, and non-programmers to add qualitative insights into the ABM model without the intervention of the programmer. This role separation within the architecture allows policy-makers to systematically experiment with multiple policy interventions, different starting conditions, and visualizations to interrogate their ABM</description>

      <title>MOMAland: A Set of Benchmarks for Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many challenging tasks such as managing traffic systems, electricity grids, or supply chains involve complex decision-making processes that must balance multiple conflicting objectives and coordinate the actions of various independent decision-makers (DMs). One perspective for formalising and addressing such tasks is multi-objective multi-agent reinforcement learning (MOMARL). MOMARL broadens reinforcement learning (RL) to problems with multiple agents each needing to consider multiple objectives in their learning process. In reinforcement learning research, benchmarks are crucial in facilitating progress, evaluation, and reproducibility. The significance of benchmarks is underscored by the existence of numerous benchmark frameworks developed for various RL paradigms, including single-agent RL (e.g., Gymnasium), multi-agent RL (e.g., PettingZoo), and single-agent multi-objective RL (e.g., MO-Gymnasium). To support the advancement of the MOMARL field, we introduce MOMAland, the first collection of standardised environments for multi-objective multi-agent reinforcement learning. MOMAland addresses the need for comprehensive benchmarking in this emerging field, offering over 10 diverse environments that vary in the number of agents, state representations, reward structures, and utility considerations. To provide strong baselines for future research, MOMAland also includes algorithms capable of learning policies in such settings.</description>

      <title>Rendering Wireless Environments Useful for Gradient Estimators: A Zero-Order Stochastic Federated Learning Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-device federated learning (FL) is a growing machine learning setting whereby multiple edge devices collaborate to train a model without disclosing their raw data. With the great number of mobile devices participating in more FL applications via the wireless environment, the practical implementation of these applications will be hindered due to the limited uplink capacity of devices, causing critical bottlenecks. In this work, we propose a novel doubly communication-efficient zero-order (ZO) method with a one-point gradient estimator that replaces communicating long vectors with scalar values and that harnesses the nature of the wireless communication channel, overcoming the need to know the channel state coefficient. It is the first method that includes the wireless channel in the learning algorithm itself instead of wasting resources to analyze it and remove its impact. We then offer a thorough analysis of the proposed zero-order federated learning (ZOFL) framework and prove that our method converges \textit{almost surely}, which is a novel result in nonconvex ZO optimization. We further prove a convergence rate of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{K}})$ in the nonconvex setting. We finally demonstrate the potential of our algorithm with experimental results.</description>

      <title>Honeybee: Decentralized Peer Sampling with Verifiable Random Walks for Blockchain Data Sharding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data sharding$\unicode{x2013}$in which block data is sharded without sharding compute$\unicode{x2013}$is at the present the favored approach for scaling Ethereum and other popular blockchains. A key challenge toward implementing data sharding is verifying whether the entirety of a block's data is available in the network (across its shards). A central technique proposed to conduct this verification uses erasure-coded blocks and is called data availability sampling (DAS). While the high-level protocol details of DAS have been well discussed in the community, discussions around how such a protocol will be implemented at the peer-to-peer layer are lacking. We identify random sampling of nodes as a fundamental primitive necessary to carry out DAS and present Honeybee, a decentralized algorithm for sampling nodes that uses verifiable random walks. Honeybee is secure against attacks even in the presence of a large number of Byzantine nodes (e.g., 50% of the network). We evaluate Honeybee through experiments and show that the quality of sampling achieved by Honeybee is significantly better compared to the state-of-the-art. Our proposed algorithm has implications for DAS functions in both full nodes and light nodes.</description>

      <title>MACM: Utilizing a Multi-Agent System for Condition Mining in Solving Complex Mathematical Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models, such as GPT-4, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing standard queries. Despite these advancements, their performance substantially declines in \textbf{advanced mathematical problems requiring complex, multi-step logical reasoning}. To enhance their inferential capabilities, current research has delved into \textit{prompting engineering}, exemplified by methodologies such as the Tree of Thought and Graph of Thought. Nonetheless, these existing approaches encounter two significant limitations. Firstly, their effectiveness in tackling complex mathematical problems is somewhat constrained. Secondly, the necessity to design distinct prompts for individual problems hampers their generalizability. In response to these limitations, this paper introduces the \textit{Multi-Agent System for conditional Mining} (\textbf{MACM}) prompting method. It not only resolves intricate mathematical problems but also demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across various mathematical contexts. With the assistance of MACM, the accuracy of GPT-4 Turbo on the most challenging level five mathematical problems in the MATH dataset increase from $\mathbf{54.68\%} \text{ to } \mathbf{76.73\%}$. The code is available in \url{https://github.com/bin123apple/MACM}.</description>
