      <title>Condorcet's Paradox as Non-Orientability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preference cycles are prevalent in problems of decision-making, and are contradictory when preferences are assumed to be transitive. This contradiction underlies Condorcet's Paradox, a pioneering result of Social Choice Theory, wherein intuitive and seemingly desirable constraints on decision-making necessarily lead to contradictory preference cycles. Topological methods have since broadened Social Choice Theory and elucidated existing results. However, characterisations of preference cycles in Topological Social Choice Theory are lacking. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a framework for topologically modelling preference cycles that generalises Baryshnikov's existing topological model of strict, ordinal preferences on 3 alternatives. In our framework, the contradiction underlying Condorcet's Paradox topologically corresponds to the non-orientability of a surface homeomorphic to either the Klein Bottle or Real Projective Plane, depending on how preference cycles are represented. These findings allow us to reduce Arrow's Impossibility Theorem to a statement about the orientability of a surface. Furthermore, these results contribute to existing wide-ranging interest in the relationship between non-orientability, impossibility phenomena in Economics, and logical paradoxes more broadly.</description>

      <title>Path Types in Algebraic Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new approach to the semantics of identity types in intensional Martin-L\"of type theory is proposed, assuming only a category with finite limits and an interval. The specification of \emph{extensional} identity types in the original presentation of natural models paralleled that of the other type formers $\Sigma$ and $\Pi$, but the treatment of the \emph{intensional} case there was less uniform. It was later reformulated to an account based on polynomials; here a further improvement in the style of the other type formers is achieved by employing an interval, in order to give a single pullback specification of a model with \emph{path types}. The interval is also used to specify a (Hurewicz) fibration structure on the universe of the model. It is shown that the combination of these two conditions suffices to model the intensional identity rules, assuming only finite limits. The addition of an interval also relates the current treatment to that of cubical type theory.</description>

      <title>Algebraic topology of the Lagrange inversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lagrange inversion formula for power series is one of the classical formulas from analysis and combinatorics. A nice geometric interpretation of this formula in terms of the Stasheff polytopes was discovered by Loday. We show that it also admits a natural topological interpretation in terms of the Chern numbers of the complex projective space. The proof is based on our earlier work on the Chern-Dold character in complex cobordism theory and leads to a new derivation of the Lagrange inversion formula. We provide a similar interpretation of the multiplicative inversion formulas in terms of Chern numbers of the smooth theta divisors. We discuss also the general related problem when all Chern numbers of an algebraic variety are divisible by its Euler characteristic.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove that, for a compact group $G$, a metrizable $G$-space is a $G$-ANR under the following asumptions: (1) if it dominates a $G$-ANR space through a fine $G$-homotopy equivalence; (2) if it is $G$-homotopy dense in a $G$-ANR; (3) if it contains a $G$-ANR as a $G$-homotopy dense subset; (4) if it is the inverse limit of an inverse sequence of $G$-ANR spaces with bonding maps that are fine $G$-homotopy equivalences.</description>

      <title>The motivic class of the space of genus $0$ maps to the flag variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\operatorname{Fl}_{n+1}$ be the variety of complete flags in $\mathbb{A}^{n+1}$ and let $\Omega^{2}_{\beta}(\operatorname{Fl}_{n+1})$ be the space of based maps $f:\mathbb{P}^{1}\to \operatorname{Fl}_{n+1}$ in the class $f_{*}[\mathbb{P}^{1}]=\beta$. We show that under a mild positivity condition on $\beta$, the class of $\Omega^{2}_{\beta}(\operatorname{Fl}_{n+1})$ in $K_{0}(\operatorname{Var})$, the Grothendieck group of varieties, is given by \[ [\Omega^{2}_{\beta}(\operatorname{Fl}_{n+1})] = [\operatorname{GL}_{n}\times \mathbb{A}^{a}]. \]
  The proof of this result was obtained in conjunction with Google Gemini and related tools. We briefly discuss this research interaction, which may be of independent interest. However, the treatment in this paper is entirely human-authored (aside from excerpts in an appendix which are clearly marked as such).</description>

Abstract: We introduce configured group cohomology, a variant of locally smooth cohomology built from well-configured tuples and geometric fillings. This framework yields explicit locally smooth $\R/\Z$-valued $3$-cocycles of Chern--Simons type on diffeomorphism groups preserving geometric structures. As an application we show that, for several such groups, the third group homology contains a subgroup isomorphic to $\Q/\Z$.</description>

Abstract: We study a weak form of formality for differential graded algebras, called $A_3$-formality, for the cohomology of pro-p Demushkin groups at odd primes p. We show that the differential graded $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebras of continuous cochains of Demushkin groups with q-invariant not equal 3 are $A_3$-formal, whereas Demushkin groups with q-invariant 3 are not $A_3$-formal. We prove these results by an explicit computation of the Benson-Krause-Schwede canonical class in Hochschild cohomology.</description>

      <title>Topological Stability and Latschev-type Reconstruction Theorems for Spaces of Curvature Bounded Above</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04259v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of homotopy-type reconstruction of compact subsets $X\subset\R^N$ that have the Alexandrov curvature bounded above ($\leq$ $\kappa$) in the intrinsic length metric. The reconstructed spaces are in the form of Vietoris--Rips complexes computed from a compact sample $S$, Hausdorff--close to the unknown shape $X$. Instead of the Euclidean metric on the sample, our reconstruction technique leverages a path-based metric to compute these complexes. As naturally emerging in the framework of reconstruction, we also study the Gromov--Hausdorff topological stability and finiteness problem for general compact for subspaces of curvature bounded above. Our techniques provide novel sampling conditions as an alternative to the existing and commonly used techniques using weak feature size and $\mu$--reach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that establishes homotopy-type reconstruction guarantees for spaces with vanishing reach and $\mu$--reach, a regime not covered by existing sampling conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given $f: M \to N$ a homotopy equivalence of compact manifolds with boundary, we use a construction of Geoghegan and Nicas to define its Reidemeister trace $[T] \in \pi_1^{st}(\mathcal{L} N, N)$. We realize the Goresky-Hingston coproduct as a map of spectra, and show that the failure of $f$ to entwine the spectral coproducts can be characterized by Chas-Sullivan multiplication with $[T]$. In particular, when $f$ is a simple homotopy equivalence, the spectral coproducts of $M$ and $N$ agree.</description>

Abstract: Fix primes $p$ and $\ell$, and let $C_p$ be the cyclic group of order $p$. We compute the $C_p$-equivariant spoke topological Hochschild homology of $\underline{\mathbb{F}}_{\ell}$ and prove it exhibits a form of B\"okstedt periodicity. Here spoke topological Hochschild homology is a variant of topological Hochschild homology where one replaces the circle in the construction with the unreduced suspension of $C_p$. As an application, we use this result to give a new proof of the Segal conjecture for the cyclic group of order an odd prime $p$.</description>

      <title>Homotopy type of spaces of locally convex curves in the sphere S^3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10928v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Locally convex (or nondegenerate) curves in the sphere $S^n$ have been studied for several reasons, including the study of linear ordinary differential equations of order $n+1$. Taking Frenet frames allows us to obtain corresponding curves $\Gamma$ in the group $Spin_{n+1}$. Let $L_n(z_0;z_1)$ be the space of such curves $\Gamma$ with prescribed endpoints $\Gamma(0) = z_0$, $\Gamma(1) = z_1$. The aim of this paper is to determine the homotopy type of the spaces $L_3(z_0;z_1)$ for all $z_0, z_1 \in Spin_4$. As a corollary, we obtain the homotopy type of the space of closed locally convex curves in either $S^3$ or $P^3$.
  There are many previous papers addressing related questions. An early paper solves the corresponding problem for curves in $S^2$. Another previous result (with B. Shapiro) reduces the problem to $z_0 = 1$ and $z_1 \in Quat_4$ where $Quat_4 \subset Spin_4$ is a finite group of order $16$. A more recent paper shows that for $z_1 \in Quat_4 \smallsetminus Z(Quat_4)$ we have a homotopy equivalence $L_3(1;z_1) \approx \Omega Spin_4$. In this paper we compute the homotopy type of $L_3(1;z_1)$ for $z_1 \in Z(Quat_4)$: it is equivalent to the wedge of $\Omega Spin_4$ with an infinite countable family of spheres (as for the case $n = 2$).
  The structure of the proof can be compared to that of the case $n = 2$ but some of the steps require the creation of new theories, involving algebra and combinatorics. We construct explicit subsets $Y \subset L_n(z_0;z_1)$ for which the inclusion $Y \subset \Omega Spin_{n+1}(z_0;z_1)$ is a homotopy equivalence. For $n = 2$, there is a simple geometric description of $Y$; for $n = 3$, the far less natural construction is based on the theory of itineraries of such curves. The itinerary of a curve in $L_n(1;z_1)$ is a finite word in the alphabet $S_{n+1} \smallsetminus \{e\}$ of nontrivial permutations.</description>

      <title>Relative tensor products and Koszul duality in monoidal oo-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11861v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This semi-expository work covers central aspects of the theory of relative tensor products as developed in Higher Algebra, as well as their application to Koszul duality for algebras in monoidal oo-categories. Part of our goal is to expand on the rather condensed account of loc. cit. Along the way, we generalize various aspects of the theory. For instance, given a monoidal oo-category Cc, an oo-category Mm which is left-tensored over Cc, and an algebra A in Cc, we construct an action of A-A-bimodules N in Cc on left A-modules M in Mm by an "external relative tensor product" N \otimes_A M. (Up until now, even the special ("internal") case Cc = Mm appears to have escaped the literature.
  As an application, we generalize the Koszul duality of loc. cit. to include modules. Our straightforward approach requires that we at this point assume certain compatibilities between tensor products and limits; these assumptions have recently been shown to be unnecessary in work by Brantner, Campos and Nuiten (arXiv:2104.03870).</description>

      <title>Local Topological Constraints on Berry Curvature in Spin--Orbit Coupled BECs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19282v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a local topological obstruction to the simultaneous flattening of Berry curvature in spin--orbit-coupled Bose--Einstein condensates (SOC BECs), which remains valid even when the global Chern number vanishes. For a generic two-component SOC BEC, the extended parameter space is the total space $M$ of a principal $U(1)_+ \times U(1)_-$ bundle over the Brillouin torus $T^{2}_{\mathrm{BZ}}$. On $M$, we construct a Kaluza--Klein metric and a natural metric connection $\nabla^{C}$ whose torsion 3-form encodes the synthetic gauge fields. Under the physically relevant assumption of constant Berry curvatures, the harmonic part of this torsion defines a mixed cohomology class $[\omega] \in \bigl(H^{2}(T^{2}_{\mathrm{BZ}}) \otimes H^{1}(S^{1}_{\phi_{+}})\bigr) \oplus \bigl(H^{2}(T^{2}_{\mathrm{BZ}}) \otimes H^{1}(S^{1}_{\phi_{-}})\bigr)$ with mixed tensor rank $r=1$. By extending the Pigazzini--Toda (PT) lower bound for metric connections to the Kaluza--Klein setting via a deformation--semicontinuity argument, we demonstrate that the obstruction kernel $\mathcal{K}$ vanishes for the physical metric, yielding the sharp inequality $dim \mathfrak{hol}^{\mathrm{off}}(\nabla^{C}) \geq 1$. This bound forces the existence of at least one off-diagonal curvature operator, preventing the complete gauging-away of Berry phases even in regimes with zero net topological charge. This work provides the first cohomological lower bound, based on the PT framework, certifying locally irremovable curvature in SOC BECs beyond the Chern-number paradigm.</description>
