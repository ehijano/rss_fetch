      <title>Eigenvalues of a coupled system of thermostat-type via a Birkhoff--Kellogg type Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, by means of Birkhoff--Kellogg type Theorem in cones we address the existence of eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors to a family of coupled system of thermostat type. The system is characterized by the presence of a real parameter that influences not only the differential equations but also the boundary conditions. Motivated by models of temperature regulation and feedback-controlled systems, we reformulate the original boundary value problems into systems of Hammerstein integral equations. The theoretical results are applied to three different classes of boundary conditions in $t=0$, which are supported by examples.</description>

      <title>From tug-of-war to Brownian Boost: explicit ODE solutions for player-funded stochastic-differential games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brownian Boost is a one-parameter family of stochastic differential games played on the real line in which players spend at rates of their choosing in an ongoing effort to influence the drift of a randomly diffusing point particle~$X$. One or other player is rewarded, at time infinity, according to whether~$X$ tends to plus or minus infinity. Each player's net receipt is the final reward (only for the victor) minus the player's total spend. We characterise and explicitly compute the time-homogeneous Markov-perfect Nash equilibria of Brownian Boost, finding the derivatives of the players' expected payoffs to solve a pair of coupled first-order non-linear ODE. Brownian Boost is a high-noise limit of a two-dimensional family of player-funded tug-of-war games, one of which was studied in~\cite{LostPennies}. We analyse the discrete games, finding them, and Brownian Boost, to exemplify key features studied in the economics literature of tug-of-war initiated by~\cite{HarrisVickers87}: a battlefield region where players spend heavily;
  stakes that decay rapidly but asymmetrically in distance to the battlefield; and an effect of discouragement that makes equilibria fragile under asymmetric perturbation of incentive.
  Tug-of-war has a parallel mathematical literature derived from~\cite{PSSW09}, which solved the scaled fair-coin game in a Euclidean domain via the infinity Laplacian PDE. By offering an analytic solution to Brownian Boost, a game that models strategic interaction and resource allocation, we seek to build a bridge between the two tug-of-war literatures.</description>

      <title>Existence and explicit form of nonlinear Hermite--Chebyshev approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, sufficient conditions for the existence of trigonometric Hermite--Jacobi appro\-ximations of a system of functions that are sums of convergent Fourier series are found. Based on these results, sufficient conditions are established under which nonlinear Hermite--Chebyshev approximations of systems of functions representable by Fourier series in Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kind exist. When the found conditions are met, explicit formulas are obtained for the numerators and denominators of trigonometric Hermite--Jacobi approximations and nonlinear Hermite--Chebyshev approximations of the first and second kind of the specified systems of functions.</description>

      <title>A two-parameter deformation of the gamma function, associated functions, and some related inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new two-parameter deformation of the Gamma function that generalizes some existing Gamma-type functions in the literature. We study properties of this function that depend on the parameters. We also prove some inequalities for the corresponding beta function and polygamma functions.</description>

      <title>Deformation of moduli spaces of meromorphic $G$-connections on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ via unfolding of irregular singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20486v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unfolding singular points in linear differential equations is a classical technique for studying the properties of irregular singularities by relating them to regular singularities. In this paper, we propose a general framework for unfolding unramified irregular singularities of meromorphic connections on the trivial principal $G$-bundle over $\mathbb{P}^{1}$.
  One of our main results is the description of the unfolding of singularities in terms of deformations of their moduli spaces. We show that every moduli space of irreducible meromorphic $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ can be deformed into a moduli space of irreducible Fuchsian $G$-connections on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$.
  Furthermore, we study the unfolding of additive Deligne-Simpson problems, in which the unfolding of irregular singularities naturally generates a family of such problems. As an application of our main result, we prove that a Deligne-Simpson problem for $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities admits a solution if and only if every unfolded Deligne-Simpson problem in the family admits a simultaneous solution.
  We also provide a combinatorial and diagrammatic framework of the unfolding process in terms of spectral types and unfolding diagrams. Finally, we address a conjecture proposed by Oshima concerning the existence of irreducible $G$-connections that realize prescribed spectral types and their unfoldings. Our main result gives an affirmative answer to this conjecture.</description>
