      <title>Particle Thermal Inertia Delays the Onset of Convection in Particulate Rayleigh-B\'enard System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the linear stability of a thermally stratified fluid layer confined between horizontal walls and subject to continuous injection of dilute thermal particles at one boundary and extraction at the opposite, forming a particulate Rayleigh-B\'enard (pRB) system. The analysis focuses on the influence of thermal coupling between the dispersed and carrier phases, quantified by the specific heat capacity ratio $\epsilon$. Increasing $\epsilon$ systematically enhances stability, with this effect persisting across a wide range of conditions, including heavy and light particles, variations in volumetric flux, injection velocity and direction, and injection temperature. The stabilizing influence saturates when the volumetric heat capacity of the particles approaches that of the fluid, $\epsilon = O(1)$. The physical mechanism is attributed to a modification of the base-state temperature profile caused by interphase heat exchange, which reduces thermal gradients near the injection wall and weakens buoyancy-driven motion.</description>

      <title>Geometric Solution of Turbulence as Diffusion in Loop Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly nonlinear dynamics, from fluid turbulence to quantum chromodynamics, have long constituted some of the most challenging problems in theoretical physics. This review describes a unified theoretical framework, the loop space calculus, which offers an analytical approach to these problems. The central idea is a shift in perspective from pointwise fields to integrated loop observables, a transformation that recasts the governing nonlinear equations into a universal linear diffusion equation in the space of loops. This framework, supported by recent mathematical analysis, is analytically solvable and yields an exact, parameter-free solution for decaying hydrodynamic turbulence--the Euler ensemble--which is shown to be dual to a solvable string theory. The theory's predictions include: (i) the unification of spatial and temporal scaling laws, which are shown to be governed by two related, infinite spectra of intermittency and decay exponents, respectively, both derived from the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function; (ii) a first-order phase transition in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence; and (iii) the formation of quantized, concentric shells in passive scalar mixing. The theory also predicts log-periodic oscillations in correlation functions, effects not described by standard phenomenology, for which there is now emerging evidence from high-precision turbulence experiments. The appearance of identical mathematical structures as solutions to the turbulent regime of Yang-Mills gradient flow points towards the broad applicability of this approach. The framework also yields a new type of minimal surface that solves the QCD loop equations in the limit of large loops.</description>

      <title>Role of varying Reynolds number for flow past a rotating cylinder at high rotation rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study reports comprehensive bifurcation analysis of flow past a rotating cylinder at a fixed rotation rate by varying free-stream Reynolds number ($Re_{\infty}$) from 1000-6000 in intervals of 50. Two-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved using dispersion relation preserving numerical methods over 101 test cases, amounting to $10^6$ core hours of computing. The dataset produced from high-fidelity simulations serve as useful benchmarking tools for testing compressible flow solvers, estimating unsteady force distribution and vorticity dynamics. For moderate $Re_{\infty}$, rotation induces circulation that reduces pressure drag with increasing $Re_{\infty}$. For higher $Re_{\infty}$, boundary layer becomes thinner with suppressed flow separation, but effect of rotation saturates. Thus, benefits of increasing $Re_{\infty}$ taper off and pressure recovery stalls. The bifurcation analysis reveals a critical $Re_{\infty}$ of 5650 beyond which global behavior of Magnus-Robins effect changes significantly. Supercritical flow is receptive to time-dependent instabilities and structures in wake of the cylinder become dynamically unstable. Even small changes in $Re_{\infty}$ leads to different instantaneous force distributions and sharp fluctuations in lift and drag calculations. Stronger, coherent vortices in the wake generate consistent, high-energy periodic signals, contributing to strong Fourier amplitudes in spectra. An artificial neural network (ANN) is trained using simulation datasets to serve as fast, inexpensive alternatives for calculating lift, drag, and onset time of instability. The ANN reduces time required for simulation by 99.9\%, enabling dense parametric sweeps. Maximum accuracy achieved for the ANN is between 90-99\% for the parameters examined.</description>

      <title>A Unified Spectrum for Turbulence in Microfluidic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a predictive master spectrum describing turbulence-like flows in microfluidic systems. Extending Pao's viscous-range closure, the model introduces (i) an adaptive inertial-range slope dependent on measurable dimensionless numbers and (ii) a physics-specific cutoff that captures entropy-producing sinks such as electrokinetic forcing, compliant walls, active stresses, and interfacial tension. This formulation unifies turbulence regimes -- electrokinetic, active, interfacial, and compressible -- within one compact expression. Comparison with reported data reproduces both spectral slopes and dissipation cutoffs while requiring only global observables (velocity, viscosity, Taylor microscale, and forcing strength). The framework provides a design-level predictive tool for turbulent microflows prior to computationally heavy DNS or CFD.</description>

      <title>Simulation of a Non-Newtonian drop impact on a rigid surface: A mess-free approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study explores the impact of a non-Newtonian fluid drop on a rigid surface using a mesh-free approach, Smoothed Particle Hydrodynam-ics. The complex interaction between viscous and elastic forces during drop impact may be reproduced by integrating the Oldroyd-B model, which de-scribes viscoelastic fluids, into the developed computational framework. A suit-able boundary condition is assumed for interaction between fluid and solid sur-faces. The ongoing study examines how a droplet deforms, spreads, and recoils after an impact due to its viscoelasticity. The developed computational frame-work is validated by comparing results from existing literature, providing an understanding of how viscoelasticity influences drop-impact behaviour and opening up new avenues for subsequent research in fluid dynamic problems.</description>

      <title>Generalizable super-resolution turbulence reconstruction from minimal training data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully resolving turbulent flows remains challenging due to turbulent systems' multiscale complexity. Existing data-driven approaches typically demand expensive retraining for each flow scenario and struggle to generalize beyond their training conditions. Leveraging the universality of small-scale turbulent motions (Kolmogorov's K41 theory), we propose a Scale-oriented Zonal Generative Adversarial Network (SoZoGAN) framework for high-fidelity, zero-shot turbulence generation across diverse domains. Unlike conventional methods, SoZoGAN is trained exclusively on a single dataset of moderate-Reynolds-number homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT). The framework employs a zonal decomposition strategy, partitioning turbulent snapshots into subdomains based on scale-sensitive physical quantities. Within each subdomain, turbulence is synthesized using scale-indexed models pre-trained solely on the HIT database. SoZoGAN demonstrates high accuracy, cross-domain generalizability, and robustness in zero-shot super-resolution of unsteady flows, as validated on untrained HIT, turbulent boundary layer, and channel flow. Its strong generalization, demonstrated for homogenous and inhomogenous turbulence cases, suggests potential applicability to a wider range of industrial and natural turbulent flows. The scale-oriented zonal framework is architecture-agnostic, readily extending beyond GANs to other deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on the objectivity and thermodynamic consistency of Korteweg-type fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we compare the entropy principle and the objectivity arguments in the methodologies of Dunn and Serrin [1] and in the more recent weakly nonlocal thermodynamic analysis of Korteweg-type fluids in [2]. It is concluded that the different objectivity approaches lead to the same constitutive functions, and that the difference in the thermodynamically compatible pressure tensors of perfect Korteweg fluids is due to different symmetry requirements.</description>

      <title>Unified Model of Heated Plasma Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the need to predict plasma density and temperature distributions created in the early stages of high-intensity laser-plasma interactions, we develop a fluid model of plasma expansion into vacuum that incorporates external heating. We propose a new three-parameter family of self-similar solutions for plasma expansion that models a wide range of spatiotemporal variations of the electron temperature. Depending on the relative scales of the heated plasma domain $L$, the Debye length $\lambda_D$ and an emergent ion-acoustic correlation length $\lambda_s$, characterized by the parameters $\lambda_s/\lambda_D$ and $L/\lambda_s$, a spectrum of dynamical behaviors for the expanding plasma are identified. The behavior is classified into five dynamical regimes, ranging from nearly quasineutral expansion to the formation of bare ion slabs susceptible to Coulomb explosion. The limiting self-similar solutions are analyzed, and the dynamics in the five asymptotic limits in the parameter space are detailed. Scaling relations for the length scales and energies of the expanding plasma are proposed. The self-similar framework is applied to laser-plasma interactions, specifically addressing the plasma dynamics at a target surface during prepulse-target interactions. The results offer insights into the expansion behavior based on the laser-plasma parameters, and scaling relations for optimizing laser-plasma schemes and guiding experimental designs in high-intensity laser experiments.</description>

      <title>Nanofluidic logic based on chiral skyrmion flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle-like chiral magnetic skyrmions can flow in nanotracks and behave like chiral fluids. Using interacting flows to perform logical operations is an important topic in microfluidics and nanofluidics. Here, we report a basic nanofluidic logic computing system based on chiral magnetic skyrmions flowing in parallel pipelines connected by an H-shaped junction. The flow behaviors could be manipulated by adjusting the spin polarization angle, which controls the intrinsic skyrmion Hall angle. We demonstrate that within certain range of the spin polarization angle, fully developed skyrmion flows could lead to fluidic logical operations, which significantly reduce the complexity of skyrmion logic as there is no need for deterministic creation, precise control, and detection of a single isolated skyrmion. Our results suggest that the chiral flow behaviors of magnetic quasiparticles may offer possibilities for spintronic and nanofluidic functions.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Fidelity Global Search Framework for Hotspot Prevention in 3D Thermal Design Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a B\'ezier-based Multi-Fidelity Thermal Optimization Framework, which is a computationally efficient methodology for the global optimization of 3D heat sinks. The flexible B\'ezier-parameterized fin geometries and the adopted multi-fidelity pseudo-3D thermal modeling strategy meet at a balance between accuracy and computational cost. In this method, the smooth and compact B\'ezier representation of fins defines the design space from which diverse topologies can be generated with minimal design variables. A global optimizer, the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy, minimizes the pressure drop with respect to a given surface-average temperature constraint to achieve improvement in the pressure loss. In the framework, the pseudo-3D model couples two thermally interacting 2D layers: a thermofluid layer representing the fluid domain passing through the fins, and a conductive base plate representing the surface where excessive average temperature is to be avoided. Both layers are coupled with calibrated heat transfer coefficients obtained from high-fidelity 3D simulations. For several fin geometries, the proposed framework has been validated by comparing the pseudo-3D results with those of full 3D simulations, which yielded good agreement in terms of temperature distribution and pressure drops when the computational cost was reduced by several orders of magnitude. Optimization results show that it attains up to 50\% pressure loss reduction compared to conventional straight-fin configurations, and it reveals a clear trade-off between thermal performance and hydraulic efficiency. Thus, the proposed method forms a new basis for fast, geometry-flexible, and optimized heat sink design, enabling efficient exploration of complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Vorticity-induced surfing and trapping in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microorganisms often encounter strong confinement and complex hydrodynamic flows while navigating their habitats. Combining finite-element methods and stochastic simulations, we study the interplay of active transport and heterogeneous flows in dense porous channels. We find that swimming always slows down the traversal of agents across the channel, giving rise to robust power-law tails of their exit-time distributions. These exit-time distributions collapse onto a universal master curve with a scaling exponent of $\approx 3/2$ across a wide range of packing fractions and motility parameters, which can be rationalized by a scaling relation. We further identify a new motility pattern where agents alternate between surfing along fast streams and extended trapping phases, the latter determining the power-law exponent. Unexpectedly, trapping occurs in the flow backbone itself -- not only at obstacle boundaries -- due to vorticity-induced reorientation in the highly-heterogeneous fluid environment. These findings provide a fundamentally new active transport mechanism with direct implications for biofilm clogging and the design of novel microrobots capable of operating in heterogeneous media.</description>

      <title>Polarization-controlled pattern formation in antiparallel dipolar binary condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate non-equilibrium pattern formation in an antiparallel two-component dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate by varying the polarization angle and the trap aspect ratio. At finite tilt, the condensate supports stripe order. Quenching the angle to zero triggers a roton-assisted, mushroom-like corrugation that destroys translational order and drives the system into labyrinthine textures, whereas a slow linear ramp produces long-lived curved stripes that ultimately converge to labyrinths. Population imbalance strongly biases the evolution: the minority component preferentially fragments into a stable droplet array while the majority remains comparatively diffuse; once formed, the droplet crystal is robust under polarization hysteresis with largely reversible shape changes and unchanged lattice topology. The trap aspect ratio controls both the initial stripe number and the instability timescale, with tighter axial confinement accelerating corrugation and yielding denser labyrinths at late times. All behaviors arise within a quasi-two-dimensional mean-field regime where beyond-mean-field corrections are negligible; accordingly, the droplets reported here are not self-bound in free space. The observed textures (such as stripes, curved stripes, and labyrinths) mirror the taxonomy and instability pathways of nuclear "pasta" morphologies (rods and slabs) known from neutron-star and supernova matter, highlighting polarization angle, trap geometry, and population imbalance as practical, experimentally accessible controls for selecting and steering patterns in dipolar mixtures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20021v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the 3D stationary flow of a weakly conducting fluid in a cubic cavity, driven by the Lorentz force created by two permanent magnets and a weak constant current. Our goal is to determine the conditions leading to efficient mixing within the cavity. The flow is composed of a large recirculation cell created by one side magnet, superposed to two recirculation cells created by a central magnet perpendicular to the first one. The overall structure of this flow, obtained here by solving the Stokes equations with Lorentz forcing, is similar to the tri-cellular model flow studied by Toussaint et. al. (Phys. Fluids. 7, 1995). Chaotic advection in this flow is analyzed by means of Poincar\'e sections, Lyapunov exponents and expansion entropies. In addition, we quantify the quality of mixing by computing contamination rates, homogeneity, as well as mixing times. Though individual vortices have poor mixing properties, the superposition of both flows creates chaotic streamlines and efficient mixing.</description>

      <title>Near Real-time Adaptive Isotropic and Anisotropic Image-to-mesh Conversion for Numerical Simulations Involving Cerebral Aneurysms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Presented are two techniques that are designed to help streamline the discretization of complex vascular geometries within the numerical modeling process. The first method integrates multiple software tools into a single pipeline which can generate adaptive anisotropic meshes from segmented medical images. The pipeline is shown to satisfy quality, fidelity, smoothness, and robustness requirements while providing near real-time performance for medical image-to-mesh conversion. The second method approximates a user-defined sizing function to generate adaptive isotropic meshes of good quality and fidelity in real-time. Tested with two brain aneurysm cases and utilizing up to 96 CPU cores within a single, multicore node on Purdue University's Anvil supercomputer, the parallel adaptive anisotropic meshing method utilizes a hierarchical load balancing model (designed for large, cc-NUMA shared memory architectures) and contains an optimized local reconnection operation that performs three times faster than its original implementation from previous studies. The adaptive isotropic method is shown to generate a mesh of up to approximately 50 million elements in less than a minute while the adaptive anisotropic method is shown to generate approximately the same number of elements in about 5 minutes.</description>

      <title>Turbulence and large-scale structures in self-gravitating superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study turbulence in self-gravitating superfluids by performing direct numerical simulations of the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson (GPP) equation, which is also a model for dark matter haloes around galaxies. In the absence of self-gravity, the spectrally truncated Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation shows the emergence of Kolmogorov's $5/3$ scaling in the incompressible kinetic energy spectrum. Introducing self-gravity, we observe the formation of different structures, from sheet-like to spherically collapsed structures, which introduce a minimum in the kinetic energy spectrum that corresponds to the sizes of these structures. The system shows early convergence towards statistically stationary states, which we show by the onset of thermalisation in the compressible kinetic energy spectrum, where $E_{\rm kin}^c \propto k^2$. We also show that the formation of such large-scale structures suggests that the particles (bosons) move from small to large scales through an inverse cascade, supporting a mechanism for the formation of large-scale structures, such as dark matter haloes, around our galaxy Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Circulation Control Jet Bi-Stability on a Wing Section at Transonic Speeds via Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00150v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phenomenon of stable lift oscillations occurring on an elliptic wing section utilizing circulation control at transonic speeds was evaluated using numerical simulations. As the momentum of the jet increases beyond a prescribed magnitude, periodic detachment occurs from the trailing-edge. This behavior conforms to a bi-stable state, consistent with prior experimental observations. Analysis by both steady and unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes calculations showed that the effect is decoupled from the dominant upstream shockwave. This indicates that the jet can no longer augment the wing's circulation, marking the termination of circulation control. Furthermore, the results confirm that the absence of the downstream separation bubble acts as the catalyst for this detachment. Dynamic Mode Decomposition analysis revealed that the bi-stability is driven by a pressure feedback between the trailing-edge shockwave and a downstream pressure bubble. A secondary feedback governs the pressure redistribution during the detachment cycle. It was concluded that the pressure-dominant nature of the bi-stability allows it to be captured using relatively simple methods such as URANS, and even approximated through a Reduced Order Model comprising only 2% of the total modes, encapsulating 25% of the modal influence and reconstructing the pressure field with 98% accuracy.</description>

      <title>The U2H map explains the effect of (sub)mesoscale currents on significant wave height statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21736v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Currents modulate the energy of surface gravity waves, leading to spatial inhomogeneities in significant wave height (SWH). Previous work indicates that the overall scale of the inhomogeneities is set by the scale of the currents, that the inhomogeneities are strongly anisotropic even for isotropic currents, and that the rotational and divergent components of the currents have sharply distinct effects. We explain these and other features of current-induced SWH inhomogeneities using the U2H map, a linear relation between SWH and currents deduced from wave-action conservation by making simplifying assumptions. We obtain a linear law relating the spectrum of SWH to the spectra of rotational and divergent kinetic energy of the current. This makes it possible to relate SWH statistics (such as variance and anisotropy) to the current statistics and wave properties including directional spreading.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Slip Boundary Condition: Surface Roughness as a Hidden Tuning Parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effect of boundary surface roughness on numerical simulations of incompressible fluid flow past a cylinder in two and three spatial dimensions furnished with slip boundary conditions. The governing equations are approximated using a continuous finite element method, stabilized with a Galerkin least-squares approach.
  Through a series of numerical experiments, we demonstrate that: $(i)$ the introduction of surface roughness through numerical discretization error, or mesh distortion, makes the potential flow solution unstable; $(ii)$ when numerical surface roughness and mesh distortion are minimized by using high-order isoparametric geometry mappings, a stable potential flow is obtained in both two and three dimensions; $(iii)$ numerical surface roughness, mesh distortion and refinement level can be used as control parameters to manipulate drag and lift forces resulting in numerical values spanning more than an order of magnitude.
  Our results cast some doubt on the predictive capability of the slip boundary condition for wall modeling in turbulent simulations of incompressible flow.</description>

      <title>Scaling in two-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An equation for the evolution of mean kinetic energy, $ E $, in a 2-D or 3-D Rayleigh-B\'enard system with domain height $ L $ is derived. Assuming classical Nusselt number scaling, $ Nu \sim Ra^{1/3} $, and that mean enstrophy, in the absence of a downscale energy cascade, scales as $\sim E/L^2 $, we find that the Reynolds number scales as $ Re \sim Pr^{-1}Ra^{2/3} $ in the 2-D system, where $ Ra $ is the Rayleigh number and $ Pr $ the Prandtl number, which is a much stronger scaling than in the 3-D system. Using the evolution equation and the Reynolds number scaling, it is shown that $ \tilde{\tau} &gt; c Pr^{-1/2}Ra^{1/2} $, where $ \tilde{\tau} $ is the non-dimensional convergence time scale and $ c $ is a non-dimensional constant. For the 3-D system, we make the estimate $ \tilde{\tau} \gtrsim Ra^{1/6} $ for $ Pr = 1 $. It is estimated that the total computational cost of reaching the high $ Ra $ limit in a simulation is comparable between 2-D and 3-D. The results of the analysis are compared to DNS data and it is concluded that the theory of the `ultimate state' is not valid in 2-D. Despite the big difference between the 2-D and 3-D systems in the scaling of $ Re $ and $ \tilde{\tau} $, the Nusselt number scaling is similar. This observation supports the hypothesis of Malkus (1954) that the heat transfer is not regulated by the dynamics in the interior of the convection cell, but by the dynamics in the boundary layers.</description>

      <title>Real-time identification of parametric sloshing-induced heat and mass transfer in a horizontally oriented cylindrical tank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vertical forcing of partially filled tanks can induce parametric sloshing. Under non-isothermal conditions, the resulting mixing can disrupt the thermal stratification between liquid and vapor, leading to enhanced heat and mass transfer and large pressure fluctuations. This work presents an experimental investigation of sloshing-induced heat and mass transfer in a horizontally oriented cylindrical tank under vertical harmonic excitation. This configuration is particularly relevant for cryogenic fuel storage in aircraft and ground transportation, yet its thermodynamic response under parametric sloshing remains largely uncharacterized. The present study provides the first experimental characterization of the sloshing-induced pressure drop and associated heat and mass transfer in this geometry. Decoupled isothermal and non-isothermal experimental campaigns are carried out across multiple fill levels and forcing amplitudes, near resonance of the first longitudinal symmetric mode $(2,0)$, using a hydrofluoroether fluid (3M Novec HFE-7000). To quantify heat and mass transfer, a lumped thermodynamic model is combined with an Augmented-state Extended Kalman Filter (AEKF), enabling real-time, time-resolved inference of Nusselt numbers. A critical forcing threshold is identified: below it, the fluid remains quiescent and thermally stratified; above it, parametric resonance drives strong sloshing, complete thermal destratification, and a rapid pressure drop. At 50% fill, the dominant $(2,0)$ response intermittently alternates with a planar $(1,0)$ mode, indicating subharmonic mode interaction. The inferred Nusselt numbers increase by several orders of magnitude after destratification, and pressure-rate analysis confirms that condensation governs the pressure evolution.</description>
