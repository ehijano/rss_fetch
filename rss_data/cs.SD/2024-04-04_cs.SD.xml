      <title>Analyzing Musical Characteristics of National Anthems in Relation to Global Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music plays a huge part in shaping peoples' psychology and behavioral patterns. This paper investigates the connection between national anthems and different global indices with computational music analysis and statistical correlation analysis. We analyze national anthem musical data to determine whether certain musical characteristics are associated with peace, happiness, suicide rate, crime rate, etc. To achieve this, we collect national anthems from 169 countries and use computational music analysis techniques to extract pitch, tempo, beat, and other pertinent audio features. We then compare these musical characteristics with data on different global indices to ascertain whether a significant correlation exists. Our findings indicate that there may be a correlation between the musical characteristics of national anthems and the indices we investigated. The implications of our findings for music psychology and policymakers interested in promoting social well-being are discussed. This paper emphasizes the potential of musical data analysis in social research and offers a novel perspective on the relationship between music and social indices. The source code and data are made open-access for reproducibility and future research endeavors. It can be accessed at http://bit.ly/na_code.</description>

      <title>Mai Ho'om\=auna i ka 'Ai: Language Models Improve Automatic Speech Recognition in Hawaiian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we address the challenge of improving Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for a low-resource language, Hawaiian, by incorporating large amounts of independent text data into an ASR foundation model, Whisper. To do this, we train an external language model (LM) on ~1.5M words of Hawaiian text. We then use the LM to rescore Whisper and compute word error rates (WERs) on a manually curated test set of labeled Hawaiian data. As a baseline, we use Whisper without an external LM. Experimental results reveal a small but significant improvement in WER when ASR outputs are rescored with a Hawaiian LM. The results support leveraging all available data in the development of ASR systems for underrepresented languages.</description>

      <title>UniAV: Unified Audio-Visual Perception for Multi-Task Video Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video localization tasks aim to temporally locate specific instances in videos, including temporal action localization (TAL), sound event detection (SED) and audio-visual event localization (AVEL). Existing methods over-specialize on each task, overlooking the fact that these instances often occur in the same video to form the complete video content. In this work, we present UniAV, a Unified Audio-Visual perception network, to achieve joint learning of TAL, SED and AVEL tasks for the first time. UniAV can leverage diverse data available in task-specific datasets, allowing the model to learn and share mutually beneficial knowledge across tasks and modalities. To tackle the challenges posed by substantial variations in datasets (size/domain/duration) and distinct task characteristics, we propose to uniformly encode visual and audio modalities of all videos to derive generic representations, while also designing task-specific experts to capture unique knowledge for each task. Besides, we develop a unified language-aware classifier by utilizing a pre-trained text encoder, enabling the model to flexibly detect various types of instances and previously unseen ones by simply changing prompts during inference. UniAV outperforms its single-task counterparts by a large margin with fewer parameters, achieving on-par or superior performances compared to state-of-the-art task-specific methods across ActivityNet 1.3, DESED and UnAV-100 benchmarks.</description>

      <title>RALL-E: Robust Codec Language Modeling with Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Text-to-Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present RALL-E, a robust language modeling method for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. While previous work based on large language models (LLMs) shows impressive performance on zero-shot TTS, such methods often suffer from poor robustness, such as unstable prosody (weird pitch and rhythm/duration) and a high word error rate (WER), due to the autoregressive prediction style of language models. The core idea behind RALL-E is chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which decomposes the task into simpler steps to enhance the robustness of LLM-based TTS. To accomplish this idea, RALL-E first predicts prosody features (pitch and duration) of the input text and uses them as intermediate conditions to predict speech tokens in a CoT style. Second, RALL-E utilizes the predicted duration prompt to guide the computing of self-attention weights in Transformer to enforce the model to focus on the corresponding phonemes and prosody features when predicting speech tokens. Results of comprehensive objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that, compared to a powerful baseline method VALL-E, RALL-E significantly improves the WER of zero-shot TTS from $6.3\%$ (without reranking) and $2.1\%$ (with reranking) to $2.8\%$ and $1.0\%$, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RALL-E correctly synthesizes sentences that are hard for VALL-E and reduces the error rate from $68\%$ to $4\%$.</description>

      <title>M3TCM: Multi-modal Multi-task Context Model for Utterance Classification in Motivational Interviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate utterance classification in motivational interviews is crucial to automatically understand the quality and dynamics of client-therapist interaction, and it can serve as a key input for systems mediating such interactions. Motivational interviews exhibit three important characteristics. First, there are two distinct roles, namely client and therapist. Second, they are often highly emotionally charged, which can be expressed both in text and in prosody. Finally, context is of central importance to classify any given utterance. Previous works did not adequately incorporate all of these characteristics into utterance classification approaches for mental health dialogues. In contrast, we present M3TCM, a Multi-modal, Multi-task Context Model for utterance classification. Our approach for the first time employs multi-task learning to effectively model both joint and individual components of therapist and client behaviour. Furthermore, M3TCM integrates information from the text and speech modality as well as the conversation context. With our novel approach, we outperform the state of the art for utterance classification on the recently introduced AnnoMI dataset with a relative improvement of 20% for the client- and by 15% for therapist utterance classification. In extensive ablation studies, we quantify the improvement resulting from each contribution.</description>

      <title>Interpreting End-to-End Deep Learning Models for Speech Source Localization Using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models are widely applied in the signal processing community, yet their inner working procedure is often treated as a black box. In this paper, we investigate the use of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to learning-based end-to-end speech source localization models. We consider the Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) technique, which aims to determine which parts of the input are more important for the output prediction. Using LRP we analyze two state-of-the-art models, of differing architectural complexity that map audio signals acquired by the microphones to the cartesian coordinates of the source. Specifically, we inspect the relevance associated with the input features of the two models and discover that both networks denoise and de-reverberate the microphone signals to compute more accurate statistical correlations between them and consequently localize the sources. To further demonstrate this fact, we estimate the Time-Difference of Arrivals (TDoAs) via the Generalized Cross Correlation with Phase Transform (GCC-PHAT) using both microphone signals and relevance signals extracted from the two networks and show that through the latter we obtain more accurate time-delay estimation results.</description>

      <title>Correlation and Spectral Density Functions in Mode-Stirred Reverberation -- II. Spectral Moments, Sampling, Noise, EMI and Understirring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In part I, spectral moments and kurtosis were established as parameters in analytic models of correlation and spectral density functions for dynamic reverberation fields. In this part II, several practical limitations affecting the accuracy of estimating these parameters from measured stir sweep data are investigated. For sampled fields, the contributions of finite differencing and aliasing are evaluated. Finite differencing results in a negative bias that depends, to leading order, quadratically on the product of the sampling time interval and the stir bandwidth. Numerical estimates of moments extracted directly from sampled stir sweeps show good agreement with values obtained by an autocovariance method. The effects of data decimation and noise-to-stir ratios of RMS amplitudes are determined and experimentally verified. In addition, the dependencies on the noise-to-stir-bandwidth ratio, EMI, and unstirred energy are characterized.</description>

      <title>SceneFake: An Initial Dataset and Benchmarks for Scene Fake Audio Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many datasets have been designed to further the development of fake audio detection. However, fake utterances in previous datasets are mostly generated by altering timbre, prosody, linguistic content or channel noise of original audio. These datasets leave out a scenario, in which the acoustic scene of an original audio is manipulated with a forged one. It will pose a major threat to our society if some people misuse the manipulated audio with malicious purpose. Therefore, this motivates us to fill in the gap. This paper proposes such a dataset for scene fake audio detection named SceneFake, where a manipulated audio is generated by only tampering with the acoustic scene of an real utterance by using speech enhancement technologies. Some scene fake audio detection benchmark results on the SceneFake dataset are reported in this paper. In addition, an analysis of fake attacks with different speech enhancement technologies and signal-to-noise ratios are presented in this paper. The results indicate that scene fake utterances cannot be reliably detected by baseline models trained on the ASVspoof 2019 dataset. Although these models perform well on the SceneFake training set and seen testing set, their performance is poor on the unseen test set. The dataset (https://zenodo.org/record/7663324#.Y_XKMuPYuUk) and benchmark source codes (https://github.com/ADDchallenge/SceneFake) are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Profile-Error-Tolerant Target-Speaker Voice Activity Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Target-Speaker Voice Activity Detection (TS-VAD) utilizes a set of speaker profiles alongside an input audio signal to perform speaker diarization. While its superiority over conventional methods has been demonstrated, the method can suffer from errors in speaker profiles, as those profiles are typically obtained by running a traditional clustering-based diarization method over the input signal. This paper proposes an extension to TS-VAD, called Profile-Error-Tolerant TS-VAD (PET-TSVAD), which is robust to such speaker profile errors. This is achieved by employing transformer-based TS-VAD that can handle a variable number of speakers and further introducing a set of additional pseudo-speaker profiles to handle speakers undetected during the first pass diarization. During training, we use speaker profiles estimated by multiple different clustering algorithms to reduce the mismatch between the training and testing conditions regarding speaker profiles. Experimental results show that PET-TSVAD consistently outperforms the existing TS-VAD method on both the VoxConverse and DIHARD-I datasets.</description>

      <title>Measuring audio prompt adherence with distribution-based embedding distances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An increasing number of generative music models can be conditioned on an audio prompt that serves as musical context for which the model is to create an accompaniment (often further specified using a text prompt). Evaluation of how well model outputs adhere to the audio prompt is often done in a model or problem specific manner, presumably because no generic evaluation method for audio prompt adherence has emerged. Such a method could be useful both in the development and training of new models, and to make performance comparable across models. In this paper we investigate whether commonly used distribution-based distances like Fr\'echet Audio Distance (FAD), can be used to measure audio prompt adherence. We propose a simple procedure based on a small number of constituents (an embedding model, a projection, an embedding distance, and a data fusion method), that we systematically assess using a baseline validation. In a follow-up experiment we test the sensitivity of the proposed audio adherence measure to pitch and time shift perturbations. The results show that the proposed measure is sensitive to such perturbations, even when the reference and candidate distributions are from different music collections. Although more experimentation is needed to answer unaddressed questions like the robustness of the measure to acoustic artifacts that do not affect the audio prompt adherence, the current results suggest that distribution-based embedding distances provide a viable way of measuring audio prompt adherence. An python/pytorch implementation of the proposed measure is publicly available as a github repository.</description>

      <title>As Good As A Coin Toss: Human detection of AI-generated images, videos, audio, and audiovisual stimuli</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16760v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As synthetic media becomes progressively more realistic and barriers to using it continue to lower, the technology has been increasingly utilized for malicious purposes, from financial fraud to nonconsensual pornography. Today, the principal defense against being misled by synthetic media relies on the ability of the human observer to visually and auditorily discern between real and fake. However, it remains unclear just how vulnerable people actually are to deceptive synthetic media in the course of their day to day lives. We conducted a perceptual study with 1276 participants to assess how accurate people were at distinguishing synthetic images, audio only, video only, and audiovisual stimuli from authentic. To reflect the circumstances under which people would likely encounter synthetic media in the wild, testing conditions and stimuli emulated a typical online platform, while all synthetic media used in the survey was sourced from publicly accessible generative AI technology.
  We find that overall, participants struggled to meaningfully discern between synthetic and authentic content. We also find that detection performance worsens when the stimuli contains synthetic content as compared to authentic content, images featuring human faces as compared to non face objects, a single modality as compared to multimodal stimuli, mixed authenticity as compared to being fully synthetic for audiovisual stimuli, and features foreign languages as compared to languages the observer is fluent in. Finally, we also find that prior knowledge of synthetic media does not meaningfully impact their detection performance. Collectively, these results indicate that people are highly susceptible to being tricked by synthetic media in their daily lives and that human perceptual detection capabilities can no longer be relied upon as an effective counterdefense.</description>

      <title>Transforming LLMs into Cross-modal and Cross-lingual Retrieval Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on text-only data that go far beyond the languages with paired speech and text data. At the same time, Dual Encoder (DE) based retrieval systems project queries and documents into the same embedding space and have demonstrated their success in retrieval and bi-text mining. To match speech and text in many languages, we propose using LLMs to initialize multi-modal DE retrieval systems. Unlike traditional methods, our system doesn't require speech data during LLM pre-training and can exploit LLM's multilingual text understanding capabilities to match speech and text in languages unseen during retrieval training. Our multi-modal LLM-based retrieval system is capable of matching speech and text in 102 languages despite only training on 21 languages. Our system outperforms previous systems trained explicitly on all 102 languages. We achieve a 10% absolute improvement in Recall@1 averaged across these languages. Additionally, our model demonstrates cross-lingual speech and text matching, which is further enhanced by readily available machine translation data.</description>
