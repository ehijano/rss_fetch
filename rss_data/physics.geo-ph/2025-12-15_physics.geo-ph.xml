      <title>Predominant-Mode Inversion of Surface Waves: Inherently Addressing Inconspicuous Low Frequency Mode Jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inversion of Rayleigh-wave dispersion data is particularly challenging at sites with strong impedance contrasts, where modal energy often transitions smoothly from the fundamental to higher modes at low frequencies. Analysts may misinterpret this transition as a continuation of the fundamental mode, leading to an overestimation of shear-wave velocity (Vs) in deeper layers and/or a misinterpretation of bedrock depth. Although effective-mode inversion can theoretically account for such behavior, it requires precise source-receiver geometry and cannot be applied when target dispersion data are formed by combining multiple active shots with passive-array recordings that have unknown source locations. This study introduces a predominant-mode inversion framework that addresses low-frequency mode jumps by automatically identifying, at each frequency, the Rayleigh-wave mode with the maximum vertical surface amplitude. This enables inversion without explicit mode indexing or assumptions about fundamental-mode dominance. The predominant-mode forward model is derived and implemented using the thin-layer method. The forward model is integrated into a particle-swarm-optimization global search algorithm and applied to invert three synthetic models exhibiting low-frequency mode jumps, using multiple layering parameterizations. Across all cases, the predominant-mode method accurately recovers major velocity contrasts and interface depths, whereas fundamental-mode inversions consistently overestimate Vs and mislocate deeper boundaries. The method is further validated using real field data from active and passive surface-wave measurements at the I15 Downhole Array Site. Inverted Vs profiles show strong agreement with downhole PS logs and with empirical transfer functions. Overall, the predominant-mode framework provides a robust approach for surface-wave inversion at sites with strong impedance contrasts.</description>

      <title>Source mechanism and rupture directivity of small earthquakes in the Changning region, China, using a dense array data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating focal mechanism solutions with rupture directivity analysis enables high-resolution characterization of subsurface fault geometry and earthquake rupture processes. However, resolving these parameters for small-magnitude earthquakes remains challenging due to small rupture sizes, short durations, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Here, we utilized a dense array of nodal seismometers in the Changning region, Sichuan Basin, China, to study the focal mechanism and rupture directivity of aftershocks following the 2019 Ms 6.0 induced earthquake. Using PhaseNet+ and SKHASH, we first enhance the focal mechanism catalog (1&lt;M&lt;4). Then, applying the spectral ratio method with empirical Green's functions (EGF), we observe azimuth-dependent corner frequencies of two M3 aftershocks, by spectral fitting to the Brune's model, which are consistent with unilateral rupture. Our results reveal that the two earthquakes occurred at an unidentified conjugate fault and ruptured towards N60{\deg}E unilaterally, which significantly differs from the northwestward rupture of the MS 6.0 mainshock. Furthermore, we obtain a rupture speed of approximately 0.6 times the shear wave velocity. We also apply the spectral decomposition method to compute stress drops (M&gt;1), and their spatial variability reflects a long-term interplay between fluid injection and faults in the salt-mining area. These findings illuminate a complex fault system beneath the Changning anticline and highlight the importance of high-resolution seismic arrays in resolving rupture processes of small-magnitude events.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Cross-Learning for Seismic Acoustic Impedance Inversion and Wavelet Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic acoustic impedance inversion is one of the most challenging tasks in geophysical exploration. Many studies have proposed the use of deep learning for processing; however, most of them are limited by factors such as seismic wavelets and low-frequency initial models. Furthermore, self-supervised frameworks constructed entirely using deep learning models struggle to form direct and effective physical constraints to unlabeled outputs during the multi-model concatenation, which leads to instability in inversion. In this work, we introduced innovations in both the deep learning framework and training strategy. First, we designed a deep learning framework to perform acoustic impedance inversion and seismic wavelet extraction simultaneously. Building on this foundation, considering the scarcity of well data, we proposed a physics-informed cross-learning strategy to impose effective constraints on the framework. We conducted comparative experiments and ablation experiments on both synthetic datasets and field datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a significant improvement compared with semi-supervised learning methods and can extract seismic wavelets with relatively high accuracy. Finally, to ensure the reproducibility of this work, we have made the code open-source.</description>

      <title>Machine-learned global glacier ice volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a global dataset of glacier ice thickness modeled with IceBoost v2.0, a machine learning model trained on 7 million ice thickness measurements and informed by physical and geometrical predictors. We model the distributed ice thickness for every glacier in the two latest Randolph Glacier Inventory releases (v6.0 and v7.0), totaling 215,547 and 274,531 glacier outlines, respectively, plus 955 ice masses contiguous with the Greenland Ice Sheet. We find a global glacier volume of $(149 \pm 38)\times 10^3$ km$^3$, consistent with the previous ensemble estimate of $(147 \pm 28)\times 10^3$ km$^3$. The corresponding sea-level equivalent, $323 \pm 91$ mm, is likewise consistent with the earlier value of $315 \pm 63$ mm. Compared to measurements, IceBoost error is 20-45% lower than the other solutions in the high Arctic, highlighting the value of machine-learning approaches. Confidence in our solution is highest at higher latitudes. Over mountainous terrain, small glaciers, and under-represented lower-latitude regions, confidence is lower. IceBoost v2.0 demonstrates strong generalization at ice sheet margins. On the Geikie Plateau (East Greenland), we find nearly twice as much ice as previously reported, highlighting the method's potential to infer bed topography in parts of the ice sheets. The quality of the solutions depends on the accuracy of the training data, the Digital Elevation Model, ice velocity fields, and glacier geometries, including nunataks. Using the Jensen Gap, we probe the model's curvature with respect to input errors and find it is strongly concave over low-slope, thick-ice regions, implying a potential downward bias in predicted thickness under input uncertainty. The released dataset can be used to model future glacier evolution and sea-level rise, inform the design of glaciological surveys and field campaigns, as well as guide policies on freshwater management.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of motions and deformations of an arbitrary geometry flexural floe in ocean waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive mathematical framework for modeling the coupled hydroelastic dynamics of sea-ice floes of arbitrary shape and non-uniform thickness under linear ocean wave forcing. We simultaneously incorporate four dominant rigid-body motions (heave, surge, roll, pitch) and the complete spectrum of flexural deformation modes within a unified Green function formulation. The water flow is modeled using potential theory with Laplace's equation, while the floe obeys a generalized Kirchhoff-Love plate equation with spatially varying flexural rigidity. We formulate the coupled fluid-structure interaction problem through kinematic velocity-matching conditions and dynamic pressure-continuity conditions at the ice-water interface. The elastic eigenproblem with free-edge boundary conditions yields a complete orthogonal basis of deformation modes, accounting for added mass effects through modified natural frequencies. By decomposing the velocity potential into partial potentials associated with incident waves, scattered waves, rigid motions, and elastic modes, we reduce the problem to a system of Fredholm integral equations of the second kind for surface density functions on all boundary segments. The solution methodology employs single-layer potential representations with fundamental Green functions for Laplace's equation. We present explicit formulations for all boundary conditions in compact tensor form, provide asymptotic analysis for the spectrum of non-uniform thickness floes, and discuss resonance phenomena arising from the interaction between incident wave frequency and natural vibration modes.</description>

      <title>Integrating Regional Ice Charts and Copernicus Sea Ice Products for Navigation Risk in Alaskan Waters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As climate change continues to reshape marginal ice zones in the Arctic, accurate and reliable sea ice data are critical for ensuring maritime safety. This study compares regional ice charts from the Alaska Sea Ice Program with satellite derived Copernicus sea ice concentration data to evaluate spatial and temporal discrepancies in ice representation across Alaskan waters from January 2010 to March 2025. Daily Arctic Sea Ice Program polygons were aligned with Copernicus grid points in a common UTM framework, and residuals were computed to quantify systematic differences. Results show that Copernicus consistently underestimates ice concentration relative to Arctic Sea Ice Program, particularly in nearshore and marginal ice zones affected by land-spillover and mixed-pixel effects such as those observed in Cook Inlet. Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis shows that both datasets capture the same dominant physical modes of sea ice variability, with the first mode representing the annual freeze thaw cycle and the second reflecting marginal ice-zone dynamics. To assess operational implications, vessel Automatic Identification System data were combined with Alaska Sea Ice Program ice charts using the IACS POLARIS Risk Index Outcome framework. Approximately 36 percent of AIS observations within ice affected waters corresponded to negative Risk Index Outcome values, indicating that vessels frequently operated under elevated-risk conditions. These findings demonstrate that regional charts and Copernicus provide complementary capabilities that together enable more accurate and operationally meaningful Arctic navigation and risk assessments.</description>
