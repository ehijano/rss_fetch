      <title>On the Twistability of Partially Coherent, Schell-model Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of assessing the twistability of a given bonafide cross spectral density is here tackled for the class of Schell-model sources whose shift invariant degree of coherence is represented through a real and symmetric function, say $\mu(-\bfr)=\mu(\bfr)$. On employing an abstract operatorial language, the problem of the determination of the, highly degenerate spectrum of a twisted operator $\hat W_u$ is addressed through a modal analysis based on the knowledge of the spectrum (eigenvalues and eigenstates) of the {\em sole} twist operator $\hat T_u$, already found by Simon and Mukunda [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A \textbf{15,} 1361 (1998)]. To this end, the evaluation of the complete tensor of the matrix elements $\bra n',\ell'|\hat W_u|n,\ell\ket$ is carried out within the framework of the so-called {\em extended Wigner distribution function}, a concept recently introduced by Van Valkenburgh [J. Mod. Opt. \textbf{55,} 3537 - 3549 (2008)]. The analytical determination of the spectrum of saturated twisted astigmatic Gaussian Schell-model sources is also presented as a practical application of the algorithm here developed.</description>

      <title>Rotating polarization magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise magnetometry is vital in numerous scientific and technological applications. At the forefront of sensitivity, optical atomic magnetometry, particularly techniques utilizing nonlinear magneto-optical rotation (NMOR), enables ultraprecise measurements across a broad field range. Despite their potential, these techniques reportedly lose sensitivity at higher magnetic fields, which is attributed to the alignment-to-orientation conversion (AOC) process. In our study, we utilize light with continuously rotating linear polarization to avoid AOC, producing robust optical signals and achieving high magnetometric sensitivity over a dynamic range nearly three times greater than Earth's magnetic field. We demonstrate that employing rotating polarization surpasses other NMOR techniques that use modulated light. Our findings also indicate that the previously observed signal deterioration is not due to AOC, suggesting an alternative cause for this decline.</description>

      <title>Back-Scattering Suppression for Broad-Spectral High-Absorption Silicon Extended Area Blackbody</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability and emissivity of the online calibration blackbody used in high-precision infrared remote sensing detectors in extreme environments are the primary limiting factors for their measurement accuracy. Due to the limitations of microstructure size effects, traditional calibration extended area blackbody cannot achieve an optimal balance between emissivity and stability, thus hindering further improvement in infrared remote sensing accuracy. This work proposes a new method that utilize suppressing near-field backscattering to control far-field reflectance. Specifically, through simultaneously reducing backscattering intensity and the backscattering solid angle, the reflectance is significantly reduced to an extremely low limit, which is validated through numerical simulations. Additionally, by combining the femtosecond laser self-convergent processing technique, the spontaneous energy negative feedback mechanism during femtosecond laser processing is utilized to achieve the fabrication of a high emissivity, thermally stable, mechanically stable, and highly uniform extended area blackbody. The blackbody fabricated using this technique can be applied for online calibration in various extreme environments, significantly improving measurement accuracy and service life.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Quantum Electrodynamics of Epsilon-Near-Zero Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate vacuum-induced nonlinearity and single-photon nonlinear optical responses of Epsilon-Near-Zero (ENZ) media and of sub-wavelength nanocavities. We apply the rigorous quantum Langevin-noise approach in the framework of the Green's tensor quantization method to ENZ materials and resonators with causal dispersion and we derive generally valid closed-form analytical solutions for the nonlinear phase shifts achievable in cavities with spherical geometry. This is achieved by employing a fully nonperturbative methodology for the analysis of open quantum systems with single-photon Kerr-type nonlinearity in dielectric environments with absorption losses and dispersion that satisfy the Kramers-Kronig relations. Our findings are relevant for the design of quantum optical devices and are of importance to emerging quantum technology applications, including on-chip single-photon nondemolition detection, quantum sensing, and controlled quantum gates driven by enhanced photon blockade effects at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Continuous and Reversible Electrical Tuning of Fluorescent Decay Rate via Fano Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decay rate of an atomic or molecular dipole depends on the local density of optical states (LDOS) -- Purcell effect -- which can significantly be enhanced near a dielectric-core metal-shell nanoparticle (CSNP). On top of that, an auxiliary quantum object (QO) can introduce a Fano transparency in the plasmonic spectrum of the CSNP. Here, we show that an auxiliary QO, located at the hotspot of the CSNP, can modify the LDOS, hence the decay rate of an excited dipole. Moreover, by controlling the resonance of the auxiliary QO via an applied voltage, one can continuously and reversibly tune both the radiative and nonradiative decay rates of the dipole up to 2 orders-of-magnitude. This phenomenon emerges as an invaluable tool to implement in integrated quantum technologies, enabling realization of on-demand entanglement/single-photon sources, controlled execution of quantum gates and electrical-control of superradiant-like phase transitions. It also bears potential for application in super-resolution microscopy and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).</description>

      <title>Controllable Thermo-Stimulated Luminescence in Niobate Persistent Phosphor by Constructing the Photovoltaic/Electrolytic Cell for Remote Intelligent Anti-Counterfeiting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent luminescence (PersL) carrying remote key information plays a crucial role for intelligent anti-counterfeiting applications. However, the weak PersL intensity accompanied by uncontrollability limits their practical application. Here we develop LiNbO3 (LNO):Pr,Bi phosphor with enhanced red PersL by trace doping Sm3+. The LNO:Pr,Bi,Sm phosphor exhibits quadruplet luminescence, including polychrome photoluminescence, PersL, and photo/thermo-stimulated luminescence (PSL/TSL). Particularly, the enhanced TSL can carry remote subjective information independent of the phosphor itself by controlling the temperature. A mechanism of afterglow enhancement is proposed based on constructing reversible photovoltaic cells and electrolytic cells by photothermal redox reactions using Bi3+ + VO and Bi3+/Pr3+ + VLi' ion pair. This study has sparked the exploration of designing the information storage PersL materials for more sophisticated remote intelligent anti-counterfeiting.</description>

      <title>Narrowband parallel coherent LiDAR with frequency interleaving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high demand for 3D imaging in intelligent robotics is motivating the advances of coherent LiDARs towards high performances with low complexity/cost. However, the current coherent LiDARs suffer from the tight coupling between the high ranging-imaging performance and the high complexity/cost. Herein, we propose a narrowband parallel coherent LiDAR with frequency-interleaving architecture. The LiDAR architecture utilizes narrowband signals for ranging, and interleaves multi-channel sparse and narrowband signals in frequency domain at the receiving end to significantly reduce the required bandwidth and the number of detection branches, facilitating massive parallelization with low system complexity/cost. In experiments, a ranging precision of 0.49 mm that approaches the shot noise limit, and a power sensitivity of -95 dBm (~9 photons) are achieved. Parallel 3D imaging with an equivalent imaging rate of 10 Mpixel/s and a 2 cm ranging precision is also demonstrated using only two 150 MHz receiving branches. With these desirable properties, this new LiDAR opens an avenue for the LiDAR ecosystem.</description>

      <title>The Orbital Hall Effect of vortex light in specialized optical materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely accepted that the optical Orbital Hall Effect (OHE) is analogous to the Spin Hall Effect (SHE). However, it has been reported that these two types of phenomena are fundamentally distinct in curved spacetime. In this paper, we construct a vortex Laguerre-Gaussian electromagnetic wave packet and analyze its motion by solving the covariant Maxwell equations in a specialized optical material that is equivalent to curved spacetime. Our findings reveal that, within media, the relationships between intrinsic orbital angular momentum-dependent and spin-dependent separations can differ significantly. These results suggest that the optical OHE in materials cannot be accurately predicted by merely substituting spin with intrinsic orbital angular momentum in the SHE. Additionally, we compute the maximum deviation angle of the OHE in two experimentally viable optical materials. According to our results, in the first material, the transverse displacement can be successfully detected using current experimental techniques, which can serve as a reference for future experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit interactions of the twisted random light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The twist phase of random light represents a nontrivial two-point phase, endowing the field with orbital angular momentum. Although the mutual transition of the spin and orbit angular momenta of coherent light has been revealed, the relationship between spin-orbital angular momentum interaction (SOI) and the twist phase has remained unexplored. This is because of the stochastic nature of random light, making it challenging to explore the properties of angular momenta that rely on well-defined spatial and polarization structures. This study addresses this gap from the view of the asymmetry coherent-mode decomposition for twisted random light to gain insight into the intricate interplay between the twist phase and the SOI within a tight focusing system. Our findings reveal that spin and orbit angular momentum transitions occur in the tightly focused twisted random light beam, yielding the transverse spin density controlled by the twist phase. This effect becomes more pronounced when the spin of random light and the chirality of the twist phase are the same. Our work may find significant applications in optical sensing, metrology, and quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Scattering by nanoplasmonic mesoscale assemblies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flexibility and versatility of nanoassembled plasmonic structures provide platforms for mesoscale tunable optical modulation. Our recently developed model for these nanoassembled plasmonic structures is composed of a dielectric spherical core surrounded by a concentric spherical shell containing a random distribution of AuNPs. This model provides a useful platform for studying the role of a controlled amount of disorder on scattering by a particle. In that context, we explore the angular distribution of scattered light for different sizes (5 - 20 nm) and filling fractions (0.1 - 0.3) of the AuNP in the coatings. The simulations reveal that the coating of AuNPs redistributes power in a way that suppresses angular side lobes, thereby guiding the scattered power preferentially in the forward direction. These results highlight that with the ability to tune both the spatial and the spectral aspects of the scattering profile, these coated structures may serve as a platform for a variety of applications, including passive cloaking, scattering enhancement, and high-resolution imaging.</description>

      <title>Radiation of surface polaritons by an annular beam coaxially enclosing a cylindrical waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the radiation of surface polaritons by an annular beam that coaxially encloses a cylindrical waveguide surrounded by a homogeneous medium. By using the Green dyadic, the electromagnetic potentials and the electric and magnetic fields are found inside and outside the waveguide. The expression for the energy losses is derived for the general case of the dispersion for dielectric permittivities inside and outside the cylinder. A comprehensive analysis is presented in the spectral range corresponding to the radiation of surface polaritons. The highest peaks in the spectral distribution are obtained for intermediate values of the beam velocity. In the limit of transparent medium the spectrum of radiated surface polaritons is discrete and the corresponding frequencies are determined by the eigenvalue equation for the cylindrical waveguide. Numerical examples are presented for the Drude model of dispersion.</description>

      <title>Topological invariant of non-Hermitian space-time modulated photonic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a medium transformation approach to formulate the adjoint system of space-time modulated photonic crystals (STMPCs), essential for the bi-orthogonal Berry connection when calculating the topological invariant. We show that the non-Abelian Zak phase of STMPCs comprising stacked photonic time crystals and dielectrics is quantized to 0 or 1 for both the entangled and isolated bands. We find that the eigenmodes at the center and edge of the Brillouin zone differ in symmetry for the band with non-trivial Zak phases, while they share the same symmetry for the trivial Zak phases. In addition, topological phase transitions owing to band inversion are observed. Moreover, a generalized Brillouin zone of the non-Hermitian STMPCs is established, which is identical to the Hermitian counterpart, implicating that the non-Bloch band theory is not required in this regard. The proposed medium transformation method may serve as an alternative approach to exploring more intricate topological phenomena in non-Hermitian systems when incorporating non-Bloch band theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the theoretical framework for a material system that supports surface plasmon polaritions (SPPs) excited by a dipole excitation, where the media configuration suddenly changes at a temporal boundary. We employ three-dimensional Green's function analysis in the Laplace transform domain. We use this framework to demonstrate dynamic SPP formation and time-boundary-induced interference of slow and fast propagating SPPs. This analysis provides insight into how SPPs are formed in time and how they interfere at a temporal boundary.</description>

      <title>Diffractive Magic Cube Network with Super-high Capacity Enabled by Mechanical Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiplexing and dynamic reconfigurable metasurfaces have been extensively studied to enhance system capacity in response to the challenges posed by the exponential growth of optical information. Among them, the mechanically reconfigurable strategy offers a cost-effective and low-complexity approach for capacity enhancement. However, the channel numbers achieved in current studies are insufficient for practical applications because of inadequate mechanical transformations and suboptimal optimization methods. In this article, a diffractive magic cube network (DMCN) is proposed to advance the multiplexing capacity of mechanically reconfigurable metasurfaces. We utilized the deep diffractive neural network (D2NN) model to jointly optimize the subset of channels generated by the combination of three mechanical operations, permutation, translation, and rotation. The 144-channel holograms, 108-channel single-focus/multi-focus, and 60-channel orbital angular momentum (OAM) beam/comb generation were numerically achieved and experimentally validated using a spatial light modulator (SLM) and a reflective mirror. Our strategy not only provides a novel paradigm to improve metasurface capacity to super-high level with low crosstalk, but also paves the way for new advancements in optical storage, computing, communication, and photolithography.</description>

      <title>Tutorial of Fourier Transform for ultrafast optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This tutorial is designed for individuals who are new to the field of ultrafast optics. It was written in response to the apparent lack of comprehensive introductions to the basic Fourier Transform, extending beyond the flat-phase description. Additionally, there is a need for complete derivations of several relations involving the Fourier Transform, maintaining its most general formulation. This approach avoids the arbitrary selection of Fourier-Transform coefficients and ensures a complete understanding. It shows the importance of having Fourier-Transform coefficients as parameters, which I would like to advocate people to do. Most important of all, I've seen misuse of Fourier Transform over my years of discussion in the lab and from others' questions since I shared my code publicly on Github. Surprisingly, since people check the correctness of numerical implementation only by seeing if the simulation result is smooth and if it duplicates the ``overall physics,'' this seems to be a widespread problem from my perspective, which can be solved by a simple tutorial. This is why I hope that this tutorial can help people understand more about the Fourier Transform, especially in the context of ultrafast optics.</description>

      <title>Chirality encoding in resonant metasurfaces governed by lattice symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral metasurfaces provide invaluable tools capable of controlling structured light required for biosensing, photochemistry, holography, and quantum photonics. Here we suggest and realize a universal strategy for controlling the chiral response of resonant metasurfaces via the interplay of meta-atom geometry and lattice arrangements within all five possible planar Bravais symmetries. By introducing chiral gradient metasurfaces, we illustrate how our approach allows producing a predictable chiral response tunable by simple parameter variations. We highlight that symmetry-controlled chiral response provides an additional degree of freedom in optical signal processing, and showcase this with simultaneous mid-IR image encoding in two fundamental quantities, transmission and circular dichroism. Our proposed concept represents a universal toolkit for on-demand design and control of chiral metastructures that has potential for numerous applications in life sciences, quantum optics and more.</description>

      <title>On-chip, inverse-designed active wavelength division multiplexer at THz frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of photonic integrated components for terahertz has become an active and growing research field. Despite its numerous applications, several challenges are still present in hardware design. We demonstrate an on-chip active wavelength division multiplexer (WDM) operating at THz frequencies. The WDM architecture is based on an inverse design topology optimization, which is applied in this case to the active quantum cascade heterostructure material embedded within a polymer in a planarized double metal cavity. Such an approach enables the fabrication of a strongly subwavelength device, with a normalized volume of only $V/\lambda^3 \simeq 0.5$. The WDM input is integrated with a THz quantum cascade laser frequency comb, providing three broadband output ports, ranging from 2.2 THz to 3.2 THz, with $\approx$ 330 GHz bandwidth and a maximum crosstalk of -6 dB. The three ports are outcoupled via integrated broadband patch array antennas with surface emission. Such a device can be also function as a stand-alone element, unlocking complex on-chip signal processing in the THz range</description>

      <title>Near-zero-index behavior in indium antimonide revealed by phase-corrected terahertz reflection spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a phase correction method for broadband terahertz time-domain spectroscopy in reflection geometry, which allows us to obtain quantitative and accurate values for the complex refractive index of materials. The process is analytical, based on the Kramers-Kronig relations, and does not require any computationally intensive algorithms. We validate it by extracting the refractive index of silicon, obtaining the nominal value with an accuracy better than 2.5\% over the 0.25--3.5 THz range, and better than 0.6\% in the 1--2 THz range. We use the method to experimentally observe that an undoped InSb crystal shows a refractive index of $n&lt;1$ between 1 and 2 THz, in proximity to the plasma frequency of the material where, the amplitude of the group velocity goes as low as 0.08$c$.</description>

      <title>Superfluorescent scintillation from coupled perovskite quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scintillation, the process of converting high-energy radiation to detectable visible light, is pivotal in advanced technologies spanning from medical diagnostics to fundamental scientific research. Despite significant advancements toward faster and more efficient scintillators, there remains a fundamental limit arising from the intrinsic properties of scintillating materials. The scintillation process culminates in spontaneous emission of visible light, which is restricted in rate by the oscillator strength of individual emission centers. Here, we observe a novel collective emission phenomenon under X-ray excitation, breaking this limit and accelerating the emission. Our observation reveals that strong interactions between simultaneously excited coupled perovskite quantum dots can create collective radioluminescence. This effect is characterized by a spectral shift and an enhanced rate of emission, with an average lifetime of 230 ps, 14 times faster than their room temperature spontaneous emission. It has been established that such quantum dots exhibit superfluorescence under UV excitation. However, X-ray superfluorescence is inherently different, as each high-energy photon creates multiple synchronized excitation events, triggered by a photoelectron and resulting in even faster emission rates, a larger spectral shift, and a broader spectrum. This observation is consistent with a quantum-optical analysis explaining both the UV-driven and X-ray-driven effects. We use a Hanbury-Brown-Twiss g^(2) ({\tau}) setup to analyze the temperature-dependent temporal response of these scintillators. Collective radioluminescence breaks the limit of scintillation lifetime based on spontaneous emission and could dramatically improve time-of-flight detector performance, introducing quantum enhancements to scintillation science.</description>

      <title>Photonics detection of molecular-specific spatial structural alterations in cell nuclei due to chronic alcoholism and probiotics treatments on colon cancer via a light localization method using confocal imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonics/light localization techniques are important in understanding the structural changes in biological tissues at the nano- to sub-micron scale. It is now known that structural alteration starts at the nanoscale at the beginning of cancer progression. This study examines the molecular-specific nano-structural alterations of chronic alcoholism and probiotic effects on colon cancer using a mouse model of colon cancer. Confocal microscopy and mesoscopic light-scattering analysis are applied to quantify structural changes in DNA (chromatin), cytoskeleton, and ki-67 protein cells with appropriate staining dyes. We assessed alcohol-treated and azoxymethane (AOM) with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis models, including ethanol (EtOH) and probiotic (L.Casei) treatments separately and together. The inverse participation ratio (IPR) technique was employed to quantify the degree of light localization to access the molecular-specific spatial structural disorder as a biomarker for cancer progression detection. Significant enhancement of cancer progression was observed in the alcohol-treated group, and probiotics treatment with alcohol showed partial reversal of these changes in colon cancer. The results underscore the potential of the IPR technique in detecting early structural changes in colon cancer, offering insights into the mitigating effects of probiotics on alcohol-induced enhancement of colon cancer.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate trapping of individual rubidium (Rb) and cesium (Cs) atoms in an interleaved array of bright tweezers and dark bottle-beam traps, using a microfabricated optical element illuminated by a single laser beam. This trapping approach is simple and robust compared to common approaches that use active optoelectronic components and multiple laser wavelengths, and can be easily adapted for other atomic species.</description>

      <title>Subnanometric control of coupling between WS$_2$ monolayers with a molecular spacer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stacking monolayer semiconductors into heterostructures allows for control of their optical and electronic properties, offering advantages for nanoscale electronics, optoelectronics, and photonics. Specifically, adding a thin spacer between monolayers can yield bulk materials that retain interesting monolayer properties, such as a direct bandgap and a high emission quantum efficiency. The interaction mechanisms between monolayers, including interlayer coupling, charge transfer, and energy transfer, might be tuned through subnanometric control over the spacer thickness. Traditional spacer materials like bulk oxides or other layered materials can suffer from poor material interfaces or inhomogeneous thickness over large areas. Here, we use a spin-cast organic molecular spacer to adjust interlayer coupling in WS$_2$ monolayer stacks. We vary the molecular spacer thickness to tune the interlayer distance, significantly altering the optical properties of the resulting organic-inorganic heterostructures. Additionally, we demonstrate a dependence of the valence-band splitting on molecular spacer thickness manifested as a change in the energy difference between A and B excitons resulting from spin-orbit coupling and interlayer interactions. Our results illustrate the potential of molecular spacers to tailor the properties of monolayer heterostructures. This accessible approach opens new routes to advance atomically thin devices and could enable sensing technologies at the subnanometer scale.</description>

      <title>Efficient inverted HTL-free Sm$_2$NiMnO$_6$-based perovskite solar cell: a SCAPS-1D study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition to sustainable energy has accelerated research into perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as promising candidates for next-generation photovoltaics. Despite their remarkable efficiencies, the commercialization of PSCs is hindered by lead toxicity and material instability. In this study, we explore a lead-free Samarium-based double perovskite oxide Sm$_2$NiMnO$_6$ (SNMO), as the active absorber layer in an innovative inverted HTL-free PSC architecture. Using SCAPS-1D simulations, we optimized the device configuration to achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.93% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.8 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 16.46 mA/cm2, and a fill factor (FF) of 82.14%. We demonstrate that increasing the SNMO absorber thickness enhances light harvesting in the red spectrum region (~620 nm), shifting the external quantum efficiency (EQE) peak from 380 nm at 50 nm thickness to about 620 nm at 1 um. We also investigated various electron transport layers (ETLs) and found that the indium tin oxide (ITO) exhibited superior PV performances, boosting the PCE to ~12.6% due to its excellent conductivity and optimal energy band alignment with SNMO. These findings establish SNMO as a promising absorber material for environmentally friendly PSCs, paving the way for cheaper, simpler, scalable, and sustainable photovoltaic solutions. This work highlights the potential of HTL-free architectures in reducing costs and complexities while maintaining competitive efficiencies, offering a significant step forward in advancing lead-free solar technologies.</description>

      <title>A Hidden Quantum Paraelectric Phase in SrTiO3 Induced by Terahertz Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent manipulation of lattice vibrations using ultrafast light pulses enables access to nonequilibrium 'hidden' phases with designed functionalities in quantum materials. However, expanding the understanding of nonlinear light-phonon interaction mechanisms remains crucial for developing new strategies. Here, we report re-entrant ultrafast phase transitions in SrTiO3 driven by intense terahertz excitation. As the terahertz field increases, the system transitions from the quantum paraelectric (QPE) ground state to an intermediate ferroelectric phase, and then unexpectedly reverts to a QPE state above ~500 kV/cm. The latter hidden QPE phase exhibits distinct lattice dynamics compared to the initial phases, highlighting activated antiferrodistortive phonon modes. Aided by first-principles dynamical calculations, we identify the mechanism for these complex behaviors as a superposition of multiple coherently excited eigenstates of the polar soft mode. Our results reveal a previously uncharted quantum facet of SrTiO3 and open pathways for harnessing high-order excitations to engineer quantum materials in the ultrafast regime.</description>

      <title>Topological gap solitons in equidistant lithium niobate waveguide arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equidistant 1D arrays of thin film lithium niobate waveguides can exhibit non-trivial topology due to a specific interplay between inter- and intra-modal couplings of two families of guided modes. In this work we analyze two-colour spatial solitons, emerging due to $\chi_2$ nonlinear interactions between the modes of non-trivial topology in the fundamental harmonic field, and modes of trivial topology in the second harmonic field. We discuss solitons localized in the bulk of the array (bulk solitons), and at an edge of a finite-size array (edge solitons). The latter emerge due to the nonlinear interactions between a topological edge mode in the fundamental harmonic and bulk modes in the second harmonic. We reveal that for each type of soliton, bulk or edge, there generally exist two families of solutions with different internal structures and ranges of propagation constants. All bulk solitons can only be excited above a certain power threshold dictated by the coupling strength in the second harmonic field and the phase matching between the fundamental and second harmonics. The power threshold for edge solitons generally appears to be much lower, and, by tuning the phase matching, it can be reduced to zero.</description>

      <title>A Simplified Theory of External Occulters for Solar Coronagraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a first-principles analytic treatment of modern multi-vane occulters in circular (coronagraph) and linear (heliospheric imager) geometry, develop a simplified theory that is useful for designing and predicting their performance, explain certain visual artifacts, and explore the performance limits of multi-vane occulters. Multi-vane occulters are challenging to design in part because they violate the conditions for both the Fraunhofer and Fresnel approximations to diffraction theory, and new designs have therefore generally required explicit simulation, empirical measurement, "guesstimation", or all three. Starting from the Kirchoff diffraction integral, we develop a "sequential plane wave" approximate analytic theory that is suitable for predicting performance of multi-vane occulters, and use it to derive closed-form expressions for the performance of new designs. We review the fundamental 2-D system of an occulter edge, discuss how it applies to real 3-D systems by extrusion or revolution, present the reason for observed bright quasi-achromatic fringing around coronagraph occulters, develop the sequential plane wave approximation in 2-D and explore its limits, describe the relevance of the 2-D theory to practical 3-D instruments, and discuss implications for multi-vane occulter design in current and future instruments.</description>

      <title>Emerging Quadrature Lattices of Kerr Combs</title>

Abstract: A quadrature lattice is a coupled array of squeezed vacuum field quadratures that offers new avenues in shaping the quantum properties of multimode light [1-3]. Such lattices are described within the framework of non-Hermitian, non-dissipative physics and exhibit intriguing lattice phenomena such as lattice exceptional points, edge-states, entanglement and non-Hermitian skin effect, offering fundamentally new methods for controlling quantum fluctuations [1, 4]. Nonlinear resonators are suitable for studying multimode pair-generation processes and squeezing which are non-dissipative in \chi(2) and \chi(3) materials [5-12], but observing non-Hermitian lattice phenomena in photonic quadrature lattices was not achieved. Remarkably, in dissipative Kerr microcombs [13], which have revolutionized photonic technology, such lattices emerge and govern the quantum noise that leads to comb formation. Thus, they offer a unique opportunity to realize quadrature lattices, and to study and manipulate multimode quantum noise which is essential for any quantum technology. Here, we experimentally study non-Hermitian lattice effects in photonic quadrature lattices for the first time. Our photonic quadrature lattices emerge at Kerr microcomb transitions, allowing us to observe fundamental connections between dispersion symmetry, frequency-dependent squeezed supermodes, and non-Hermitian lattice physics in an integrated setup. Our work unifies two major fields, quantum non-Hermitian physics and Kerr combs, and opens the door to utilizing dissipative Kerr combs to experimentally explore rich non-Hermitian physics in the quantum regime, engineer quantum light, and develop new tools to study the quantum noise and formation of Kerr combs.</description>

      <title>Optical Routing via High Efficiency Composite Acoustic Diffraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Acousto-optical modulation (AOM) is a powerful and widely used technique for rapidly controlling the frequency, phase, intensity, and direction of light. Based on Bragg diffraction, AOMs typically exhibit moderate diffraction efficiency, often less than 90\% even for collimated inputs. In this work, we demonstrate that this efficiency can be significantly improved using a composite (CP) setup comprising a pair of 4-F-linked AOMs, enabling beamsplitting with fully tunable splitting amplitude and phase. The efficiency enhancement arises from two effects, termed "momentum echo" and "high-order rephasing," which can be simultaneously optimized by adjusting the relative distance between the two AOMs. This method is resource-efficient, does not require ultra-collimation, and maintains control bandwidth. Experimentally, we achieved a diffraction efficiency exceeding 99\% (excluding insertion loss) and a 35 dB single-mode suppression of the 0th-order beam, demonstrating a full-contrast optical router with a switching time of less than 100~nanoseconds. Theoretically, we formulate the dynamics of CP-AOM in terms of multi-mode quantum control and discuss extensions beyond the $N=2$ configuration presented in this work. The substantially enhanced performance of CP-AOMs, coupled with reduced acoustic amplitude requirements, may significantly advance our ability to accurately control light at high speeds with low-loss acousto-optics.</description>

      <title>Method for overcoming the finite space-bandwidth limitation of digital holograms in holography</title>

Abstract: A digital hologram has a finite space-bandwidth, which determines the spatial resolution and angular field of view of its reconstructed image. However, higher space-bandwidth induces aliased replica patterns in the Fresnel diffraction. This study analyzes the spatial distribution of the angular spectrum in an undersampled hologram using angle modulation in the complex domain. The replica functions are identified as phase-modulated functions by multiples of the sampling frequency, with the spatial frequency range extending continuously from the original function into the regions of the replica functions. Simulations of optical imaging confirm the theoretical predictions, demonstrating that imaging performance beyond the space-bandwidth limitation of a digital hologram is achievable. Specifically, multiple diffraction fields have the orthogonal property, which enables the effective removal of high-order terms. This approach provides an alternative solution to overcome the constraints imposed by the finite space-bandwidth of digital holograms.</description>

      <title>Wavelength-selective thermal nonreciprocity barely improves sky radiative cooling</title>

Abstract: Radiative cooling has showcased great potential for passive refrigeration without extra energy consumption, while its cooling power and efficiency is confined by Kirchhoff's law, that is, the emissivity is equal to the absorptivity. The recent development of thermal nonreciprocity that breaks the limitations of Kirchhoff's law, especially in broadband manner, makes nonreciprocal radiative cooling (NRC) possible. Since there lacks of reports of NRC theoretically or experimentally, it is time to evaluate the feasibility and worthiness of develop NRC. Here, we discussed the effects of NRC at around room temperature (298.15 K) from three perspectives: ideal selective radiators, non-selective radiators, and colored radiators. Contrary to intuition, the introduction of thermal nonreciprocity in the atmospheric window (8-13 {\mu}m) only leads to a negative gain. Additionally, it should be noted that the radiators discussed in this work are horizontally placed without the influence of asymmetric external heat sources. The current findings shatter the inherent notion of NRC and offer some theoretical support for the practical realization and application of nonreciprocal radiative refrigeration devices.</description>

      <title>Extracting Complete Resonance Characteristics From the Phase of Physical Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resonances are common in wave physics and their full and rigorous characterization is crucial to correctly tailor the response of a system in both time and frequency domains. However, they have been conventionally described by the quality factor, a real-valued number quantifying the sharpness of a single peak in the amplitude spectrum, and associated with a singularity in the complex frequency plane. But the amplitude of a physical signal does not hold all the information on the resonance and it has not been established that even the knowledge of the full distribution of singularities carries this information. Here we derive a quality function that fully characterizes resonances from the knowledge of the phase spectrum of the signal. This function is driven by the spectral derivative of the phase and does not require the amplitude of the signal. It can be obtained by numerically calculating the spectral derivative of the phase from numerical or experimental acquisitions of the phase spectrum. Alternatively, it can be retrieved from the distribution of poles and zeros in the complex frequency plane through an analytic expression, which demonstrates that singularities do not suffice to fully characterize the resonances and that both singularities and zeros must be taken into account to retrieve the quality function. This approach permits to extract all the characteristics of resonances from arbitrary spectral response functions without a priori knowledge on the physical system.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic resonances in the chain of spheroidal metallic nanoparticles on the dielectric substrate</title>

Abstract: The optical and plasmonic properties of the chains of prolate metallic spheroids of the dielectric substrate are studied in the work using the local field approximation. The case when spheroids are arranged in such a way that their major semi-axis belongs to the substrate plane is considered. The relations for the transverse component of the chain polarizability tensor and the frequency of the transverse chain resonance are obtained. The comparative analysis of spectral shifts of the maxima of the imaginary part of the transverse chain polarizability and the polarizability of isolated prolate spheroid is performed. The influence of the variation of the material of particles in the chain and the dielectric environment on the location of the maxima of the imaginary part of the transverse polarizability is studied. The limits of applicability of the theory proposed in the paper are established.</description>

      <title>Thermo-optic tuning of directional infrared emissivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tuning the spatial extent of directional thermal emission across an arbitrary, and fixed spectral bandwidth is a fundamentally enabling capability for a range of emerging applications such as thermophotovoltaics, thermal imaging, and radiative cooling. However, previous experimental demonstrations were limited to narrow bandwidths, and the resonance frequency itself changed significantly as a function of the reconfigured directional response. Here, we demonstrate thermo-optic tuning of directional infrared emissivity using InAs-based gradient ENZ materials functioning as broadband directional thermal emitters whose angular selectivity can be modified via thermal free-carrier effects. We experimentally demonstrate two emitters achieving a 5{\deg} and 10{\deg} increase in the angular extent of their directional emissivity in the p-polarization across a prescribed, broad wavelength range of operation (12.5 to 15$\mu$m), for moderate temperatures below 400 K. Temperature-driven control of directional emissivity offers a new mode of post-fabrication control of radiative heat transfer that may in turn enable novel device functionalities.</description>

      <title>Integrated Electro-Optic Absorption Modulator for Silicon Nitride Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silicon nitride (SiN) is currently the most prominent platform for photonics at visible and near-IR wavelength bandwidth. However, realizing fast electro-optic (EO) modulators, the key components of any integrated optics platform, remains challenging in SiN. Recently, transparent conductive oxides (TCO) have emerged as a promising platform for photonic integrated circuits. Here we make an important step towards exceeding possibilities of both platforms, reporting for the first-time high-speed ITO electro-optic modulators based on silicon nitride waveguides. The insertion losses of 5.7 dB and bandwidth of about 1 GHz are shown for 300 nm-thickness SiN waveguide platform with 9.3-um-length hybrid waveguide. The fabrication process of devices requires only standard clean room tools, is repeatable and compatible with the CMOS technology. Simulation results of optimized device designs indicate that further improvement is possible and offer promising opportunities towards silicon nitride photonic computation platforms based on ITO.</description>

      <title>Complex-valued 3D atomic spectroscopy with Gaussian-assisted inline holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09117v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a laser-cooled atomic sample is optically excited, the envelope of coherent forward scattering can often be decomposed into a few complex Gaussian profiles. The convenience of Gaussian propagation helps addressing key challenges in digital holography. In this work, we develop a Gaussian-decomposition-assisted approach to inline holography, for single-shot, simultaneous measurements of absorption and phase-shift profiles of small atomic samples sparsely distributed in 3D. The samples' axial positions are resolved with micrometer resolution, and their spectroscopy are extracted from complex-valued images recorded at various probe frequencies. The phase-angle readout is not only robust against transition saturation, but also insensitive to atom-number and optical-pumping-induced interaction-strength fluctuations. Benefiting from such features, we achieve hundred-kHz-level single-shot resolution to the transition frequency of a $^{87}$Rb D2 line, with merely hundreds of atoms. We further demonstrate single-shot 3D field sensing by measuring local light shifts to the atomic array with micrometer spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Evidence of relativistic field-derivative torque in nonlinear THz response of magnetization dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the complete light-spin interactions in magnetic systems is the key to manipulating the magnetization using optical means at ultrafast timescales. The selective addressing of spins by terahertz (THz) electromagnetic fields via Zeeman torque is one of the most successful ultrafast means of controlling magnetic excitations. Here we show that this traditional Zeeman torque on the spins is not sufficient, rather an additional relativistic field-derivative torque is essential to realize the observed magnetization dynamics. We accomplish this by exploring the ultrafast nonlinear magnetization dynamics of rare-earth, Bi-doped iron garnet when excited by two co-propagating THz pulses. First, by exciting the sample with an intense THz pulse and probing the magnetization dynamics using magneto-optical Faraday effect, we find the collective exchange resonance mode between rare-earth and transition metal sublattices at 0.48 THz. We further explore the magnetization dynamics via the THz time-domain spectroscopic means. We find that the observed nonlinear trace of the magnetic response cannot be mapped to the magnetization precession induced by the Zeeman torque, while the Zeeman torque supplemented by an additional field-derivative torque follows the experimental evidences. This breakthrough enhances our comprehension of ultra-relativistic effects and paves the way towards novel technologies harnessing light-induced control over magnetic systems.</description>
