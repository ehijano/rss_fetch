      <title>6Vision: Image-encoding-based IPv6 Target Generation in Few-seed Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient global Internet scanning is crucial for network measurement and security analysis. While existing target generation algorithms demonstrate remarkable performance in large-scale detection, their efficiency notably diminishes in few-seed scenarios. This decline is primarily attributed to the intricate configuration rules and sampling bias of seed addresses. Moreover, instances where BGP prefixes have few seed addresses are widespread, constituting 63.65% of occurrences. We introduce 6Vision as a solution to tackle this challenge by introducing a novel approach of encoding IPv6 addresses into images, facilitating comprehensive analysis of intricate configuration rules. Through a process of feature stitching, 6Vision not only improves the learnable features but also amalgamates addresses associated with configuration patterns for enhanced learning. Moreover, it integrates an environmental feedback mechanism to refine model parameters based on identified active addresses, thereby alleviating the sampling bias inherent in seed addresses. As a result, 6Vision achieves high-accuracy detection even in few-seed scenarios. The HitRate of 6Vision shows a significant improvement ranging from 181% to 2,490% compared to existing algorithms, while the CoverNum increases by a factor of 1.18 to 11.20 times. Additionally, 6Vision can function as a preliminary detection module for existing algorithms, yielding a conversion gain (CG) ranging from 242% to 2,081%. Ultimately, we achieve a conversion rate (CR) of 28.97% for few-seed scenarios. We develop the IPv6 hitlist Patch, which augments current target generation algorithms for large-scale address detection, thereby effectively supporting IPv6 network measurement and security analysis.</description>

      <title>Age-Based Device Selection and Transmit Power Optimization in Over-the-Air Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, over-the-air federated learning (FL) has attracted significant attention for its ability to enhance communication efficiency. However, the performance of over-the-air FL is often constrained by device selection strategies and signal aggregation errors. In particular, neglecting straggler devices in FL can lead to a decline in the fairness of model updates and amplify the global model's bias toward certain devices' data, ultimately impacting the overall system performance. To address this issue, we propose a joint device selection and transmit power optimization framework that ensures the appropriate participation of straggler devices, maintains efficient training performance, and guarantees timely updates. First, we conduct a theoretical analysis to quantify the convergence upper bound of over-the-air FL under age-of-information (AoI)-based device selection. Our analysis further reveals that both the number of selected devices and the signal aggregation errors significantly influence the convergence upper bound. To minimize the expected weighted sum peak age of information, we calculate device priorities for each communication round using Lyapunov optimization and select the highest-priority devices via a greedy algorithm. Then, we formulate and solve a transmit power and normalizing factor optimization problem for selected devices to minimize the time-average mean squared error (MSE). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method offers two significant advantages: (1) it reduces MSE and improves model performance compared to baseline methods, and (2) it strikes a balance between fairness and training efficiency while maintaining satisfactory timeliness, ensuring stable model performance.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin-based SIM Communication and Flight Control for Advanced Air Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric Vertical Take-off and Landing vehicles (eVTOLs) are driving Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) toward transforming urban transportation by extending travel from congested ground networks to low-altitude airspace. This transition promises to reduce traffic congestion and significantly shorten commute times. To ensure aviation safety, eVTOLs must fly within prescribed flight corridors. These corridors are managed by ground-based Air Traffic Control (ATCo) stations, which oversee air-ground communication and flight scheduling. However, one critical challenge remains: the lack of high rate air-ground communication and safe flight planning within these corridors. The introduction of 6G-oriented Stacked Intelligent Metasurface (SIM) technology presents a high rate communication solution. With advanced phase-shifting capabilities, SIM enables precise wireless signal control and supports beam-tracking communication with eVTOLs. Leveraging this technology, we propose a Composite Potential Field (CPF) approach. This method dynamically integrates target, separation, and communication fields to optimize both SIM communication efficiency and flight safety. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of this DT-based approach. Compared to the potential field flight control benchmark, it improves the transmission rate by 8.3\%. Additionally, it reduces flight distance deviation from the prescribed corridor by 10\% compared to predetermined optimization methods.</description>

      <title>Securing Wi-Fi 6 Connection Establishment Against Relay and Spoofing Threats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless local area networks remain vulnerable to attacks initiated during the connection establishment (CE) phase. Current Wi-Fi security protocols fail to fully mitigate attacks like man-in-the-middle, preamble spoofing, and relaying. To fortify the CE phase, in this paper we design a backward-compatible scheme using a digital signature interwoven into the preambles at the physical (PHY) layer with time constraints to effectively counter those attacks. This approach slices a MAC-layer signature and embeds the slices within CE frame preambles without extending frame size, allowing one or multiple stations to concurrently verify their respective APs' transmissions. The concurrent CEs are supported by enabling the stations to analyze the consistent patterns of PHY-layer headers and identify whether the received frames are the anticipated ones from the expected APs, achieving 100% accuracy without needing to examine their MAC-layer headers. Additionally, we design and implement a fast relay attack to challenge our proposed defense and determine its effectiveness. We extend existing open-source tools to support IEEE 802.11ax to evaluate the effectiveness and practicality of our proposed scheme in a testbed consisting of USRPs, commercial APs, and Wi-Fi devices, and we show that our relay attack detection achieves 96-100% true positive rates. Finally, end-to-end formal security analyses confirm the security and correctness of the proposed solution.</description>

      <title>Stackelberg Game Based Performance Optimization in Digital Twin Assisted Federated Learning over NOMA Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the advantage of preserving data privacy, federated learning (FL) still suffers from the straggler issue due to the limited computing resources of distributed clients and the unreliable wireless communication environment. By effectively imitating the distributed resources, digital twin (DT) shows great potential in alleviating this issue. In this paper, we leverage DT in the FL framework over non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network to assist FL training process, considering malicious attacks on model updates from clients. A reputationbased client selection scheme is proposed, which accounts for client heterogeneity in multiple aspects and effectively mitigates the risks of poisoning attacks in FL systems. To minimize the total latency and energy consumption in the proposed system, we then formulate a Stackelberg game by considering clients and the server as the leader and the follower, respectively. Specifically, the leader aims to minimize the energy consumption while the objective of the follower is to minimize the total latency during FL training. The Stackelberg equilibrium is achieved to obtain the optimal solutions. We first derive the strategies for the followerlevel problem and include them in the leader-level problem which is then solved via problem decomposition. Simulation results verify the superior performance of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Denoising and Adaptive Online Vertical Federated Learning for Sequential Multi-Sensor Data in Industrial Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the continuous improvement in the computational capabilities of edge devices such as intelligent sensors in the Industrial Internet of Things, these sensors are no longer limited to mere data collection but are increasingly capable of performing complex computational tasks. This advancement provides both the motivation and the foundation for adopting distributed learning approaches. This study focuses on an industrial assembly line scenario where multiple sensors, distributed across various locations, sequentially collect real-time data characterized by distinct feature spaces. To leverage the computational potential of these sensors while addressing the challenges of communication overhead and privacy concerns inherent in centralized learning, we propose the Denoising and Adaptive Online Vertical Federated Learning (DAO-VFL) algorithm. Tailored to the industrial assembly line scenario, DAO-VFL effectively manages continuous data streams and adapts to shifting learning objectives. Furthermore, it can address critical challenges prevalent in industrial environment, such as communication noise and heterogeneity of sensor capabilities. To support the proposed algorithm, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, highlighting the effects of noise reduction and adaptive local iteration decisions on the regret bound. Experimental results on two real-world datasets further demonstrate the superior performance of DAO-VFL compared to benchmarks algorithms.</description>

      <title>Combined Hyper-Extensible Extremely-Secured Zero-Trust CIAM-PAM architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) systems play a pivotal role in securing enterprise infrastructures. However, the complexity of implementing these systems requires careful architectural planning to ensure positive Return on Investment (RoI) and avoid costly delays. The proliferation of Active Persistent cyber threats, coupled with advancements in AI, cloud computing, and geographically distributed customer populations, necessitates a paradigm shift towards adaptive and zero-trust security frameworks. This paper introduces the Combined Hyper-Extensible Extremely-Secured Zero-Trust (CHEZ) CIAM-PAM architecture, designed specifically for large-scale enterprises. The CHEZ PL CIAM-PAM framework addresses critical security gaps by integrating federated identity management (private and public identities), password-less authentication, adaptive multi-factor authentication (MFA), microservice-based PEP (Policy Entitlement Point), multi-layer RBAC (Role Based Access Control) and multi-level trust systems. This future-proof design also includes end-to-end data encryption, and seamless integration with state-of-the-art AI-based threat detection systems, while ensuring compliance with stringent regulatory standards.</description>
