      <title>Thermodynamic Geometric Constraint on the Spectrum of Markov Rate Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectrum of Markov generators encodes physical information beyond simple decay and oscillation, which reflects irreversibility and governs the structure of correlation functions. In this work, we prove an ellipse theorem that provides a universal thermodynamic geometric constraint on the spectrum of Markov rate matrices. The theorem states that all eigenvalues lie within a specific ellipse in the complex plane. In particular, the imaginary parts of the spectrum, which indicate oscillatory modes, are bounded by the maximum thermodynamic force associated with individual transitions. This spectral bound further constrains the possible values of correlation functions of two arbitrary observables. Finally, we compare our result with a previously proposed conjecture, which remains an open problem and warrants further investigation.</description>

      <title>Time arrow in open-boundary one-dimensional stochastic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the finite-timestep Brownian dynamics of a single particle confined in one dimension, with a nonuniform temperature profile. In such an open-boundary scenario, one cannot observe any net probability current in the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS). On the other hand, the nonequilibrium nature of this system is exhibited through the asymmetry in forward and backward transition probabilities, as is reported in this work through the stochastic simulation analysis and theoretical arguments. The irreversibility becomes prominent nearby the temperature interface. We propose that the observed irreversibility can be accounted for via a virtual-gyration scenario, while the collapse of virtual gyrations upon the one-dimensional coordinate leads to the absence of probability current.</description>

      <title>Rare Events, Many Searchers, and Fast Target Reaching in a Finite Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding a target in a complex environment is a fundamental challenge in nature, from chemical reactions to sperm reaching an egg. An effective strategy to reduce the time needed to reach a target is to deploy many searchers, increasing the likelihood that at least one will succeed by using the statistics of rare events. When the underlying stochastic process involves broadly distributed step sizes, rare long jumps dominate the dynamics, making the use of multiple searchers particularly powerful. We investigate the statistics of extreme events for the mean first passage time in a system of $N$ independent walkers moving with jumps distributed according to a power law, where target-reaching is governed by single, large fluctuations. We show that the mean first passage time of the fastest walker scales as $\langle \tau_N \rangle \sim 1/N$, representing a dramatic speed-up compared to classical Brownian search strategies. From this, we derive a scaling law relating the number of walkers required to reach a target within a given time to the size $X$ of the search region. As an application, we model biological fertilization, predicting how the optimal number of spermatozoa scales with uterus size across species. Our predictions match empirical data, suggesting that evolution may have exploited rare-event dynamics and broadly distributed motion to optimize reproductive success. This theory applies broadly to any population of searchers operating within a region of size $X$, providing a universal framework for efficient search in disordered or high-dimensional environments.</description>

      <title>Intermediate Interaction Strategies for Collective Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From bird flocks and fish schools to migrating cell sheets, collective motion is a ubiquitous biological phenomenon that inspires quantitative modeling through self-propelled particle (SPP) frameworks. Conventional SPP models prescribe either distance-based (metric) or rank-based (topological) interactions; however, empirical studies indicate that real groups may blend both types of interaction. Motivated by this graded perception, we introduce a new three-dimensional SPP model in which metric and topological alignments act simultaneously and are weighted by a single tunable mixing parameter called the interaction parameter. Large-scale simulations spanning a wide ranges of interaction parameters and densities revealed rich dynamics. Even when the global order parameter is low, cluster-level analysis with HDBSCAN shows that particles self-organize into several spatially distinct but internally well-aligned sub-flocks, exposing a hidden layer of order. Most importantly, an intermediate balance in which metric and topological cues contribute almost equally maximizes the global order parameter and markedly improves robustness to density variations. Numerical experiments supported by linear stability analysis demonstrate that activating metric and topological interactions in concert bridges the traditional modeling dichotomy and furnishes a more adaptive and resilient framework for collective motion. Therefore, the proposed model therefore provides a versatile platform for exploring mixed-interaction effects in biological and engineered multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>The Origin of the Gauge Theories of Glassy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analytical model of a glass-forming system is formulated within the formalism analogous to gauge theory constructions in quantum field theory. This work explores the scope of the proposed approach and investigates the equilibrium behavior of the model under the mean-field approximation. The analysis reveals three possible equilibrium scenarios, only one of which exhibits strong glass-forming ability. Additionally, an upper limit for the initial temperature is identified, beyond which quenching into the glassy state becomes impossible.</description>

      <title>Emergent Distance from Mutual Information in the Critical 1D XXZ Spin Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility that spatial geometry may emerge from the entanglement structure of a quantum many-body system is a subject of fundamental interest. Here, we propose and numerically test a candidate distance metric in 1D, d_E, defined purely from quantum mutual information (I) via the relation d_E = K_0 / sqrt(I). Using large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we compute this emergent distance for the ground state of the 1D spin-1/2 XXZ chain, a canonical model system. Our simulations show that in the quantum critical phase at anisotropy $\Delta = 1.0$, the mutual information exhibits a power-law decay consistent with the emergence of a valid metric space. In stark contrast, within the gapped, antiferromagnetic phase ($\Delta = 2.0$), where mutual information decays exponentially, the emergent distance grows exponentially, a behavior inconsistent with the triangle inequality. These results provide numerical evidence that this information-theoretic definition can yield a well-behaved geometry in critical systems, offering a quantitative tool for probing quantum phases and motivating further analytical investigation into the foundations of emergent space.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph-Based Models of Random Chemical Reaction Networks: Conservation Laws, Connectivity, and Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random graph models have been instrumental in characterizing complex networks, but chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are better represented as hypergraphs. Traditional models of random CRNs often reduce CRNs to bipartite graphs, representing species and reactions as distinct nodes, or simpler derived graphs, which can obscure the relationship between the statistical properties of these representations and the physical characteristics of the CRN. We introduce a straightforward model for generating random CRNs that preserves their hypergraph structure as well as atomic composition, enabling the direct study of chemically relevant features. Notably, our approach distinguishes two notions of connectivity that are equivalent in graphs but differ fundamentally in hypergraphs. These notions exhibit percolation-like phase transitions, which we analyze in detail. The first type of connectivity has relevance to steady-state synthesis and transduction, determining the effective reactions an open CRN can perform at steady state. The second type is suitable to identify which species can be produced from a given initial set of species in a closed CRN. Our findings highlight the importance of hypergraph-based modeling for uncovering the complex behaviors of CRNs.</description>

      <title>Crossover in the Ordered Phase in the Non-Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg Regime of Spin Models with Long-Range Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous spin models with long-range interactions of the form $r^{-\sigma}$, where $r$ is the distance between two spins and $\sigma$ controls the decay of the interaction, exhibit enhanced order that competes with thermal disturbances, leading to a richer variety of phases and types of phase transitions. In-depth research in this area not only aids in comprehending the complex behaviors in theoretical models but also provides valuable insights into the diverse phase transitions observed in real materials. Here, we identify that the true long-range ordered phase encompasses distinct scaling regimes, which we term Enhance Long-Range Ordered (EnLRO) and Reduce Long-Range Ordered (ReLRO) regimes. In the one-dimensional XY model, the crossover from EnLRO to ReLRO regimes occurs around $\sigma \approx 1.575$, while in two dimensions, the crossover happens near $\sigma \approx 3.2$. Applying finite-size scaling analysis, we extract the critical exponents that characterize the order-to-disorder phase transitions in the EnLRO and ReLRO regimes, constructing comprehensive phase diagrams. The analysis is further extended to the 1D and 2D long-range Heisenberg models, where we find the EnLRO-ReLRO crossover at $\sigma \approx 1.575$ and $\sigma \approx 3.22$, respectively. The similar crossover points suggest that the distinction between EnLRO and ReLRO regimes is a generic feature in continuous spin models with long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Large Interconnected Thermodynamic Systems Nearly Minimize Entropy Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many have speculated whether nonequilibrium systems obey principles of maximum or minimum entropy production. In this work, we use stochastic thermodynamics to derive the condition for the minimum entropy production state (MEPS) for continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs), even far from equilibrium. We show that real nonequilibrium steady states (NESS) generally violate both the MINEP and MAXEP principles. However, through numerical sampling of large interconnected CTMCs, we find that as system size increases, the steady-state entropy production tends to converge toward the minimum. This suggests that large nonequilibrium systems may self-organize to make efficient use of thermodynamic resources, offering a nuanced perspective on the longstanding debate between MAXEP and MINEP.</description>

      <title>Statistics of stochastic entropy for recorded transitions between ENSO states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the transitions between established phases of the El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) by surveying the daily data of the Southern Oscillation Index from an entropic viewpoint using the framework of stochastic Statistical Physics. We evaluate the variation of entropy produced due to each recorded path of that index during each transition as well as taking only into consideration the beginning and the end of the change between phases and verified both integral fluctuation relations. The statistical results show that these entropy variations have not been extreme entropic events; only the transition between the strong $1999-2000$ La Ni\~na to the moderate $2002-2003$ El Ni\~no is at the edge of being so. With that, the present work opens a long and winding avenue of research over the application of stochastic Statistical Physics to Climate Dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmas and other systems with long-range interactions are commonly found in non-equilibrium steady states that are outside traditional Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics, but can be described using generalized statistical mechanics frameworks such as superstatistics, where steady states are treated as superpositions of canonical ensembles under a temperature distribution. In this work we solve the problem of inferring the possible steady states of a composite system $AB$ where subsystem $A$ is described by superstatistics and $E_{AB} = E_A + E_B$. Our result establishes a closure property of superstatistics, namely that $A$ is described by superstatistics if and only if $AB$ and $B$ are also superstatistical with the same temperature distribution. Some consequences of this result are discussed, such as the impossibility of local thermal equilibrium (LTE) for additive subsystems in non-canonical steady states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a regularized fluctuating lattice Boltzmann model (Reg-FLBM) for the D3Q27 lattice, which incorporates thermal fluctuations through Hermite-based projections to ensure compliance with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. By leveraging the recursive regularization framework, the model achieves thermodynamic consistency for both hydrodynamic and ghost modes. Compared to the conventional single-relaxation.time BGK-FLBM, the Reg-FLBM provides improved stability and a more accurate description of thermal fluctuations. The implementation is optimized for large-scale parallel simulations on GPU-accelerated architectures, enabling systematic investigation of fluctuation-driven phenomena in mesoscale and nanoscale fluid systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range interactions are ubiquitous in nature, where they are mediated by diffusive fields at the cellular scale or by visual cues for groups of animals. Short-range forces, which are paradigmatic in physics, can thus often be neglected when modeling the collective behaviors of biological systems induced by mediated interactions. However, when self-organization leads to the emergence of dense phases, we show that excluded-volume interactions play an important and versatile role. We consider assemblies of active particles that undergo either condensation or phase-separation due to motility regulation and show that short-range repulsive forces can induce opposite effects. When motility regulation triggers an absorbing phase transition, such as a chemotactic collapse, repulsive forces opposes the formation of condensates and stabilize the coexistence between finite-density phases. In contrast, when motility regulation induces liquid-gas coexistence, repulsive forces can, counterintuitively, lead to a significant increase in the liquid density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain a form of the local thermodynamic equilibrium density operator which is invariant under pseudo-gauge transformations of the stress-energy and the spin tensors. This operator is an excellent candidate to describe the dynamics of a system which is assumed to achieve local equilibrium from a pseudo-gauge invariant quantum state, a situation which is believed to occur, for instance, in nuclear collisions at very high energy. As a consequence of pseudo-gauge invariance, the ambiguity affecting the predictions of mean values of observables from a local equilibrium state can be removed.</description>

      <title>Defects and their Time Scales in Quantum and Classical Annealing of the Two-Dimensional Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate defects in the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising ferromagnet on periodic $L\times L$ lattices after quantum annealing from high to vanishing field. With exact numerical solutions for $L \le 6$, we observe the expected critical Kibble-Zurek (KZ) time scale $\propto L^{z+1/\nu}$ (with $z=1$ and $1/\nu \approx 1.59$) at the quantum phase transition. We also observe KZ scaling of the ground-state fidelity at the end of the process. The excitations evolve by coarsening dynamics of confined defects, with a time scale $\propto L^2$, and interface fluctuations of system-spanning defects, with life time $\propto L^3$. We build on analogies with classical simulated annealing, where we characterize system-spanning defects in detail and find differences in the dynamic scales of domain walls with winding numbers $W=(1,0)/(0,1)$ (horizontal/vertical) and $W=(1,1)$ (diagonal). They decay on time scales $\propto L^3$ (which applies also to system-spanning domains in systems with open boundaries) and $\propto L^{3.4}$, respectively, when imposed in the ordered phase. As a consequence of $L^{3.4}$ exceeding the classical KZ scale $L^{z+1/\nu}=L^{3.17}$ the probability of $W=(1,1)$ domains in SA scales with the KZ exponent even in the final $T=0$ state. In QA, also the $W=(1,0)/(0,1)$ domains are controlled by the KZ time scale $L^{2.59}$. The $L^3$ scale can nevertheless be detected in the excited states, using a method that we develop that should also be applicable in QA experiments.</description>

      <title>Similarity networks of ordinal-pattern transitions classify falling paper trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Paper fragments in free fall constitute a simple yet paradigmatic mechanical system exhibiting remarkably complex motions. Despite a long history of investigation, this system has defied comprehensive first-principles modeling, motivating the development of phenomenological and experimental approaches to classify the free-fall dynamics of small paper fragments. Here we apply the Bandt-Pompe symbolization method to extract high-dimensional features corresponding to ordinal-pattern transitions (so-called ordinal networks) from observed area time series of video-recorded falling papers shaped as circles, squares, hexagons, and crosses. We then represent each trajectory as a node in a weighted similarity network, with edges encoding pairwise dynamical similarity, and identify motion classes via community detection. Our method automatically clusters trajectories into tumbling and chaotic falls in excellent agreement with expert visual classification. Notably, it outperforms previous approaches based on classical physical features derived from complete three-dimensional trajectories -- especially for cross-shaped papers -- and requires no prior specification of the number of motion classes. We further find that trajectories diverging from expert classifications occupy more central positions in the similarity network, suggesting more complex and ambiguous dynamic behavior.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov formulation of band theory for disordered non-Hermitian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Bloch band theory serves as a cornerstone for understanding intriguing non-Hermitian phenomena, such as the skin effect and extreme spectral sensitivity to boundary conditions. Yet this theory hinges on translational symmetry and thus breaks down in disordered systems. Here, we develop a real-space Lyapunov formulation of band theory that governs the spectra and eigenstates of disordered non-Hermitian systems. This framework yields universal non-Hermitian Thouless relations linking spectral density and localization to Lyapunov exponents under different boundary conditions. We further identify an exact topological criterion: skin modes and Anderson-localized modes correspond to nonzero and zero winding numbers, respectively, revealing the topological nature of the skin-Anderson transition. This transition is dictated by an essential Lyapunov exponent and gives rise to novel unidirectional critical states. Our formulation provides a unified and exact description of spectra and localization in generic one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems without translational symmetry, offering new insights into the interplay among non-Hermiticity, disorder, and topology.</description>

      <title>Effects of structural properties of neural networks on machine learning performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, graph-based machine learning techniques, such as reinforcement learning and graph neural networks, have garnered significant attention. While some recent studies have started to explore the relationship between the graph structure of neural networks and their predictive performance, they often limit themselves to a narrow range of model networks, particularly lacking mesoscale structures such as communities. Our work advances this area by conducting a more comprehensive investigation, incorporating realistic network structures characterized by heterogeneous degree distributions and community structures, which are typical characteristics of many real networks. These community structures offer a nuanced perspective on network architecture. Our analysis employs model networks such as random and scale-free networks, alongside a comparison with a biological neural network and its subsets for more detailed analysis. We examine the impact of these structural attributes on the performance of image classification tasks. Our findings reveal that structural properties do affect performance to some extent. Specifically, networks featuring coherent, densely interconnected communities demonstrate enhanced learning capabilities. The comparison with the biological neural network emphasizes the relevance of our findings to real-world structures, suggesting an intriguing connection worth further exploration. This study contributes meaningfully to network science and machine learning, providing insights that could inspire the design of more biologically informed neural networks.</description>

      <title>Testing APS conjecture on regular graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The maximum energy of the EPR model on a weighted graph is known to be upper-bounded by the sum of the total weight and the value of maximum-weight fractional matching~(MWFM). Recently, Apte, Parekh and Sud~(APS) conjecture that the bound could be strengthened by replacing MWFM with maximum weight matching~(MWM). Here we test this conjecture on a special class of regular graphs that Henning and Yeo constructed many years ago. On this class of regular graphs, MWMs achieve tight lower bounds. As for the maximum energy of the EPR model, we have recently devised a new algorithm called Fractional Entanglement Distribution~(FED) based on quasi-homogeneous fractional matchings, which could achieve rather high accuracy. Applying the FED algorithm to the EPR model on Henning-Yeo graphs, we could thus obtain energy as high as possible and matching value as low as possible, and then make high-precision tests of the APS conjecture. Nevertheless, our numerical results do not show any evidence that the APS conjecture could be violated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a thermodynamically consistent quantum master equation that satisfies locality for quadratic systems coupled to independent and identical baths at each site. We show that the quasi-local Redfield equation coincides exactly with the Davies equation, which satisfies the detailed-balance condition, due to cancellation of quantum coherence generated by each bath. This derivation does not rely on the secular approximation, which fails in systems with vanishing energy-level spacings. We discuss generalizations of our result to slowly driven quadratic systems and generic quantum many-body systems. Our result paves the way to a thermodynamically consistent description of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how a quantum many-body state is maintained stably as a nonequilibrium steady state is of fundamental and practical importance for exploration and exploitation of open quantum systems. We establish a general equivalent condition for an open quantum many-body system governed by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad dynamics under local drive and/or dissipation to have a quantum independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) steady state. We present a sufficient condition for a system to have a quantum i.i.d. steady state by identifying a set of operators that commute with arbitrary quantum i.i.d. states. In particular, a set of quantum i.i.d. states is found to be an invariant subset of time evolution superoperators for systems that satisfy the sufficient condition. These findings not only identify a class of models with exactly solvable steady states but also lead to a no-go theorem that precludes quantum entanglement and spatial correlations in a broad class of quantum many-body steady states in a dissipative environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks storing multiple discrete attractors are canonical models of biological memory. Previously, the dynamical stability of such networks could only be guaranteed under highly restrictive conditions. Here, we derive a theory of the local stability of discrete fixed points in a broad class of networks with graded neural activities and in the presence of noise. By directly analyzing the bulk and outliers of the Jacobian spectrum, we show that all fixed points are stable below a critical load that is distinct from the classical \textit{critical capacity} and depends on the statistics of neural activities in the fixed points as well as the single-neuron activation function. Our analysis highlights the computational benefits of threshold-linear activation and sparse-like patterns.</description>

      <title>Relaxation dynamics of a mobile impurity injected in a one-dimensional Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonequilibrium dynamics of a quantum impurity immersed with a finite velocity in a one-dimensional system of weakly interacting bosons is studied. We uncover and characterize different regimes of relaxation dynamics. We find that the final impurity velocity remains constant in a large interval of sufficiently big and realistic initial velocities. The underlying physical mechanism is the emission of the dispersive density shock waves that carry away the excess of the initial impurity momentum, while locally the system remains in the same stationary state. In contrast, a heavy impurity with the same coupling constant relaxes differently and the regime of constant final velocity disappears. Furthermore, a fast heavy impurity exhibits damped velocity oscillations in time before reaching a stationary state. This process is accompanied by the oscillations of the local depletion of the boson density around the impurity, until their positions coincide and they continue the motion together. Decreasing the impurity-boson coupling or increasing the strength of repulsion between bosons, the oscillations get amplified. In the case of a heavy impurity with the mass bigger than the critical one, the ground state energy as a function of momentum exhibits cusps and metastable branches. We show that they manifest themselves by a soliton emission, a considerable slowing down of the relaxation, and a change of the impurity direction of motion with respect to the initial one.</description>

      <title>Inference of time delay in stochastic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time delay is ubiquitous in many experimental and real-world situations. It is often unclear whether time delay plays a significant role in observed phenomena, and if it does, how long the time lag really is. This would be invaluable knowledge when analyzing and modeling such systems. Hitherto, no universal method is available by which the time delay can be inferred. To address this problem, we propose and demonstrate two different methods to infer time delay in overdamped Langevin systems with delayed feedback. In the first part, we focus on the power spectral density based on the positional data and use a characteristic signature of the time delay to infer the delay time. In limiting cases, we establish a direct relation of the observations made for nonlinear time-delayed feedback forces to analytical results obtained for the linear system. In other situations despite the absence of this direct relation, the characteristic signature remains and can be exploited by a semiautomatic method to infer the delay time. Furthermore, it may not always desirable or possible to observe a system for a long time to infer dependencies and parameters. Thus, in the second part, we propose for the first time a probing method combined with a neural network to infer the delay time, which requires only short observation time series. These proposed methods for inferring time delays in stochastic systems may prove to be valuable tools for gaining deeper insight into the role of delay across a wide range of applications -- from the behavior of individual colloidal particles under feedback control to emergent collective phenomena such as flocking and swarming.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hubbard model at $U\to\infty$ has recently been shown to have resonant valence bond (RVB) ground states on the corner-sharing sawtooth and pyrochlore lattices in the dilute doping limit of a single vacancy. In an effort to further generalize those results, I study how the ground state is modified when not all corners are shared between two tetrahedra as in the quasi-1D lattices of a pyrochlore stripe, and how to approach the problem in the case of finite doping. Using a non-Abelian version of the flux inequality, the tetrahedron chain is shown to have degenerate RVB-like ground states. The Bethe ansatz (BA) is adapted to solve the sawtooth chain with spinless or spin-polarized fermions and multiple holons, which is the first example of applying BA to a quasi-1D lattice.</description>

Abstract: Ferromagnetic exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are nonlinear exponential tilts of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi models, under which the presence of certain subgraphs such as triangles may be emphasized. These models are mixtures of metastable wells which each behave macroscopically like new Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi models themselves, exhibiting the same laws of large numbers for the overall edge count as well as all subgraph counts. However, the microscopic fluctuations of these quantities remained elusive for some time. Building on a recent breakthrough by Fang, Liu, Shao and Zhao [FLSZ24] driven by Stein's method, we prove quantitative central limit theorems (CLTs) for these quantities and more in metastable wells under ferromagnetic ERGMs. One main novelty of our results is that they apply also in the supercritical (low temperature) regime of parameters, which has previously been relatively unexplored. To accomplish this, we develop a novel probabilistic technique based on the careful analysis of the evolution of relevant quantities under the ERGM Glauber dynamics. Our technique allows us to deliver the main input to the method developed by [FLSZ24], which is the fact that the fluctuations of subgraph counts are driven by those of the overall edge count. This was first shown for the triangle count by Sambale and Sinulis [SS20] in the Dobrushin (very high temperature) regime via functional-analytic methods. We feel our technique clarifies the underlying mechanisms at play, and it also supplies improved bounds on the Wasserstein and Kolmogorov distances between the observables at hand and the limiting Gaussians, as compared to the results of [FLSZ24] in the subcritical (high temperature) regime beyond the Dobrushin regime. Moreover, our technique is flexible enough to also yield quantitative CLTs for vertex degrees and local subgraph counts, which have not appeared before in any parameter regime.</description>

Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Zakharov stationary states for weak wave turbulence involve solving a leading-order kinetic equation. Recent calculations of higher-order corrections to this kinetic equation using the Martin-Siggia-Rose path integral are reconsidered in terms of stationary states of a Fokker-Planck Hamiltonian. A non-perturbative relation closely related to the quantum mechanical Ehrenfest theorem is introduced and used to express the kinetic equation in terms of divergences of two-point expectation values in the limit of zero dissipation. Similar equations are associated to divergences in higher-order cumulants. It is additionally shown that the ordinary thermal equilibrium state is not actually a stationary state of the Fokker-Planck Hamiltonian, and a non-linear modification of dissipation is considered to remedy this.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10283v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the relaxation of a Brownian particle with long range memory under confinement in one dimension. The particle diffuses in an arbitrary confining potential and resets at random times to previously visited positions, chosen with a probability proportional to the local time spent there by the particle since the initial time. This model mimics an animal which moves erratically in its home range and returns preferentially to familiar places from time to time, as observed in nature. The steady state density of the position is given by the equilibrium Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution, as in standard diffusion, while the transient part of the density can be obtained through a mapping of the Fokker-Planck equation of the process to a Schr\"odinger eigenvalue problem. Due to memory, the approach at late times toward the steady state is critically self-organised, in the sense that it always follows a sluggish power-law form, in contrast to the exponential decay that characterises Markov processes. The exponent of this power-law depends in a simple way on the resetting rate and on the leading relaxation rate of the Brownian particle in the absence of resetting. We apply these findings to several exactly solvable examples, such as the harmonic, V-shaped and box potentials.</description>

Abstract: We say of an isolated macroscopic quantum system in a pure state $\psi$ that it is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium (MATE) if $\psi$ lies in or close to a suitable subspace $\mathcal{H}_{eq}$ of Hilbert space. It is known that every initial state $\psi_0$ will eventually reach and stay there most of the time (``thermalize'') if the Hamiltonian is non-degenerate and satisfies the appropriate version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., that every eigenvector is in MATE. Tasaki recently proved the ETH for a certain perturbation $H_\theta^{fF}$ of the Hamiltonian $H_0^{fF}$ of $N\gg 1$ free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice. The perturbation is needed to remove the high degeneracies of $H_0^{fF}$. Here, we first point out that also for degenerate Hamiltonians all $\psi_0$ thermalize if the ETH holds, i.e., if every eigenbasis lies in MATE, and we prove that this is the case for $H_0^{fF}$. Inspired by the fact that there is one eigenbasis of $H_0^{fF}$ for which MATE can be proved more easily than for the others, with smaller error bounds, and also in higher spatial dimensions, we show for any given $H_0$ that the existence of one eigenbasis in MATE implies quite generally that most eigenbases of $H_0$ lie in MATE. We also show that, as a consequence, after adding a small generic perturbation, $H=H_0+\lambda V$ with $\lambda\ll 1$, for most perturbations $V$ the perturbed Hamiltonian $H$ satisfies ETH and all states thermalize.</description>

      <title>Quick design of feasible tensor networks for constrained combinatorial optimization</title>

Abstract: Quantum computers are expected to enable fast solving of large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. However, their limitations in fidelity and the number of qubits prevent them from handling real-world problems. Recently, a quantum-inspired solver using tensor networks has been proposed, which works on classical computers. Particularly, tensor networks have been applied to constrained combinatorial optimization problems for practical applications. By preparing a specific tensor network to sample states that satisfy constraints, feasible solutions can be searched for without the method of penalty functions. Previous studies have been based on profound physics, such as U(1) gauge schemes and high-dimensional lattice models. In this study, we devise to design feasible tensor networks using elementary mathematics without such a specific knowledge. One approach is to construct tensor networks with nilpotent-matrix manipulation. The second is to algebraically determine tensor parameters. We showed mathematically that such feasible tensor networks can be constructed to accommodate various types of constraints. For the principle verification, we numerically constructed a feasible tensor network for facility location problem, to find much faster construction than conventional methods. Then, by performing imaginary time evolution, feasible solutions were always obtained, ultimately leading to the optimal solution.</description>

      <title>Critical Dynamics of Spin Boson Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the low-energy properties of the spin-boson model (SBM), which describes the dynamics of a 1/2 spin associated with a thermostat characterized by a power law spectral density, $f(\omega)\propto \omega^s$. The theoretical description is constructed in the Schwinger--Keldysh technique, based on the representation of the 1/2-spin by Majorana spinors. We study the critical dynamics of the system near the quantum phase transition by constructing and analyzing the system of renormalization group equations. Our theoretical approach is more universal, contrary to the one based on quantum-classical mapping, since it is applicable for $s\leq 1$. We show that in both the ohmic case $s=1$, and the weakly subohmic case $s\lesssim 1$, the second order quantum phase transition is observed in the model considered, and the critical magnetization exponent agrees with the exact hyperscaling result, $1/\delta=(1-s)/(1+s)$. Furthermore, we obtain the dependence of the critical value of the spin-boson coupling constant on the temperature of the ohmic bosonic thermal bath.</description>

      <title>Energy diffusion in the long-range interacting spin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate energy diffusion in long-range interacting spin systems, where the interaction decays algebraically as $V(r) \propto r^{-\alpha}$ with the distance $r$ between the sites. We consider prototypical spin systems, the transverse Ising model, and the XYZ model in the $D$-dimensional lattice with finite $\alpha &gt;D$ which guarantees the thermodynamic extensivity. In one dimension, both normal and anomalous diffusion are observed, where the anomalous diffusion is attributed to anomalous enhancement of the amplitude of the equilibrium current correlation. We prove the power-law clustering property of arbitrary orders of joint cumulants in general dimensions. Applying this theorem to equal-time current correlations, we further prove several theorems leading to the statement that the sufficient condition for normal diffusion in one dimension is $\alpha &gt; 3/2$ regardless of the models. The fluctuating hydrodynamics approach consistently explains L\'{e}vy diffusion for $\alpha &lt; 3/2$, which implies the condition is optimal. In higher dimensions of $D \geq 2$, normal diffusion is indicated as long as $\alpha &gt; D$.</description>

      <title>Scaling and Universality at Noisy Quench Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14355v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) have been studied in the extended XY model under both noiseless and noisy linear driven staggered field cases. In the time-independent staggered field case, the model exhibits a single critical point where the transition occurs from the spin-liquid phase to the antiferromagnetic phase. In the noiseless ramp case, unlike the transverse field XY model where DQPT always occurs for a quench crossing the single critical point, there is a critical sweep velocity above which the kinks corresponding to a DQPT are completely removed. Furthermore, in this case there are only two critical modes whose excitation probability is one-half. In the presence of a Gaussian white noise, we find that this critical sweep velocity decreases by increasing the noise strength, and scales linearly with the square of the noise intensity. A surprising result occurs when the noise intensity and sweep velocity are about the same order of magnitude, the number of critical modes is significantly increased, signalling a region with multiple critical modes. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the scaling of the dynamical free energy near the DQPTs time is the same for both noiseless and noisy ramp quenches.</description>

      <title>A Rigorous Foundation for Stochastic Thermodynamics via the Microcanonical Ensemble</title>

Abstract: We consider a small Hamiltonian system strongly interacting with a much larger Hamiltonian system (the bath), while being driven by both a time-dependent control parameter and non-conservative forces. The joint system is assumed to be thermally isolated. Under the assumption of time-scale separation (TSS)--where the bath equilibrates much faster than the system and the external driving--the bath remains in instantaneous equilibrium, described by the microcanonical ensemble conditioned on the system state and the control parameter. We identify a decomposition of the total Hamiltonian that renders the bath energy an adiabatic invariant under slow evolution. This same decomposition defines the system Hamiltonian as the Hamiltonian of mean force, and ensures that neither the system nor the control parameter does reactive work on the bath. Using time-reversal symmetry and TSS, and without invoking any model details, we rigorously prove that the reduced dynamics of the system is Markovian and satisfies a form of local detailed balance (LDB) which involves transition probabilities but not path probabilities. By working entirely within the microcanonical framework and adopting a precise decomposition of the total energy, we provide rigorous definitions of bath entropy as the Boltzmann entropy, and of heat as the negative change of the bath energy. Our approach bypasses the ambiguities associated with conventional definitions of thermodynamic variables and path probabilities, and establishes a rigorous and thermodynamically consistent foundation for stochastic thermodynamics, valid even under strong system-bath coupling.</description>

      <title>Scaling, Fractal Dynamics and Critical Exponents: Application in a non-integer dimensional Ising model</title>

Abstract: Moving beyond simple associations, researchers need tools to quantify how variables influence each other in space and time. Correlation functions provide a mathematical framework for characterizing these essential dependencies, revealing insights into causality, structure, and hidden patterns within complex systems. In physical systems with many degrees of freedom, such as gases, liquids, and solids, a statistical analysis of these correlations is essential. For a field $\Psi(\vec{x},t)$ that depends on spatial position $\vec{x}$ and time $t$, it is often necessary to understand the correlation with itself at another position and time $\Psi(\vec{x}_0,t_0)$. This specific function is called the autocorrelation function. In this context, the autocorrelation function for order--parameter fluctuations, introduced by Fisher, provides an important mathematical framework for understanding the second-order phase transition at equilibrium. However, his analysis is restricted to a Euclidean space of dimension $d$, and an exponent $\eta$ is introduced to correct the spatial behavior of the correlation function at $T=T_c$. In recent work, Lima et al demonstrated that at $T_c$ a fractal analysis is necessary for a complete description of the correlation function. In this study, we investigate the fundamental physics and mathematics underlying phase transitions. In particular, we show that the application of modern fractional differentials allows us to write down an equation for the correlation function that recovers the correct exponents below the upper critical dimension. We obtain the exact expression for the Fisher exponent $\eta$. Furthermore, we examine the Rushbrooke scaling relation, which has been questioned in certain magnetic systems, and, drawing on results from the Ising model, we confirm that both our relations and the Rushbrooke scaling law hold even when $d$ is not an integer.</description>

      <title>Ultra-delayed material failure via shear banding after straining an amorphous material</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We predict a phenomenon of catastrophic material failure arising suddenly within an amorphous material, with an extremely long delay time since the material was last deformed. By simulating a mesoscopic soft glassy rheology model in one dimension (1D), a mesoscopic elastoplastic model in 1D and 2D, and a continuum fluidity model in 1D, we demonstrate the basic physics to involve a dramatic ultra-delayed shear banding instability, in which strain suddenly strongly localises within the material and the stress drops precipitously. The delay time after the long historical shear strain was applied before failure occurs increases steeply with decreasing strain amplitude, decreasing working temperature, and increasing sample annealing prior to shear. In demonstrating the same physics -- which is directly testable experimentally and in particle simulations -- to obtain within three different constitutive models, we suggest it may be generic across amorphous materials. The counter-intuitive prediction of catastrophic material failure long after any deformation was last applied could have important consequences for material processing and performance.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum complexity via universal saturation of stabilizer entropies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04190v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonstabilizerness or `magic' is a key resource for quantum computing and a necessary condition for quantum advantage. Non-Clifford operations turn stabilizer states into resourceful states, where the amount of nonstabilizerness is quantified by resource measures such as stabilizer R\'enyi entropies (SREs). Here, we show that SREs saturate their maximum value at a critical number of non-Clifford operations. Close to the critical point SREs show universal behavior. Remarkably, the derivative of the SRE crosses at the same point independent of the number of qubits and can be rescaled onto a single curve. We find that the critical point depends non-trivially on R\'enyi index $\alpha$. For random Clifford circuits doped with T-gates, the critical T-gate density scales independently of $\alpha$. In contrast, for random Hamiltonian evolution, the critical time scales linearly with qubit number for $\alpha&gt;1$, while is a constant for $\alpha&lt;1$. This highlights that $\alpha$-SREs reveal fundamentally different aspects of nonstabilizerness depending on $\alpha$: $\alpha$-SREs with $\alpha&lt;1$ relate to Clifford simulation complexity, while $\alpha&gt;1$ probe the distance to the closest stabilizer state and approximate state certification cost via Pauli measurements. As technical contributions, we observe that the Pauli spectrum of random evolution can be approximated by two highly concentrated peaks which allows us to compute its SRE. Further, we introduce a class of random evolution that can be expressed as random Clifford circuits and rotations, where we provide its exact SRE. Our results opens up new approaches to characterize the complexity of quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Homogeneous nucleation, a textbook transition path for phase transitions, is typically understood on thermodynamic grounds through the prism of classical nucleation theory. However, recent studies have suggested the applicability of classical nucleation theory to systems far from equilibrium. In this Article, we formulate a purely mechanical perspective of homogeneous nucleation and growth, elucidating the criteria for the properties of a critical nucleus without appealing to equilibrium notions. Applying this theory to active fluids undergoing motility-induced phase separation, we find that nucleation proceeds in a qualitatively similar fashion to equilibrium systems, with concepts such as the Gibbs-Thomson effect and nucleation barriers remaining valid. We further demonstrate that the recovery of such concepts allows us to extend classical theories of nucleation rates and coarsening dynamics to active systems upon using the mechanically-derived definitions of the nucleation barrier and surface tensions. Three distinct surface tensions -- the mechanical, capillary, and Ostwald tensions -- play a central role in our theory. While these three surface tensions are identical in equilibrium, our work highlights the distinctive role of each tension in the stability of active interfaces and the nucleation and growth of motility-induced phases.</description>

      <title>A Counterdiabatic Route to Entanglement Steering and Dynamical Freezing in the Floquet Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling the dynamics of quantum many-body systems is crucial for developing quantum technologies. This work demonstrates that counter-diabatic (CD) driving provides a powerful tool for steering collective spin systems along entangled trajectories for a long time. In particular, CD driving leads to approximate stroboscopic freezing and eternal entanglement oscillations for a large class of initial states in the periodically driven Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. Intriguingly, CD driving generates spin squeezing and its associated metrologically useful multipartite entanglement at the mid-point of every drive cycle, when the system is initially prepared in a fully x-polarized state. The CD driving induced non-ergodic dynamics is accompanied by a decrease in the average eigenstate entanglement and inverse participation ratio, thereby signalling greater eigenstate localization. Our work opens a new route to evade Floquet heating and control entanglement generation in collective spin systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the ensemble of states generated by performing projective measurements on the output of a random matchgate (or free-fermionic) quantum circuit. We rigorously show that this `projected ensemble' exhibits deep thermalization: For large system sizes, it converges towards a universal ensemble that is uniform over the manifold of Gaussian fermionic states. As well as proving moment-wise convergence of these ensembles, we demonstrate that the full distribution of any physical observable in the projected ensemble is close to its universal form in Wasserstein-1 distance, which we argue is an appropriate and efficiently computable measure of convergence when studying deep thermalization. Using this metric, we also numerically find that local matchgate circuits deeply thermalize after a timescale $t \sim L^2$ set by the diffusive spreading of quantum information. Our work opens up new avenues to experimentally accessible protocols to probe the emergence of quantum statistical mechanics and benchmark quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Soft gravitons as Goldstone modes of spontaneously broken asymptotic symmetries in de Sitter spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I demonstrate that soft graviton modes in de Sitter spacetimes are the Goldstone modes of the spontaneously broken asymptotic symmetry group of de Sitter space. I then show that any local measurement, including the effects of the environment, will collapse the symmetric state onto the broken state in the large volume limit. In any discussion involving observers, de Sitter spacetimes are, therefore, best described globally by the broken phase, while local observers, in the small volume limit, can not discriminate between different degenerate global vacuum states and are therefore best described by the symmetric state. As a consequence, a small Hubbled-sized local region initially in the symmetric state will, after a time-scale corresponding to the Page time of de Sitter space, have expanded to a large region in the broken state. This illuminates the physical nature of soft graviton modes in de Sitter spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: Kramers escape from a metastable state in the presence of both thermal and quantum fluctuations under strong damping is treated as a thermally activated process in a quantum modified semiclassical potential. Dirac's time-dependent variational method together with the Jackiw-Kerman function is employed to derive the semiclassical potential. Quantum correction is incorporated in the drift potential, and is determined by quasi-stationary conditions and minimal uncertainty relation. The semiclassical rate obtained here is consistent in form with those from the quantum Smoluchowski equations deduced heuristically by modifying the diffusion coefficient using the path-integral method. Unlike approaches using the path-integral, which involves continuation into imaginary time, the approach here is simpler and more easily understood in terms of classical picture.</description>

      <title>Elasticity of a Freely Jointed Chain with Quenched Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14817v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simple theoretical model, the Freely Jointed Chain with quenched hinges (qFJC), which captures the quenched disorder in the local bending stiffness of the polymer. In this article, we analyze the tensile elasticity of the qFJC in the Gibbs (fixed-force) ensemble. For finite-size systems, we obtain a recurrence relation of the exact free energy, which allows us to calculate the exact force-extension relation numerically for an arbitrary size of the system. In the thermodynamic limit, when $L({\rm contour \;length})\gg L_p({\rm persistence \;length})$, we obtain a framework to deal with quenched disorder in the polymer configuration. This allows us to obtain the response function for the discrete and continuous qFJC in the thermodynamic limit. It turns out that the extension of the continuous qFJC can be cast in a simple form. Furthermore, we have applied our analysis to rod-coil multiblock copolymers.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coherence of Topologically Frustrated Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of entanglement and magic properties in topologically frustrated systems suggests that, in the thermodynamic limit, these quantities decompose into two distinct contributions. One is determined by the specific nature of the model and its Hamiltonian, and another arises from topological frustration itself, resulting in being independent of the Hamiltonian's parameters. In this work, we test the generality of this picture by investigating an additional quantum resource, namely quantum coherence, in two different models where topological frustration is induced through an appropriate choice of boundary conditions. Our findings reveal a perfect analogy between the behavior of quantum coherence and that of other quantum resources, particularly magic, providing further evidence in support of the universality of this picture and the topological nature of this source of frustration.</description>

      <title>Maximum entropy for dynamic processes on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic processes on networks are fundamental to understanding modern-day phenomena such as information diffusion and opinion polarization on the internet or epidemics spreading through society. However, such processes are notoriously difficult to study broadly as small changes in initial conditions, the process, or the network can lead to very different evolution trajectories. Here we apply the information-theoretic framework of maximum caliber to study the statistics of such systems analytically, focusing on processes that can be interpreted as driven by interactions between populations of different types of individuals in the network. We verify the dynamics deduced from maximum caliber by using simulations of different processes on different networks, introduce an approximation of the dynamics that significantly simplifies the problem, and show that the approximation can be used to recover well-established models of population dynamics that are typically not thought of as taking place on networks.</description>

      <title>Impact of Clifford operations on non-stabilizing power and quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness, alongside entanglement, is a crucial ingredient for fault-tolerant quantum computation and achieving a genuine quantum advantage. Despite recent progress, a complete understanding of the generation and thermalization of non-stabilizerness in circuits that mix Clifford and non-Clifford operations remains elusive. While Clifford operations do not generate non-stabilizerness, their interplay with non-Clifford gates can strongly impact the overall non-stabilizing dynamics of generic quantum circuits. In this work, we establish a direct relationship between the final non-stabilizing power and the individual powers of the non-Clifford gates, in circuits where these gates are interspersed with random Clifford operations. By leveraging this result, we unveil the thermalization of non-stabilizing power to its Haar-averaged value in generic circuits. As a precursor, we analyze two-qubit gates and illustrate this thermalization in analytically tractable systems. Extending this, we explore the operator-space non-stabilizing power and demonstrate its behavior in physical models. Finally, we examine the role of non-stabilizing power in the emergence of quantum chaos in brick-wall quantum circuits. Our work elucidates how non-stabilizing dynamics evolve and thermalize in quantum circuits and thus contributes to a better understanding of quantum computational resources and of their role in quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Quantum Complexity and Chaos in Many-Qudit Doped Clifford Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of quantum complexity and chaos in doped Clifford circuits acting on qudits of odd prime dimension $d$. Using doped Clifford Weingarten calculus and a replica tensor network formalism, we derive exact results and perform large-scale simulations in regimes challenging for tensor network and Pauli-based methods. We begin by analyzing generalized stabilizer entropies, computable magic monotones in many-qudit systems, and identify a dynamical phase transition in the doping rate, marking the breakdown of classical simulability and the onset of Haar-random behavior. The critical behavior is governed by the qudit dimension and the magic content of the non-Clifford gate. Using the qudit $T$-gate as a benchmark, we show that higher-dimensional qudits converge faster to Haar-typical stabilizer entropies. For qutrits ($d=3$), analytical predictions match numerics on brickwork circuits, showing that locality plays a limited role in magic spreading. We also examine anticoncentration and entanglement growth, showing that $O(\log N)$ non-Clifford gates suffice for approximating Haar expectation values to precision $\varepsilon$, and relate antiflatness measures to stabilizer entropies in qutrit systems. Finally, we analyze out-of-time-order correlators and show that a finite density of non-Clifford gates is needed to induce chaos, with a sharp transition fixed by the local dimension, twice that of the magic transition. Altogether, these results establish a unified framework for diagnosing complexity in doped Clifford circuits and deepen our understanding of resource theories in multiqudit systems.</description>

      <title>Coupled Entropy: A Goldilocks Generalization for Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evidence is presented that the accuracy of Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics framework is improved using the coupled entropy, which carefully establishes the physical measures of complex systems. While Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics (NSM) has developed into a powerful toolset, questions have persisted as to how to evaluate whether its proposed solutions properly characterize the uncertainty of heavy-tailed distributions. The entropy of the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) is $1+\kappa+\ln\sigma$, where $\kappa$ is the shape or nonlinear coupling and $\sigma$ is the scale. A generalized entropy should retain the uncertainty due to the scale, while minimizing the dependence of the nonlinear coupling. The Tsallis entropy of the GPD instead subtracts a function of the inverse-scale and converges to one as $\kappa\rightarrow\infty$. Colloquially, the Tsallis entropy is too cold. The normalized Tsallis entropy (NTE) rectifies the positive dependence on the scale but introduces a nonlinear term multiplying the scale and the coupling, making it too hot. The coupled entropy measures the uncertainty of the GPD to be $1+\ln_\frac{\kappa}{1+\kappa}\sigma=1+\frac{1+\kappa}{\kappa}(\sigma^\frac{\kappa}{1+\kappa}-1)$, which converges to $\sigma$ as $\kappa\rightarrow\infty$. One could say, the coupled entropy allows scientists, engineers, and analysts to eat their porridge, confident that its measure of uncertainty reflects the mathematical physics of the scale of non-exponential distributions while minimizing the dependence on the shape or nonlinear coupling. The training of the coupled variational autoencoder is an example of the unique ability of the coupled entropy to improve the performance of complex systems.</description>
