      <title>Flexible Asymmetrically Transparent Conductive Electrode based on Photonic Nanojet Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible transparent electrodes, encompassing the combination of optical transparency and electrical conductivity, empower numerous optoelectronic applications. While the main efforts nowadays concentrate on developing wire meshes and conductive oxides, those technologies are still in a quest to find a balance between price, performance, and versatility. Here we propose a new platform, encompassing the advantages of nanophotonic design and roll-to-roll large-scale lithography fabrication tools, granting an ultimate balance between optical, electrical, and mechanical properties. The design is based on an array of silica microspheres deposited on a patterned thin aluminum film attached to a flexible polymer matrix. Microspheres are designed to squeeze 80% light through nanoscale apertures with the aid of the photonic nanojet effect given the light impinges the structure from the top. The photonic structure blocks the transmission for the backpropagation direction thus granting the device with the high 5-fold level of asymmetry. The patterned layer demonstrates a remarkable 2.8 {\Omega}/sq sheet resistance comparable to that of a continuous metal layer. The high conductivity is shown to be maintained after a repeatable application of strain on the flexible electrode. The technical specifications of the demonstrated transparent electrode establish it as a viable option for integrating into advanced optoelectronic devices such as solar cells, touchscreens, and organic light-emitting diodes to name a few. Its notable capacity to optimize light transmittance while ensuring consistent electrical performance, alongside its mechanical flexibility, makes the demonstrated device an essential component for applications, where such attributes are critically required.</description>

      <title>sCWatter: Open source coupled wave scattering simulation for spectroscopy and microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several emerging microscopy imaging methods rely on complex interactions between the incident light and the sample. These include interferometry, spectroscopy, and nonlinear optics. Reconstructing a sample from the measured scattered field relies on fast and accurate optical models. Fast approaches like ray tracing and the Born approximation have limitations that are limited when working with high numerical apertures. This paper presents sCWatter, an open-source tool that utilizes coupled wave theory (CWT) to simulate and visualize the 3D electric field scattered by complex samples. The sample refractive index is specified on a volumetric grid, while the incident field is provided as a 2D image orthogonal to the optical path. We introduce connection equations between layers that significantly reduce the dimensionality of the CW linear system, enabling efficient parallel processing on consumer hardware. Further optimizations using Intel MKL and CUDA significantly accelerate both field simulation and visualization.</description>

      <title>Rigorous analysis of optical forces in dielectric structures based on the Minkowski-Helmholtz formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical forces in dielectric structures are typically analyzed by utilizing either the Maxwell stress tensor or energy-based methods from which they can be derived by means of the eigenfrequencies and the effective refractive indices involved. While the equivalence of these two methods has been discussed in several studies, it would seem that a general electrodynamic proof of this aspect is still lacking. In this work, we provide a rigorous electrodynamic derivation based on the Minkowski-Helmholtz formula and the electromagnetic variation theorem, from which one can directly conclude that under Hermitian conditions these two approaches are formally equivalent to each other. The results of our study universally apply to any dielectric waveguide or cavity configuration. In addition, this methodology can be employed in graded index systems that do not exhibit sharp interfaces. Importantly, our analysis offers a straightforward route for predicting optical forces in a variety of photonic arrangements, including dielectric scatterers and multielement array configurations.</description>

      <title>Nature of Optical Thermodynamic Pressure Exerted in Highly Multimoded Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of optical thermodynamics provides a comprehensive framework that enables a self-consistent description of the intricate dynamics of nonlinear multimoded photonic systems. This theory, among others, predicts a pressure-like intensive quantity ($\hat{p}$) that is conjugate to the system's total number of modes ($M$) - its corresponding extensive variable. Yet at this point, the nature of this intensive quantity is still nebulous. In this Letter, we elucidate the physical origin of the optical thermodynamic pressure and demonstrate its dual essence. In this context, we rigorously derive an expression that splits $\hat{p}$ into two distinct components, a term that is explicitly tied to the electrodynamic radiation pressure and a second entropic part that is responsible for the entropy change. We utilize this result to establish a formalism that simplifies the quantification of radiation pressure under nonlinear equilibrium conditions, thus eliminating the need for a tedious evaluation of the Maxwell stress tensor. Our theoretical analysis is corroborated by numerical simulations carried out in highly multimoded nonlinear optical structures. These results may provide a novel way in predicting and controlling radiation pressure processes in a variety of nonlinear electromagnetic settings.</description>

      <title>High-power even- and odd mode emission from linear arrays of resonant-tunneling-diode (RTD) oscillators in the 0.4- to 0.8-THz frequency range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant tunneling diode (RTD) oscillators possess the highest oscillation frequency among all electronic THz emitters. However, the emitted power from RTDs remains limited. Here, we propose linear RTD-oscillator arrays capable of supporting coherent emission from both odd and even coupled modes. Both modes exhibit constructive interference in the far field, enabling high power emission. Experimental demonstrations of coherent emission from 11-RTD-oscillator linear arrays are presented. The odd mode oscillates at approximately 450 GHz, emitting about 0.5 mW, while the even mode oscillates at around 750 GHz, emitting about 1 mW. Moreover, certain RTD-oscillator arrays demonstrate dual-band oscillation under different biases, allowing for controllable switching between two coupled modes. In addition, during bias sweeping in both directions, a notable hysteresis feature is observed in the switching bias for the odd and even modes. Our linear RTD-oscillator array represents a significant step forward in the realization of high-power large RTD-oscillator arrays and enables large-scale applications of RTD devices.</description>

      <title>Waveguide Tailored Radiation Pattern of Nanoparticles for Tunable Multimodal Guided Surface Lattice Resonances in Asymmetric Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface lattice resonances (SLR) in metasurfaces is promising in applications of sub-wavelength devices, with high quality factors (high-Q), large local field enhancement and long-range interaction properties. Tunable peak position and multimodal resonances make SLR further appealing to flexible and multiple light-matter interactions. However, reported multimodal SLRs lack flexible and economic tunability. Moreover, current high-Q SLR requires a homogeneous index of operational environment, which hampered potential applications such as biosensors that are usually operated in aqueous or air environment. Here we report a guided-SLR (gSLR) that is easily accessible in index-discontinuous environment along with multimodal property and active tunability of resonating wavelength, mode number and mode coupling strength. The gSLR is realized via coupling scattered light from metasurfaces units into a slab waveguide, which opens up a light propagating channel in the lattice plane in index-asymmetric environment. Tailoring radiation pattern of each units with guided transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes, multimodal resonances of both orthogonal and parallel coupling directions are accomplished. Mode number and mode frequency positions can be easily adjusted by waveguide configuration, while mode strength is tuned by vertical position in the slab. The easy-to-access, actively tunable and multimodal gSLR in inhomogeneous medium will promote the realization of ultrathin and ultracompact nano-optical and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Bi-chromatic paraxial beam as a model of spatio-temporal light fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical fields with rich and well-developed spatio-temporal structure, including ultra-short structured light pulses, are essentially non-monochromatic and contain a continuous spectrum of monochromatic constituents. However, some substantial features of such fields and physical mechanisms determining their behavior can be understood based on simplified models including only two monochromatic paraxial components. We consider examples of such model beams, their specific spatial and temporal properties as well as their descriptive abilities for the meaningful characterization of realistic spatio-temporal light fields. In particular, the proposed model enables an explicit consistent analysis of the photon-probability distributions in non-monochromatic fields, which confirms a high degree of coincidence between the "energy center" and "probability center" of the field. Simultaneously, particular features of the two-component bi-chromatic paraxial fields (periodic and rotational character of the longitudinal and temporal evolution, specific deformations of the propagating-beam transverse intensity profile, etc.) are inspected using numerical examples.</description>

      <title>1-bit Quantized On-chip Hybrid Diffraction Neural Network Enabled by Authentic All-optical Fully-connected Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical Diffraction Neural Networks (DNNs), a subset of Optical Neural Networks (ONNs), show promise in mirroring the prowess of electronic networks. This study introduces the Hybrid Diffraction Neural Network (HDNN), a novel architecture that incorporates matrix multiplication into DNNs, synergizing the benefits of conventional ONNs with those of DNNs to surmount the modulation limitations inherent in optical diffraction neural networks. Utilizing a singular phase modulation layer and an amplitude modulation layer, the trained neural network demonstrated remarkable accuracies of 96.39% and 89% in digit recognition tasks in simulation and experiment, respectively. Additionally, we develop the Binning Design (BD) method, which effectively mitigates the constraints imposed by sampling intervals on diffraction units, substantially streamlining experimental procedures. Furthermore, we propose an on-chip HDNN that not only employs a beam-splitting phase modulation layer for enhanced integration level but also significantly relaxes device fabrication requirements, replacing metasurfaces with relief surfaces designed by 1-bit quantization. Besides, we conceptualized an all-optical HDNN-assisted lesion detection network, achieving detection outcomes that were 100% aligned with simulation predictions. This work not only advances the performance of DNNs but also streamlines the path towards industrial optical neural network production.</description>

      <title>Optical cavity characterization with a mode-matched heterodyne sensing scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a technique for measuring the complex reflectivity of an optical cavity with a resonant local oscillator laser and an auxiliary probe laser, each coupled via opposite ends of the cavity. A heterodyne sensing scheme is then used to observe the phase and amplitude of the interference beat-note between the promptly reflected field and the cavity transmitted field injected through the far mirror. Since the local oscillator laser must pass through the cavity before interfering with the probe laser these measurements are not only independent of the spatial coupling of either laser to the cavity, but also obtained at the in-situ position of the cavity Eigenmode. This technique was demonstrated on a 19 m cavity to measure the individual transmissivities of each of the mirrors as well as the round trip optical losses to an accuracy of several parts per million.</description>

Abstract: Tunable nonlinearity facilitates the creation of reconfigurable nonlinear metasurfaces, enabling innovative applications in signal processing, light switching, and sensing. This paper presents a novel approach to electrically modulate SHG from a lithium niobate (LN) metasurface, exploiting the electro-optical (EO) effect. By fabricating a nanohole array metasurface on a thin LN film and applying an electric field, we demonstrate the alteration of the material's refractive index, resulting in resonance shifts and modulation of SHG intensity at specific wavelengths. Our findings provide valuable insights for the development of electrically tunable nonlinear light sources, quantum optics, dynamic nonlinear holography, and nonlinear information processing.</description>

      <title>Si Superstrate Lenses on Patch-Antenna-Coupled TeraFETs: NEP Optimization and Frequency Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a study on performance optimization and resonant frequency modification of terahertz detectors by the use of hyper-hemispherical silicon superstrate lenses. The detectors are patch-TeraFETs, i.e., field-effect transistors with monolithically integrated patch antennas fabricated with a commercial 65-nm CMOS foundry process and designed for an operation frequency of 580 GHz. We demonstrate a strong improvement of the optical noise-equivalent power optical NEP, referenced against the total radiation power) reaching a value of 16 pW/Hz^(1/2). We show, furthermore, that the resonance frequency can be efficiently fine-tuned by the choice of the material and the thickness of a dielectric layer placed between the transistor and the superstrate lens. The resonance frequency can be shifted by more than 15 % of the center frequency (up to 100 GHz for the 580 GHz devices). The design of the on-chip optics can be employed for post-fabrication tailoring of the detector's resonance frequency to target specific spectral positions.</description>

      <title>Inverse solving the Schr\"odinger equation for precision alignment of a microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In paraxial approximation, the electromagnetic eigenmodes inside an optical microresonator can be derived from a Schr\"odinger-type eigenvalue problem. In this framework, tilting the cavity mirrors effectively introduces a linear potential to the system. In our work, we apply solution strategies for inverse problems to precisely determine and control the relative orientation of two mirrors forming an optical microcavity. Our approach employs the inversion of the Schr\"odinger equation to reconstruct the effective potential landscape, and thus mirror tilts, from observed mode patterns. We investigate regularization techniques to address the ill-posed nature of inverse problems and to improve the stability of solutions. Our method consistently achieves an angle resolution of order 100 nanoradians per measurement.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz imaging provides valuable insights into the composition and structure of objects or materials, with applications spanning security screening, medical imaging, materials science, and cultural heritage preservation. Despite its widespread utility, traditional terahertz imaging is limited in spatial resolution to approximately 1 mm according to Abbe's formula. In this paper, we propose a novel super-resolution method for terahertz time-domain spectroscopy systems. Our approach involves spatial filtering through scattering in the far-field of high spatial frequency components of the imaged sample. This method leverages evanescent wave filtering using a knife edge, akin to a standard structured illumination scheme. We demonstrate improved spatial resolution in slit diffraction, edge imaging, and reflection imaging of structures fabricated on a paper substrate using commonly encountered materials in works of art and documents. Furthermore, we present super-resolved images of an ancient document on parchment, showcasing the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Optical next generation reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks with dynamics exhibit remarkable capability in processing information. Reservoir computing (RC) is a canonical example that features rich computing expressivity and compatibility with physical implementations for enhanced efficiency. Recently, a new RC paradigm known as next generation reservoir computing (NGRC) further improves expressivity but compromises the physical openness, posing challenges for neuromorphic realizations. Here we demonstrate optical NGRC with large-scale computations performed by light scattering through disordered media. In contrast to conventional optical RC implementations, we drive our optical reservoir directly with time-delay inputs. We show that, much like digital NGRC that relies on polynomial features of delayed inputs, our optical reservoir also implicitly generates these polynomial features for desired functionalities. By leveraging the domain knowledge of the reservoir inputs, the optical NGRC not only predicts the short-term dynamics of the low-dimensional Lorenz63 and high-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky chaotic time series, but also replicates their long-term ergodic properties. Optical NGRC shows superiority in shorter training length, fewer hyperparameters and increased interpretability compared to conventional optical RC, while achieving state-of-the-art forecasting performance. Given its scalability and versatility, the optical NGRC framework also paves the way for next generation physical RC, new applications and architectures in a broad sense.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we introduce various chiro-optical structures comprising single, dimer, or trimer arrangements of plasmonic nanoantennas capable of actively modulating the chiral transmission of light through the application of an external magnetic field. Specifically, we explore monomers, dimers, and trimers of trapezoidal nanoantennas, as well as trimer configurations of triangular nanoantennas, with Au nanoparticles serving as the plasmonic elements. To enable active magnetic control over the chiro-optical response in these chiral plasmonic systems, Ni is incorporated as the active magneto-plasmonic element. Our findings not only confirm the chirality of all proposed structures but also demonstrate the feasibility of magnetically manipulating the chiro-optical response within these configurations. This study provides valuable insights into the field of chiral magneto-plasmonic nanophotonic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-photon time-of-flight (TOF) non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging enables the high-resolution reconstruction of objects outside the field of view. The compactness of TOF NLOS imaging systems, entailing the miniaturization of key components within such systems is crucial for practical applications. Here, we present a miniaturized four-channel time-correlated single-photon counting module dedicated to TOF NLOS imaging applications. The module achieves excellent performance with a 10 ps bin size and 27.4 ps minimum root-mean-square time resolution. We present the results of TOF NLOS imaging experiment using an InGaAs/InP single-photon detector and the time-correlated single-photon counting module, and show that a 6.3 cm lateral resolution and 2.3 cm depth resolution can be achieved under the conditions of 5 m imaging distance and 1 ms pixel dwell time.</description>

      <title>Building a controlled-NOT gate between polarization and frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By harnessing multiple degrees of freedom (DoFs) within a single photon, controlled quantum unitaries, such as the two-qubit controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate, play a pivotal role in advancing quantum communication protocols like dense coding and entanglement distillation. In this work, we devise and realize a CNOT operation between polarization and frequency DoFs by exploiting directionally dependent electro-optic phase modulation within a fiber Sagnac loop. Alongside computational basis measurements, we validate the effectiveness of this operation through the synthesis of all four Bell states in a single photon, all with fidelities greater than 98%. This demonstration opens new avenues for manipulating hyperentanglement across these two crucial DoFs, marking a foundational step toward leveraging polarization-frequency resources in fiber networks for future quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Superdirective and Superabsorptive Aperiodic Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a general theory of aperiodic subwavelength arrays for controlling electromagnetic waves. The considered platform is formed by an array of electrically small loaded scatterers above a ground plane. While the array is geometrically periodic, all the loads can be in general different, so that the distributions of currents induced by plane waves are not periodic. To allow analytical solutions, we study arrays of thin wires or strips loaded by bulk loads. We demonstrate a practical way of creating tunable and reconfigurable multifunctional devices, on examples of superdirective beam splitters, focusing lenses establishing subdiffraction focusing, and absorbers going beyond perfect absorption. Contrary to the constraints imposed by the Floquet theorem in periodic counterparts like periodic metasurfaces or metagratings, where a fixed angle of incidence and period dictate the propagating directions of reflected waves, the proposed aperiodic designs allow controlling all propagating modes in any direction, which provides more freedom in manipulating electromagnetic waves. We hope that these results can be useful in multiple applications, such as telecommunications, radar techniques, signal processing, and energy harnessing.</description>

      <title>Quantization of optical quasinormal modes for spatially separated cavity systems with finite retardation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multi-cavity quantization scheme is developed using quasinormal modes (QNMs) of optical cavities embedded in a homogeneous background medium for cases where retardation is significant in the inter-cavity coupling. Using quantities that can be calculated in computational optics with numerical Maxwell solvers, we extend previous QNM quantization schemes and define a quantitative measure to determine if a separate quantization of QNM cavities is justified or if a joint quantization of the system is necessary. We test this measure for the examples of two coupled one-dimensional dielectric slabs and a dimer of metal nanorods acting as QNM cavities. For sufficiently large separations, the new scheme allows for an efficient treatment of multi-cavity phenomena using parameters defined for the individual cavities. Formulating the Hamiltonian in a familiar system-bath form, the scheme connects the rigorous QNM theory and widespread phenomenological models of open cavities coupled to a shared photonic bath with parameters obtained directly from Maxwell calculations.</description>

      <title>Near-field reconstruction of periodic structures with superimposed illumination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the reconstruction of periodic structures using phase or phaseless near-field measurements. We introduce a novel illumination strategy based on the quasi-periodic condition. Employing the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map, we reformulate the scattering problem into a uniquely solvable boundary value problem. Our theoretical analysis shows the advantages of employing a fixed wavenumber superposition illumination strategy and proves that a specific wavenumber interval and fixed direction uniquely determine the grating structure. Numerical results confirm the efficacy of this illumination strategy and reconstruction algorithm, enabling super-resolution imaging from both phase and phaseless near-field measurements.</description>

      <title>Single-shot characterization of photon indistinguishability with dielectric metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing the indistinguishability of photons is a key task in quantum photonics, underpinning the tuning and stabilization of the photon sources and thereby increasing the accuracy of quantum operations. The protocols for measuring the degree of indistinguishability conventionally require photon-coincidence measurements at several different time or phase delays, which is a fundamental bottleneck towards the fast measurements and real-time monitoring of indistinguishability. Here, we develop a static dielectric metasurface grating without any reconfigurable elements that realizes a tailored multiport transformation in the free-space configuration without the need for phase locking and enables single-shot characterization of the indistinguishability between two photons in multiple degrees of freedom including time, spectrum, spatial modes, and polarization. Topology optimization is employed to design a silicon metasurface with polarization independence, high transmission, and high tolerance to measurement noise. We fabricate the metasurface and experimentally quantify the indistinguishability of photons in the time domain with fidelity over 98.4\%. We anticipate that the developed framework based on ultrathin metasurfaces can be further extended for multi-photon states and additional degrees of freedom associated with spatial modalities.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic surface polaritons at isotropic--uniaxial interface: an exact algebraic solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface polaritons in an anisotropic media posses a strong dependence of the wavevector on the propagation direction, which is called the isofrequency contour. This can lead to the fact that polariton propagation will be possible in a limited range of angles in the boundary plane. Notable examples are Dyakonov surface waves at the boundary of two dielectrics and hyperbolic plasmons in a hyperbolic metamaterial. Exact closed-form solutions of the polariton dispersion equation are known only in special cases: in a weakly anisotropic medium, and in an arbitrary medium for highly symmetric directions of polariton propagation. This work provides an universal exact solution in algebraic form for surface polariton at the interface of an arbitrary isotropic and an uniaxial media for the case of the optic axis parallel to the boundary. As an example, it was used to analyze the shapes of isofrequency contours of surface polaritons. The work brings together previously scattered results of studies of various types of surface polaritons in uniaxial media.</description>

      <title>Theory of the linewidth-power product of photonic-crystal surface-emitting lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11246v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A general theory for the intrinsic (Lorentzian) linewidth of photonic-crystal surface-emitting lasers (PCSELs) is presented. The effect of spontaneous emission is modeled by a classical Langevin force entering the equation for the slowly varying waves. The solution of the coupled-wave equations, describing the propagation of four basic waves within the plane of the photonic crystal, is expanded in terms of the solutions of the associated spectral problem, i.e. the laser modes. Expressions are given for photon number, rate of spontaneous emission into the laser mode, Petermann factor and effective Henry factor entering the general formula for the linewidth. The theoretical framework is applied to the calculation of the linewidth-power product of air-hole and all-semiconductor PCSELs. For output powers in the Watt range, intrinsic linewidths of a few tens of Hertz are predicted if stable single mode operation is ensured</description>

      <title>Intra- and intercycle analysis of intraband high-order harmonic generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study intraband high-order harmonic generation arising from a band-gap material driven by a linearly polarized laser field. We factorize the intraband high-order harmonic-generation signal into intracycle and intercycle terms. The intracycle term uniquely determines the spectral characteristics whereas the intercycle term merely modulates the spectral features by imposing energy conservation in the long-pulse limit. Through analysis of the intracycle interference, the cutoff is identified, and the origin of the harmonic selection rules is revealed. Further, it is outlined how different components of the bandstructure contribute to different regions of the harmonic spectrum, giving rise to non-trivial intensity scaling of individual harmonics in the plateau region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electro-optics serves as the crucial bridge between electronics and photonics, unlocking a wide array of applications ranging from communications and computing to sensing and quantum information. Integrated electro-optics approaches in particular enable essential electronic high-speed control for photonics while offering substantial photonic parallelism for electronics. Recent strides in thin-film lithium niobate photonics have ushered revolutionary advancements in electro-optics. This technology not only offers the requisite strong electro-optic coupling but also boasts ultra-low optical loss and high microwave bandwidth. Further, its tight confinement and compatibility with nanofabrication allow for unprecedented reconfigurability and scalability, facilitating the creation of novel and intricate devices and systems that were once deemed nearly impossible in bulk systems. Building upon this platform, the field has witnessed the emergence of various groundbreaking electro-optic devices surpassing the current state of the art, and introducing functionalities that were previously non-existent. This technological leap forward provides a unique framework to explore various realms of physics as well, including photonic non-Hermitian synthetic dimensions, active topological physics, and quantum electro-optics. In this review, we present the fundamental principles of electro-optics, drawing connections between fundamental science and the forefront of technology. We discuss the accomplishments and future prospects of integrated electro-optics, enabled by thin-film lithium niobate platform.</description>
