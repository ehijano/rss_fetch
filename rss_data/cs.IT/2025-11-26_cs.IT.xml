      <title>The Quality of Information: A Weighted Entropy Approach to Near-Optimal Mastermind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel class of information-theoretic strategies for solving the game of Mastermind, achieving state-of-the-art performance among known heuristic methods. The core contribution is the application of a weighted entropy heuristic, based on the Belis-Guias, u framework, which assigns context- dependent utility values to each of the possible feedback types. A genetic algorithm optimization approach discovers interpret-able weight patterns that reflect strategic game dynamics. First, I demonstrate that a single, fixed vector of optimized weights achieves a remarkable 4.3565 average guesses with a maximum of 5. Building upon this, I introduce a stage-weighted heuristic with distinct utility vectors for each turn, achieving 4.3488 average guesses with a maximum of 6, approaching the theoretical optimum of 4.3403 by less than 0.2%. The method retains the computational efficiency of classical one-step-ahead heuristics while significantly improving performance through principled information valuation. A complete implementation and all optimized parameters are provided for full reproducibility.</description>

      <title>The Semiotic Channel Principle: Measuring the Capacity for Meaning in LLM Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel semiotic framework for analyzing Large Language Models (LLMs), conceptualizing them as stochastic semiotic engines whose outputs demand active, asymmetric human interpretation. We formalize the trade-off between expressive richness (semiotic breadth) and interpretive stability (decipherability) using information-theoretic tools. Breadth is quantified as source entropy, and decipherability as the mutual information between messages and human interpretations. We introduce a generative complexity parameter (lambda) that governs this trade-off, as both breadth and decipherability are functions of lambda. The core trade-off is modeled as an emergent property of their distinct responses to $\lambda$. We define a semiotic channel, parameterized by audience and context, and posit a capacity constraint on meaning transmission, operationally defined as the maximum decipherability by optimizing lambda. This reframing shifts analysis from opaque model internals to observable textual artifacts, enabling empirical measurement of breadth and decipherability. We demonstrate the framework's utility across four key applications: (i) model profiling; (ii) optimizing prompt/context design; (iii) risk analysis based on ambiguity; and (iv) adaptive semiotic systems. We conclude that this capacity-based semiotic approach offers a rigorous, actionable toolkit for understanding, evaluating, and designing LLM-mediated communication.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Coding and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-shot information theory addresses scenarios in source coding and channel coding where the signal blocklength is assumed to be 1. In this case, each source and channel can be used only once, and the sources and channels are arbitrary and not required to be memoryless or ergodic. We study the achievability part of one-shot information theory, i.e., we consider explicit coding schemes in the oneshot scenario. The objective is to derive one-shot achievability results that can imply existing (first-order and second-order) asymptotic results when applied to memoryless sources and channels, or applied to systems with memory that behave ergodically.
  Poisson functional representation was first proposed as a one-shot channel simulation technique by Li and El Gamal [118] for proving a strong functional representation lemma. It was later extended to the Poisson matching lemma by Li and Anantharam [117], which provided a unified one-shot coding scheme for a broad class of information-theoretic problems. The main contribution of this thesis is to extend the applicability of Poisson functional representation to various more complicated scenarios, where the original version cannot be applied directly and further extensions must be developed.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Dominant-Interferer Approximation for SINR Coverage in Poisson Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate radio propagation and interference modeling is essential for the design and analysis of modern cellular networks. Stochastic geometry offers a rigorous framework by treating base station locations as a Poisson point process and enabling coverage characterization through spatial averaging, but its expressions often involve nested integrals and special functions that limit general applicability. Probabilistic interference models seek closed-form characterizations through moment-based approximations, yet these expressions remain tractable only for restricted parameter choices and become unwieldy when interference moments lack closed-form representations. This work introduces a hybrid approximation framework that addresses these challenges by combining Monte Carlo sampling of a small set of dominant interferers with a Laplace functional representation of the residual far-field interference. The resulting dominant-plus-tail structure provides a modular, numerically stable, and path-loss-agnostic estimator suitable for both noise-limited and interference-limited regimes. We further derive theoretical error bounds that decrease with the number of dominant interferers and validate the approach against established stochastic geometry and probabilistic modeling benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Computer-aided Characterization of Fundamental Limits of Coded Caching with Linear Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by prior work by Tian and by Cao and Xu, this paper presents an efficient computer-aided framework to characterize the fundamental limits of coded caching systems under the constraint of linear coding. The proposed framework considers non-Shannon-type inequalities which are valid for representable polymatroids (and hence for linear codes), and leverages symmetric structure and problem-specific constraints of coded caching to reduce the complexity of the linear program. The derived converse bounds are tighter compared to previous known analytic methods, and prove the optimality of some achievable memory-load tradeoff points under the constraint of linear coding placement and delivery. These results seem to indicate that small, structured demand subsets combined with minimal common information constructions may be sufficient to characterize optimal tradeoffs under linear coding.</description>

      <title>Joint Satellite Power Consumption and Handover Optimization for LEO Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In satellite constellation-based communication systems, continuous user coverage requires frequent handoffs due to the dynamic topology induced by the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. Each handoff between a satellite and ground users introduces additional signaling and power consumption, which can become a significant burden as the size of the constellation continues to increase. This work focuses on the optimization of the total transmission rate in a LEO-to-user system, by jointly considering the total transmitted power, user-satellite associations, and power consumption, the latter being handled through a penalty on handoff events. We consider a system where LEO satellites serve users located in remote areas with no terrestrial connectivity, and formulate the power allocation problem as a mixed-integer concave linear program (MICP) subject to power and association constraints. Our approach can be solved with off-the-shelf solvers and is benchmarked against a naive baseline where users associate to their closest visible satellite. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in controlling the handoff frequency while maintaining high user throughput. These performance gains highlight the effectiveness of our handover-aware optimization strategy, which ensures that user rates improve significantly, by about 40%, without incurring a disproportionate rise in the handoff frequency.</description>

      <title>Two-Step Decoding of Binary $2\times2$ Sum-Rank-Metric Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We resolve an open problem posed by Chen--Cheng--Qi (IEEE Trans.\ Inf.\ Theory, 2025): can decoding of binary sum-rank-metric codes $\SR(C_1,C_2)$ with $2\times2$ matrix blocks be reduced entirely to decoding the constituent Hamming-metric codes $C_1$ and $C_2$ without the additional requirement $d_1\ge\tfrac{2}{3}d_{\mathrm{sr}}$ that underlies their fast decoder? We answer this in the affirmative by exhibiting a simple two-step procedure: first uniquely decode $C_2$, then apply a single error/erasure decoding of $C_1$.This shows that the restrictive hypothesis $d_1\ge\tfrac{2}{3}d_{\mathrm{sr}}$ is theoretically unnecessary.The resulting decoder achieves unique decoding up to $\lfloor (d_{\mathrm{sr}}-1)/2\rfloor$ with overall cost $T_2+T_1$, where $T_2$ and $T_1$ are the complexities of the Hamming decoders for $C_2$ and $C_1$, respectively. We further show that this reduction is asymptotically optimal in a black-box model, as any sum-rank decoder must inherently decode the constituent Hamming codes.For BCH or Goppa instantiations over $\F_4$, the decoder runs in $O(\ell^2)$ time.</description>

      <title>Towards Edge General Intelligence: Knowledge Distillation for Mobile Agentic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge General Intelligence (EGI) represents a paradigm shift in mobile edge computing, where intelligent agents operate autonomously in dynamic, resource-constrained environments. However, the deployment of advanced agentic AI models on mobile and edge devices faces significant challenges due to limited computation, energy, and storage resources. To address these constraints, this survey investigates the integration of Knowledge Distillation (KD) into EGI, positioning KD as a key enabler for efficient, communication-aware, and scalable intelligence at the wireless edge. In particular, we emphasize KD techniques specifically designed for wireless communication and mobile networking, such as channel-aware self-distillation, cross-model Channel State Information (CSI) feedback distillation, and robust modulation/classification distillation. Furthermore, we review novel architectures natively suited for KD and edge deployment, such as Mamba, RWKV (Receptance, Weight, Key, Value) and Cross-Architecture distillation, which enhance generalization capabilities. Subsequently, we examine diverse applications in which KD-driven architectures enable EGI across vision, speech, and multimodal tasks. Finally, we highlight the key challenges and future directions for KD in EGI. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive reference for researchers exploring KD-driven frameworks for mobile agentic AI in the era of EGI.</description>

      <title>Explainable Deep Learning for Secrecy Energy-Efficiency Maximization in Ambient Backscatter Multi-User NOMA Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the secrecy energy-efficiency (SEE) of a multi-user downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system assisted by multiple ambient backscatter communications (AmBC) in the presence of a passive eavesdropper. We analyze both the trade-off and the ratio between the achievable secrecy sum-rate and total power consumption. In the special case of two backscatter devices (BDs), we derive closed-form solutions for the optimal reflection coefficients and power allocation by exploiting the structure of the SEE objective and the Pareto boundary of the feasible set. When more than two BDs are present, the problem becomes analytically intractable. To address this, we propose two efficient optimization techniques: (i) an exhaustive grid- based benchmark method, and (ii) a scalable particle swarm optimization algorithm. Furthermore, we design a deep learning-based predictor using a feedforward neural network (FNN), which closely approximates the optimal solutions. Numerical results show that the inclusion of AmBC significantly improves SEE, with gains up to 615% compared to conventional NOMA in high-noise regimes. Additionally, the FNN model achieves more than 95% accuracy compared to the optimal baseline, while reducing complexity. Finally, we employ SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret the learned model, revealing that the most influential features correspond to the dominant composite channel components, in accordance with the theoretical system model. This demonstrates the potential of explainable artificial intelligence to build trust in energy-efficient and secure AmBC-NOMA systems for next-generation internet of things applications.</description>

      <title>On hierarchical secure aggregation against relay and user collusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secure aggregation (SA) is fundamental to privacy preservation in federated learning (FL), enabling model aggregation while preventing disclosure of individual user updates. This paper addresses hierarchical secure aggregation (HSA) against relay and user collusion in homogeneous networks, where each user connects to $n$ relays and each relay serves $m$ users. In the two-phase communication framework, users transmit masked data to relays, which then process and forward compiled messages to the server for exact sum recovery. The primary objective is to devise a transmission scheme such that the server can finish the aggregation task, while any group of $T_h$ colluding relays and $T_u$ colluding users cannot reveal any information about the data owned by the non-colluding users. In this study, we establish fundamental limits on the communication load, defined as the ratio of transmitted information size to original data size, for each user-relay link and each relay-server link. Achievable thresholds for collusion resilience are also derived. When the number of colluding relays and users falls below certain critical thresholds, we construct communication-optimal schemes using methods from network function computation. A limitation of these schemes is their reliance on large random keys. To address this, we derive a lower bound on the required key size and prove its achievability in cyclic networks, where users are connected to relays in a cyclic wrap-around manner. By establishing a connection between HSA and network function computation, this work advances the theoretical limits of communication efficiency and information-theoretic security in secure aggregation.</description>

      <title>General Multi-User Distributed Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops a unified {learning- and information-theoretic} framework for distributed computation and inference across multiple users and servers. The proposed \emph{General Multi-User Distributed Computing (GMUDC)} model characterizes how computation, communication, and accuracy can be jointly optimized when users demand heterogeneous target functions that are arbitrary transformations of shared real-valued subfunctions. Without any separability assumption, and requiring only that each target function lies in a reproducing-kernel Hilbert space associated with a shift-invariant kernel, the framework remains valid for arbitrary connectivity and task-assignment topologies. A dual analysis is introduced: the \emph{quenched design} considers fixed assignments of subfunctions and network topology, while the \emph{annealed design} captures the averaged performance when assignments and links are drawn uniformly at random from a given ensemble. These formulations reveal the fundamental limits governing the trade-offs among computing load, communication load, and reconstruction distortion under computational and communication budgets~$\Gamma$ and~$\Delta$. The analysis establishes a spectral--coverage duality linking generalization capability with network topology and resource allocation, leading to provably efficient and topology-aware distributed designs. The resulting principles provide an \emph{information--energy foundation} for scalable and resource-optimal distributed and federated learning systems, with direct applications to aeronautical, satellite, and edge-intelligent networks where energy and data efficiency are critical.</description>

      <title>CSI Prediction Frameworks for Enhanced 5G Link Adaptation: Performance-Complexity Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and timely channel state information (CSI) is fundamental for efficient link adaptation. However, challenges such as channel aging, user mobility, and feedback delays significantly impact the performance of adaptive modulation and coding (AMC). This paper proposes and evaluates two CSI prediction frameworks applicable to both time division duplexing (TDD) and frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems. The proposed methods operate in the effective signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) domain to reduce complexity while preserving predictive accuracy. A comparative analysis is conducted between a classical Wiener filter and state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks based on gated recurrent units (GRUs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and a delayed deep neural network (DNN). The evaluation considers the accuracy of the prediction in terms of mean squared error (MSE), the performance of the system, and the complexity of the implementation regarding floating point operations (FLOPs). Furthermore, we investigate the generalizability of both approaches under various propagation conditions. The simulation results show that the Wiener filter performs close to GRU in terms of MSE and throughput with lower computational complexity, provided that the second-order statistics of the channel are available. However, the GRU model exhibits enhanced generalization across different channel scenarios. These findings suggest that while learningbased solutions are well-suited for TDD systems where the base station (BS) handles the computation, the lower complexity of classical methods makes them a preferable choice for FDD setups, where prediction occurs at the power-constrained user equipment (UE).</description>

      <title>Unified Block Signal Processing Framework for LPWANs: Sequence Index Modulation Spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs) demand high receiver sensitivity and efficient physical-layer signal processing. This paper introduces a unified framework for generalized block signal transmission in LPWANs, addressing the limitations of conventional symbol-by-symbol approaches. The framework comprises three key components: the signal block vector, the intra-block structure generator, and the signal basis matrix, and leverages quasi-orthogonal codewords formed through cyclically shifted spreading sequences. The resulting quasi-orthogonality enables reliable multi-user separation, particularly under asynchronous access. The framework establishes a conceptual foundation for block synchronization and provides a unified demodulation structure based on block correlation matching. It further supports flexible and systematic implementation, as demonstrated through applications to frequency-shift keying and chirp spread spectrum. This work advances scalable and efficient physical-layer design for next-generation LPWANs.</description>

Abstract: We make four contributions to the theory of optimal subspace packings and equi-isoclinic subspaces: (1) a new lower bound for block coherence, (2) an exact count of equi-isoclinic subspaces of even dimension $r$ in $\mathbb{R}^{2r+1}$ with parameter $\alpha \neq \tfrac{1}{2}$, (3) a new upper bound for the number of $r$-dimensional equi-isoclinic subspaces in $\mathbb{R}^d$ or $\mathbb{C}^d$, and (4) a proof that when $d=2r$, a further refinement of this bound is attained for every $r$ in the complex case and every $r=2^k$ in the real case. For each of these contributions, the proof ultimately relies on a dimension count.</description>

      <title>Generative Model-Aided Continual Learning for CSI Feedback in FDD mMIMO-OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep autoencoder (DAE) frameworks have demonstrated their effectiveness in reducing channel state information (CSI) feedback overhead in massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. However, existing CSI feedback models struggle to adapt to dynamic environments caused by user mobility, requiring retraining when encountering new CSI distributions. Moreover, returning to previously encountered environments often leads to performance degradation due to catastrophic forgetting. Continual learning involves enabling models to incorporate new information while maintaining performance on previously learned tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based learning approach for CSI feedback. By using a GAN generator as a memory unit, our method preserves knowledge from past environments and ensures consistently high performance across diverse scenarios without forgetting. Simulation results show that the proposed approach enhances the generalization capability of the DAE framework while maintaining low memory overhead. Furthermore, it can be seamlessly integrated with other advanced CSI feedback models, highlighting its robustness and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient VLMs: Information-Theoretic Driven Compression via Adaptive Structural Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance across multimodal tasks, yet their ever-growing scale poses severe challenges for deployment and efficiency. Existing compression methods often rely on heuristic importance metrics or empirical pruning rules, lacking theoretical guarantees about information preservation. In this work, we propose InfoPrune, an information-theoretic framework for adaptive structural compression of VLMs. Grounded in the Information Bottleneck principle, we formulate pruning as a trade-off between retaining task-relevant semantics and discarding redundant dependencies. To quantify the contribution of each attention head, we introduce an entropy-based effective rank (eRank) and employ the Kolmogorov--Smirnov (KS) distance to measure the divergence between original and compressed structures. This yields a unified criterion that jointly considers structural sparsity and informational efficiency. Building on this foundation, we further design two complementary schemes: (1) a training-based head pruning guided by the proposed information loss objective, and (2) a training-free FFN compression via adaptive low-rank approximation. Extensive experiments on VQAv2, TextVQA, and GQA demonstrate that InfoPrune achieves up to 3.2x FLOP reduction and 1.8x acceleration with negligible performance degradation, establishing a theoretically grounded and practically effective step toward efficient multimodal large models.</description>

      <title>The Fourier Ratio and complexity of signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Fourier ratio of a signal $f:\mathbb Z_N\to\mathbb C$, \[ \mathrm{FR}(f)\ :=\ \sqrt{N}\,\frac{\|\widehat f\|_{L^1(\mu)}}{\|\widehat f\|_{L^2(\mu)}} \ =\ \frac{\|\widehat f\|_1}{\|\widehat f\|_2}, \] as a simple scalar parameter governing Fourier-side complexity, structure, and learnability. Using the Bourgain--Talagrand theory of random subsets of orthonormal systems, we show that signals concentrated on generic sparse sets necessarily have large Fourier ratio, while small $\mathrm{FR}(f)$ forces $f$ to be well-approximated in both $L^2$ and $L^\infty$ by low-degree trigonometric polynomials. Quantitatively, the class $\{f:\mathrm{FR}(f)\le r\}$ admits degree $O(r^2)$ $L^2$-approximants, which we use to prove that small Fourier ratio implies small algorithmic rate--distortion, a stable refinement of Kolmogorov complexity.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Structure of Chaotic Attractors in FitzHugh-Rinzel model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaotic bursting behaviors have been observed by many authors in neural dynamics mainly in the transition between different kinds of bursting behavior. As a well-known three-dimensional ODEs model with various bursting solutions, the FitzHugh-Rinzel model has been considered in this paper. The structure of the strange attractor that appears in chaotic transitions of this model was investigated by introducing a stochastic approach to uncover the transition mech- anism. To portray this idea the attractor of the dynamical system can be partitioned into some regions and a discrete evolution that is inspired by the flow between them is sketched. A suitable Markov chain has been associated with the strange attractor based on partition selected by the recognizable regions of the attractor. Then the entropy rate of the Markov chain and the topological entropy of dynamical systems are compared to decide if the associated Markov chain should be modified or not. Furthermore, the differences between entropies guide us to uncover some changes in the shape of the attractor including some new regions which play important roles in the chaotic behavior of our system. It can be also ensured with the help of Lempel-Ziv quantity that the estimated entropy rate is reliable.</description>

      <title>Prompt Fairness: Sub-group Disparities in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), though shown to be effective in many applications, can vary significantly in their response quality. In this paper, we investigate this problem of prompt fairness: specifically, the phrasing of a prompt by different users/styles, despite the same question being asked in principle, may elicit different responses from an LLM. To quantify this disparity, we propose to use information-theoretic metrics that can capture two dimensions of bias: subgroup sensitivity, the variability of responses within a subgroup and cross group consistency, the variability of responses across subgroups. Our analysis reveals that certain subgroups exhibit both higher internal variability and greater divergence from others. Our empirical analysis reveals that certain demographic sub groups experience both higher internal variability and greater divergence from others, indicating structural inequities in model behavior. To mitigate these disparities, we propose practical interventions, including majority voting across multiple generations and prompt neutralization, which together improve response stability and enhance fairness across user populations. In the experiments, we observe clear prompt sensitivity disparities across demographic subgroups: before mitigation, cross-group divergence values reach 0.28 and typically fall in the from 0.14 to 0.22 range. After applying our neutralization and multi generation strategy, these divergences consistently decrease, with the largest gap reduced to 0.22 and many distances falling to 0.17 or below, indicating more stable and consistent outputs across subgroups.</description>

      <title>Sparse MIMO-OFDM Channel Estimation via RKHS Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for channel estimation in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) wireless communication systems. The method exploits the band-sparsity of wireless channels in the delay-beamspace domain by solving a regularized optimization problem in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). A suitable representer theorem allows us to transform the infinite-dimensional optimization problem into a finite-dimensional one, which we then approximate with a low-dimensional surrogate. We solve the resulting optimization problem using a forward- backward splitting (FBS)-based algorithm. By exploiting the problem's modulation structure, we achieve a computational complexity per iteration that is quasi-linear in the number of unknown variables. We also propose a data-driven deep-unfolding based extension to improve the performance at a reduced number of iterations. We evaluate our channel estimators on ray-traced channels generated with SionnaRT. The results show that our methods significantly outperform linear methods such as linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) channel estimation based on aggregate channel statistics, both in terms of raw estimation accuracy as well as in downstream performance.</description>

      <title>On lattices over Fermat function fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Function field lattices are an interesting example of algebraically constructed lattices. Their minimum distance is bounded below by a function of the gonality of the underlying function field. Known explicit examples--coming mostly from elliptic and Hermitian curves--typically meet this lower bound. In this paper, we construct, for every integer $n \geqslant 4$, a new family of lattices arising from the Fermat function field $F_n$ and the set of its $3n$ total inflection points. These lattices have rank $3n-1$, and we show that their minimum distance equals $\sqrt{2n}$, thereby exceeding the classical bound $\sqrt{2\gamma(F_n)} = \sqrt{2(n-1)}$. We also determine their kissing number, which turns out to be independent of $n$, and analyze the structure of the second shortest vectors. Our results provide the first explicit examples of function field lattices of arbitrarily large rank whose minimum distance surpasses the expected bound, offering new geometric features of potential interest for coding-theoretic and cryptographic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Securing the Internet of Things (IoT) against quantum attacks requires public-key cryptography that (i) remains compact and (ii) runs efficiently on microcontrollers, capabilities many post-quantum (PQ) schemes lack due to large keys and heavy arithmetic. We address both constraints simultaneously with, to our knowledge, the first-ever isogeny framework that encodes super-singular elliptic-curve isogeny data via novel Engel expansions over the p-adic Laurent series. Engel coefficients compress torsion information, thereby addressing the compactness constraint, yielding public keys of ~1.1 - 16.9 kbits preserving the hallmark small sizes of isogeny systems. Engel arithmetic is local and admits fixed-precision p-adic operations, enabling micro-controller efficiency with low-memory, branch-regular kernels suitable for embedded targets.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Approximate Degradability of High-Spin Modified Landau-Streater Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16312v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the degradability of quantum channels in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, focusing on the Modified Landau-Streater (MLS) channels constructed from SU(2) spin-$j$ representations. While the super-additivity of coherent information generally renders quantum capacity calculations intractable, approximate degradability provides a path to tight lower bounds. Extending the analysis of qubit depolarizing channels by Leditzky et al., we rigorously establish that the MLS family exhibits an $O(p^2)$ approximate degradability parameter for arbitrary dimension $d = 2j+1$. A pivotal contribution of our work is the geometric characterization of the noise structure: we establish that the diamond norm distance between the pure Landau-Streater channel and the identity channel is exactly $2$. We identify this geometric orthogonality between the noise and signal subspaces as the physical mechanism responsible for canceling the first-order non-degradability terms. These results suggest that $O(p^2)$ degradability is a robust feature of highly symmetric noise models, paving the way for a deeper structural understanding of quantum capacity in high-dimensional regimes.</description>

Abstract: Markov random fields are known to be fully characterized by properties of their information diagrams, or I-diagrams. In particular, for Markov random fields, regions in the I-diagram corresponding to disconnected vertex sets in the graph vanish. Recently, I-diagrams have been generalized to F-diagrams, for a larger class of functions F satisfying the chain rule beyond Shannon entropy, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence and cross-entropy. In this work, we generalize the notion and characterization of Markov random fields to this larger class of functions F and investigate preliminary applications.
  We define F-independences, F-mutual independences, and F-Markov random fields and characterize them by their F-diagram. In the process, we also define F-dual total correlation and prove that its vanishing is equivalent to F-mutual independence. We then apply our results to information functions F that are applied to probability mass functions. We show that if the probability distributions of a set of random variables are Markov random fields for the same graph, then we formally recover the notion of an F-Markov random field for that graph. We then study the Kullback-Leibler diagrams on specific Markov chains, leading to a visual representation of the second law of thermodynamics and a simple explicit derivation of the decomposition of the evidence lower bound for diffusion models.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the decoding of the rank metric Reed--Muller codes introduced by Augot, Couvreur, Lavauzelle and Neri in 2021. These codes are defined from Abelian Galois extensions extending the construction of Gabidulin codes over arbitrary cyclic Galois extensions. We propose a polynomial time algorithm that rests on the structure of Dickson matrices, works on any such code and corrects any error of rank up to half the minimum distance.</description>

      <title>Realizing Quantum Wireless Sensing Without Extra Reference Sources: Architecture, Algorithm, and Sensitivity Maximization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg Atomic REceivers (RAREs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for radio-frequency signal measurement, enabling advanced quantum wireless sensing. Existing RARE-based sensing systems popularly adopt the heterodyne detection methodology, which requires an additional reference source to serve as an atomic mixer. However, this approach entails a bulky transceiver architecture and is limited in the supportable sensing bandwidth. To address these limitations, we propose a self-heterodyne sensing paradigm where the transmitter's self-interference naturally provides the reference signal. We demonstrate that a self-heterodyne RARE functions as an atomic autocorrelator, eliminating the need for external reference sources while supporting substantially wider bandwidth than conventional heterodyne methods. Next, a two-stage algorithm is devised to perform target ranging in self-heterodyne RARE systems. This algorithm is shown to closely approach the Cramer-Rao lower bound. Furthermore, we introduce the power-trajectory ($P$-trajectory) design for RAREs, which maximizes the sensing sensitivity through time-varying transmission power control. An internal noise (ITN)-limited $P$-trajectory is developed to capture the profile of the asymptotically optimal time-varying power in the presence of ITN only. This design is then extended to the practical $P$-trajectory by incorporating both the ITN and external noise. Numerical results validate that the proposed self-heterodyne sensing can achieve a $\sim$100 MHz-level bandwidth with high sensitivity, substantially surpassing existing heterodyne counterparts and paving the way for high-resolution quantum wireless sensing.</description>

      <title>Limitations to Computing Quadratic Functions on Reed-Solomon Encoded Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08000v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of low-bandwidth non-linear computation on Reed-Solomon encoded data. Given an $[n,k]$ Reed-Solomon encoding of a message vector $\mathbf{f} \in \mathbb{F}_q^k$, and a polynomial $g \in \mathbb{F}_q[X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k]$, a user wishing to evaluate $g(\mathbf{f})$ is given local query access to each codeword symbol. The query response is allowed to be the output of an arbitrary function evaluated locally on the codeword symbol, and the user's aim is to minimize the total information downloaded in order to compute $g(\mathbf{f})$. This problem has been studied before for \emph{linear} functions $g$; in this work we initiate the study of non-linear functions by starting with quadratic monomials.
  For $q = p^e$ and distinct $i,j \in [k]$, we show that any scheme evaluating the quadratic monomial $g_{i,j} := X_i X_j$ must download at least $2 \log_2(q-1) - 3$ bits of information when $p$ is an odd prime, and at least $2\log_2(q-2) -4$ bits when $p=2$. When $k=2$, our result shows that one cannot do significantly better than the naive bound of $k \log_2(q)$ bits, which is enough to recover all of $\mathbf{f}$. This contrasts sharply with prior work for low-bandwidth evaluation of \emph{linear} functions $g(\mathbf{f})$ over Reed-Solomon encoded data, for which prior work has shown it is possible to substantially improve upon this bound.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a terrestrial localization system based on 5G infrastructure as a viable alternative to GNSS, particularly in scenarios where GNSS signals are obstructed or unavailable. It discusses network planning aimed at enabling positioning as a primary service, in contrast to the traditional focus on communication services in terrestrial networks. Building on a network infrastructure optimized for positioning, the paper proposes a system that leverages carrier phase (CP) ranging in combination with trilateration to localize the user within the network when at least three base stations (BSs) provide line-of-sight (LOS) conditions. Achieving accurate CP-based positioning requires addressing three key challenges: integer ambiguity resolution, LOS/NLOS link identification, and localization under obstructed LOS conditions. To this end, the system employs a multi-carrier CP approach, which eliminates the need for explicit integer ambiguity estimation. Additionally, a deep learning model is developed to identify NLOS links and exclude them from the trilateration process. In cases where LOS is obstructed and CP ranging becomes unreliable, the system incorporates an error-state extended Kalman filter to fuse complementary data from other sensors, such as inertial measurement units (IMUs) and cameras. This hybrid approach enables robust tracking of moving users across diverse channel conditions. The performance of the proposed terrestrial positioning system is evaluated using the real-world KITTI dataset, featuring a moving vehicle in an urban environment. Simulation results show that the system can achieve a positioning error of less than 5 meters in the KITTI urban scenario--comparable to that of public commercial GNSS services--highlighting its potential as a resilient and accurate solution for GNSS-denied environments.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the studies of twisted generalized Reed-Solomon (TGRS) codes, we initiate the study of twisted elliptic curve codes (TECCs) in this paper. In particular, we study a class of TECCs with one twist. The parity-check matrices of the TECCs are explicitly given by computing the Weil differentials. Then the sufficient and necessary conditions of self-duality are presented. The minimum distances of the TECCs are also determined. Moreover, examples of MDS, AMDS, self-dual and MDS self-dual TECCs are given. Finally, we calculate the dimensions of the Schur squares of TECCs and show the non-equivalence between TECCs and ECCs/GRS codes.</description>

      <title>Indoor Fluid Antenna Systems Enabled by Layout-Specific Modeling and Group Relative Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15006v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid antenna system (FAS) revolutionizes wireless communications via utilizing position-flexible antennas that dynamically optimize channel conditions and mitigate multipath fading. This innovation is particularly valuable in indoor environments, in which signal propagation is severely degraded due to structural obstructions and complex multipath reflections. In this paper, we investigate the channel modeling and the joint optimization of antenna positioning, beamforming, and power allocation for indoor FAS. In particular, we propose a layout-specific channel model, and employ the novel group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm for tackling the optimization problem. Compared to the state-of-the-art Sionna model, our model achieves an 83.3% reduction in computation time with an approximately 3 dB increase in root-mean-square error (RMSE). When simplified to a two-ray model, our model allows for a closed-form antenna position solution with near-optimal performance. For the joint optimization problem, our GRPO algorithm outperforms proximal policy optimization (PPO) and other baselines in sum-rate, while requiring only 50.8% computational resources of PPO, thanks to its group advantage estimation. Simulation results show that increasing either the group size or trajectory length in GRPO does not yield significant improvements in sum-rate, suggesting that these parameters can be selected conservatively without sacrificing performance.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Antenna Aided Mixed Near-Field and Far-Field Communications in the Upper Mid-Band: Interference Analysis and Joint Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04865</link>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose to leverage rotatable antennas (RAs) for improving the communication performance in mixed near-field and far-field communication systems by exploiting a new spatial degree-of-freedom (DoF) offered by antenna rotation to mitigate complex near-field interference and mixed-field interference. Specifically, we investigate a modular RA-enabled mixed-field downlink communication system, where a base station (BS) consisting of multiple RA subarrays communicates with multiple near-field users in the presence of several legacy far-field users. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum-rate of the near-field users by jointly optimizing the power allocation and rotation angles of all subarrays at the BS. To gain useful insights into the effect of RAs on mixed-field communications, we first analyze a special case where all subarrays share the same rotation angle and obtain closed-form expressions for the rotation-aware normalized near-field interference and the rotation-aware normalized mixed-field interference using the Fresnel integrals. We then analytically reveal that array rotation effectively suppresses both interference types, thereby significantly enhancing mixed-field communication performance. For the general case involving subarray-wise rotation, we propose an efficient double-layer algorithm to obtain a high-quality solution, where the inner layer optimizes power allocation using the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique, while the outer layer determines the rotation angles of all subarrays via particle swarm optimization (PSO). Finally, numerical results highlight the significant performance gains achieved by RAs over conventional fixed-antenna systems and demonstrate the effectiveness of our developed joint design compared to benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Vendi Information Gain for Active Learning and its Application to Ecology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10390v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While monitoring biodiversity through camera traps has become an important endeavor for ecological research, identifying species in the captured image data remains a major bottleneck due to limited labeling resources. Active learning -- a machine learning paradigm that selects the most informative data to label and train a predictive model -- offers a promising solution, but typically focuses on uncertainty in the individual predictions without considering uncertainty across the entire dataset. We introduce a new active learning policy, Vendi information gain (VIG), that selects images based on their impact on dataset-wide prediction uncertainty, capturing both informativeness and diversity. We applied VIG to the Snapshot Serengeti dataset and compared it against common active learning methods. VIG needs only 3% of the available data to reach 75% accuracy, a level that baselines require more than 10% of the data to achieve. With 10% of the data, VIG attains 88% predictive accuracy, 12% higher than the best of the baselines. This improvement in performance is consistent across metrics and batch sizes, and we show that VIG also collects more diverse data in the feature space. VIG has broad applicability beyond ecology, and our results highlight its value for biodiversity monitoring in data-limited environments.</description>
