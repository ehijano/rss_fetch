      <title>Calligraphy Concerning Casually Compiled Cardinal Characteristic Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I establish several inequalities between cardinal characteristics of the continuum. In particular, it is shown that the partition splitting number is not larger than the uniformity of the meagre ideal; not all sets of reals having the cardinality of an (the?) $\varepsilon$-almost bisecting number are of strong measure zero; no fewer sets of strong measure zero than indicated by the statistically reaping number suffice to cover the reals; the pair-splitting number is not smaller than the evasion number; and the subseries number is neither smaller than the pair-splitting number nor than the minimum of the unbounding number and the unbisecting number. Moreover I provide a diagram putting these results into context and give a brief historical account.</description>

      <title>A proof-theoretical approach to some extensions of first order quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalised quantifiers, which include Henkin's branching quantifiers, have been introduced by Mostowski and Lindstr\"om and developed as a substantial topic application of logic, especially model theory, to linguistics with work by Barwise, Cooper, Keenan.
  In this paper, we mainly study the proof theory of some non-standard quantifiers as second order formulae . Our first example is the usual pair of first order quantifiers (for all / there exists) when individuals are viewed as individual concepts handled by second order deductive rules. Our second example is the study of a second order translation of the simplest branching quantifier: ``A member of each team and a member of each board of directors know each other", for which we propose a second order treatment.</description>

      <title>Equiconsistency of the Minimalist Foundation with its classical version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Minimalist Foundation, for short MF, was conceived by the first author with G. Sambin in 2005, and fully formalized in 2009, as a common core among the most relevant constructive and classical foundations for mathematics.
  To better accomplish its minimality, MF was designed as a two-level type theory, with an intensional level mTT, an extensional one emTT, and an interpretation of the latter into the first.
  Here, we first show that the two levels of MF are indeed equiconsistent by interpreting mTT into emTT. Then, we show that the classical extension emTT^c is equiconsistent with emTT by suitably extending the G\"odel-Gentzen double-negation translation of classical logic in the intuitionistic one. As a consequence, MF turns out to be compatible with classical predicative mathematics \`a la Weyl, contrary to the most relevant foundations for constructive mathematics.
  Finally, we show that the chain of equiconsistency results for MF can be straightforwardly extended to its impredicative version to deduce that Coquand-Huet's Calculus of Constructions equipped with basic inductive types is equiconsistent with its extensional and classical versions too.</description>

      <title>A closed subset of Baire space not Medvedev equivalent to any closed set of Cantor space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For mass problems $P,Q\subseteq {\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}}$ (Baire space), $P$ is Medvedev reducible to $Q$ ($P\leq_sQ$) if for some Turing funcional $\Phi$, $\Phi(Q)\subseteq P$, and Medvedev equivalent to $Q$ if also $Q\leq_sP$. Shafer asked if every closed problem $P$ is Medvedev equivalent to a closed problem $Q$ with $Q\subseteq 2^\mathbb{N}$ (Cantor space). We show that this is not the case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A function is boundedly finite-to-one if there is a natural number $k$ such that each point has at most $k$ inverse images. In this paper, we prove in $\mathsf{ZF}$ (without the axiom of choice) several results concerning this notion, among which are the following:
  (1) For each infinite set $A$ and natural number $n$, there is no boundedly finite-to-one function from $\mathcal{S}(A)$ to $\mathcal{S}_{\leq n}(A)$, where $\mathcal{S}(A)$ is the set of all permutations of $A$ and $\mathcal{S}_{\leq n}(A)$ is the set of all permutations of $A$ moving at most $n$ points.
  (2) For each infinite set $A$, there is no boundedly finite-to-one function from $\mathcal{B}(A)$ to $\mathrm{fin}(A)$, where $\mathcal{B}(A)$ is the set of all partitions of $A$ whose blocks are finite and $\mathrm{fin}(A)$ is the set of all finite subsets of $A$.</description>

      <title>Periodic frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymodal provability logic GLP is incomplete w.r.t. Kripke frames. It is known to be complete w.r.t. topological semantics, where the diamond modalities correspond to topological derivative operations. However, the topologies needed for the completeness proof are highly non-constructive. The question of completeness of GLP w.r.t. natural scattered topologies on ordinals is dependent on large cardinal axioms of set theory and is still open. So far, we are lacking a useable class of models for which GLP is complete.
  In this paper we define a natural class of countable general topological frames on ordinals for which GLP is sound and complete. The associated topologies are the same as the ordinal topologies introduced by Thomas Icard. However, the key point is to specify a suitable algebra of subsets of an ordinal closed under the boolean and topological derivative operations. The algebras we define are based on the notion of a periodic set of ordinals generalizing that of an ultimately periodic binary omega-word.</description>

      <title>Borel complexity of families of finite equivalence relations via large cardinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a large family of theories of equivalence relations, each with finitely many classes, and assuming the existence of an $\omega$-Erdos cardinal, we determine which of these theories are Borel complete. We develop machinery, including {\em forbidding nested sequences} which implies a tight upper bound on Borel complexity, and {\em admitting cross-cutting absolutely indiscernible sets} which in our context implies Borel completeness. In the Appendix we classify the reducts of theories of refining equivalence relations, possibly with infinite splitting.</description>

      <title>Bounding the degree of generic sharp transitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a generically sharply $t$-transitive permutation group of finite Morley rank on a set of rank $r$ satisfies $t\le r+2$ provided the pointwise stabilizer of a generic $(t-1)$-tuple is an $L$-group, which holds, for example, when the stabilizer is solvable or when $r\le 5$. This makes progress on the Borovik-Cherlin conjecture that every generically $(r+2)$-transitive permutation group of finite Morley rank on a set of rank $r$ is of the form $\operatorname{PGL}_{r+1}(F)$ acting naturally on $\mathbb{P}^r(F)$.
  Our proof is assembled from three key ingredients that are independent of the main theorem -- these address actions of $\operatorname{Alt}(n)$ on $L$-groups of finite Morley rank, generically $2$-transitive actions with abelian point stabilizers, and simple groups of rank $6$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Filtrations are certain transfinite sequences of topologies increasing in strength and interpolating between two given topologies $\sigma$ and $\tau$, with $\tau$ being stronger than $\sigma$. We prove general results on stabilization at $\tau$ of filtrations interpolating between $\sigma$ and $\tau$. These topological results involve an interplay between $\kappa$-Borel sets with respect to the topology $\sigma$ and $\kappa$-Baireness of the topology $\tau$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1810.00493v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new invariant of Borel reducibility, namely the notion of thickness; this associates to every sentence $\Phi$ of $\mathcal{L}_{\omega_1 \omega}$ and to every cardinal $\lambda$, the thickness $\tau(\Phi, \lambda)$ of $\Phi$ at $\lambda$. As applications, we show that all the Friedman-Stanley jumps of torsion abelian groups are non-Borel complete. We also show that under the existence of large cardinals, if $\Phi$ is a sentence of $\mathcal{L}_{\omega_1 \omega}$ with the Schr\"{o}der-Bernstein property (that is, whenever two countable models of $\Phi$ are biembeddable, then they are isomorphic), then $\Phi$ is not Borel complete.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Elementary Proof of Zorn's Lemma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10258v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zorn's Lemma is a well-known equivalent of the Axiom of Choice. It is usually regarded as a topic in axiomatic set theory, and its historically standard proof (from the Axiom of Choice) relies on transfinite recursion, a non-elementary set-theoretic machinery. However, the statement of Zorn's Lemma itself uses only elementary terminology for partially ordered sets. Therefore, it is worthy to establish a proof using only such elementary terminology. Following this line of study, we give a new simple proof of Zorn's Lemma, which does not even use the notion of a well-ordered set.</description>

Abstract: In recent work, we introduced a new semantics for conditionals, covering a large class of what we call preconditionals. In this paper, we undertake an axiomatic study of preconditionals and subclasses of preconditionals. We then prove that any bounded lattice equipped with a preconditional can be represented by a relational structure, suitably topologized, yielding a single relational semantics for conditional logics normally treated by different semantics, as well as generalizing beyond those semantics.</description>

Here we shall give two criteria \it nontiriviality \rm and \it quasi-nontriviality \rm in order to distinguish two axiom-schemata.</description>
