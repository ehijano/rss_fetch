      <title>Hilbert space fragmentation at the origin of disorder-free localization in the lattice Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories, the discretized cousins of continuum gauge theories, have become an important platform for the exploration of non-equilibrium phenomena beyond their original scope in the Standard Model. In particular, recent works have reported the possibility of disorder-free localization in the lattice Schwinger model. Using degenerate perturbation theory and numerical simulations based on exact diagonalization and matrix product states, we perform a detailed characterization of thermalization breakdown in the Schwinger model including its spectral properties, the structure of eigenstates, and out-of-equilibrium quench dynamics. We scrutinize the strong-coupling limit of the model, in which an intriguing, double-logarithmic-in-time, growth of entanglement was previously proposed from the initial vacuum state. We identify the origin of this ultraslow growth of entanglement as due to an approximate Hilbert space fragmentation and the emergence of a dynamical constraint on particle hopping, which gives rise to sharp jumps in the entanglement entropy dynamics within individual background charge sectors. Based on the statistics of jump times, we argue that the entanglement growth, averaged over charge sectors, is more naturally explained as either single-logarithmic or a weak power law in time. Our results thus suggest the existence of a single ergodicity-breaking regime due to Hilbert space fragmentation, whose properties are reminiscent of conventional many-body localization within the numerically accessible system sizes.</description>

      <title>Inverse Spin Hall Effect in Nonequilibrium Dirac Systems Induced by Anomalous Flow Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Dirac fermions in the presence of a space-dependent chiral gauge field and thermodynamic gradients, establishing a connection to the inverse spin Hall effect. The chiral gauge field induces a chiral magnetic field, resulting in a surface Fermi arc state and a chiral Landau level state which, although is delocalized in the bulk, we show to be more robust against impurities. By applying chemical potential and temperature gradients, we achieve nonzero charge currents, with each gradient leading to distinct Fermi level dependencies, both of which have been observed in a recent experiment. Unlike the conventional mixed axial-gravitational anomaly, our currents require a noncollinear chiral magnetic field and thermodynamic gradient. We further derive low-energy transport formulas and demonstrate the importance of carefully treating the ultraviolet cutoff for understanding our lattice calculations.</description>

      <title>Notes on Confinement on $\mathbf{R^3 \times S^1}$: From Yang-Mills, super-Yang-Mills, and QCD(adj) to QCD(F)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.10423v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a pedagogical introduction to the physics of confinement on $R^3 \times S^1$, using $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills with massive or massless adjoint fermions as the prime example; at the end, we also add fundamental flavours. The small-$S^1$ limit is remarkable, allowing for controlled semiclassical determination of the nonperturbative physics in these, mostly non-supersymmetric, theories. We begin by reviewing the Polyakov confinement mechanism on $R^3$. Moving on to $R^3 \times S^1$, we show how introducing adjoint fermions stabilizes center symmetry, leading to abelianization and semiclassical calculability. We explain how monopole-instantons and twisted monopole-instantons arise. We describe the role of various novel topological excitations in extending Polyakov's confinement to the locally four-dimensional case, discuss the nature of the confining string, and the $\theta$-angle dependence.~We study the global symmetry realization and, when available, present evidence for the absence of phase transitions as a function of the $S^1$ size. As our aim is not to cover all work on the subject, but to prepare the interested reader for its study, we also include brief descriptions of topics not covered in detail: the necessity for analytic continuation of path integrals, the study of more general theories, and the 't Hooft anomalies involving higher-form symmetries.</description>

      <title>Critical properties of metallic and deconfined quantum phase transitions in Dirac systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize, by means of large-scale fermion quantum Monte Carlo simulations, metallic and deconfined quantum phase transitions in a bilayer honeycomb model in terms of their quantum critical and finite-temperature properties.The model features three different phases at zero temperature as function of interaction strength. At weak interaction, a fully symmetric Dirac semimetal state is realized. At intermediate and strong interaction, respectively, two long-range-ordered phases that break different symmetries are stabilized. The ordered phases feature partial and full, respectively, gap openings in the fermion spectrum. The first transition between the disordered and long-range-ordered semimetallic phases has previously been argued to be described by the $(2+1)$-dimensional Gross-Neveu-SO(3) field theory. By performing simulations with an improved symmetric Trotter decomposition, we further substantiate this claim by computing the critical exponents $1/\nu$, $\eta_\phi$, and $\eta_\psi$, which turn out to be consistent with the field-theoretical expectation within numerical and analytical uncertainties. The second transition between the two long-range-ordered phases has previously been proposed as a possible instance of a metallic deconfined quantum critical point. We further develop this scenario by analyzing the spectral functions in the single-particle, particle-hole, and particle-particle channels. Our results indicate gapless excitations with a unique velocity, supporting the emergence of Lorentz symmetry at criticality. We also compute the finite-temperature phase boundaries of the ordered states above the fully gapped state at large interaction. The phase boundaries vanishes smoothly in the vicinity of the putative metallic deconfined quantum critical point, in agreement with the expectation for a continuous or weakly-first-order transition.</description>
