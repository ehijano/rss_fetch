      <description>arXiv:2512.11133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter gives an overview of the core concepts of machine learning (ML) -- the use of algorithms that learn from data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed -- that are relevant to particle physics with some examples of applications to the energy, intensity, cosmic, and accelerator frontiers.</description>

      <title>Universal and non-universal facets of quantum critical phenomena unveiled along the Schmidt decomposition theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of the spin magnitude $S$ on the quantum Gr\"uneisen parameter $\Gamma^{0\text{K}}_q$ right at critical points (CPs) for the 1D Ising model under a transverse magnetic field. Our findings are fourfold: $\textit{i)}$ for higher $S$, $\Gamma^{0\text{K}}_q$ is increased, but remains finite, reflecting the enhancement of the Hilbert space dimensionality; $\textit{ii)}$ the Schmidt decomposition theorem recovers the extensivity of the nonadditive $q$-entropy $S_q$ only for a $\textit{special}$ value of the entropic index $q$; $\textit{iii)}$ the universality class in the frame of $S_q$ depends only on the symmetry of the system; $\textit{iv)}$ we propose an experimental setup to explore finite size effects in connection with the Hilbert space occupation at CPs. Our findings unveil both universal and non-universal aspects of quantum criticality in terms of $\Gamma^{0\text{K}}_q$ and $S_q$.</description>

      <title>Optimal dismantling of directed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a fundamental problem in network science, network dismantling focuses on identifying a set of critical nodes whose removal sharply reduces a network's connectivity and functionality. Potential applications include stopping rumor spread, blocking sentiment propagation, and controlling epidemics and pandemics. Previous studies have mainly focused on undirected networks, whereas many real-world networks are inherently directed, such as the World Wide Web and the global trade system. Moreover, the functionality of directed networks depends on the giant strongly connected component (GSCC), where nodes are mutually reachable. Considering both the directionality and heterogeneity of these networks, we propose a novel centrality measure, network incoherence (NI) centrality, and develop a trophic analysis-based dismantling (TAD) method, in which nodes are removed in descending order according to their NI centrality scores, aiming to efficiently dismantle directed networks by reducing the GSCC. When applied to a wide range of benchmark synthetic networks with varying degree heterogeneity and 15 real-world directed networks, our TAD method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Significantly, TAD also induces the largest maximum avalanches during the dismantling process, highlighting its ability to capture structurally critical nodes. These findings provide new insight into the structure-function relationship of directed networks and inform the design of more resilient systems against perturbations.</description>

      <title>On the risk of fatigue failure of structural elements exposed to bottom wave slamming -- Impulse response regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19899v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study aims to investigate whether fatigue damage induced by bottom wave slamming can be a failure mode important to consider when sizing a marine structural element. The body exposed to wave impacts is assumed to have a shape and structural arrangement such that the duration of wave-impact loads is short relative to the structure's vibratory response time. In this dynamical regime, fatigue is found to be a potentially important failure mechanism: accounting for the risk of failure due to fatigue damage may result in design constraints that are significantly more conservative than those based on the risk of ultimate strength exceedance. The role of fatigue damage depends on the elevation of the body. It is predominant for low elevations, for which slamming events are frequent. Since this study aims to provide general insight, the specific details of the body, such as its shape and structural arrangement, are not specified. Instead, a general framework is used for the analysis. The way forward to address a specific case study, possibly including the effects of forward and seakeeping motions, is briefly explained.</description>

      <title>Efficient Exploration of Chemical Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating reaction rates and chemical stability is fundamental, yet efficient methods for large-scale simulations remain out of reach despite advances in modeling and exascale computing. Direct simulation is limited by short timescales; machine-learned potentials require large data sets and struggle with transition state regions essential for reaction rates. Reaction network exploration with sufficient accuracy is hampered by the computational cost of electronic structure calculations, and even simplifications like harmonic transition state theory rely on prohibitively expensive saddle point searches. Surrogate model-based acceleration has been promising but hampered by overhead and numerical instability.
  This dissertation presents a holistic solution, co-designing physical representations, statistical models, and systems architecture in the Optimal Transport Gaussian Process (OT-GP) framework. Using physics-aware optimal transport metrics, OT-GP creates compact, chemically relevant surrogates of the potential energy surface, underpinned by statistically robust sampling. Alongside EON software rewrites for long timescale simulations, we introduce reinforcement learning approaches for both minimum-mode following (when the final state is unknown) and nudged elastic band methods (when endpoints are specified). Collectively, these advances establish a representation-first, modular approach to chemical kinetics simulation. Large-scale benchmarks and Bayesian hierarchical validation demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and practical exploration of chemical kinetics, transforming a longstanding theoretical promise into a working engine for discovery.</description>

      <title>Exact fluctuation relation for open systems beyond the Jarzynski equality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive exact fluctuation equalities for open systems that recover free energy differences between two equilibrium endpoints connected by nonequilibrium processes with arbitrary dynamics and coupling. The exponential of the free energy difference is expressed in terms of ensemble averages of the Hamiltonian of mean force (HMF) shift and the chi-squared divergence between the initial and final marginal probability distribution of the open system. A trajectory counterpart of this relation follows from an asymptotic equilibration postulate, which treats relaxation to the final stationary canonical state as a boundary condition rather than as a consequence of constraints on the driven dynamics. In the frozen-coupling regime, the HMF shift reduces to the bare-system Hamiltonian shift, yielding a clear heat-work decomposition. The Jarzynski equality (JE) is recovered under the assumption of Hamiltonian dynamics for the combined system. We validate the theory on a dissipative, phase-space-compressing drive followed by an underdamped Langevin relaxation, where the assumptions underlying the JE break down, whereas our equality reproduces the exact free energy differences.</description>
