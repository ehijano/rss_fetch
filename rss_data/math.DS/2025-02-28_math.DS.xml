      <title>Measure rigidity and equidistribution for fractal carpets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\theta$ be a Bernoulli measure which is stationary for a random walk generated by finitely many contracting rational affine dilations of $\mathbb{R}^d$, and let $\mathcal{K} = \mathrm{supp}(\theta)$ be the corresponding attractor. An example in dimension $d=1$ is the Hausdorff measure on Cantor's middle thirds set, and examples in higher dimensions include missing digits sets, Sierpi\'nski carpets and Menger sponges. Let $\nu$ denote the image of $\theta$ under the map $\mathcal{K} \to \mathrm{SL}_{d+1}(\mathbb{R})/\mathrm{SL}_{d+1}(\mathbb{Z})$ which sends $x$ to the lattice $\Lambda_x = \mathrm{span}_{\mathbb{Z}}(e_1,\ldots,e_d,e_{d+1} + (x,0))$. We prove equidistribution of the pushforward measures $a_{n*}\nu$ along any diverging sequence of diagonal matrices $(a_n)\subset\mathrm{SL}_{d+1}(\mathbb{R})$ that expand the first $d$ coordinates under a natural non-escape of mass condition. The latter condition is known to hold whenever $\theta$ is absolutely friendly. We also show that weighted badly approximable vectors and Dirichlet-improvable vectors (for arbitrary norm) form a subset of $\mathcal{K}$ of $\theta$-measure zero. The key ingredient is a measure classification theorem for the stationary measures of an associated random walk on an $S$-arithmetic space, introduced by the two first-named authors in earlier work. A new feature of this setting is that this random walk admits stationary measures which are not invariant.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics in pulse-modulated feedback drug dosing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulse-modulated feedback is utilized in drug dosing to mimic sustained over a longer period of time manual discrete dose administration, the latter is in contrast with continuous drug infusion. The intermittent mode of dosing calls for a hybrid (continuous-discrete) modeling of the closed-loop system, where the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug are captured by differential equations whereas the control law is described by difference equations. Hybrid dynamics are highly nonlinear which complicates formal design of pulse-modulated feedback. This paper demonstrates complex nonlinear dynamical phenomena arising in a simple control system of dosing a neuromuscular blockade agent in anesthesia. Along with the nominal periodic regimen, undesirable nonlinear behaviors, i.e. periodic solutions of high multiplicity, multistability, as well as deterministic chaos, are shown to exist. It is concluded that design of feedback drug dosing algorithms based on a hybrid paradigm has to be informed by a thorough bifurcation analysis in order to secure patient safety.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution of saddle periodic points for H\'enon-like maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that under the natural assumption over the dynamical degrees, the saddle periodic points of a H\'enon-like map in any dimension equidistribute with respect to the equilibrium measure. Our work is a generalization of results of Bedford-Lyubich-Smillie, Dujardin and Dinh-Sibony along with improvements of their techniques. We also investigate some fine properties of Green currents associated with the map. On the pluripotential-theory side, in our non-compact setting, the wedge product of two positive closed currents of complementary bi-degrees can be defined using super-potentials and the density theory. We prove that these two definitions are coherent.</description>

      <title>Impilict Runge-Kutta based sparse identification of governing equations in biologically motivated systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying governing equations in physical and biological systems from datasets remains a long-standing challenge across various scientific disciplines, providing mechanistic insights into complex system evolution. Common methods like sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) often rely on precise derivative estimations, making them vulnerable to data scarcity and noise. This study presents a novel data-driven framework by integrating high order implicit Runge-Kutta methods (IRKs) with the sparse identification, termed IRK-SINDy. The framework exhibits remarkable robustness to data scarcity and noise by leveraging the lower stepsize constraint of IRKs. Two methods for incorporating IRKs into sparse regression are introduced: one employs iterative schemes for numerically solving nonlinear algebraic system of equations, while the other utilizes deep neural networks to predict stage values of IRKs. The performance of IRK-SINDy is demonstrated through numerical experiments on benchmark problems with varied dynamical behaviors, including linear and nonlinear oscillators, the Lorenz system, and biologically relevant models like predator-prey dynamics, logistic growth, and the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Results indicate that IRK-SINDy outperforms conventional SINDy and the RK4-SINDy framework, particularly under conditions of extreme data scarcity and noise, yielding interpretable and generalizable models.</description>

      <title>Dynamics on Lie groups with applications to attitude estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of filtering - propagation of probability densities through stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and association of measurement data using Bayesian inference - of objects whose state space forms a Lie group is considered. Particular emphasis is given to concentrated Gaussians (CGs) as a parametric family of probability distributions to capture the uncertainty associated with an estimated group element. The so-called group-affine property of the vector field governing the state time evolution is shown to be a necessary and sufficient condition for the linearity of the dynamics expressed in terms of exponential coordinates, in turn implying the family of CGs is invariant under such evolution. A physically-motivated SDE on the group is then reformulated as an SDE on the associated Lie algebra via exponential coordinates. The vector space structure of the Lie algebra together with the notion of a CG enables the leveraging of techniques from conventional Gaussian-based Kalman filtering in an approach called the tangent space filter (TSF). We provide example calculations for several Lie groups that arise in the problem of estimating position, velocity, and orientation of a rigid body from a noisy, potentially biased inertial measurement unit (IMU). For the specific problem of attitude estimation, it is shown through numerical experiments that TSF-based approaches are more accurate and robust than another widely used attitude filtering technique.</description>

      <title>A predator-prey model with age-structured role reversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a predator-prey model with an age-structured predator population that exhibits a functional role reversal. The structure of the predator population in our model embodies the ecological concept of an "ontogenetic niche shift", in which a species' functional role changes as it grows. This structure adds complexity to our model but increases its biological relevance. The time evolution of the age-structured predator population is motivated by the Kermack-McKendrick Renewal Equation (KMRE). Unlike KMRE, the predator population's birth and death rate functions depend on the prey population's size. We establish the existence, uniqueness, and positivity of the solutions to the proposed model's initial value problem. The dynamical properties of the proposed model are investigated via Latin Hypercube Sampling in the 15-dimensional space of its parameters. Our Linear Discriminant Analysis suggests that the most influential parameters are the maturation age of the predator and the rate of consumption of juvenile predators by the prey. We carry out a detailed study of the long-term behavior of the proposed model as a function of these two parameters. In addition, we reduce the proposed age-structured model to ordinary and delayed differential equation (ODE and DDE) models. The comparison of the long-term behavior of the ODE, DDE, and the age-structured models with matching parameter settings shows that the age structure promotes the instability of the Coexistence Equilibrium and the emergence of the Coexistence Periodic Attractor.</description>

      <title>ServoLNN: Lagrangian Neural Networks Driven by Servomechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining deep learning with classical physics facilitates the efficient creation of accurate dynamical models. In a recent class of neural network, Lagrangian mechanics is hard-coded into the architecture, and training the network learns the given system. However, the current architectures do not facilitate the modelling of dynamical systems that are driven by servomechanisms (e.g. servomotors, stepper motors, current sources, volumetric pumps). This article presents ServoLNN, a new architecture to model dynamical systems that are driven by servomechanisms. ServoLNN is compatible for use in real-time applications, where the driving motion is known only just-in-time. A PyTorch implementation of ServoLNN is provided. The derivations and results reveal the occurrence of a possible family of solutions that the training may converge on. The effect of the family of solutions on the predicted physical quantities is explored, as is the resolution to reduce the family of solutions to a single solution. Resultantly, the architecture can simultaneously accurately find the energies, power, rate of work, mass matrix, generalised accelerations, generalised forces, and the generalised forces that drive the servomechanisms.</description>

      <title>On Piecewise Affine Reachability with Bellman Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A piecewise affine map is one of the simplest mathematical objects exhibiting complex dynamics. The reachability problem of piecewise affine maps is given as follows: Given two vectors $\mathbf{s}, \mathbf{t} \in \mathbb{Q}^d$ and a piecewise affine map $f$, is there $n\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $f^{n}(\mathbf{s}) = \mathbf{t}$? Koiran, Cosnard, and Garzon show that the reachability problem of piecewise affine maps is undecidable even in dimension 2.
  Most of the recent progress has been focused on decision procedures for one-dimensional piecewise affine maps, where the reachability problem has been shown to be decidable for some subclasses. However, the general undecidability discouraged research into positive results in arbitrary dimension.
  In this work, we consider a rich subclass of piecewise affine maps defined by Bellman operators of Markov decision processes (MDPs). We then investigate the restriction of the piecewise affine reachability problem to that with Bellman operators and, in particular, its decidability in any dimension. As one of our primary contributions, we establish the decidability of reachability for two-dimensional Bellman operators, in contrast to the negative result known for general piecewise affine maps.</description>

      <title>Locally homogeneous Axiom A flows II: geometric structures for Anosov subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a non-compact semisimple real Lie group $G$ and an Anosov subgroup $\Gamma$, we utilize the correspondence between $\mathbb R$-valued additive characters on Levi subgroups $L$ of $G$ and $\mathbb R$-affine homogeneous line bundles over $G/L$ to systematically construct families of non-empty domains of proper discontinuity for the $\Gamma$-action. If $\Gamma$ is torsion-free, the analytic dynamical systems on the quotients are Axiom A, and assemble into a single partially hyperbolic multiflow. Each Axiom A system admits global analytic stable/unstable foliations with non-wandering set a single basic set on which the flow is conjugate to Sambarino's refraction flow, establishing that all refraction flows arise in this fashion. Furthermore, the $\mathbb R$-valued additive character is regular if and only if the associated Axiom A system admits a compatible pseudo-Riemannian metric and contact structure, which we relate to the Poisson structure on the dual of the Lie algebra of $G$.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of an Impulsive VS-EIAR Epidemic Model with Application to COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a VS-EIAR epidemiological model that incorporates vaccinated individuals $\{V_i : i = 1, \ldots, n\}$, where $n \in \mathbb{N}^{*}$. The dynamics of the VS-EIAR model are governed by a system of ordinary differential equations describing the evolution of vaccinated, susceptible, exposed, infected, asymptomatic, and deceased population groups. Our primary objective is to minimize the number of susceptible, exposed, infected, and asymptomatic individuals by administering vaccination doses to susceptible individuals and providing treatment to the infected population. To achieve this, we employ optimal control theory to regulate the epidemic dynamics within an optimal terminal time $\tau^{*}$. Using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP), we establish the existence of an optimal control pair $(v^{*}(t), u^{*}(t))$. Additionally, we extend the model to an impulsive VS-EIAR framework, with particular emphasis on the impact of immigration and population movement. Finally, we present numerical simulations to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate their practical applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00585v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the problem of bounding the Fourier transforms of stationary measures of iterated function systems (IFSs) and how the pseudo-randomness of the IFS either due to arithmetic, algebraic or geometric reasons is reflected in the behaviour of the Fourier transform. We outline various methods that have been built to estimate the Fourier transform of stationary measures arising e.g. from thermodynamical formalism, additive combinatorics, random walks on groups and hyperbolic dynamics. Open problems, prospects and recent links to quantum chaos are also highlighted.</description>

      <title>Explain the Black Box for the Sake of Science: the Scientific Method in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10557v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scientific method is the cornerstone of human progress across all branches of the natural and applied sciences, from understanding the human body to explaining how the universe works. The scientific method is based on identifying systematic rules or principles that describe the phenomenon of interest in a reproducible way that can be validated through experimental evidence. In the era of generative artificial intelligence, there are discussions on how AI systems may discover new knowledge. We argue that human complex reasoning for scientific discovery remains of vital importance, at least before the advent of artificial general intelligence. Yet, AI can be leveraged for scientific discovery via explainable AI. More specifically, knowing the `principles' the AI systems used to make decisions can be a point of contact with domain experts and scientists, that can lead to divergent or convergent views on a given scientific problem. Divergent views may spark further scientific investigations leading to interpretability-guided explanations (IGEs), and possibly to new scientific knowledge. We define this field as Explainable AI for Science, where domain experts -- potentially assisted by generative AI -- formulate scientific hypotheses and explanations based on the interpretability of a predictive AI system.</description>
