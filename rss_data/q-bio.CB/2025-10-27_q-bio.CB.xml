      <title>Beyond Autophagy: VPS39 Deficiency Triggers Migrasome-Driven Stress Adaptation Revealed by Super-Resolution Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autophagy and migrasome formation constitute critical cellular mechanisms for maintaining cellular homeostasis, however, their potential compensatory interplay remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify VPS39, a core component of the HOPS complex, as a molecular switch coordinating these processes. Genetic ablation of VPS39 not only impairs autophagic flux but also triggers cell migration through RhoA/Rac1 GTPases upregulation, consequently facilitating migrasome formation. Using super-resolution microscopy, we further demonstrate that migrasomes serve as an alternative disposal route for damaged mitochondria during VPS39-induced autophagy impairment, revealing a novel stress adaptation mechanism. Our work establishes a previously unrecognized autophagy-migrasome axis and provides direct visual evidence of organelle quality control via migrasomal extrusion. These findings position VPS39-regulated pathway switching as a potential therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases characterized by autophagy dysfunction.</description>

      <title>Glymphatic Clearance in the Optic Nerve: A Multidomain Electro-osmostic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective metabolic waste clearance and maintaining ionic homeostasis are essential for the health and normal function of the central nervous system. To understand its mechanism and the role of fluid flow, we develop a multidomain electro-osmotic model of optic-nerve microcirculation that couples hydrostatic and osmotic fluid transport with electro-diffusive solute movement across axons, glia, the extracellular space, and arterial/venous/capillary perivascular spaces. Cerebrospinal fluid enters the optic nerve via the arterial parivascular space, passes both the glial and ECS before exiting through the venous parivascular space. Exchanges across astrocytic endfeet are essential and they occur in two distinct and coupled paths: through AQP4 on glial membranes and gaps between glial endfeet, thus establishing a mechanistic substrate for two modes of glymphatic transport, at rest and during stimulus-evoked perturbations. Parameter sweeps show that lowering AQP4-mediated fluid permeability or PVS permeability elevates pressure, suppresses radial exchange and slows clearance, effects most pronounced for solutes reliant on PVS V export. The model reproduces baseline and stimulus-evoked flow and demonstrates that PVS-mediated export is the primary clearance route for both small and moderate solutes. Small molecules clear faster because rapid ECS diffusion broadens their distribution and enhances ECS PVS exchange, whereas moderate species have low ECS diffusivity, depend on transendfoot transfer, and clear more slowly via PVS V convection. Our framework can also be used to explain the sleep-wake effect mechanistically: enlarging ECS volume or permeability increases transinterface flux and accelerates waste removal.</description>
