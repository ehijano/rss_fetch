      <title>Global Bifurcation in Symmetric Systems of Nonlinear Wave Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we use the equivariant degree theory to establish a global bifurcation result for the existence of non-stationary branches of solutions to a nonlinear, two-parameter family of hyperbolic wave equations with local delay and non-trivial damping. As a motivating example, we consider an application of our result to a system of $N$ identical vibrating strings with dihedral coupling relations.</description>

      <title>Existence and non-existence of normalized solutions for a nonlinear fractional Schr\"odinger system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a nonlinear fractional Sch\"ordinger system in $\mathbb{{R}}$ with intraspecies interactions $a_{i}&gt;0 \ (i=1,2)$ and interspecies interactions $\beta \in\mathbb{{R}}$. We study this system by solving an associated constrained minimization problem (i.e., $L^2-$norm constrains). Under certain assumptions on the trapping potentials $V_i(x) \ (i=1,2),$ we derive some delicate estimates for the related energy functional and establish a criterion for the existence and non-existence of solutions, in which way several existence results are obtained.</description>

      <title>Free boundary regularity for almost minimizers of the parabolic Signorini problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the regularity of the "regular" part of the free boundary for almost minimizers in the parabolic Signorini problem with zero thin obstacle. This work is a continuation of our earlier research on the regularity of almost minimizers. We first establish the Weiss-type monotonicity formula by comparing almost minimizers with parabolically homogeneous replacements and utilizing conformal self-similar coordinates. Subsequently, by deriving the Almgren-type frequency formula and applying the epiperimetric inequality, we obtain the optimal growth near regular free boundary points and achieve the regularity of the regular set.</description>

      <title>Regularity of Solution of the Schr\"odinger Equation on Symmetric Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the behavior of solutions \( u(x,t) \) to the fractional Schr\"odinger equation on rank symmetric spaces of non-compact type. We proved that as time \( t \) approaches $0$, then $u(x,t)$ converges pointwise almost everywhere to the initial radial data \( f \), provided that \( f \in H^s(\mathbb{X}) \) with \( s &gt; \frac{1}{2} \). This result extends Sj\"olin's results in this setting.</description>

      <title>Comparison principles for 3-D steady potential flow in spherical coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the 3-D steady potential flow for a compressible gas with pressure satisfying $p'(\rho)=\rho^{\gamma-1}$, where $\rho$ is the density and $\gamma\geq-1$ is a constant. In spherical coordinates, the potential equation is of mixed type in the unit sphere. We establish a strong comparison principle for elliptic solutions of the equation. The main difference from the classical case is that the coefficients of this equation depend fully on the potential function itself. We overcome this difficulty by the sufficient analysis on the structure of the equation itself, and finally derive the result. The result obtained here can be applied to the problem of supersonic flow over a delta wing and other problems related to gas dynamics.</description>

      <title>Riemann boundary value problems for the Chaplygin gas outside a convex cornered wedge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional Riemann boundary value problems of Euler equations for the Chaplygin gas with two piecewise constant initial data outside a convex cornered wedge. In self-similar coordinates, when the flow at the wedge corner is subsonic, this problem can be reformulated as a boundary value problem for nonlinear degenerate elliptic equations in concave domains containing a corner larger than $\pi$. It is shown that there does not exist a global Lipschitz solution for this case. We analyze the sign of the flow velocity along a certain direction, and then obtain this result by deriving a contradiction. Besides, the unique existence of the solution to the problem is established when the flow at the wedge corner is supersonic. The results obtained here are also valid for the problem of shock diffraction by a convex cornered wedge.</description>

      <title>Non-Leray-Hopf solutions to 3D stochastic hyper-viscous Navier-stokes equations: beyond the Lions exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the 3D stochastic Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) on torus where the viscosity exponent can be larger than the Lions exponent 5/4. For arbitrarily prescribed divergence-free initial data in $L^{2}_x$, we construct infinitely many probabilistically strong and analytically weak solutions in the class $L^{r}_{\Omega}L_{t}^{\gamma}W_{x}^{s,p}$, where $r\geq1$ and $(s, \gamma, p)$ lie in two supercritical regimes with respect to the Lady\v{z}henskaya-Prodi-Serrin (LPS) criteria.It shows that even in the high viscosity regime beyond the Lions exponent, though solutions are unique in the Leray-Hopf class, the uniqueness fails in the mixed Lebesgue spaces and, actually, there exist infinitely manly non-Leray-Hopf solutions which can be very close to the Leray-Hopf solutions. Furthermore, we prove the vanishing noise limit result, which relates together the stochastic solutions and the deterministic solutions constructed by Buckmaster-Vicol [4] and the recent work [23].</description>

      <title>Stein-Weiss problems via nonlinear Rayleigh quotient for concave-convex nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we consider existence and multiplicity of positive solutions for nonlocal elliptic problems driven by the Stein-Weiss problem with concave-convex nonlinearities defined in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^N$. More precisely, we consider the following nonlocal elliptic problem:
  \begin{equation*}
  - \Delta u + V(x)u = \lambda a(x) |u|^{q-2} u + \displaystyle \int \limits_{\mathbb{R}^N}\frac{b(y)\vert u(y) \vert^p dy}{\vert x\vert^\alpha\vert x-y\vert^\mu \vert y\vert^\alpha} b(x)\vert u\vert^{p-2}u, \,\, \hbox{in}\ \mathbb{R}^N, \,\, u\in H^1(\mathbb{R}^N),
  \end{equation*}
  where $\lambda &gt;0, \alpha \in (0,N), N\geq3,
  0&lt;\mu&lt;N, 0 &lt;
  \mu + 2 \alpha &lt; N$. Furthermore, we assume also that $V: \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}$ is a bounded potential, $a \in{L}^r(\mathbb{R}^N), a &gt; 0$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$ and
  $b\in{L}^{t}(\mathbb{R}^N), b&gt;0$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$ for some specific $r, t &gt; 1$. We assume also that $1\leq q&lt;2$ and $2_{\alpha,\mu} &lt; p&lt;2_{\alpha,\mu}^*$ where $2_{\alpha ,\mu}=(2N-2\alpha-\mu)/N$ and $2_{\alpha,\mu}^*= (2N-2\alpha-\mu)/(N-2)$.
  Our main contribution is to find the largest $\lambda^* &gt; 0$ in such way that our main problem admits at least two positive solutions for each $\lambda \in (0, \lambda^*)$. In order to do that we apply the nonlinear Rayleigh quotient together with the Nehari method. Moreover, we prove a Brezis-Lieb type Lemma and a regularity result taking into account our setting due to the potentials $a, b : \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal elliptic systems via nonlinear Rayleigh quotient with general concave and coupling nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we shall investigate existence and multiplicity of solutions for a nonlocal elliptic systems driven by the fractional Laplacian. Specifically, we establish the existence of two positive solutions for following class of nonlocal elliptic systems: 
  \begin{equation*}
  \left\{\begin{array}{lll}
  (-\Delta)^su +V_1(x)u = \lambda|u|^{p - 2}u+ \frac{\alpha}{\alpha+\beta}\theta |u|^{\alpha - 2}u|v|^{\beta}, \;\;\; \mbox{in}\;\;\; \mathbb{R}^N,
  (-\Delta)^sv +V_2(x)v= \lambda|v|^{q - 2}v+ \frac{\beta}{\alpha+\beta}\theta |u|^{\alpha}|v|^{\beta-2}v, \;\;\; \mbox{in}\;\;\; \mathbb{R}^N,
  (u, v) \in H^s(\mathbb{R}^N) \times H^s(\mathbb{R}^N).
  \end{array}\right.
  \end{equation*}
  Here we mention that $\alpha &gt; 1, \beta &gt; 1, 1 \leq p \leq q &lt; 2 &lt; \alpha + \beta &lt; 2^*_s$, $\theta &gt; 0, \lambda &gt; 0, N &gt; 2s$, and $s \in (0,1)$. Notice also that continuous potentials $V_1, V_2: \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfy some extra assumptions. Furthermore, we find the largest positive number $\lambda^* &gt; 0$ such that our main problem admits at least two positive solutions for each $ \lambda \in (0, \lambda^*)$. This can be done by using the nonlinear Rayleigh quotient together with the Nehari method. The main feature here is to minimize the energy functional in Nehari manifold which allows us to prove our main results without any restriction on size of parameter $\theta &gt; 0$.</description>

      <title>Dissipation and Regularity in the Smagorinsky Model with Dynamic Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents an innovative extension of the Smagorinsky model incorporating dynamic boundary conditions and advanced regularity methods. We formulate the modified Navier-Stokes equations with the Smagorinsky term to model dissipation in turbulence and prove theorems concerning the existence, uniqueness, and asymptotic behavior of solutions. The first theorem establishes the existence and uniqueness of solutions in higher Sobolev spaces, considering the effect of the nonlinear Smagorinsky term and dynamic boundary conditions. The proof employs the Galerkin method and energy estimates, culminating in the application of Gr\"onwall's theorem. The second theorem investigates the asymptotic behavior of solutions, focusing on anomalous dissipation in high-turbulence regimes. We demonstrate that the dissipated energy does not decrease with vanishing viscosity, indicating the occurrence of anomalous dissipation. The third theorem explores advanced regularity in higher Sobolev spaces, allowing for more rigorous control of nonlinear terms and ensuring improved stability conditions. The proof utilizes the energy method combined with Sobolev estimates and Gr\"onwall's inequality. These mathematical results are fundamental for the analysis of dissipation in turbulent flows and can inspire new approaches in numerical simulations of fluids.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of hybrid inverse problems in limited view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid inverse problems such as Acousto-Electric Tomography, Current Density Imaging or Magnetic Resonance Electric Impedance Tomography are concerned with reconstructing the electrical conductivity from interior measurements. For a two-dimensional object the measurements correspond to two different functions imposed as the Neumann boundary condition to an elliptic PDE. In limited view these functions are only non-zero on the part of the boundary that one can control. In this paper we address how to choose such boundary functions in limited view such that the reconstruction procedure is feasible. This is related to the corresponding Jacobian being non-zero. We supplement the theoretical results by numerical reconstructions following the approach of Acousto-Electric Tomography.</description>

      <title>On pseudo almost Periodic Solutions of the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the existence, uniqueness and exponential stability of pseudo almost periodic (PAP-) mild solutions of the parabolic-elliptic (P-E) Keller-Segel system on a bounded domain $\Omega\in \mathbb{R}^n$ with smooth boundary. First, the well-posedness of the corresponding linear system is established by using the smoothing estimates of the Neumann heat semigroup on $\Omega$. Then, the existence of PAP-mild solution of linear system is done by proving a Massera-type principle. Next, we obtain the well-posedness of such solutions for semilinear system by using the results of linear system and fixed point arguments. The exponential stability is proven by using again the estimates of the Neumann heat semigroup. Finally, we discuss also such results for the case of the Keller-Segel system on the framework of real hyperbolic manifolds.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish a Liouville theorem for solutions to the Lane Emden equation involving Baouendi Grushin operators. We focus on solutions that are stable outside a compact set. Specifically, we prove that when p is smaller than the Joseph Lundgren exponent and differs from the Sobolev exponent, 0 is the unique solution stable outside a compact set. This work extends the results obtained by Farina (J. Math. Pures Appl., 87 (5) (2007)).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the partial data inverse problem for nonlinear magnetic Schr\"odinger equations. We show that the knowledge of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, measured on an arbitrary part of the boundary, determines the time-dependent linear coefficients, electric and magnetic potentials, and nonlinear coefficients, provided that the divergence of the magnetic potential is given. Additionally, we also investigate both the forward and inverse problems for the linear magnetic Schr\"odinger equation with a time-dependent leading term. In particular, all coefficients are uniquely recovered from boundary data.</description>

      <title>Fluid relaxation approximation of the Busenberg--Travis cross-diffusion system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Busenberg--Travis cross-diffusion system for segregating populations is approximated by the compressible Navier--Stokes--Korteweg equations on the torus, including a density-dependent viscosity and drag forces. The Korteweg term can be associated to the quantum Bohm potential. The singular asymptotic limit is proved rigorously using compactness and relative entropy methods. The novelty is the derivation of energy and entropy inequalities, which reduce in the asymptotic limit to the Boltzmann--Shannon and Rao entropy inequalities, thus revealing the double entropy structure of the limiting Busenberg--Travis system.</description>

Abstract: In bounded $n$-dimensional domains with $n\ge 3$, this manuscript considers an initial-boundary problem for a quasilinear chemotaxis system with indirect attractant production, as arising, inter alia, in the modeling of effects due to phenotypical heterogeneity in microbial populations. Under the assumption that the rates $D$ and $S$ of diffusion and cross-diffusion are suitably regular functions of the population density, essentially exhibiting asymptotic behavior of the form \[
  D(\xi) \simeq \xi^{m-1}
  \quad \mbox{and} \quad
  S(\xi) \simeq \xi^\sigma,
  \qquad \xi \simeq \infty, \] the identity \[
  \sigma=m-1+\frac{4}{n}
  \qquad \qquad (n\ge 3), \] is shown to determine a critical line for the occurrence of blow-up. This considerably differs from low-dimensional cases, in which the relation \[
  \sigma=m+\frac{2}{n}
  \qquad \qquad (n\le 2) \] is known to play a correspondingly pivotal role.</description>

      <title>Quantitative bounds for bounded solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations in endpoint critical Besov spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the quantitative regularity and blow-up criteria for classical solutions to the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a critical Besov space setting. Specifically, we consider solutions $u\in L^\infty_T(\dot{B}_{p,\infty}^{-1+\frac{3}{p}})$ such that $|D|^{-1+\frac{3}{p}}|u|\in L^\infty_t (L_x^p)$ with $3&lt;p&lt;\infty$. by establishing delicate regularity estimates and substantially improving the strategy in \cite{Tao_20}, we are able to overcome difficulties stemming from the low regularity of $\dot{B}_{p,\infty}^{-1+\frac{3}{p}}$ and derive quantitative bounds for solutions $u$ involving a quadruple exponential of their Besov norm and a double exponent of $L^p$ norm of $|D|^{-1+\frac{3}{p}}|u|$. As a consequence, we establish a new blow-up rate for solutions blowing up at a finite time expressed in terms of quadruple and double logarithms of the two critical norms respectively. This work provides improved insights into blow-up criteria and makes a significant contribution to the advancement of research on the Navier-Stokes equations in critical Besov spaces.</description>

      <title>On hydrostatic limit of Beris-Edwards system in a thin strip</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the scaled anisotropic co-rotational Beris-Edwards system modeling the hydrodynamic motion of nematic liquid crystals in a thin strip of 3D. We prove the global well-posedness of anisotropic system, and we show that for hydrostatic limt system, $(u,v)$ as the solution of hydrostatic Prandtl system, if there ratio between derivatives of the vertical variable has distance from certain values, then we have the exponential decay of the Q-tensor system. Moreover, we justify the limit from the anisotropic system to the hydrostatic system in Sobolev space.</description>

      <title>Complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation for positive $(p,p)$ forms on compact K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation for differential $(p,p)$ forms is introduced on compact K\"ahler manifolds. For any $1 \leq p &lt; n$, we show the existence of smooth solutions unique up to adding constants. For $p=1$, this corresponds to the Calabi-Yau theorem proved by S. T. Yau, and for $p=n-1$, this gives the Monge-Amp\`ere equation for $(n-1)$ plurisubharmonic functions solved by Tosatti-Weinkove. For other $p$ values, this defines a non-linear PDE that falls outside of the general framework of Caffarelli-Nirenberg-Spruck. Further, we define a geometric flow for higher-order forms that preserves their cohomology classes, and extends the K\"ahler-Ricci flow naturally to $(p,p)$ forms. As a consequence of our main theorem, we show that this flow exists in a maximal time interval and can be shown to converge under some assumptions. A modified flow is introduced in order to study the evolution of Hodge classes of $M$ with respect to the rational span of Chern classes of holomoprhic vector bundles. The convergence of the associated normalized flow is shown and some potential applications are discussed.</description>

      <title>On The Hydrostatic Approximation of Navier-Stokes-Maxwell System with 2D Electronic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the local well-posedness of a scaled anisotropic Navier-Stokes-Maxwell system in a two-dimensional striped domain with a transverse magnetic field around $ (0,0,1)$ in Gevrey-2 class. We also justify the limit from the scaled anisotropic equations to the associated hydrostatic system and obtain the precise convergence rate. Then, we prove the global well-posedness for the system and show that small perturbations near $(0,0,1)$ decay exponentially in time. Finally, we show the optimality of the Gevrey-2 regularity by proving the solution to linearized hydrostatic system around shear flows $(V(y),0,0)=(y(1-y),0,0)$ with some initial data $(\zeta, \zeta ^1)$ grows exponentially. More precisely, for some large parameter $ \lvert k \rvert&gt;M\gg 1 $ corresponding to the frequency in $x$, there exists a solution $ h_k(t,x,y)$ of the system
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases} \partial_{tt}h_k+\partial_th_k-\partial_{yy}h_k+V(y) \partial_x h_k =0,\\
  h_k(0,x,y)=\zeta,\quad \partial_th_k(0,x,y)= \zeta ^1,\\
  h_k(t, x,0)=h_k(t, x, 1)=0, \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
  such that for any $s\in [0,\frac{1}{2})$ and $t\in [T_k,T_0)$ with $T_{k}\approx |k|^{s-\frac{1}{2}}\to 0$ as $|k|\to \infty$ and some $T_0$ small and independent of $k$, it satisfies
  \begin{align*}
  \lVert h_k(t) \rVert_{L^2 }\geq C \, e^{\sqrt{|k|}t}( \lVert \zeta \rVert_{L^2} + \lVert \zeta ^1 \rVert_{L^2}),
  \end{align*}
  for some $C &gt; 0$ independent of $k$.</description>

      <title>Existence of solutions to Dirichlet boundary value problems of the stationary relativistic Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Dirichlet boundary value problem of steady-state relativistic Boltzmann equation in half-line with hard potential model, given the data for the outgoing particles at the boundary and a relativistic global Maxwellian with nonzero macroscopic velocities at the far field. We first explicitly address the sound speed for the relativistic Maxwellian in the far field, according to the eigenvalues of an operator based on macro-micro decomposition. Then we demonstrate that the solvability of the problem varies with the Mach number $\mathcal{M}^\infty$. If $\mathcal{M}^\infty&lt;-1$, a unique solution exists connecting the Dirichlet data and the far field Maxwellian when the boundary data is sufficiently close to the Maxwellian. If $\mathcal{M}^\infty&gt;-1$, such a solution exists only if the outgoing boundary data is small and satisfies certain solvability conditions. The proof is based on the macro-micro decomposition of solutions combined with an artificial damping term. A singular in velocity (at $p_1=0$ and $|p|\gg 1$) and spatially exponential decay weight is chosen to carry out the energy estimates. The result extends the previous work [Ukai, Yang, Yu, Comm. Math. Phys. 236, 373-393, 2003] to the relativistic problem.</description>

      <title>Variational Physics-informed Neural Operator (VINO) for Solving Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) is a required step in the simulation of natural and engineering systems. The associated computational costs significantly increase when exploring various scenarios, such as changes in initial or boundary conditions or different input configurations. This study proposes the Variational Physics-Informed Neural Operator (VINO), a deep learning method designed for solving PDEs by minimizing the energy formulation of PDEs. This framework can be trained without any labeled data, resulting in improved performance and accuracy compared to existing deep learning methods and conventional PDE solvers. By discretizing the domain into elements, the variational format allows VINO to overcome the key challenge in physics-informed neural operators, namely the efficient evaluation of the governing equations for computing the loss. Comparative results demonstrate VINO's superior performance, especially as the mesh resolution increases. As a result, this study suggests a better way to incorporate physical laws into neural operators, opening a new approach for modeling and simulating nonlinear and complex processes in science and engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the global well-posedness and long-time behavior of the general Ericksen--Leslie system in 2D under a magnetic field. The PDE system consists of Navier--Stokes equations and kinematic transport equations for the orientations of liquid crystal molecules. For liquid crystal molecules with fixed modulus in torus $\mathbb{T}^2$, we prove the well-posedness of steady-state solutions in order to prove that there exist global strong solutions to the general Ericksen--Leslie system, which are smooth away from the initial time, and the long-time behavior of the solutions is classified according to the $\mathbb{T}^2$ boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Sobolev space theory for the heat and time-fractional heat equations in non-smooth domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general $L_p$-solvability result for the classical heat equation and time-fractional heat equations in non-smooth domains with the zero Dirichlet boundary condition. We consider domains $\Omega$ admitting the Hardy inequality: There exists a constant $N&gt;0$ such that $$ \int_{\Omega}\Big|\frac{f(x)}{d(x,\partial\Omega)}\Big|^2\mathrm{d}x\leq N\int_{\Omega}|\nabla f|^2 \mathrm{d} x\quad\text{for any}\quad f\in C_c^{\infty}(\Omega)\,. $$ To illustrate the boundary behavior of solutions in a general framework, we employ a weight system composed of a superharmonic function and a distance function to the boundary. Further, we investigate applications for various non-smooth domains, including convex domains, domains with exterior cone condition, totally vanishing exterior Reifenberg domains, and domains $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ for which the Aikawa dimension of $\Omega^c$ is less than $d-2$. By using superharmonic functions tailored to the geometric conditions of the domain, we derive weighted $L_p$-solvability results for various non-smooth domains, with specific weight ranges that vary by domain condition. In addition, we provide an application for the H\"older continuity of solutions in domains with the volume density condition, and a pointwise estimate for solutions in Lipschitz cones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence of solutions to a type of super-Liouville equation on the compact Riemannian surface $M$ with boundary and with its Euler characteristic $\chi(M)&lt;0$. The boundary condition couples a Neumann condition for functions and a chirality boundary condition for spinors. Due to the generality of the equation, we introduce a weighted Dirac operator based on the solution to a related Liouville equation. Then we construct a Nehari manifold according to the spectral decomposition of the weighted Dirac operator, and use minimax theory on this Nehari manifold to show the existence of the non-trivial solutions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work the evolution of a fluid droplet in vacuum is considered. This means that the surface tension and the fluid forces are in equilibrium at the free boundary. The fluid is governed by the incompressible quasi-steady Stokes equation.
  We present higher order energy estimates for this setting in the planar case. In particular bounds of the curvature and its tangential derivative combined with the second and third spacial derivatives of the fluid velocity as respective dissipation. These estimates are shown to hold until the point of a topological degeneracy. They provide quantitative bounds, that depend on specific properties of the initial geometry only.
  The work contrasts previous approaches, which are based on the use of local coordinates and instead performs all estimates in an Eulerian setting. Indeed, the estimates provided here are geometrically intrinsic and collapse only once these intrinsic qualities break.</description>

Abstract: We study degenerate quasilinear elliptic equations on Riemannian manifolds and obtain several Liouville theorems. Notably, we provide rigorous proof asserting the nonexistence of positive solutions to the subcritical Lane-Emden-Fowler equations over complete Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. These findings serve as a significant generalization of Gidas and Spruck's pivotal work (Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 34, 525-598, 1981) which focused on the semilinear case, as well as Serrin and Zou's contributions (Acta Math. 189, 79-142, 2002) within the context of Euclidean geometries.</description>

      <title>Global smooth solutions of 2-D quadratically quasilinear wave equations with null conditions in exterior domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For 3-D quadratically quasilinear wave equations with or without null conditions in exterior domains, when the compatible initial data and Dirichlet boundary values are given, the global existence or the optimal existence time of small data smooth solutions have been established in early references. However, for 2-D quadratically quasilinear wave equations with null conditions in exterior domains, due to the slower space-time decay rates of solutions, it is unknown whether the global small solutions exist. In this paper, we are concerned with this unsolved problem and show the global existence for a class of 2-D quadratically quasilinear wave equations. Our main ingredients include: Firstly, through finding two good unknowns we can transform such a class of quadratically quasilinear wave equations into certain manageable cubic nonlinear forms; Secondly, some crucial pointwise estimates are derived for the initial boundary value problem of 2-D linear wave equations in exterior domains; Thirdly, we establish some precise space-time decay estimates on the good derivatives of solutions as well as the solutions themselves.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic stability of the sine-Gordon kink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the full asymptotic stability of the sine-Gordon kink outside symmetry under small perturbations in weighted Sobolev norms. Our proof consists of a space-time resonances approach based on the distorted Fourier transform to capture modified scattering effects combined with modulation techniques to take into account the invariance under Lorentz transformations and under spatial translations. A major challenge is the slow local decay of the radiation term caused by the threshold resonances of the non-selfadjoint linearized matrix operator around the moving kink. Our analysis crucially relies on two remarkable null structures in the quadratic nonlinearities of the evolution equation for the radiation term and of the modulation equations.
  The entire framework of our proof, including the systematic development of the distorted Fourier theory, is not specific to the sine-Gordon model and extends to many other asymptotic stability problems for moving solitons in relativistic scalar field theories on the line.</description>

Abstract: We study a deterministic particle scheme to solve a scalar balance equation with nonlocal interaction and nonlinear mobility used to model congested dynamics. The main novelty with respect to "Radici-Stra [SIAM J.Math.Anal 55.3 (2023)]" is the presence of a source term; this causes the solutions to no longer be probability measures, thus requiring a suitable adaptation of the numerical scheme and of the estimates leading to compactness.</description>

      <title>On quantum ergodicity for higher dimensional cat maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study eigenfunction localization for higher dimensional cat maps, a popular model of quantum chaos. These maps are given by linear symplectic maps in ${\mathrm Sp}(2g,\mathbb Z)$, which we take to be ergodic.Under some natural assumptions, we show that there is a density one sequence of integers $N$ so that as $N$ tends to infinity along this sequence, all eigenfunctions of the quantized map at the inverse Planck constant $N$ are uniformly distributed. For the two-dimensional case ($g=1$), this was proved by P. Kurlberg and Z. Rudnick (2001). The higher dimensional case offers several new features and requires a completely different set of tools, including from additive combinatorics, in particular Bourgain's bound (2005) for Mordell sums, and a study of tensor product structures for the cat map.</description>

      <title>Evolution of weights on a connected finite graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a connected finite graph, we propose an evolution of weights including Ollivier's Ricci flow as a special case. During the evolution process, on each edge, the speed of change of weight is exactly the difference between the Wasserstein distance related to two probability measures and certain graph distance. Here the probability measure may be chosen as an $\alpha$-lazy one-step random walk, an $\alpha$-lazy two-step random walk, or a general probability measure. Based on the ODE theory, we show that the initial value problem has a unique global solution.
  A discrete version of the above evolution is applied to the problem of community detection. Our algorithm is based on such a discrete evolution, where probability measures are chosen as $\alpha$-lazy one-step random walk and $\alpha$-lazy two-step random walk respectively. Note that the later measure has not been used in previous works [2, 16, 20, 23]. Here, as in [20], only one surgery needs to be performed after the last iteration. Moreover, our algorithm is much easier than those of [2, 16, 20], which were all based on Lin-Lu-Yau's Ricci curvature. The code is available at https://github.com/mjc191812/Evolution-of-weights-on-a-connected-finite-graph.</description>

      <title>Fine properties of nonlinear potentials and a unified perspective on monotonicity formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We rigorously show that a large family of monotone quantities along the weak inverse mean curvature flow is the limit case of the corresponding ones along the level sets of $p$-capacitary potentials. Such monotone quantities include Willmore and Minkowski-type functionals on Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. In $3$-dimensional manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature, we also recover the monotonicity of the Hawking mass and its nonlinear potential theoretic counterparts. This unified view is built on a refined analysis of $p$-capacitary potentials. We prove that they strongly converge in $W^{1,q}_{\mathrm{loc}}$ as $p\to 1^+$ to the inverse mean curvature flow and their level sets are curvature varifolds. Finally, we also deduce a Gauss-Bonnet-type theorem for level sets of $p$-capacitary potentials.</description>

      <title>A dual-pairing summation-by-parts finite difference framework for nonlinear conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust and stable high order numerical methods for solving partial differential equations are attractive because they are efficient on modern and next generation hardware architectures. However, the design of provably stable numerical methods for nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws pose a significant challenge. We present the dual-pairing (DP) and upwind summation-by-parts (SBP) finite difference (FD) framework for accurate and robust numerical approximations of nonlinear conservation laws. The framework has an inbuilt "limiter" whose goal is to detect and effectively resolve regions where the solution is poorly resolved and/or discontinuities are found. The DP SBP FD operators are a dual-pair of backward and forward FD stencils, which together preserve the SBP property. In addition, the DP SBP FD operators are designed to be upwind, that is they come with some innate dissipation everywhere, as opposed to traditional SBP and collocated discontinuous Galerkin spectral element methods which can only induce dissipation through numerical fluxes acting at element interfaces. We combine the DP SBP operators together with skew-symmetric and upwind flux splitting of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws. Our semi-discrete approximation is provably entropy-stable for arbitrary nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws. The framework is high order accurate, provably entropy-stable, convergent, and avoids several pitfalls of current state-of-the-art high order methods. We give specific examples using the in-viscid Burger's equation, nonlinear shallow water equations and compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics. Numerical experiments are presented to verify accuracy and demonstrate the robustness of our numerical framework.</description>

      <title>Quenched invariance principle for random walks in random environments admitting a cycle decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of non-reversible, continuous-time random walks in random environments on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ that admit a cycle representation with finite cycle length. The law of the transition rates, taking values in $[0, \infty)$, is assumed to be stationary and ergodic with respect to space shifts. Moreover, the transition rate from $x$ to $y$, denoted by $c^\omega(x,y)$, is a superposition of non-negative random weights on oriented cycles that contain the edge $(x,y)$. We prove a quenched invariance principle under moment conditions that are comparable to the well-known p-q moment condition of Andres, Deuschel, and Slowik [2] for the random conductance model. A key ingredient in proving the sublinearity is an energy estimate for the non-symmetric generator. Our result extends that of Deuschel and K\"osters [12] beyond strong ellipticity and bounded cycle lengths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study atomic ground state energies for neutral atoms as the nuclear charge $Z$ is large in the no-pair formalism. We show that for a large class of projections defining the underlying Dirac sea -- covering not only the physical reasonable cases but also ``weird'' ones -- the corresponding no-pair ground state energy does not exceed the one of the Furry energy up to subleading order. An essential tool is the use and extension of S\'er\'e's results on atomic Dirac-Hartree-Fock theory.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the Maxwell-Schr\"odinger and Vlasov-Maxwell Equations from Non-Relativistic QED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spinless Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian in a semiclassical mean-field limit of many fermions. For appropriate initial conditions, we prove, in the trace norm topology of reduced density matrices, that the many-body quantum state converges to a tensor product of a semiclassically structured Slater determinant and a coherent photon state. These evolve according to a fermionic variant of the Maxwell-Schr\"odinger equations. By combining this result with [arXiv:2308.16074] through a suitable regularization of the initial data, we further show that, in the limit of large particle number, the dynamics of the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian can be approximately described by the non-relativistic Vlasov--Maxwell system for extended charges.</description>

Abstract: We study very weak solutions to scalar Euler-Lagrange equations associated with quadratic convex functionals. We investigate whether $W^{1,1}$ solutions are necessarily $W^{1,2}_{\operatorname{loc}}$, which would make the theories by De Giorgi-Nash and Schauder applicable. We answer this question positively for a suitable class of functionals. This is an extension of Weyl's classical lemma for the Laplace equation to a wider class of equations under stronger regularity assumptions. Conversely, using convex integration, we show that outside this class of functionals, there exist $W^{1,1}$ solutions of locally infinite energy to scalar Euler-Lagrange equations. In addition, we prove an intermediate result which permits the regularity of a $W^{1,1}$ solution to be improved to $W^{1,2}_{\operatorname{loc}}$ under suitable assumptions on the functional and solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06232v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a dynamic model for inhomogeneous viscoelastic media at finite strains. The model features a Kelvin-Voigt rheology, and includes a self-generated gravitational field in the actual evolving configuration. In particular, a fully Eulerian approach is adopted. We specialize the model to viscoelastic (barotropic) fluids and prove existence and a certain regularity of global weak solutions by a Faedo-Galerkin semi-discretization technique. Then, an extension to multi-component chemically reacting viscoelastic fluids based on a phenomenological approach by Eckart and Prigogine, is advanced and studied. The model is inspired by planetary geophysics. In particular, it describes gravitational differentiation of inhomogeneous planets and moons, possibly undergoing volumetric phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: The rotation modified Kadomtsev Petviashvili equation which is also known as the Kadomtsev Petviashvili Ostrovsky equation, describes the gradual wave field diffusion in the transverse direction to the direction of the propagation of the wave in a rotating frame of reference. This equation is a generalization of the Ostrovsky equation additionally having weak transverse effects. We investigate transverse instability and stability of small periodic traveling waves of the Ostrovsky equation with respect to either periodic or square-integrable perturbations in the direction of wave propagation and periodic perturbations in the transverse direction of motion in the rotation-modified Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we first introduce an innovative equivalent norm in the Musielak-Orlicz Sobolev spaces in a very general setting and we then present a new result on the boundedness of the solutions of a wide class of nonlinear Neumann problems, both of independent interest. Moreover, we study a variable exponent double phase problem with a nonlinear boundary condition and prove the existence of multiple solutions under very general assumptions on the nonlinearities. To be more precise, we get constant sign solutions (nonpositive and nonnegative) via a mountain-pass approach and a sign-changing solution by using an appropriate subset of the corresponding Nehari manifold along with the Brouwer degree and the Quantitative Deformation Lemma.</description>

      <title>Solvability of the $L^p$ Dirichlet problem for the heat equation is equivalent to parabolic uniform rectifiability in the case of a parabolic Lipschitz graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if a parabolic Lipschitz (i.e., Lip(1,1/2)) graph domain has the property that its caloric measure is a parabolic $A_\infty$ weight with respect to surface measure (which in turn is equivalent to $L^p$ solvability of the Dirichlet problem for some finite $p$), then the function defining the graph has a half-order time derivative in the space of (parabolic) bounded mean oscillation. Equivalently, we prove that the $A_\infty$ property of caloric measure implies, in this case, that the boundary is parabolic uniformly rectifiable. Consequently, by combining our result with the work of Lewis and Murray we resolve a long standing open problem in the field by characterizing those parabolic Lipschitz graph domains for which one has $L^p$ solvability (for some $p &lt;\infty$) of the Dirichlet problem for the heat equation. The key idea of our proof is to view the level sets of the Green function as extensions of the original boundary graph for which we can prove (local) square function estimates of Littlewood-Paley type.</description>

Abstract: Let $n\ge 3$, $0&lt;m&lt;\frac{n-2}{n}$, $\rho_1&gt;0$, $\eta&gt;0$, $\beta&gt;\frac{m\rho_1}{n-2-nm}$, $\alpha=\alpha_m=\frac{2\beta+\rho_1}{1-m}$, $\beta_0&gt;0$ and $\alpha_0=2\beta_0+1$. We use fixed point argument to give a new proof for the existence and uniqueness of radially symmetric singular solution $f=f^{(m)}$ of the elliptic equation $\Delta (f^m/m)+\alpha f+\beta x\cdot\nabla f=0$, $f&gt;0$, in $\mathbb{R}^n\setminus\{0\}$, satisfying $\displaystyle\lim_{|x|\to 0}|x|^{\alpha/\beta}f(x)=\eta$. We also prove the existence and uniqueness of radially symmetric singular solution $g$ of the equation $\Delta\log g+\alpha_0 g+\beta_0x\cdot\nabla g=0$, $g&gt;0$, in $\mathbb{R}^n\setminus\{0\}$, satisfying $\displaystyle\lim_{|x|\to 0}|x|^{\alpha_0/\beta_0}g(x)=\eta$. Such equations arises from the study of backward singular self-similar solution of the fast diffusion equation $u_t=\Delta u^m$ and the logarithmic diffusion equation $u_t=\Delta\log u$ respectively. We will also prove that $f$ satisfies $\underset{\substack{|x|\to\infty}}{\lim}|x|^2f(x)^{1-m}=\frac{2(n-2-nm)}{(1-m)\rho_1}$.</description>

Abstract: Viscosity solutions to the eikonal equation on a non-compact complete Riemannian manifold are crucial for understanding the underlying geometric and topological properties. The classical definition of viscosity solutions relies on the differential structure and does not directly extended to general metric spaces. In this work, we explore the (metric) viscosity solutions on the Wasserstein space P_p(X), where X is a complete, separable, locally compact, non-compact geodesic space. We introduce a new and elegant definition of the metric viscosity solutions in this context and investigate their properties such as stability, uniqueness and comparison principle. Moreover, we study their relationship with two types of distance-like function and present two distinct methods to construct (strong) metric viscosity solutions on the Wasserstein space P_p(X).</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the contact line problem in a channel. Precisely, we consider the incompressible Navier-Stokes/Cahn-Hilliard system with eneralized Navier boundary condition and relaxation boundary condition in a channel, which is the phase field model for the moving contact line problem in fluid mechanics. We establish the existence and uniqueness of local-in-time strong solution to this initial boundary value problem in 2D. To our knowledge, this is the first result to give the local-in-time well-posedness of Navier-Stokes/Cahn-Hilliard system with generalized Navier boundary condition and relaxation boundary condition. This result provides a rigorous mathematical analysis to confirm that the physical and numerical results by Qian-Wang-Sheng [Phys. Rev. E 68 (2003), 016306, 1-15; J. Fluid Mech. 564 (2006), 333-360] are well-posed and reasonable.</description>

      <title>A note on the Lp-Sobolev inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The usual Sobolev inequality in $\mathbb{R}^N$, asserts that $\|\nabla u\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^N)} \geq \mathcal{S}\|u\|_{L^{p^*}(\mathbb{R}^N)}$ for $1&lt;p&lt;N$ and $p^*=\frac{pN}{N-p}$, with $\mathcal{S}$ being the sharp constant. Based on a recent work of Figalli and Zhang [Duke Math. J., 2022], a weak norm remainder term of Sobolev inequality in a subdomain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^N$ with finite measure is established, i.e., for $\frac{2N}{N+1}&lt;p&lt;N$ there exists a constant $\mathcal{C}&gt;0$ independent of $\Omega$ such that \[ \|\nabla u\|^p_{L^p(\Omega)}
  -\mathcal{S}^p\|u\|^p_{L^{p^*}(\Omega)} \geq \mathcal{C}|\Omega|^{-\frac{\gamma}{p^*(p-1)}} \|u\|_{L^{\bar{p}}_w(\Omega)}^{\gamma}\| u\|_{L^{p^*}(\Omega)}^{p-\gamma},\quad \mbox{for all}\ u\in C^\infty_0(\Omega)\setminus\{0\}, \] where $\gamma=\max\{2,p\}$, $\bar{p}=p^*(p-1)/p$, and $\|\cdot\|_{L^{\bar{p}}_w(\Omega)}$ denotes the weak $L^{\bar{p}}$-norm. Moreover, we establish a sharp upper bound of Sobolev inequality in $\mathbb{R}^N$.</description>

      <title>A uniqueness theory on determining the nonlinear energy potential in phase-field system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phase-field system is a nonlinear model that has significant applications in material sciences. In this paper, we are concerned with the uniqueness of determining the nonlinear energy potential in a phase-field system consisting of Cahn-Hilliard and Allen-Cahn equations. This system finds widespread applications in the development of alloys engineered to withstand extreme temperatures and pressures. The goal is to reconstruct the nonlinear energy potential through the measurements of concentration fields. We establish the local well-posedness of the phase-field system based on the implicit function theorem in Banach spaces. Both of the uniqueness results for recovering time-independent and time-dependent energy potential functions are provided through the higher order linearization technique.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a condition under which the thermal quasi-geostrophic (TQG) model possesses a solution that is holomorphic in time with values in the Gevrey space of complex analytic functions. This can be seen as the complex extension of the work by Levermore and Oliver (1997) for the generalized Euler equation but applied to the TQG model.</description>

      <title>Gradient higher integrability for degenerate/ singular parabolic multi-phase problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article establishes an interior gradient higher integrability result for weak solutions to parabolic multi-phase problems. The prototype equation for the parabolic multi-phase problem of $p$-Laplace type is given by \[ u_t - \operatorname{div} \left(|\nabla u|^{p-2} \nabla u + a(z) |\nabla u|^{q-2} \nabla u + b(z) |\nabla u|^{s-2} \nabla u \right) = 0, \] where $\frac{2n}{n+2} &lt; p \leq q \leq s &lt; \infty$, and the coefficients $a(z)$ and $b(z)$ are non-negative H\"older continuous functions on $\Omega_T = \Omega \times (0, T)$, with $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$. We introduce a novel intrinsic scaling to address the problem in both the degenerate regime ($p \geq 2$) and the singular regime $\left(\frac{2n}{n+2} &lt; p &lt; 2\right),$ providing a unified framework. Our approach involves proving uniform parabolic Sobolev-Poincar\'e inequalities, which are key to establishing reverse H\"older type inequalities, along with covering lemmas for the $p$, $(p,q)$, $(p,s)$, and $(p,q,s)$-phases without distinguishing between the regimes of $p$, $q$, and $s$. In the end, we also discuss the gradient higher integrability for general parabolic multi-phase problem involving a finite number of phases.</description>

      <title>Observability from a measurable set for functions in a Gevrey class</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an observability inequality in terms of a measurable set for general Gevrey regular functions. As an application, we establish an observability estimate from a measurable set for sums of Laplace eigenfunctions in a compact and connected boundaryless Riemannian manifold that belongs to the Gevrey class. The estimate has an explicit dependence on the maximal eigenvalue.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear Calder\'on-Zygmund $ L^2$-theory for the Dirichlet problem involving $ -|Du|^{\gamma}\Delta^N_p u=f$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a nonlinear Calder\'on-Zygmund $L^2$-theory to the Dirichlet problem $$-|Du|^{\gamma}\Delta^N_p u=f\in L^2(\Omega)\quad {\rm in}\quad \Omega; \quad u=0 \ \mbox{on $\partial\Omega$} $$ for $n\ge2$, $ p&gt;1$ and a large range of $\gamma&gt;-1$, in particular, for all $p&gt;1$ and all $ \gamma&gt;-1$ when $n=2$. Here $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is a bounded convex domain, or a bounded Lipschitz domain whose boundary has small weak second fundamental form in the sense of Cianchi-Maz'ya (2018).
  The proof relies on an extension of an Miranda-Talenti \&amp; Cianchi-Maz'ya type inequality, that is, for any $v\in C^\infty_0(\Omega)$ in any bounded smooth domain $\Omega$, $\|D[(|Dv|^2+\epsilon)^{\frac\gamma 2}Dv]\|_{L^2(\Omega)}$ is bounded via $\|(|Dv|^2+\epsilon)^{\frac\gamma 2} \Delta^N_{p,\epsilon}v \|_{L^2(\Omega)}$, where $\Delta^N_{p,\epsilon}v$ is the $\epsilon$-regularization of normalized $p$-Laplacian.
  Our results extend the well-known Calder\'on-Zygmund $L^2$-estimate for the Poisson equation, a nonlinear global second order Sobolev estimate for inhomogeneous $p$-Laplace equation by Cianchi-Maz'ya (2018), and a local $W^{2,2}$-estimate for inhomogeneous normalized $p$-Laplace equation by Attouchi-Ruosteenoja (2018).</description>

      <title>Adaptive waveform inversion for transmitted wave data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive Waveform Inversion (AWI) applied to transient transmitted wave data can yield estimates of index of refraction (or wave velocity) similar to those obtained by travel time inversion. The AWI objective function measures normalized mean-square dispersion about zero time of a family of filters, one filter for each source-reeciver pair, designed to match predicted data to observed data. Provided that the data contain a single smooth wavefront, this function approaches the mean square traveltime error as data wavelength tends to zero. The scaling of each filter to have unit norm is responsible for the simple relation with travel time tomography. A similar approach, Matched Source Waveform Inversion (MSWI), does not normalize the filters and has a looser relation with mean-square travel time error. If substantial energy is spread amongst multiple arrivals, on the other hand, neither AWI nor MSWI objectives approximate the travel time mean square erorr, and attempts to minimize them by local (Newton-related) optimization are as likely to stagnate at models predicting erroneous travel times as is least-square Full Waveform Inversion (FWI). The matching filter at the heart of this approach must be ``pre-whitened'', that is, computed by solving a regularized least squares problem for filtered data misfit. In order for the relation to traveltime tomography to hold, and for the filtered data misfit to stay relatively small, the regularization weight must be coupled to data wavelength. These objective functions can also be used as penalty terms in a homotopy of objectives connecting AWI or MSWI with FWI.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates for orthonormal functions and probabilistic convergence of density functions of compact operators on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13764v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish some Strichartz estimates for orthonormal functions and probabilistic convergence of density functions related to compact operators on manifolds. Firstly, we present the suitable bound of $\int_{a\leq|s|\leq b}e^{isx}s^{-1+i\gamma}ds$ for the cases $\gamma \in \mathbb{R},a\geq0,b&gt;0,$ $\gamma \in \mathbb{R},\gamma\neq0,a,b\in \mathbb{R}$ and $\gamma \in \mathbb{R}$, which extends the result of Page 204 of Vega (199-211,IMA Vol. Math. Appl., 42, 1992.) Secondly, we prove that $\left|\gamma\int_{a}^{b}e^{isx}s^{-1+i\gamma}ds\right|\leq C(1+|\gamma|)^{2}(\gamma \in \mathbb{R},a,b\in \mathbb{R}),$ where $C$ is independent of $\gamma,a, b$, which extends Lemma 1 of Bez et al. (Forum of Mathematics, Sigma, 9(2021), 1-52). Thirdly, we extend the result of Theorems 8, 9 of R. Frank, J. Sabin (Amer. J. Math. 139(2017), 1649-1691.) with the aid of the suitable bound of the above complex integrals established in this paper. Fourthly, we establish the Strichartz estimates for orthonormal functions related to Boussinesq operator on the real line for both small time interval and large time interval and on the torus with small time interval; we also establish the convergence result of some compact operators in Schatten norm. Fifthly, we establish the convergence result related to nonlinear part of the solution to some operator equations in Schatten spaces. Finally, inspired by the work of Hadama and Yamamoto (Probabilistic Strichartz estimates in Schatten classes and their applications to Hartree equation, arxiv:2311.02713v1.), for $\gamma_{0}\in \mathfrak{S}^{2}$, we establish the probabilistic convergence of density functions of compact operator on manifolds with full randomization, which improves the result of Corollary 1.2 of Bez et al. (Selecta Math. 26(2020), 24 pp) in the probabilistic sense.</description>

      <title>Clustering in Causal Attention Masking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a modification of the self-attention dynamics proposed by Geshkovski et al. (arXiv:2312.10794) to better reflect the practically relevant, causally masked attention used in transformer architectures for generative AI. This modification translates into an interacting particle system that cannot be interpreted as a mean-field gradient flow. Despite this loss of structure, we significantly strengthen the results of Geshkovski et al. (arXiv:2312.10794) in this context: While previous rigorous results focused on cases where all three matrices (Key, Query, and Value) were scaled identities, we prove asymptotic convergence to a single cluster for arbitrary key-query matrices and a value matrix equal to the identity. Additionally, we establish a connection to the classical R\'enyi parking problem from combinatorial geometry to make initial theoretical steps towards demonstrating the existence of meta-stable states.</description>
