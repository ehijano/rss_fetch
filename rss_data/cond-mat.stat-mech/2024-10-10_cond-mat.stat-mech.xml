      <title>Scaling behavior in the number theoretic division model of self-organized criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the number theoretic division model of self-organized criticality [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 158702 (2008)]. The model consists of a pool of $M-1$ ordered integers $\{2, 3, \cdots, M\}$, and the aim is to dynamically form a primitive set of integers, where no number can be divided or divisible by others. Using intensive simulation studies and finite-size scaling method, we find the primitive set size fluctuations in the division model to show power spectral density of the form $1/f^{\alpha}$ in the frequency regime $1/M\ll f \ll 1/2$ with $\alpha \approx 2$ (different from $\alpha \approx 1.80(1)$ as reported previously) along with an additional scaling in terms of the system size $\sim M^b$. We also show similar power spectra properties for a class of random walks with a power-law distributed jump size (L\'evy flights).</description>

      <title>Scaling of Extreme Events in 2d BTW Sandpile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study extreme events in a finite-size 2D Abelian sandpile model, specifically focusing on avalanche area and size. Employing the approach of Block Maxima, the study numerically reveals that the rescaled distributions for the largest avalanche size and area converge into the Gumbel and Weibull family of Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distributions respectively. Numerically, we propose scaling functions for extreme avalanche activities that connect the activities on different length scales. With the help of data collapse, we estimate the precise values of these scaling exponents. The scaling function provides an understanding of the intricate dynamics within the sandpile model, shedding light on the relationship between system size and extreme event characteristics. The findings presented in this paper give valuable insights into the extreme behaviour of the Abelian sandpile model and offer a framework to understand the statistical properties of extreme events in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Abelian and nonAbelian gauge Higgs theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauge symmetries and Higgs mechanisms are key features of theories describing high-energy particle physics and collective phenomena in statistical and condensed-matter physics. In this review we address the collective behavior of systems of multicomponent scalar fields interacting with gauge fields, which can be already present in the underlying microscopic system or emerge only at criticality. The interplay between local gauge and global symmetries determines the phase diagram, the nature of the Higgs phases, and the nature of phase transitions between the high-temperature disordered and the low-temperature Higgs phases. However, further crucial features determine the universal properties of the critical behaviors at continuous transitions. Specifically, their nature also depends on the role played by the gauge modes at criticality: effective (Abelian or nonAbelian) gauge Higgs field theories emerge if gauge modes develop critical correlations, while more standard critical behaviors occur in the case they remain short ranged at the transition. In the latter case, gauge fields only prevent non-gauge invariant correlators from becoming critical. This review covers the recent progress made in the study of Higgs systems with Abelian and nonAbelian gauge fields. We mainly focus on three-dimensional systems, and briefly discuss two-dimensional systems, whose equilibrium statistical properties are described by a classical partition function. However, by using the quantum-to-classical mapping, the results on the critical behavior for classical systems in $D=d+1$ dimensions can be extended to quantum transitions in $d$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Optimal conditions for first passage of jump processes with resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the first passage time beyond a barrier located at $b\geq0$ of a random walk with independent and identically distributed jumps, starting from $x_0=0$. The walk is subject to stochastic resetting, meaning that after each step the evolution is restarted with fixed probability $r$. We consider a resetting protocol that is an intermediate situation between a random walk ($r=0$) and an uncorrelated sequence of jumps all starting from the origin ($r=1$), and derive a general condition for determining when restarting the process with $0&lt;r&lt;1$ is more efficient than restarting after each jump. If the mean first passage time of the process in absence of resetting is larger than that of the sequence of jumps, this condition is sufficient to establish the existence of an optimal $0&lt;r^*&lt;1$ that represents the best strategy, outperforming both $r=0$ and $r=1$. Our findings are discussed by considering two important examples of jump processes, for which we draw the phase diagram illustrating the regions of the parameter space where resetting with some $0&lt;r^*&lt;1$ is optimal.</description>

      <title>Information interference driven by environmental activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world systems are shaped by both their complex internal interactions and the changes in their noisy environments. In this work, we study how a shared active bath affects the statistical dependencies between two interacting Brownian particles by evaluating their mutual information. We decompose the mutual information into three terms: information stemming from the internal interactions between the particles; information induced by the shared bath, which encodes environmental changes; a term describing information interference that quantifies how the combined presence of both internal interactions and environment either masks (destructive interference) or boosts (constructive interference) information. By studying exactly the case of linear interactions, we find that the sign of information interference depends solely on that of the internal coupling. However, when internal interactions are described by a nonlinear activation function, we show that both constructive and destructive interference appear depending on the interplay between the timescale of the active environment, the internal interactions, and the environmental coupling. Finally, we show that our results generalize to hierarchical systems where asymmetric couplings to the environment mimic the scenario where the active bath is only partially accessible to one particle. This setting allows us to quantify how this asymmetry drives information interference. Our work underscores how information and functional relationships in complex multi-scale systems are fundamentally shaped by the environmental context.</description>

      <title>Run-and-tumble particles in slit geometry as a splitting probability problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Run-and-tumble particles confined between two walls seem like a simple enough problem to possess analytical tractability. Yet up to date, no satisfactory analysis is available for dimensions higher than one. This work contributes to the theoretical understanding of this system by reinterpreting it as a splitting probability problem. Such reinterpretation permits us to formulate the problem as the integral equation, rather than a more standard differential equation based on the Fokker-Planck equation. In addition to providing an analogy with another phenomenon, the reinterpretation permits a new type of analysis, yields useful results, and offers some analytical tractability.</description>

      <title>Backbone exponent and annulus crossing probability for planar percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the recent derivation of the backbone exponent for 2D percolation. In contrast to previously known exactly solved percolation exponents, the backbone exponent is a transcendental number, which is a root of an elementary equation. We also report an exact formula for the probability that there are two disjoint paths of the same color crossing an annulus. The backbone exponent captures the leading asymptotic, while the other roots of the elementary equation capture the asymptotic of the remaining terms. This suggests that the backbone exponent is part of a conformal field theory (CFT) whose bulk spectrum contains this set of roots. Our approach is based on the coupling between SLE curves and Liouville quantum gravity (LQG), and the integrability of Liouville CFT that governs the LQG surfaces.</description>

      <title>$q$-Breathers in the diatomic $\beta$-Fermi-Pasta-Ulam- Tsingou chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $q$-Breathers (QBs) represent a quintessential phenomenon of energy localization, manifesting as stable periodic orbits exponentially localized in normal mode space. Their existence can hinder the thermalization process in nonlinear lattices. In this study, we employ the Newton's method to identify QB solutions in the diatomic Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chains and perform a comprehensive analysis of their linear stability. We derive an analytical expression for the instability thresholds of low-frequency QBs, which converges to the known results of monoatomic chains as the bandgap approaches zero. The expression reveals an inverse square relationship between instability thresholds and system size, as well as a quadratic dependence on the mass difference, both of which have been corroborated through extensive numerical simulations. Our results demonstrate that the presence of a bandgap can markedly enhance QB stability, providing a novel theoretical foundation and practical framework for controlling energy transport between modes in complex lattice systems. These results not only expand the applicability of QBs but also offer significant implications for understanding the thermalization dynamics in complex lattice structures, with wide potential applications in related low-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory of Mpemba effects and a no-Mpemba theorem for monotone many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mpemba effects (MPEs), where a hotter system cools faster than a colder one, present intriguing anomalies in relaxation processes. Despite their universal observation and significant fundamental and practical implications, a comprehensive theoretical understanding based on microscopic properties remains elusive. In this Letter, we introduce two universal frameworks for classical systems to address this gap. Firstly, we reveal that MPEs, traditionally defined by macroscopic temperature comparisons, can be understood through microstate comparisons. This insight offers a straightforward and universal microscopic perspective on MPEs, relevant for experiments and numerical simulations to identify their microscopic origins. Secondly, we establish a "no-Mpemba theorem," a rigorous sufficient condition for the absence of MPEs, thereby identifying specific classes of systems devoid of these effects. Our findings are exemplified using ferromagnetic Ising models and one-dimensional multiparticle systems, demonstrating the practical applicability of our theoretical advancements.</description>

      <title>Thermomajorization Mpemba Effect: Unification and Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect is a counterintuitive physical phenomenon where a hot system cools faster than a warm one. In recent years, theoretical analyses of the Mpemba effect have been developed for microscopic systems and experimentally verified. However, the conventional theory relies on a specific choice of distance measure to quantify relaxation speed, leading to several theoretical ambiguities. In this Letter, we derive a rigorous quantification of the Mpemba effect based on thermomajorization theory, referred to as the thermomajorization Mpemba effect. This approach resolves all existing ambiguities and provides a unification of the conventional Mpemba effect across all monotone measures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the universality of the thermomajorization Mpemba effect for Markovian dynamics, rigorously proving that it can occur in any temperature regime with fixed energy levels. Our findings offer a paradigm shift in understanding thermal relaxation processes and provide insights into designing systems that exhibit the Mpemba effect.</description>

      <title>Kramers-Wannier self-duality and non-invertible translation symmetry in quantum chains: a wave-function perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kramers-Wannier self-duality of critical quantum chains is examined from the perspective of model wave functions. We demonstrate, using the transverse-field Ising chain and the $3$-state Potts chain as examples, that the symmetry operator for the Kramers-Wannier self-duality follows in a simple and direct way from a `generalised' translation symmetry of the model wave function in the anyonic fusion basis. This translation operation, in turn, comprises a sequence of $F$-moves in the underlying fusion category. The symmetry operator thus obtained naturally admits the form of a matrix product operator and obeys non-invertible fusion rules. The findings reveal an intriguing connection between the (non-invertible) translation symmetry on the lattice and topological aspects of the conformal field theory describing the scaling limit.</description>

      <title>The global phase diagram of the cluster-XY spin chain with dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ground-state phase diagram of a non-Hermitian cluster-XY spin chain in the language of free fermions. By calculating the second derivative of ground-state energy density and various types of order parameters, we establish the global ground-state phase diagram of the model, exhibiting rich quantum phases and corresponding phase transitions. Specially, the results reveal that the non-Hermitian cluster-XY model contains five different phases and two critical regions, i.e., ferromagnetic (FM), antiferromagnetic (AFM), symmetry-protected topological (SPT), paramagnetic (PM), Luttinger liquid-like phase, as well as critical region I and II. The order parameters and critical behaviors are investigated and the correctness of the theory is confirmed.</description>

      <title>Optimizing search processes in systems with state toggling: exact condition delimiting the efficacy of stochastic resetting strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Will the strategy of resetting help a stochastic process to reach its target efficiently, with its environment continually toggling between a strongly favourable and an unfavourable (or weakly favourable) state? A diffusive run-and-tumble motion, or motion under flashing optical traps are special examples of such state toggling. For any general process with toggling under Poisson reset, we derive a mathematical condition for continuous transitions where the advantage rendered by resetting vanishes. For the case of diffusive motion with linear potentials of unequal strength, we present exact solutions which reveal that there is quite generically a re-entrance of the advantage of resetting as a function of the strength of the strongly favourable potential. This result is shown to be valid for quadratic potential traps by using the general condition of transition.</description>

      <title>Multiple Pareto-optimal solutions of the dissipation-adaptation trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptation refers to the ability to recover and maintain ``normal'' function upon perturbations of internal of external conditions and is essential for sustaining life. Biological adaptation mechanisms are dissipative, i.e. they require a supply of energy such as the coupling to the hydrolysis of ATP. Via evolution the underlying biochemical machinery of living organisms evolved into highly optimized states. However, in the case of adaptation processes two quantities are optimized simultaneously, the adaptation speed or accuracy and the thermodynamic cost. In such cases one typically faces a trade-off, where improving one quantity implies worsening the other. The solution is no longer unique but rather a Pareto set -- the set of all physically attainable protocols along which no quantity can be improved without worsening another. Here we investigate Pareto fronts in adaptation-dissipation trade-offs for a cellular thermostat and a minimal ATP-driven receptor-ligand reaction network. We find convex sections of Pareto fronts to be interrupted by concave regions, implying the coexistence of distinct optimization mechanisms. We discuss the implications of such ``compromise-optimal'' solutions and argue that they may endow biological systems with a superior flexibility to evolve, resist, and adapt to different environments.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced phase transitions in monitored infinite-range interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in observing measurement-induced phase transitions is the mitigation of the post-selection barrier, which causes the reproducibility of specific sequences of measurement readouts--the trajectory--to be exponentially small in system size. Recent studies suggest that some classes of monitored infinite-range systems alleviate this problem by exhibiting a fast saturation of entanglement, resulting in only a polynomial post-selection overhead. This paper answers whether this feature is inherent in infinite-range systems, due to their underlying semiclassical dynamics. We consider three experimentally relevant monitored models: a Tavis-Cummings model, a Superradiance model, and a Bose-Hubbard dimer, each exhibiting non-trivial monitored dynamics. We unveil the occurrence of entanglement phase transitions in these models, showing how the saturation time is strongly affected by bistability regions, which also prevent the mitigation of the post-selection barrier. Finally, we propose experimental realizations of these models, providing a discussion of post selection from an experimental perspective.</description>

Abstract: We show that, in finite dimensions, around any $m$-partite product state $\rho_{\rm prod}=\rho_1\otimes...\otimes\rho_m$, there exists an ellipsoid of separable states centered around $\rho_{\rm prod}$. The volume of this separable ellipsoid is typically exponentially larger than that of the separable ball proposed in previous works, due to the large hierarchy of eigenvalues occurring in typical states. We further refine this ellipsoidal criterion to a trace formula, generalize it to characterize the separable region around all separable states, and further study biseparability. Our criterion will help numerical procedures to rigorously detect separability. We apply the procedure for separability detection on three-qubit X state in a dephasing environment, and the 1d transverse field Ising model at finite temperature to illustrate the power of our procedure for understanding entanglement in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic degeneracy of ground state in the frustrated Heisenberg diamond chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg diamond chain with ferro- and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions is studied. The phase boundary in the parametric space of these interactions is determined, where the transition between the ferromagnetic and other (singlet or ferrimagnetic) ground state phases occurs. On this phase boundary there is a dispersionless (flat) energy band in the one-magnon spectrum and these states can be represented as localized magnons in the trapping cells between neighboring diamonds. The ground state consists of the localized magnons and special magnon complexes and it is macroscopically degenerate. A remarkable feature of the model is the existence, on a certain part of the phase boundary, of two- and three-magnon localized states, forming flat bands in two- and three-magnon spectrum. All these localized states also belong to the ground state manifold, which turns out to be exactly the same as for the system of independent spins-$\frac{3}{2}$. This implies a large macroscopic degeneracy of the ground state $4^n$ ($n$ is number of diamonds in the chain) and a high residual entropy per spin $s_{0}=\frac{2}{3}\ln 2$.</description>

      <title>Damage spreading and coupling in spin glasses and hard spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the connection between damage spreading, a phenomenon long discussed in the physics literature, and the coupling of Markov chains, a technique used to bound the mixing time. We discuss in parallel the Edwards-Anderson spin glass model and the hard-disk system, focusing on how coupling provides insights into the region of fast coupling within the paramagnetic and liquid phases. We also work out the connection between path coupling and damage spreading. Numerically, the scaling analysis of the mean coupling time determines a critical point between fast and slow couplings. The exact relationship between fast coupling and disordered phases has not been established rigorously, but we suggest that it will ultimately enhance our understanding of phase behavior in disordered systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active fluids generate spontaneous, often chaotic mesoscale flows. Harnessing these flows to drive embedded soft materials into structures with controlled length scales and lifetimes is a key challenge at the interface between the fields of active matter and nonequilibrium self-assembly. Here, we present a simple and highly efficient computational approach to model soft materials advected by active fluids, by simulating particles moving in a spatiotemporally correlated noise field. The algorithm enables orders of magnitude speed up in comparison to other methods. To illustrate our approach, we simulate the dynamical self-organization of repulsive colloids within such an active noise field in two and three dimensions. The colloids form structures whose sizes and dynamics can be tuned by the correlation time and length of the active fluid, and range from small rotating droplets to clusters with internal flows and system-spanning sizes that vastly exceed the active correlation length. Our results elucidate how the interplay between active fluid time/length scales and emergent driven assembly can be used to rationally design functional assemblies. More broadly, our approach can be used to efficiently simulate diverse active fluids and other systems with spatiotemporally correlated noise.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Mechanisms of Diffusion Dynamics: A Comparative Efficiency Study of Event-Chain Monte Carlo Variants in Dense Hard Disk Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In molecular simulations, efficient methods for investigating equilibration and slow relaxation in dense systems are crucial yet challenging. This study focuses on the diffusional characteristics of monodisperse hard disk systems at equilibrium, comparing novel methodologies of event-chain Monte Carlo variants, specifically the Newtonian event-chain and straight event-chain algorithms. We systematically analyze both event-based and CPU time-based efficiency in liquid and solid phases, aiming to elucidate the microscopic mechanisms underlying structural relaxation. Our results demonstrate how chain length or duration, system size, and phase state influence the efficiency of diffusion dynamics, including hopping motion. This work provides insights into optimizing simulation techniques for highly packed systems and has the potential to improve our understanding of diffusion dynamics even in complex many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prethermal discrete time crystals (PDTCs) are a nonequilibrium state of matter characterized by long-range spatiotemporal order, and exhibiting a subharmonic response stabilized by many-body interactions under periodic driving. The inherent robustness of time crystalline order to perturbations in the drive protocol makes DTCs promising for applications in quantum technologies. We exploit the susceptibility of PDTC order to deviations in its order parameter to devise highly frequency-selective quantum sensors for time-varying (AC) magnetic fields in a system of strongly-driven, dipolar-coupled 13C nuclear spins in diamond. Integrating a time-varying AC field into the PDTC allows us to exponentially increase its lifetime, measuring improvement of up to three orders of magnitude (44,204 cycles), and results in a strong resonant response in the time crystalline order parameter. The linewidth of our sensor is limited by the PDTC lifetime alone, as strong interspin interactions help stabilize DTC order. The sensor operates in the 0.5-50 kHz range - a blind spot for sensors based on atomic vapor or electronic spins - and attains a competitive sensitivity. PDTC sensors are resilient to errors in the drive protocol and sample inhomogeneities, and are agnostic to the macroscopic details of the physical platform: the underlying physical principle applies equally to superconducting qubits, neutral atoms, and trapped ions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive an expression for the equilibrium probability distribution of a quantum state in contact with a noisy thermal environment that formally separates contributions from quantum and classical forms of probabilistic uncertainty. A statistical mechanical interpretation of this probability distribution enables us to derive an expression for the minimum free energy costs for arbitrary (reversible or irreversible) quantum state changes. Based on this derivation, we demonstrate that - in contrast to classical systems - the free energy required to erase or reset a qubit depends sensitively on both the fidelity of the target state and on the physical properties of the environment, such as the number of quantum bath states, due primarily to the entropic effects of system-bath entanglement.</description>

Abstract: Stress changes in the Earth's crust induced by an earthquake typically trigger other earthquakes. Identifying such aftershocks is an important step in seismic hazard assessment but has remained challenging. Here we demonstrate that earthquake catalogs without triggering can lead to spurious Omori-Utsu and productivity relations for the commonly used nearest-neighbor declustering method. However, we show that the robustness of the Omori-Utsu exponent on newly introduced parameters of the method allows to identify true aftershocks. For a natural swarm catalog, which lacks a clear distinction between triggered and background events, we reveal that the catalog is dominated by aftershocks.</description>

Abstract: Time-dependent Hamiltonian simulation using Trotterization causes two types of errors, i.e., discretization errors and digitization errors. In this paper, we propose a decomposition formula which enables us to completely eliminate digitization errors in digital quantum simulation of quantum annealing. We numerically demonstrate scaling advantage of the present method against the conventional Trotterization approach. We also show that the present method can be applied to quantum annealing with some catalysts. Notably, some combinations of nonstoquastic $XX$-interaction, bias $Z$-field, and counterdiabatic $Y$-field catalysts are included in applications of the present method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relaxation to equilibrium in Bose-Hubbard rings is numerically investigated in the time domain. We show that for small mean site populations in the Mott insulator regime, characterized by strong onsite interaction as compared to hopping, equipartition starting from nonequilibrium initial states is significantly faster in these bosonic quantum many-body systems than in their classical counterparts, given by discrete Gross-Pitaevskii lattices. We attribute this phenomenon of thermalization enhancement to a genuine quantum transport mechanism akin to tunneling, allowing for pathways that are more efficient than chaotic diffusion across the ergodic domain of the classical systems.</description>

      <title>Quasiclassical theory of out-of-time-ordered correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), defined via the squared commutator of a time-evolving and a stationary operator, represent observables that provide useful indicators for chaos and the scrambling of information in complex quantum systems. Here we present a quasiclassical formalism of OTOCs, which is obtained from the semiclassical van Vleck-Gutzwiller propagator through the application of the diagonal approximation. For short evolution times, this quasiclassical approach yields the same result as the Wigner-Moyal formalism, i.e., OTOCs are classically described via the square of the Poisson bracket between the two involved observables, thus giving rise to an exponential growth in a chaotic regime. For long times, for which the semiclassical framework is, in principle, still valid, the diagonal approximation yields an asymptotic saturation value for the quasiclassical OTOC under the assumption of fully developed classical chaos. However, numerical simulations, carried out within chaotic few-site Bose-Hubbard systems in the absence and presence of periodic driving, demonstrate that this saturation value strongly underestimates the actual threshold value of the quantum OTOC, which is normally attained after the Ehrenfest time. This indicates that nondiagonal and hence genuinely quantum contributions, thus exceeding the framework of the quasiclassical description, are primarily responsible for describing OTOCs beyond the short-time regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a quantum phase transition is crossed within a finite time, critical slowing down disrupts adiabatic dynamics, resulting in the formation of topological defects. The average density of these defects scales with the quench rate, adhering to a universal power law as predicted by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). In this study, we aim to investigate the counting statistics of kink density in the 1D transverse-field quantum Ising model. We demonstrate on a 20-qubit quantum processing unit, that higher-order cumulants follow a universal power law scaling as a function of the quench time. We also show the breakdown of the KZM mechanism for short quenches for finite-size systems. Tensor network simulations corroborate our quantum simulation results for bigger systems not in the asymptotic limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classic paradigms for learning and memory recall focus on strengths of synaptic couplings and how these can be modulated to encode memories. In a previous paper [A. K. Behera, M. Rao, S. Sastry, and S. Vaikuntanathan, Physical Review X 13, 041043 (2023)], we demonstrated how a specific non-equilibrium modification of the dynamics of an associative memory system can lead to increase in storage capacity. In this work, using analytical theory and computational inference schemes, we show that the dynamical steady state accessed is in fact similar to those accessed after the operation of a classic unsupervised scheme for improving memory recall, Hebbian unlearning or ``dreaming". Together, our work suggests how nonequilibrium dynamics can provide an alternative route for controlling the memory encoding and recall properties of a variety of synthetic (neuromorphic) and biological systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring Growing Complex Systems with Higher-Order Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A complex system with many interacting individuals can be represented by a network consisting of nodes and links representing individuals and pairwise interactions, respectively. However, real-world systems grow with time and include many higher-order interactions. Such systems with higher-order interactions can be well described by a simplicial complex (SC), which is a type of hypergraph, consisting of simplexes representing sets of multiple interacting nodes. Here, capturing the properties of growing real-world systems, we propose a growing random SC (GRSC) model where a node is added and a higher dimensional simplex is established among nodes at each time step. We then rigorously derive various percolation properties in the GRSC. Finally, we confirm that the system exhibits an infinite-order phase transition as higher-order interactions accelerate the growth of the system and result in the advanced emergence of a giant cluster. This work can pave the way for interpreting growing complex systems with higher-order interactions such as social, biological, brain, and technological systems.</description>

      <title>Modular Properties of Generalised Gibbs Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the modular properties of Generalised Gibbs Ensembles (GGEs) in two dimensional conformal field theories. These are obtained by inserting higher spin charges in the expressions for the partition function of the theory. We investigate the particular case where KdV charges are inserted in the GGE. We first determine an asymptotic expression for the transformed GGE. This expression is an expansion in terms of the zero modes of all the quasi-primary fields in the theory, not just the KdV charges. While these charges are non-commuting they can be re-exponentiated to give an asymptotic expression for the transformed GGE in terms of another GGE. As an explicit example we focus on the Lee-Yang model. We use the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz in the Lee-Yang model to first replicate the asymptotic results, and then find additional energies that need to be included in the transformed GGE in order to find the exact modular transformation.</description>

      <title>Persistent versus dissipative Peltier effect in a topological quantum thermocouple</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect on the thermoelectric properties of three-terminal quantum devices is investigated. Thermodynamic relations among the linear-response coefficients of these devices are derived and interpreted. General expressions are derived using nonequilibrium Green's functions, and applied to calculate the thermoelectric response of a model quantum thermocouple. It is shown that the AB effect can generate a large thermoelectric response in a device with particle-hole symmetry, which nominally has zero Seebeck and Peltier coefficients. In addition to modifying the external electric and thermal currents of the device, the AB effect also induces persistent electric and thermal currents. One might expect that a persistent electric current in a quantum thermocouple, through the Peltier effect, could lead to persistent Peltier cooling, violating the 1st and 2nd Laws of Thermodynamics. However, this apparent paradox is resolved by elucidating the distinction between persistent and dissipative currents in quantum thermoelectrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the spin-orbit coupled Bose gas with repulsive mean-field interparticle interactions. We analyze the phase diagram of the system varying the temperature $T&gt;0$, the chemical potentials, as well as interparticle and spin-orbit interaction couplings. Our results indicate that, for Rashba- and Weyl-type spin-orbit couplings, condensates featuring ordering wavevector $\vec{Q}\neq \vec{0}$ are fragile with respect to thermal fluctuations and, at $T&gt;0$, the only stable thermodynamic phases involving the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) are those of uniform type with $\vec{Q}=\vec{0}$. On the other hand, presence of the spin-orbit coupling stabilizes the $\vec{Q}=\vec{0}$ BEC state at any dimensionality $d&gt;1$ and modifies either the order or the universality class of the corresponding phase transition. We emphasize the singular nature of the limit of vanishing spin-orbit interaction coupling $v$, sizable shifts of the phase boundaries upon varying $v$, as well as the role of the relative magnitudes of the interparticle interaction couplings for the character of the condensation transition.</description>

      <title>Thermal disorder and phonon softening in the ferroelectric phase transition of lead titanate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report an extensive molecular dynamics study of ab-initio quality of the ferroelectric phase transition in crystalline PbTiO3. We model anharmonicity accurately in terms of potential energy and polarization surfaces trained on density functional theory data with modern machine learning techniques. Our simulations demonstrate that the transition has a strong order-disorder character, in agreement with diffraction experiments, and provide fresh insight into the approach to equilibrium upon crossing the transition temperature. We find that the macroscopic polarization appears/disappears due to dipolar switching at the nanometer scale. We also compute the infrared optical absorption spectra in both the ferroelectric and the paraelectric phases, finding good agreement with the experimental Raman frequencies. For a long time, the almost ideal displacive character of the soft mode detected by Raman scattering in the paraelectric phase has been contrasted with the order-disorder character of the transition suggested by diffraction. We settle this issue by showing that the soft mode coexists with a strong Debye relaxation due to the thermal disordering of the dipoles. The Debye relaxation feature is centered at zero frequency and appears near the transition temperature in both the ferroelectric and the paraelectric phases.</description>

      <title>Mpemba Meets Quantum Chaos: Anomalous Relaxation and Mpemba Crossings in Dissipative Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect (MPE), named after a student who discovered the phenomenon during a classroom experiment, has intrigued scientists for decades. This effect challenges conventional wisdom by demonstrating that the hot milk can freeze faster than cold milk under certain conditions. Recently, similar effects have been found in integrable quantum systems. However, the key distinction between the classical MPE and its quantum analog is that the latter relies predominantly on the of the properties of the initial states rather than the cooling rate. In this paper, we explore the quench dynamics of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) systems coupled to thermal baths. We investigate three scenarios--an SYK system coupled with an SYK thermal bath, an SYK system coupled with two thermal baths at different temperatures, and a dissipative SYK system modeled by the Lindblad equation. In the regimes where the system and the baths are strongly coupled, we observe effective temperature oscillations and Mpemba crossings (MPCs)--an effect of temperature crossings which are absent in the equilibrium thermodynamic analysis--when the system is strongly coupled to SYK thermal baths. The emergence of the MPCs suggests the observation of a transient MPE in the cooling or heating process before the systems reach the steady states. The emergence of MPCs in quantum chaotic systems exhibits strong parallels with the classical MPE.</description>

      <title>Entanglement enhancement induced by noise in inhomogeneously monitored systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how stronger noise can enhance the entanglement in inhomogeneously monitored quantum systems. We consider a free fermions model composed of two coupled chains - a system chain and an ancilla chain, each subject to its own different noise - and explore the dynamics of entanglement within the system chain under different noise intensities. Our results demonstrate that, contrary to the detrimental effects typically associated with noise, certain regimes of noise on the ancilla can significantly enhance entanglement within the system. Numerical simulations demonstrate the robustness of such entanglement enhancement across various system sizes and noise parameters. This enhancement is found to be highly dependent on the hopping strength in the ancilla, suggesting that the interplay between unitary dynamics and noise can be tuned to optimize the entanglement of a quantum system.</description>

      <title>Integrability is generic in homogeneous U(1)-invariant nearest-neighbor qubit circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrability is an exceptional property believed to hold only for systems with fine-tuned parameters. Contrary, we explicitly show that in homogeneous nearest-neighbor qubit circuits with a U(1) symmetry, i.e., circuits that repeatedly apply the same magnetization-conserving two-qubit gate, this is not the case. There, integrability is generic: all such brickwall qubit circuits are integrable, even with a randomly selected gate. We identify two phases with different conservation laws, transport properties, and strong zero edge modes. Experimentally important is the fact that varying any one of the parameters in the generic U(1) gate, one will typically cross the critical manifold that separates the two phases. Finally, we report on an unconventional time-reversal symmetry causing the system with open boundary conditions to be in the orthogonal class, while the one with periodic boundary conditions is in the unitary class.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling of quantum caustics in the dynamics of interacting particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical studies have predicted the existence of caustics in many-body quantum dynamics, where they manifest as extended regions of enhanced probability density that obey temporal and spatial scaling relations. Focusing on the transverse-field Ising model, we investigate the dynamics initiated by a local quench in a spin chain, resulting in outward-propagating excitations that create a distinct caustic pattern. We calculate the scaling of the first two maxima of the interference fringes dressing the caustic, finding a universal exponent of 2/3, associated with an Airy function catastrophe. We demonstrate that this property is universal in the entire paramagnetic phase of the model, and starts varying at the quantum phase transition (QPT). This robust scaling persists even under perturbations that break the integrability of the model. We additionally explore the effect of boundary conditions and find that open boundaries introduce significant edge effects, leading to complex interference patterns. Despite these edge-induced dynamics, the overall power-law scaling exponent remains robust. These findings highlight the potential of quantum caustics as a powerful diagnostic tool for QPTs, demonstrating resilience against integrability-breaking perturbations and boundary condition variations.</description>

      <title>Failure of the large-N expansion in a Bosonic Tensor Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the tensor model generalization of the quantum $p$-spherical model in the large-$N$ limit. While the tensor model has the same large-$N$ expansion as the disordered quantum $p$-spherical model, its ground state is superextensive, in contradiction with large-$N$ perturbation theory. Therefore, the large-$N$ expansion of this model catastrophically fails at arbitrarily large-$N$, without any obvious signal in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Precisely controlled colloids: A playground for path-wise non-equilibrium physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate path-wise observables in experiments on driven colloids in a periodic optical field to dissect selected intricate transport features, kinetics, and transition-path time statistics out of thermodynamic equilibrium. These observables directly reflect the properties of individual paths in contrast to the properties of an ensemble of particles, such as radial distribution functions or mean-squared displacements. In particular, we present two distinct albeit equivalent formulations of the underlying stochastic equation of motion, highlight their respective practical relevance, and show how to interchange between them. We discuss conceptually different notions of local velocities and interrogate one- and two-sided first-passage and transition-path-time statistics in and out of equilibrium. We emphasize how path-wise observables may be employed to systematically assess the quality of experimental data and demonstrate that, given sufficient control and sampling, one may quantitatively verify subtle theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Gaussian to log-normal transition for independent sets in a percolated hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Independent sets in graphs, i.e., subsets of vertices where no two are adjacent, have long been studied, for instance as a model of hard-core gas. The $d$-dimensional hypercube, $\{0,1\}^d$, with the nearest neighbor structure, has been a particularly appealing choice for the base graph, owing in part to its many symmetries. Results go back to the work of Korshunov and Sapozhenko who proved sharp results on the count of such sets as well as structure theorems for random samples drawn uniformly. Of much interest is the behavior of such Gibbs measures in the presence of disorder. In this direction, Kronenberg and Spinka [KS] initiated the study of independent sets in a random subgraph of the hypercube obtained by considering an instance of bond percolation with probability $p$. Relying on tools from statistical mechanics they obtained a detailed understanding of the moments of the partition function, say $\mathcal{Z}$, of the hard-core model on such random graphs and consequently deduced certain fluctuation information, as well as posed a series of interesting questions. In particular, they showed in the uniform case that there is a natural phase transition at $p=2/3$ where $\mathcal{Z}$ transitions from being concentrated for $p&gt;2/3$ to not concentrated at $p=2/3$.
  In this article, developing a probabilistic framework, as well as relying on certain cluster expansion inputs from [KS], we present a detailed picture of both the fluctuations of $\mathcal{Z}$ as well as the geometry of a randomly sampled independent set. In particular, we establish that $\mathcal{Z}$, properly centered and scaled, converges to a standard Gaussian for $p&gt;2/3$, and to a sum of two i.i.d. log-normals at $p=2/3$. A particular step in the proof which could be of independent interest involves a non-uniform birthday problem for which collisions emerge at $p=2/3$.</description>

Abstract: We formulate a scaling theory for the long-time diffusive motion in a space occluded by a high density of moving obstacles in dimensions 1, 2 and 3. Our tracers diffuse anomalously over many decades in time, before reaching a diffusive steady state with an effective diffusion constant $D_\mathrm{eff}$, which depends on the obstacle diffusivity and density. The scaling of $D_\mathrm{eff}$, above and below a critical regime, is characterized by two independent critical parameters: the conductivity exponent $\mu$, also found in models with frozen obstacles, and an exponent $\psi$, which quantifies the effect of obstacle diffusivity.</description>

      <title>Discrete Laplacian thermostat for flocks and swarms: the fully conserved Inertial Spin Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experiments on bird flocks and midge swarms reveal that these natural systems are well described by an active theory in which conservation laws play a crucial role. By building a symplectic structure that couples the particles' velocities to the generator of their internal rotations (spin), the Inertial Spin Model (ISM) reinstates a second-order temporal dynamics that captures many phenomenological traits of flocks and swarms. The reversible structure of the ISM predicts that the total spin is a constant of motion, the central conservation law responsible for all the novel dynamical features of the model. However, fluctuations and dissipation introduced in the original model to make it relax, violate the spin conservation law, so that the ISM aligns with the biophysical phenomenology only within finite-size regimes, beyond which the overdamped dynamics characteristic of the Vicsek model takes over. Here, we introduce a novel version of the ISM, in which the irreversible terms needed to relax the dynamics strictly respect the conservation of the spin. We perform a numerical investigation of the fully conservative model, exploring both the fixed-network case, which belongs to the equilibrium class of Model G, and the active case, characterized by self-propulsion of the agents and an out-of-equilibrium reshuffling of the underlying interaction network. Our simulations not only capture the correct spin wave phenomenology of the ordered phase, but they also yield dynamical critical exponents in the near-ordering phase that agree very well with the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Semi-Markov Processes in Open Quantum Systems. III. Large Deviations of First Passage Time Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a specific class of open quantum systems with finite and fixed numbers of collapsed quantum states, the semi-Markov process method is used to calculate the large deviations of the first passage time statistics. The core formula is an equation of poles, which is also applied in determining the scaled generating functions (SCGFs) of the counting statistics. For simple counting variables, the SCGFs of the first passage time statistics are derived by finding the largest modulus of the roots of this equation with respect to the $z$-transform parameter and then calculating its logarithm. The procedure is analogous to that of solving for the SCGFs of the counting statistics. However, for current-like variables, the method generally fails unless the equation of pole is simplified to a quadratic form. The fundamental reason for this lies in the nonuniqueness between the roots and the region of convergence for the joint transform. We illustrate these results via a resonantly driven two-level quantum system, where for several counting variables the solutions to the SCGFs of the first passage time are analytically obtained. Furthermore, we apply these functions to investigate quantum violations of the classical kinetic and thermodynamic uncertainty relations.</description>

      <title>Why gauge invariance applies to statistical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an introductory account of the recently identified gauge invariance of the equilibrium statistical mechanics of classical many-body systems [J. M\"uller et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. (to appear) arXiv:2406.19235]. The gauge transformation is a non-commutative shifting operation on phase space that keeps the differential phase space volume element and hence the Gibbs integration measure conserved. When thermally averaged any observable is an invariant, including thermodynamic and structural quantities. Shifting transformations are canonical in the sense of classical mechanics. They also form an infinite-dimensional group with generators of infinitesimal transformations that build a non-commutative Lie algebra. We lay out the connections with the underlying geometry of coordinate displacement and with Noether's theorem. Spatial localization of the shifting yields differential operators that satisfy commutator relationships, which we describe both in purely configurational and in full phase space setups. Standard operator calculus yields corresponding equilibrium hyperforce correlation sum rules for general observables and order parameters. Using Monte Carlos simulations we demonstrate explicitly the gauge invariance for finite shifting. We argue in favour of using the gauge invariance as a statistical mechanical construction principle for obtaining exact results and for formulating smart sampling algorithms.</description>

      <title>Novel Emergent Phases in a Two-Dimensional Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.10215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we report our observation of an extraordinarily rich phase diagram of a LaScO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ heterostructure. Close to the superconducting transition temperature, the system hosts a superconducting critical point of the Infinite-randomness type characterized by an effective dynamical exponent $\nu z$ that diverges logarithmically. At lower temperatures, we find the emergence of a magnetic field-tuned metallic phase that co-exists with a quantum Griffiths phase (QGP). Our study reveals a previously unobserved phenomenon in 2D superconductors -- an unanticipated suppression of the QGP below a crossover temperature in this system. This concealment is accompanied by the destruction of the superconducting quantum critical point signaled by a power-law divergence (in temperature) of the effective dynamical exponent. These observations are entirely at odds with the predictions of the infinite-randomness scenario and challenge the very concept of a vanishing energy scale associated with a quantum critical point. We develop and discuss possible scenarios like smearing of the phase transition that could plausibly explain our observations. Our findings challenge the notion that QGP is the ultimate ground state in two-dimensional superconductors.</description>

Abstract: While volume violation of area law has been exhibited in several quantum spin chains, the construction of a corresponding ground state in higher dimensions, entangled in more than one direction, has been an open problem. Here we construct a 2D frustration-free Hamiltonian with maximal violation of the area law. We do so by building a quantum model of random surfaces with color degree of freedom that can be viewed as a collection of colored Dyck paths. The Hamiltonian may be viewed as a 2D generalization of the Fredkin spin chain. It relates all the colored random surface configurations subject to a Dirichlet boundary condition and hard wall constraint from below to one another, and the ground state is therefore a superposition of all such classical states and non-degenerate. Its entanglement entropy between subsystems undergoes a quantum phase transition as the deformation parameter is tuned. The area- and volume-law phases are similar to the one-dimensional model, while the critical point scales with the linear size of the system $L$ as $L\log L$. Further it is conjectured that similar models with entanglement phase transitions can be built in higher dimensions with even softer area law violations at the critical point.</description>

      <title>Near-future projections in continuous agent-based models for crowd dynamics: mathematical structures in use and their implications</title>

Abstract: This paper addresses the theoretical foundations of pedestrian models for crowd dynamics. While the topic gains momentum, current models differ widely in their mathematical structure, even if we only consider continuous agent-based models. To clarify their underpinning, we first lay mathematical foundations for the common hierarchical decomposition into strategic, tactical, and operational levels and underline the practical interest in preserving the continuity between the latter two levels by working with a floor field, rather than way-points. Turning to local navigation, we clarify how three archetypical approaches, namely, purely reactive models, anticipatory models based on the idea of times to collision, and game theory, differ in the way they extrapolate trajectories in the near future. We also insist on the oft-overlooked distinction between processes pertaining to decision-making and mechanical effects in dense settings. The implications of these differences are illustrated with a comparison of the numerical predictions of these models in the simple scenario of head-on collision avoidance between agents, by varying the walking speed, the reaction times, and the degree of courtesy of the agents, notably.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal growth of quantum conditional mutual information under decoherence</title>

Abstract: Local measurements cannot create entanglement, but they can convert short-range entanglement to long-range entanglement, as in quantum teleportation. This phenomenon of measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) has been widely discussed in recent work on measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions and related phenomena. Here, we situate MIE in a broader context of the growth of long-range conditional mutual information (CMI) under decoherence. We upper-bound the rate at which decoherence can generate long-range CMI, and derive a characterization of states that saturate this bound. We point out that the structure of states saturating the CMI upper bound can be very different under different decoherent dynamics and provide explicit examples. We additionally explore the dynamics of CMI in random quantum circuits subject to random local decoherence, as a function of circuit depth. We argue that the universality class of the finite-depth teleportation transition, as well as its lower critical dimension, are different for erasures than for measurements.</description>

      <title>Evidence that the AT transition disappears below six dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03711v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the key predictions of Parisi's broken replica symmetry theory of spin glasses is the existence of a phase transition in an applied field to a state with broken replica symmetry. This transition takes place at the de Almeida-Thouless (AT) line in the $h-T$ plane. We have studied this line in the power-law diluted Heisenberg spin glass in which the probability that two spins separated by a distance $r$ interact with each other falls as $1/r^{2\sigma}$. In the presence of a random vector-field of variance $h_r^2$ the phase transition is in the universality class of the Ising spin glass in a field. Tuning $\sigma$ is equivalent to changing the dimension $d$ of the short-range system, with the relation being $d =2/(2\sigma -1)$ for $\sigma &lt; 2/3$. We have found by numerical simulations that $h_{\text{AT}}^2 \sim (2/3 -\sigma)$ implying that the AT line does not exist below $6$ dimensions and that the Parisi scheme is not appropriate for spin glasses in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>False vacuum decay and nucleation dynamics in neutral atom systems</title>

Abstract: Metastable states of quantum many-body systems with confinement offer a means to simulate false vacuum phenomenology, including non-equilibrium dynamical processes like decay by nucleation, in truncated limits. Recent work has examined the decay process in 1D ferromagnetic Ising spins and superfluids. In this paper, we study nucleation dynamics in 1D antiferromagnetic neutral atom chains with Rydberg interactions, using both numerical simulations and analytic modeling. We apply a staggered local detuning field to generate the metastable and ground states. Our efforts focus on two dynamical regimes: decay and annealing. In the first, we corroborate the phenomenological decay rate scaling and determine the associated parameter range for the decay process; in the second, we uncover and elucidate a procedure to anneal the metastable state from the initial to the final system, with intermediate nucleation events. We further propose experimental protocols to prepare the required states and perform quenches on near-term neutral atom quantum simulators, examining the experimental feasibility of our proposed setup and parameter regime.</description>

      <title>Long-lived oscillations of metastable states in neutral atom systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metastable states arise in a range of quantum systems and can be observed in various dynamical scenarios, including decay, bubble nucleation, and long-lived oscillations. The phenomenology of metastable states has been examined in quantum many-body systems, notably in 1D ferromagnetic Ising spin systems and superfluids. In this paper, we study long-lived oscillations of metastable and ground states in 1D antiferromagnetic neutral atom chains with long-range Rydberg interactions. We use a staggered local detuning field to achieve confinement. Using theoretical and numerical models, we identify novel spectral signatures of quasiparticle oscillations distinct to antiferromagnetic neutral atom systems and interpret them using a classical energy model of short-range meson repulsion. Finally, we evaluate the experimental accessibility of our proposed setup on current neutral-atom platforms and discuss experimental feasibility and constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09126v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A procedure to find optimal regimes for quantum thermal engines (QTMs) is described and demonstrated. The QTMs are modelled as the periodically-driven non-equilibrium steady states of open quantum systems, whose dynamics is approximated in this work with Markovian master equations. The action of the external agent, and the couplings to the heat reservoirs can be modulated with control functions, and it is the time-dependent shape of these control functions the object of optimisation. Those functions can be freely parameterised, which permits to constrain the solutions according to experimental or physical requirements.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Scalings of Quantum Entropies in Long-Range Heisenberg Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, building on state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we perform systematic finite-size scaling of both entanglement and participation entropies for long-range Heisenberg chain with unfrustrated power-law decaying interactions. We find distinctive scaling behaviors for both quantum entropies in the various regimes explored by tuning the decay exponent $\alpha$, thus capturing non-trivial features through logarithmic terms, beyond the case of linear Nambu-Goldstone modes. Our systematic analysis reveals that the quantum entanglement information, hidden in the scaling of the two studied entropies, can be obtained to the same level of order parameters and other usual finite-size observables of quantum many-body lattice models. The analysis and results obtained here can readily apply to more quantum criticalities in 1D and 2D systems.</description>

      <title>Angle-dependent planar thermal Hall effect by quasi-ballistic phonons in black phosphorus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of the phonon thermal Hall effect in insulators is a matter of ongoing debate. The large amplitude of the signal in an elemental non-magnetic solid, such as black phosphorus (BP) calls for a minimal mechanism with no role for spin degree of freedom. Here, we show that a longitudinal heat flow generates a transverse temperature gradient in BP even when the magnetic field, the heat current and the thermal gradient lie in the same plane. The long phonon mean-free-path leaves little room for scattering by point-like symmetry breaking defects. We argue that the angular dependence of the signal can be accounted for as a sum of two sinusoidal components each peaking when the magnetic field is parallel to a high symmetry axis. Anharmonicity and finite thermal expansion emerge as indispensable ingredients for a planar Hall signal. We identify the torque exerted by magnetic field on traveling electric dipolar waves as a possible microscopic driver.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Induced Competitive Release in a Meta-Population Model of Range Expansions in Disordered Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rare evolutionary events, such as the rise to prominence of deleterious mutations, can have drastic impacts on the evolution of growing populations. Heterogeneous environments may reduce the influence of selection on evolutionary outcomes through various mechanisms, including pinning of genetic lineages and of the population fronts. These effects play significant roles in enabling competitive release of otherwise trapped mutations. In this work we show that environments containing random arrangements of "hotspot" patches, where locally abundant resources enhance growth rates equally for all sub-populations, give rise to massively enriched deleterious mutant clones. We derive a geometrical optics description of mutant bubbles, which result from interactions with hotspots, that successfully predicts the observed increase in mutant survival. This prediction requires no fitting parameters and holds well in scenarios of rare mutations and of adaptation from standing variation. In addition, we find that the influence of environmental noise in shaping the fate of rare mutations is maximal near a percolation transition of overlapping discs, beyond which mutant survival decreases.</description>
