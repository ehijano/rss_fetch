      <title>Search for Dark Matter Induced Airglow in Planetary Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out that dark matter can illuminate planetary skies via ultraviolet airglow. Dark matter annihilation products can excite molecular hydrogen, which then deexcites to produce ultraviolet emission in the Lyman and Werner bands. We search for this new effect by analyzing nightside ultraviolet radiation data from Voyager 1, Voyager 2, and New Horizons flybys of Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, and Jupiter. Our findings set new constraints on the dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section down to about $10^{-40}~$cm$^2$. We highlight that future ultraviolet airglow measurements of Solar System planets or other worlds provide a new dark matter discovery avenue.</description>

      <title>Ultralight dark matter detection with levitated ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Levitated ferromagnets act as ultraprecise magnetometers, which can exhibit high quality factors due to their excellent isolation from the environment. These instruments can be utilized in searches for ultralight dark matter candidates, such as axionlike dark matter or dark-photon dark matter. In addition to being sensitive to an axion-photon coupling or kinetic mixing, which produce physical magnetic fields, ferromagnets are also sensitive to the effective magnetic field (or ``axion wind") produced by an axion-electron coupling. While the dynamics of a levitated ferromagnet in response to a DC magnetic field have been well studied, all of these couplings would produce AC fields. In this work, we study the response of a ferromagnet to an applied AC magnetic field and use these results to project their sensitivity to axion and dark-photon dark matter. We pay special attention to the direction of motion induced by an applied AC field, in particular, whether it precesses around the applied field (similar to an electron spin) or librates in the plane of the field (similar to a compass needle). We show that existing levitated ferromagnet setups can already have comparable sensitivity to an axion-electron coupling as comagnetometer or torsion balance experiments. In addition, future setups can become sensitive probes of axion-electron coupling, dark-photon kinetic mixing, and axion-photon coupling, for ultralight dark matter masses $m_\mathrm{DM}\lesssim\mathrm{feV}$.</description>

      <title>Production and in-medium modification of $\phi$ mesons in proton-nucleus reactions from a transport approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Production and in-medium modification of hidden strange $\phi$ mesons are studied in proton-nucleus reactions - p+C, p+Cu and p+Pb - at 12 GeV/c, partially measured by the KEK E325 collaboration via the dilepton decay mode. This work is based on the off-shell microscopic Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach, which provides the dynamical description of strongly interacting hadronic and partonic degrees of freedom in dense matter, and especially makes it possible to simulate in-medium off-shell dynamics of the $\phi$ meson in the reactions studied. Different in-medium scenarios for the modification of the $\phi$ meson spectral function in nuclear matter are investigated: i) dropping pole mass, ii) collisional broadening and iii) simultaneous dropping pole mass and collisional broadening. Even though the $\phi$ meson production in p+A reactions occurs only at densities around or below normal nuclear matter density $\rho_0$, we find visible modifications of the generated dilepton spectra for the in-medium scenarios compared to the vacuum distribution.</description>

      <title>Infrared properties of the quark-gluon vertex in general kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work we determine the eight form factors of the transversely-projected quark-gluon vertex in general kinematics, in the context of Landau-gauge QCD with two degenerate light dynamical quarks. The study is based on the set of Schwinger-Dyson equations that govern the vertex form factors, derived within the formalism of the three-particle-irreducible (3PI) effective action. The analysis is performed by employing lattice data for the main ingredients, such as gluon and quark propagators, and three-gluon vertex. The numerical treatment is simplified by decoupling the system of integral equations: the classical form factor is determined from a single non-linear equation involving only itself, while the remaining ones are subsequently computed through simple integrations. The form factors are obtained for arbitrary values of space-like momenta, and their angular dependence is examined in detail. A clear hierarchy is established at the level of the corresponding dimensionless effective couplings, in agreement with results of earlier studies. Furthermore, the classical form factor is found to be in excellent agreement with recent unquenched lattice data in the soft-gluon configuration, while the two non-classical dressings depart substantially from the lattice results. Finally, the accurate implementation of multiplicative renormalizability is confirmed, and the transition from Minkoswski to Euclidean space is elucidated.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-group running of dimension-8 four-fermion operators in the SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the renormalization-group equations governing the evolution of dimension-8 four-fermion operators in the SMEFT. We describe the calculation and present analytic results for both the full flavor structure of the SMEFT and with the assumption of minimal flavor violation. We present numerical results for the renormalization-group evolution of the coefficients, and study their impact on fits of the LHC Drell-Yan data. The effects of running on the dimension-8 coefficients can reach 50% or more when evolving from 10 TeV scale down to few-GeV energies relevant for the analysis of fixed-target data. However, the impact of the dimension-8 running on the analysis of Drell-Yan data from the LHC is minimal.</description>

      <title>Bounds on $a_\mu^{\mathrm{HVP,LO}}$ using H\"older's inequalities and finite-energy QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study establishes bounds on the leading-order (LO) hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ($a_\mu^{\mathrm{HVP,LO}}$, $a_\mu = (g-2)_\mu/2$) by using H\"older's inequality and related inequalities in Finite-Energy QCD sum rules. Considering contributions from light quarks ($u,d,s$) up to five-loop order in perturbation theory within the chiral limit, leading-order light-quark mass corrections, next-to-leading order for dimension-four QCD condensates, and leading-order for dimension-six QCD condensates, the study finds QCD lower and upper bounds as $\left(657.0\pm 34.8\right)\times 10^{-10}\leq a_\mu^{\mathrm{HVP,LO}} \leq \left(788.4\pm 41.8\right)\times10^{-10}\,$.</description>

      <title>$B_{(s)}\to D_{(s)}^{(*)}M$ decays in the presence of final-state interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of the recent data for $\bar{B}_{(s)}\to D^{(*)}_{(s)}P$ and $\bar{B}_{(s)}\to D_{(s)}V$ decays, we perform a model-independent phenomenological analysis in the presence of quasi-elastic rescattering. With the Wilson coefficients including contributions beyond the standard model, lifetimes of $B$ meson as well as the $B^0_d-\bar{B}^0_d$ mixing are investigated for clarifying correlations among the observables. We show that parameter regions for quasi-elastic rescattering, the size of color-suppressed tree amplitudes and new physics are constrained due to the lifetime data. As a consequence, it is revealed that this scenario can be testable by the future LHCb measurement of width difference in $B^0_d-\bar{B}^0_d$ mixing and semi-leptonic CP asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological study of heavy neutral gauge boson in the left-right symmetric model at future muon collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exotic neutral gauge boson is a powerful candidate for the new physics beyond the standard model. As a promising model, the left-right symmetric model has been proposed to explain the neutrino mass, dark matter, and matter-antimatter asymmetry, etc., in which exotic gauge bosons $Z^\prime, W^{\prime \pm}$ have been put forward as well as other new right-handed particles. We investigate the $\mu^+ \mu^- \to q\bar{q} $ and $ \mu^+ \mu^- \to l^+ l^- $ processes involving the $Z^\prime$ boson as an intermediate particle. The coupling strength, decay width and mass are the key parameters on the production and decay processes of the $Z^\prime$ boson. The results indicate that the angular distributions of final particles are sensitive to the couplings of $Z^\prime$ to the other fermions. Asymmetries defined from the angular distributions are ideal quantities to demonstrate the discrepancy between the standard model process and the processes with $Z^\prime$ participated and they are also appropriate observables to discriminate the couplings of $Z^\prime$ to other particles. Compared with the current results at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the future muon collider has a great potential to explore the new parameter space with $Z^\prime$ boson.</description>

      <title>Investigating the $p$-$\Omega$ Interaction and Correlation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the experimental measurements, we investigate the $p$-$\Omega$ correlation functions and interactions. By solving the inverse scattering problem, we derive the $p$-$\Omega$ potentials from a quark model. The effects of Coulomb interaction and spin-averaging are discussed. According to our results, the depletion of the $p$-$\Omega$ correlation functions, attributed to the $J^P = 2^+$ bound state not observed in the ALICE Collaboration's measurements [Nature \textbf{588}, 232 (2020)], can be explained by the contribution of the attractive $J^P = 1^+$ component in spin-averaging. Additionally, there is a subtle sub-unity part of the correlation function, which can also be seen in the experimental data, supporting the existence of the $p$-$\Omega$ bound state. So far, we have completed the consistent description of the $p$-$\Omega$ system from the perspective of the quark model in terms of energy spectrum, scattering phase shift, and correlation function. The existence of the $p$-$\Omega$ bound state has been confirmed from these three aspects. In Appendix, we learn the relationship between correlation functions and interaction potentials by using simplified square potential models and find a periodic-like variation.</description>

      <title>Study of CP Violation in charm decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The violation of the Charge-Parity (CP) symmetry is a phenomenon described by the Standard Model (SM), however, its predictions for this violation are not enough to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the visible universe. Experimentally, CP violation in hadronic decays had already been observed in various circumstances before 2019, when the LHCb experiment at CERN first published results reporting CPV in D-meson decays [arXiv:1903.08726v2] ($D^0 \to K^- K^+$ and $D^0 \to \pi^- \pi^+$). In this work, a study of CP violation is carried out analysing the phenomenology of charm decays. The study of such topic is guided by the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix and the process of flavour changing decays caused by the weak interaction (focusing on charm decays). The symmetries attributed to physical conservation laws were recognized, allowing for the possibilities of CP violation predicted by the SM to be examined more closely. Such theoretical studies are then compared to the results obtained by the LHCb Collaboration. Furthermore, a comparison between CPV in charm decays and in neutrino oscillations is made, analysing the CP violating phase in both the CKM and the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrices.</description>

      <title>Self-Interacting Dark Matter and flavor anomalies in an atlas of leptophilic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an atlas of leptophilic models with non-universal charges that combine the quantum numbers \((L_e - L_{\mu})\) and \((L_{\mu} - L_{\tau})\) in various realizations. We explore diverse manifestations of the atlas to understand their impact on explaining the muon \((g-2)_{\mu}\) anomaly, as well as the origin of self-interacting dark matter, which serves as a feasible explanation for the small-scale challenges of cold dark matter. We found that a single vector gauge boson with mass range of $\sim 10~\mathrm{MeV}$ and non-universal couplings as indicated successfully mediates interactions in the fermion and dark matter sectors in such a way that $(g-2)_{\mu}$ additional contribution agrees with experimental constraints and the self-interacting dark matter fluid behaves as suggested by observations at different astrophysical length scales. Furthermore, the model requires a dark matter candidate within $10-100~ \mathrm{GeV}$ order mass and a strong dark coupling ($g_{\chi} \sim 0.3$, much stronger than the lepton's couplings $g'_l \lesssim 10^{-4}$) to be a successful scenario to unravel astrophysical small scale problems.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent exotic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel interactions beyond the four known fundamental forces in nature (electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions), may arise due to "new physics" beyond the standard model, manifesting as a "fifth force". This review is focused on spin-dependent fifth forces mediated by exotic bosons such as spin-0 axions and axionlike particles and spin-1 Z' bosons, dark photons, or paraphotons. Many of these exotic bosons are candidates to explain the nature of dark matter and dark energy, and their interactions may violate fundamental symmetries. Spin-dependent interactions between fermions mediated by the exchange of exotic bosons have been investigated in a variety of experiments, particularly at the low-energy frontier. Experimental methods and tools used to search for exotic spin-dependent interactions, such as atomic comagnetometers, torsion balances, nitrogen-vacancy spin sensors, and precision atomic and molecular spectroscopy, are described. A complete set of interaction potentials, derived based on quantum field theory with minimal assumptions and characterized in terms of reduced coupling constants, are presented. A comprehensive summary of existing experimental and observational constraints on exotic spin-dependent interactions is given, illustrating the current research landscape and promising directions of further research.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Matter Electromagnetic Properties in Direct Detection Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomical and cosmological observations indicate that dark matter should interact very weakly with the electromagnetic radiation. Nevertheless, the existence of such interactions is not precluded by observations nor by theoretical considerations. A promising approach to probe the dark matter electromagnetic properties is through the search of photon-mediated dark matter-nucleus interactions in direct detection experiments. In this paper we present a simple methodology to calculate the scattering rate in a direct detection experiment for given values of the dark matter electric charge, charge radius, electric- and magnetic- dipole moments and anapole moment. In our work we include contributions to the scattering from nuclear recoils and from the Migdal effect. We finally apply this formalism to determine exclusion limits on the five electromagnetic interactions using data from XENON1T, LZ, PICO-60 and DS50 experiments, and we discuss the implications for a simplified dark matter model with t-channel mediators.</description>

      <title>Limits on new strongly interacting matter from measurements of Transverse Energy-Energy Correlations at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work establishes 95% confidence level limits to models incorporating additional fermions sensitive to the strong interaction. Precision measurements of Transverse Energy-Energy Correlations at the ATLAS experiment are used, exploiting their dependence on the strong coupling constant to analyse the effects of introducing new fermions with colour charge on the Renormalisation Group Equation. The comparison between theoretical predictions, corrected up to next-to-next-to-leading order, and the data collected by ATLAS at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV allows to constrain physics models proposing the existence of new fermions with masses up to 2 TeV, independently of assumptions on the fermion decay.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the amplitudes of the axion photoproduction off the nucleon, i.e., $\gamma N \to a N$, within the framework of chiral effective field theory. Several different types of contributions are simultaneously included in our calculation, namely the nucleon exchanges up to next-to-leading order, the $a\gamma\gamma$ vertex and the vector meson exchanges in the $t$-channel. We utilize the existing hadronic inputs as much as possible to fix the unknown couplings. A comprehensive study of the phenomenological discussions is then provided in this work. Different mechanisms in the $\gamma N \to a N$ processes manifest distinct behaviors in the total and differential cross sections, which could provide useful quantities to distinguish different axion models.</description>

      <title>The $g^6$ pressure of hot Yang-Mills theory: Canonical form of the integrand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present major progress towards the determination of the last missing piece for the pressure of a Yang-Mills plasma at high temperatures at order $g^6$ in the strong coupling constant. This order is of key importance due to its role in resolving the long-standing infrared problem of finite-temperature field theory within a dimensionally reduced effective field theory setup. By systematically applying linear transformations of integration variables, or momentum shifts, we resolve equivalences between different representations of Feynman sum-integrals. on the integrand level, transforming those into a canonical form. At the order $g^6$, this results in reducing a sum of O(100000) distinct sum-integrals which are produced from all four-loop vacuum diagrams down to merely 21. Furthermore, we succeed to map 11 of those onto known lower-loop structures. This leaves only 10 genuine 4-loop sum-integrals to be evaluated, thereby bringing the finalization of three decades of theoretical efforts within reach.</description>

      <title>Modelling the underlying event in photon-initiated processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling the underlying event in high-energy hadronic collisions is important for physics at colliders. This includes lepton colliders, where low-virtuality photons accompanying the lepton beam(s) may develop hadronic structure. Similarly, photon-induced collisions also occur in proton or heavy-ion beam experiments. While the underlying event in proton-proton collisions has been the subject of much study at the LHC, studies of hadronic-photon-induced underlying event are now of increasing interest in light of planned future lepton and lepton-hadron colliders, as well as the photon-induced processes in ultra-peripheral collisions at the LHC. Here we present an investigation of the underlying event in photon-initiated processes, starting from the PYTHIA models used to describe LHC and Tevatron data, and revisiting HERA and LEP2 data. While no single tune describes all the data with different beam configurations, we find that a good agreement can still be found within the same model by adjusting the relevant parameters separately for $\gamma\gamma$, $\gamma p$ and $pp$. This suggests that the basic model of multiparton interaction implemented in PYTHIA can be applied for different beam configurations. Furthermore, we find that a reasonable agreement for $\gamma\gamma$ and $\gamma p$ data, and for $pp$ data at an LHC reference energy, can be found within a single parametrization, but $pp$ collisions would prefer a stronger energy dependence, leading to too many multiparton interactions in lower energy photon-induced collisions. On this basis, we make some recommendations for simulations of photon-induced processes, such as $\gamma \gamma$ events at the LHC or FCC and $ep$ or $eA$ collisions at the EIC, and suggest possibilities for improvements in the modelling.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Type-II and Type-III seesaw model for the muon $g-2$ anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the muon anomalous dipole moment $a_\mu$ in a model that extends the Standard Model with a scalar triplet and a vector-like lepton triplet. Different from previous studies, we find that there is still viable parameter space in this model to explain the discrepancy $\Delta a_\mu=a_{\mu}(\mathrm{Exp})-a_{\mu}(\mathrm{SM})$. While being consistent with the current data of neutrino mass, precision electroweak measurements and the perturbativity of couplings, our model can provide new physics contribution $a_\mu^\textrm{NP}$ to cover the central region of $\Delta a_\mu$ with new scalar and fermion mass as low as around TeV. This mass scale is allowed by the current collider searches for doubly charged scalars and vector-like leptons, and they can be tested at future high energy and/or high luminosity colliders.</description>

      <title>Investigating two-loop effects for first-order electroweak phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study first-order electroweak phase transitions in the real-singlet extended Standard Model, for which non-zero mixing between the Higgs and the singlet can efficiently strengthen the transitions. We perform large-scale parameter space scans of the model using two-loop effective potential at next-to-next-to leading order in the high-temperature expansion, greatly improving description of phase transition thermodynamics over existing one-loop studies. We find that 1) two-loop corrections to the effective potential lead to narrower regions of strong first-order transitions and significantly smaller critical temperatures, 2) transitions involving a discontinuity in the singlet expectation value are significantly stronger at two-loop order, 3) high-temperature expansion is accurate for a wide range of parameter space that allows strong transitions, although it is less reliable for the very strongest transitions. These findings suggest revisiting past studies that connect the possibility of a first-order electroweak phase transition with future collider phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Charged Higgs Bosons Production from Vector-Like $T$ Quark Decays at $e\gamma$ Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the extended framework of the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model Type II (2HDM-II) enhanced by a vector-like quark (VLQ) doublet $TB$, we conduct a detailed analysis of the process $e^{-}\gamma \rightarrow b\nu_{e}\bar{T}$ at future high-energy $e\gamma$ colliders, focusing on the subsequent decays $\bar{T} \rightarrow H^{-} \bar{b}$ and $H^{-} \rightarrow \bar{t}b$. Utilizing current theoretical and experimental constraints, we calculate production cross sections for both unpolarized and polarized beams at center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s} = 2$ and 3 TeV, demonstrating that polarized beams significantly enhance detectability through higher production rates. By analyzing the kinematic distributions, we establish optimized selection criteria to effectively distinguish signal events from background. At $\sqrt{s} = 2$ TeV with an integrated luminosity of 1500 fb$^{-1}$, we find exclusion regions within $s_R^d \in [0.085, 0.16]$ for $m_T \in [1000, 1260]$ GeV and a discovery potential within $s_R^d \in [0.14, 0.17]$ for $m_T \in [1000, 1100]$ GeV, with these regions expanding to $s_R^d \in [0.05, 0.15]$ for $m_T \in [1000, 1340]$ GeV and $s_R^d \in [0.11, 0.17]$ for $m_T \in [1000, 1160]$ GeV at 3000 fb$^{-1}$. At $\sqrt{s} = 3$ TeV and 1500 fb$^{-1}$, we identify exclusion regions of $s_R^d \in [0.055, 0.135]$ for $m_T \in [1000, 1640]$ GeV and discovery regions of $s_R^d \in [0.09, 0.15]$ for $m_T \in [1000, 1400]$ GeV, which further expand to $s_R^d \in [0.028, 0.12]$ for $m_T \in [1000, 1970]$ GeV and $s_R^d \in [0.04, 0.122]$ for $m_T \in [1000, 1760]$ GeV at 3000 fb$^{-1}$. These findings highlight the enhanced detection potential at higher energies, particularly with polarized beams. The effects of initial state radiation, beamstrahlung, and systematic uncertainties are also considered, influencing both exclusion and discovery capabilities.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Dark Matter from Curvature Perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the production of dark matter from curvature perturbations produced during inflation or in standard cosmology, for example during first order phase transitions. Perturbations break Weyl flatness of the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric, allowing conformally coupled fields -- in particular fermions studied here -- to be produced even in the massless limit. Particle production can be computed by studying the Bogoliubov transformation induced by the stochastic background. For perturbations generated during inflation, we present a closed formula for the resulting abundance of particles that depends solely on the power spectrum of curvature perturbations at the end of inflation. This production mechanism can be dominant especially if the amplitude of curvature perturbations is enhanced for modes that exit the horizon towards the end of inflation. In the simplest scenario, the critical dark matter abundance is reproduced for $M \gtrsim 10^{6}$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Non-holomorphic Modular $S_4$ Lepton Flavour Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the formalism of the non-supersymmetric modular invariance approach to the flavour problem the elements of the Yukawa coupling and fermion mass matrices are expressed in terms of polyharmonic Maa{\ss} modular forms of level $N$ in addition to the standard modula forms of the same level and a small number of constant parameters. Non-trivial polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms exist for zero, negative and positive integer modular weights. Employing the finite modula group $S_4$ as a flavour symmetry group and assuming that the three left-handed lepton doublets furnish a triplet irreducible representation of $S_4$, we construct all possible 7- and 8-parameter lepton flavour models in which the neutrino masses are generated either by the Weinberg effective operator or by the type I seesaw mechanism. We identify the phenomenologically viable models and obtain predictions for each of these models for the neutrino mass ordering, the absolute neutrino mass scale, the Dirac and Majorana CP-violation phases and, correspondingly, for the sum of neutrino masses and the neutrinoless double beta decay effective Majorana mass. We comment on how these models can be tested and conclude that they are all falsifiable. Detailed analyses are presented in the case of three representative benchmark lepton flavour scenarios.</description>

      <title>Aggressively-Dissipative Dark Dwarfs: The Effects of Atomic Dark Matter on the Inner Densities of Isolated Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies for a dark sector that consists of Cold Dark Matter and a strongly-dissipative sub-component. The simulations are implemented in GIZMO and include standard baryons following the FIRE-2 galaxy formation physics model. The dissipative dark matter is modeled as Atomic Dark Matter (aDM), which forms a dark hydrogen gas that cools in direct analogy to the Standard Model. Our suite includes seven different simulations of $\sim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$ systems that vary over the aDM microphysics and the dwarf's evolutionary history. We identify a region of aDM parameter space where the cooling rate is aggressive and the resulting halo density profile is universal. In this regime, the aDM gas cools rapidly at high redshifts and only a small fraction survives in the form of a central dark gas disk; the majority collapses centrally into collisionless dark "clumps", which are clusters of sub-resolution dark compact objects. These dark clumps rapidly equilibrate in the inner galaxy, resulting in an approximately isothermal distribution that can be modeled with a simple fitting function. Even when only a small fraction ($\sim 5\%$) of the total dark matter is strongly dissipative, the central densities of classical dwarf galaxies can be enhanced by over an order of magnitude, providing a sharp prediction for observations.</description>

      <title>Traces of Quantum Gravity Effects at Late time Cosmological Dynamics via Distance Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the entropy-area relation of black hole thermodynamics, we study the thermodynamics of cosmological apparent horizon in a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe in the framework of an Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP). The adopted EUP naturally admits a minimal measurable momentum (equivalently a maximal measurable length), as an infrared cutoff in the theory. We derive the modified Friedmann equations in this setup and explore some predictions of these equations for the late time universe via distance measures. We show that in this framework it is possible to realize the late time cosmic speed-up and transition to the phantom phase of the equation of state parameter of the effective cosmic fluid without recourse to any dark energy component or modified gravity. Inspection of various distance measures in this framework shows that an EUP with a negative deformation parameter suffices for the interpretation of the late time asymptotically de Sitter universe with standard non-relativistic matter.</description>

      <title>Strongly Interacting Quark Matter in Massive Quark Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the properties of strongly coupled matter at high densities in a quark star (QS). The QS is built from the density-dependent quark mass model (DDQM), modified to obtain higher maximum gravitational mass ($\rm M_{max}$) of the QS using the data from observed pulsars: XMMU J173203.3-344518, PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620, and PSR J0952-0607 as constraints in Bayesian inference. We observed that the quark matter (QM) that composes QSs with $\rm M_{max} &gt; 2M_\odot$ violates the conformality criteria determined through conformal field theory. This behavior is interpreted as a consequence of the increase in quark population with $\rho_B$ and the concomitant formation of colored quark and gluon condensates, which are influenced by the pressure build-up in the stellar core as $\rho_B$ increases. This is reflected in the enhanced DDQM model employed, which introduces an additional term relevant at high densities. On the other hand, for $\rm M_{max} &lt; 2M_\odot$ we observed the desired behavior of the QM as predicted by quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at higher densities, where the interaction decreases with increasing $\rho_B$ and eventually the quarks become deconfined due to the depletion of the DDQM through an additional attractive contribution in this case.</description>

      <title>Probing Lorentz invariance with a high-energy neutrino flare</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-of-flight measurements of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos can be used to probe Lorentz invariance, a pillar of modern physics. If Lorentz-invariance violation (LIV) occurs, it could cause neutrinos to slow down, with the delay scaling linearly or quadratically with their energy. We introduce non-parametric statistical methods designed to detect LIV-induced distortions in the temporal structure of a high-energy neutrino flare as it travels to Earth from a distant astrophysical source, independently of the intrinsic timing properties of the source. Our approach, illustrated using the 2014/2015 TeV-PeV neutrino flare from the blazar TXS 0506+056 detected by IceCube, finds that the LIV energy scale must exceed 10^{14} GeV (linear) or 10^9 GeV (quadratic). Our methods provide a robust means to investigate LIV by focusing solely on a neutrino flare, without relying on electromagnetic counterparts, and account for realistic energy and directional uncertainties. For completeness, we compare our limits inferred from TXS 0506+056 to the sensitivity inferred from multi-messenger detection of tentative coincidences between neutrinos and electromagnetic emission from active galactic nuclei and tidal disruption events.</description>

      <title>A geometric phase approach to quark confinement from stochastic gauge-geometry flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply a stochastic version of the geometric (Ricci) flow, complemented with the stochastic flow of the gauge Yang-Mills sector, in order to seed the chromo-magnetic and chromo-electric vortices that source the area-law for QCD confinement. The area-law is the key signature of quark confinement in Yang-Mills gauge theories with a non-trivial center symmetry. In particular, chromo-magnetic vortices enclosed within the chromo-electric Wilson loops instantiate the area-law asymptotic behaviour of the Wilson loop vacuum expectation values. The stochastic gauge-geometry flow is responsible for the topology changes that induce the appearance of the vortices. When vortices vanish, due to topology changes in the manifolds associated to the hadronic ground states, the evaluation of the Wilson loop yields a dependence on the length of the path, hence reproducing the perimeter law of the hadronic (Higgs) phase of real QCD. Confinement, instead, is naturally achieved within this context as a by-product of the topology change of the manifold over which the dynamics of the Yang-Mills fields is defined. It is then provided by the Aharonov-Bohm effect induced by the concatenation of the compact chromo-electric and chromo-magnetic fluxes originated by the topology changes. The stochastic gauge-geometry flow naturally accomplishes a treatment of the emergence of the vortices and the generation of turbulence effects. Braiding and knotting, resulting from topology changes, namely stochastic fluctuations of the Einstein-Yang-Mills system, stabilise the chromo-magnetic vortices and dynamically induce, as non-trivial topological features, chiral symmetry-breaking. The latter is due to the appearance of torsional degrees of freedom, to which four fermion interactions are related, and to the formation of fermion condensates, in which gluon strings get stabilised by non-trivial braiding.</description>

Abstract: We further investigate the applicability of our previously suggested quantum-mechanically correlated statistical hadron gas model (HRG) to the ideal hadron resonance gas model (IHRG), which is inspired by a Beth-Uhlenbeck corrected form of the equation of state (EoS). We compute the ratios of several particle yields, both equal-mass pairs ($\bar{p} / p$, $K^-/ K^+$, $\pi^-/ \pi^+$, $\bar{\Lambda}/ \Lambda$, $\bar{\Sigma}/ \Sigma$, $\bar{\Omega}/ \Omega$) and unequal-mass pairs ($p/ \pi^+$, $k^+/ \pi^+$, $k^-/ \pi^-$, $\Lambda/ \pi^-$, $\bar{p}/ \pi^-$, $\Omega/\pi^-$) and investigate how these ratios change with the center-of-mass energy. Next, we present a comparative analysis of the outputs of our suggested HRG model and the IHRG model, Cosmic Ray Monte Carlo (CRMC) EPOS $1.99$ simulations, and experimental data from ALICE, SPS, AGS, and RHIC. When compared to the other models taken into consideration, our HRG model typically shows very close agreement with the experimental results. The proton anomaly reported at top RHIC and LHC energies may be addressed by our new HRG model, which notably exhibits a strong alignment with experimental data for $\bar{p}/ \pi^-$ and $p/ \pi^+$ ratios. However, both our HRG model and the IHRG model seem to significantly underestimate some experimental data for ratios involving hadron couples with uneven mass and (multi)strange content, such as $\Lambda/ \pi^-$ and $\Omega/ \pi^-$. This emphasizes the necessity of additional research to determine whether thermal hadron gas models are appropriate and stresses the significance of any necessary adjustments to improve their correctness.</description>

      <title>The study of the singly anti-charmed pentaquark production in b-factory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.13874v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The b-factories, such as BelleII, BarBar and LHCb, emphasize the increasing importance of exotic hadron research. In this paper, we discuss the possible production of singly anti-charmed pentaquark states $\bar{c}q qqq$ from $B$ mesons in the b-factory under SU(3) symmetry analysis. Discussions of both possibilities have been driven by the hypothesis that the pentaquark state considered in this work, known as the lowest lying state $P_{\bar c}$, could be bound or unbound. We find the golden channels for the production of the pentaquark ground states, such as $B^0 \to {P}_{\bar{c}sudu}^{(\prime) 0}\Sigma^0$. We further estimate the branching ratios for the production of the ground states $P_{\bar c}$ from $B$ meson decays. Thus, multiple channels are available for experiments, which may remove certain obstacles to the discovery of new pentaquark states.</description>

      <title>Axion dark matter with explicit Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking in the axiverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was shown that the required high quality of the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry can be a natural outcome of the multiple QCD axions model. In the axiverse, a hypothetical mass mixing between the QCD axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) can occur, which leads to an interesting phenomenon called the level crossing. In this paper, we investigate this mass mixing between one QCD axion and one ALP with the explicit PQ symmetry breaking in the early Universe. The dynamics of the axions and their cosmological evolutions when the level crossing occurs in this scenario are studied in detail. We show the evolution of the mass eigenvalues and the mass mixing angle. Then we check the condition for energy adiabatic transition with the corresponding parameter set. Finally, we estimate the relic density of the QCD axion and ALP dark matter through the misalignment mechanism. We find that, the QCD axion relic density can be suppressed, while the ALP relic density can be enhanced. The level crossing in our scenario may have some cosmological implications, such as the axion domain walls formation, the nano-Hertz gravitational waves emission, and also the primordial black holes formation.</description>

      <title>New Physics at Neutron Beam Dump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find a new utility of neutrons, usually treated as an experimental nuisance causing unwanted background, in probing new physics signals. They can either be radiated from neutrons (neutron bremsstrahlung) or appear through secondary particles from neutron-on-target interactions, dubbed "neutron beam dump". As a concrete example, we take the FASER/FASER2 experiment as a "factory" of high-energy neutrons that interact with the iron dump. We find that neutron-initiated bremsstrahlung contributions are comparable to proton-initiated ones, in terms of the resulting flux and the range of couplings that can be probed. The neutron bremsstrahlung can be used to probe dark gauge bosons with non-zero neutron coupling. In particular, we investigate protophobic gauge bosons and find that FASER/FASER2 can probe new parameter space. We also illustrate the possibility of neutron-induced secondary particles by considering axion-like particles with electron couplings. We conclude that the physics potential of FASER/FASER2 in terms of new physics searches can be greatly extended and improved with the inclusion of neutron interactions.</description>

      <title>Calculation of SU($2$) string tension in the continuum limit by an effective theory of center vortices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using an effective theory for an ensemble of center vortices, we observe the area law fall-off in the continuum limit for the SU($2$) gauge group in three-dimensional Euclidean space-time. The string tension is obtained in terms of the intrinsic properties of the vortices and the parameter describing their interactions. A good qualitative agreement between our results and the lattice ones is observed. In addition, we show that the repulsive force between the vortices increases with temperature. This behavior is expected due to the reduction of vortex configuration at higher temperatures, required for the deconfinement regime.</description>

      <title>Renormalon-based resummation of Bjorken polarised sum rule in holomorphic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13134v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximate knowledge of the renormalon structure of the Bjorken polarised sum rule (BSR) ${\overline \Gamma}_1^{{\rm p-n}}(Q^2)$ leads to the corresponding BSR characteristic function that allows us to evaluate the leading-twist part of BSR. In our previous work \cite{pPLB}, this evaluation (resummation) was performed using perturbative QCD (pQCD) coupling $a(Q^2) \equiv \alpha_s(Q^2)/\pi$ in specific renormalisation schemes. In the present paper, we continue this work, by using instead holomorphic couplings [$a(Q^2) \mapsto {\mathcal A}(Q^2)$] that have no Landau singularities and thus require, in contrast to the pQCD case, no regularisation of the resummation formula. The $D=2$ and $D=4$ terms are included in the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) of inelastic BSR, and fits are performed to the available experimental data in a specific interval $(Q^2_{\rm min},Q^2_{\rm max})$ where $ Q^2_{\rm max}=4.74 \ {\rm GeV}^2$. We needed relatively high $Q^2_{\rm min} \approx 1.7 \ {\rm GeV}^2$ in the pQCD case since the pQCD coupling $a(Q^2)$ has Landau singularities at $Q^2 \lesssim 1 \ {\rm GeV}^2$. Now, when holomorphic (AQCD) couplings ${\mathcal A}(Q^2)$ are used, no such problems occur: for the $3 \delta$AQCD and $2 \delta$AQCD variants the preferred values are $Q^2_{\rm min} \approx 0.6 \ {\rm GeV}^2$. The preferred values of $\alpha_s$ in general cannot be unambiguously extracted, due to large uncertainties of the experimental BSR data. At a fixed value of $\alpha_s^{{\overline {\rm MS}}}(M_Z^2)$, the values of the $D=2$ and $D=4$ residue parameters are determined in all cases, with the corresponding uncertainties.</description>

      <title>DEMPgen: Physics event generator for Deep Exclusive Meson Production at Jefferson Lab and the EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is increasing interest in deep exclusive meson production (DEMP) reactions, as they provide access to Generalized Parton Distributions over a broad kinematic range, and are the only means of measuring pion and kaon charged electric form factors at high $Q^2$. Such investigations are a particularly useful tool in the study of hadronic structure in QCD's transition regime from long-distance interactions described in terms of meson-nucleon degrees of freedom, to short-dist ance interactions governed by hard quark-gluon degrees of freedom. To assist the planning of future experimental investigations of DEMP reactions in this transition regime, such as at Jefferson Lab and the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), we have written a special purpose event generator, DEMPgen. Several types of DEMP reactions can be generated: $t$-channel $p(e,e^{\prime}\pi^+)n$, $p(e,e^{\prime}K^+)\Lambda[\Sigma^0]$, and $\vec{n}(e,e^{\prime}\pi^-)p$ from a polarized $^3$He target. DEMPgen is modular in form, so that additional reactions can be added over time. The generator produces kinematically-complete reaction events which are absolutely-normalized, so that projected event rates can be predicted, and detector resolution requirements studied. The event normalization is based on parameterizations of theoretical models, appropriate to the kinematic regime under study. Both fixed target modes and collider beam modes are supported. This paper presents the structure of the generator, the model parameterizations used for absolute event weighting, the kinematic distributions of the generated particles, some initial results using the generator, and instructions for its use.</description>

      <title>Radiative transitions of $\chi_{_{cJ}}\to\psi\gamma$ and $\chi_{_{bJ}}\to\Upsilon\gamma$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of instantaneous Bethe-Salpeter equation, according to the $J ^ {PC}$ of quarkonia, we find that their wave functions all contain multiple partial waves, rather than pure waves. In the radiative electromagnetic transitions $\chi_{_{cJ}}$$\rightarrow$$\gamma\psi$ and $\chi_{_{bJ}}$$\rightarrow$$\gamma\Upsilon$ ($J=0,1,2$), the main wave of quarkonium gives the non-relativistic contribution, while other waves provide the relativistic corrections. Our results indicate that the relativistic effect of charmonium, especially highly excited states, is significant. Such as the relativistic effects of $\chi_{_{cJ}}(2P)\to\gamma\psi(1S)$ ($J=0,1,2$) are $\{49.7\%,~30.9\%,~37.5\%\}$, much larger than the corresponding $\{17.8\%,~7.08\%,~12.9\%\}$ of $\chi_{_{bJ}}(2P)\rightarrow\gamma\Upsilon(1S)$. The decay of $\chi_{_{cJ}}(2P)\to\gamma\psi$ can be used to distinguish between $\chi_{_{c0}}(3860)$ and $\chi_{_{c0}}(3915)$, which particle is the charmonium $\chi_{_{c0}}(2P)$. Although our result of $\chi_{_{c1}}(3872)$$\rightarrow$$\gamma\psi(2S)$ is consistent with data, but the one of $\chi_{_{c1}}(3872)$$\rightarrow$$\gamma\psi(1S)$ is much larger than data, so whether $\chi_{_{c1}}(3872)$ is the conventional $\chi_{_{c1}}(2P)$ remains an open question. The undiscovered $\Upsilon(1D)$ and $\Upsilon(2D)$ have large production rates in decays of $\chi_{_{b0}}(2P)\rightarrow\gamma\Upsilon(1D)$ and $\chi_{_{bJ}}(3P)\rightarrow\gamma\Upsilon(2D)$ ($J=0,1$), respectively. To search for $\chi_{_{bJ}}(3P)$ $(J=0,1,2)$, the most competitive channels are the decays $\chi_{_{bJ}}(3P)\rightarrow\gamma\Upsilon(3S)$. And the best way to find $\chi_{_{b2}}(1F)$ is to search for the decay of $\chi_{_{b2}}(1F)\rightarrow\gamma\Upsilon(1D)$.</description>

      <title>Probing bottom-associated production of a TeV scale scalar decaying to a top quark and dark matter at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14844v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A minimal non-thermal dark matter model that can explain both the existence of dark matter and the baryon asymmetry in the universe is studied. It requires two color-triplet, iso-singlet scalars with $\mathcal{O}$(TeV) masses and a singlet Majorana fermion with a mass of $\mathcal{O}$(GeV). The fermion becomes stable and can play the role of the dark matter candidate. We consider the fermion to interact with a top quark via the exchange of QCD-charged scalar fields coupled dominantly to third generation fermions. The signature of a single top quark production associated with a bottom quark and large missing transverse momentum opens up the possibility to search for this type of model at the LHC in a way complementary to existing monotop searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of a $U(1)$ symmetry via an intermediate discrete symmetry may yield a hybrid topological defect of \emph{domain walls bounded by cosmic strings}. The decay of this defect network leads to a unique gravitational wave signal spanning many orders in observable frequencies, that can be distinguished from signals generated by other sources. We investigate the production of gravitational waves from this mechanism in the context of the type-I two-Higgs-doublet model extended by a $U(1)_R$ symmetry, that simultaneously accommodates the seesaw mechanism, anomaly cancellation, and eliminates flavour-changing neutral currents. The gravitational wave spectrum produced by the string-bounded-wall network can be detected for $U(1)_R$ breaking scale from $10^{12}$ to $10^{15}$ GeV in forthcoming interferometers including LISA and Einstein Telescope, with a distinctive $f^{3}$ slope and inflexion in the frequency range between microhertz and hertz.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Dark Cosmology: From Early Matter Dominance to Delayed Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel mechanism for producing dark compact objects and black holes through a dark sector, where all the dark matter can be dissipative. Heavy dark sector particles with masses above $10^4$ GeV can come to dominate the Universe and yield an early matter-dominated era before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Density perturbations in this epoch can grow and collapse into tiny dark matter halos, which cool via self interactions. The typical halo size is set by the Hubble length once perturbations begin growing, offering a straightforward prediction of the halo size and evolution depending on ones choice of dark matter model. Once these primordial halos have formed, a thermal phase transition can then shift the Universe back into radiation domination and standard cosmology. These halos can continue to collapse after BBN, resulting in the late-time formation of fragmented dark compact objects and sub-solar mass primordial black holes. We find that these compact objects can constitute a sizable fraction of all of dark matter. The resulting fragments can have masses between $10^{20}$ g to $10^{32}$ g, with radii ranging from $10^{-2}$ m to $10^5$ m, while the black holes can have masses between $10^{8}$ g to $10^{34}$ g. Furthermore, a unique feature of this model is the late-time formation of black holes which can evaporate today. We compare where these objects lie with respect to current primordial black hole and and massive (astrophysical) compact halo object constraints.</description>

      <title>Probing Heavy Neutrino Magnetic Moments at the LHC using Long-Lived Particle Searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore long-lived particle (LLP) searches using non-pointing photons at the LHC as a probe for sterile-to-sterile and active-to-sterile transition magnetic dipole moments of sterile neutrinos. We consider heavy sterile neutrinos with masses ranging from a few~GeV to several hundreds of GeV. We discuss transition magnetic dipole moments using the Standard Model effective field theory and low-energy effective field theory extended by sterile neutrinos ($N_R$SMEFT and $N_R$LEFT) and also provide a simplified UV-complete model example. LLP searches at the LHC using non-pointing photons will probe sterile-to-sterile dipole moments two orders of magnitude below the current best constraints from LEP, while an unprecedented sensitivity to sterile neutrino mass of about 700 GeV is expected for active-to-sterile dipole moments. For the UV model example with one-loop transition magnetic moments, the searches for charged lepton flavour violating processes in synergy with LLP searches at the LHC can probe new physics at several TeV mass scales and provide valuable insights into the lepton flavour structure of new physics couplings.</description>

Abstract: Structure functions of the spin-1 deuteron will be investigated experimentally from the late 2020's at various facilities such as Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, nuclotron-based ion collider facility, and electron-ion colliders. We expect that a new high-energy spin-physics field could be created by these projects. In this paper, the current theoretical status is explained for the structure functions of spin-1 hadrons, especially on parton distribution functions, transverse-momentum dependent parton distributions, and fragmentation functions. Related multiparton distribution functions are also shown.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present NNPDF4.0MC, a variant of the NNPDF4.0 set of parton distributions (PDFs) at LO, NLO and NNLO, with and without inclusion of the photon PDF, suitable for use with Monte Carlo (MC) event generators, which require PDFs to satisfy additional constraints in comparison to standard PDF sets. These requirements include PDF positivity down to a low scale $Q\sim 1$ GeV, smooth extrapolation in the very small and large $x$ regions, and numerically stable results even in extreme regions of phase space for all PDFs. We compare the NNPDF4.0MC PDFs to their baseline NNPDF4.0 counterparts, and to the NNPDF2.3LO set entering the Monash tune of the Pythia8 event generator. We briefly assess the phenomenological impact of these PDFs on the cross-sections for hard and soft QCD processes at the LHC.</description>

Abstract: Curiously in the minimal left right symmetric model, chiral symmetry that protects the electron's mass (m_e), due to parity (P) implies the vanishing of its neutrino mixing angles. We break this symmetry softly (or spontaneously if it is gauged) to generate the observed large neutrino mixing angles at the tree-level. The electron then acquires its mass on RGE running due to its neutrino's mixing, and in turn determines the B-L gauge symmetry breaking scale (v_R) to be $10^{10} GeV \lesssim v_R \leq 10^{15} GeV. $ If the muon's mass is also generated radiatively, the B-L breaking scale is $\sim 10^{14-15}$ GeV. Regardless of the high scale of v_R, this is a testable model since on RGE running and P breaking, a large strong CP phase ($\bar{\theta} &gt;&gt; 10^{-10}$) which depends logarithmically on $v_R$ is generated if there is $\mathcal{O}(1)$ CP violation in leptonic Yukawa couplings. Hence we expect that leptonic CP phases including the Dirac CP phase $\delta_{CP}$ of the PMNS matrix must be consistent with 0 or 180^o to within a degree, which can be verified or excluded by neutrino experiments such as DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande. In lieu of P, if charge conjugation C is used, the same results follow. However with C and no P, axions would likely need to be added anyway, in which case there is no constraint on \delta_{CP}.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference analysis of jet quenching using inclusive jet and hadron suppression measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The JETSCAPE Collaboration reports a new determination of the jet transport parameter $\hat{q}$ in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) using Bayesian Inference, incorporating all available inclusive hadron and jet yield suppression data measured in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC. This multi-observable analysis extends the previously published JETSCAPE Bayesian Inference determination of $\hat{q}$, which was based solely on a selection of inclusive hadron suppression data. JETSCAPE is a modular framework incorporating detailed dynamical models of QGP formation and evolution, and jet propagation and interaction in the QGP. Virtuality-dependent partonic energy loss in the QGP is modeled as a thermalized weakly-coupled plasma, with parameters determined from Bayesian calibration using soft-sector observables. This Bayesian calibration of $\hat{q}$ utilizes Active Learning, a machine--learning approach, for efficient exploitation of computing resources. The experimental data included in this analysis span a broad range in collision energy and centrality, and in transverse momentum. In order to explore the systematic dependence of the extracted parameter posterior distributions, several different calibrations are reported, based on combined jet and hadron data; on jet or hadron data separately; and on restricted kinematic or centrality ranges of the jet and hadron data. Tension is observed in comparison of these variations, providing new insights into the physics of jet transport in the QGP and its theoretical formulation.</description>

      <title>Vacuum (in)stability in 2HDMS vs N2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the criteria for vacuum stability in two models with extended scalar sectors namely, the N2HDM and the 2HDMS and make a detailed comparison between the two. For the purpose of demonstration, we choose a scenario which can accommodate the recently observed 95 GeV excess in both models. We further explore the impact of the measurement of the Yukawa couplings, the gauge boson couplings and most importantly the trilinear self-couplings of the scalars, in distinguishing the vacuum structure in both models. We further investigate the constraints from vacuum stability on the 2HDMS scenario that accommodates a viable dark matter candidate and compare it with the N2HDM case.</description>

      <title>Prospect for measurement of the CP-violating phase $\phi_s$ in the $B_{s}\rightarrow J/\psi \phi$ channel at a future Z factory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10565v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The CP-violating phase $\phi_s$, the \Bs decay width ($\Gamma_s$), and the \Bs decay width difference ($\Delta\Gamma_s$) are sensitive probes to new physics and can constrain the heavy quark expansion theory. The potential for the measurement at future $Z$ factories is studied in this manuscript. It is found that operating at Tera-$Z$ mode, the expected precision can reach: $\sigma(\phi_s) = 4.6~\mathrm{mrad}$, $\sigma(\Delta\Gamma_s) = 2.4~\mathrm{ns^{-1}}$ and $\sigma(\Gamma_s) = 0.72~\mathrm{ns^{-1}}$. The precision of $\phi_s$ is 40\% larger than the expected precision with the LHCb experiment at HL-LHC. If operating at 10-Tera-$Z$ mode, the precision of $\phi_s$ can be measured at 45\% of the precision obtained from the LHCb experiment at HL-LHC. However, the measurement of $\Gamma_s$ and $\Delta\Gamma_s$ cannot benefit from the excellent time resolution and tagging power of the future $Z$-factories. Only operating at 10-Tera-$Z$ mode can the $\Gamma_s$ and $\Delta\Gamma_s$ reach an 18\% larger precision than the precision expected to be obtained from LHCb at HL-LHC. The control of penguin contamination at the future Z-factories is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.00529v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of the inflationary dynamics are presented here for a single canonical scalar field minimally coupled to gravity. We spell out the basic equations governing the inflationary dynamics in terms of cosmic time $t$ and define a set of dimensionless variables convenient for numerical analysis. We then provide a link to our simple numerical Python code on GitHub that can be used to simulate the background dynamics as well as the evolution of linear perturbations during inflation. The code computes both scalar and tensor power spectra for a given inflaton potential $V(\phi)$. We discuss a concrete algorithm to use the code for various purposes, especially for computing the enhanced scalar power spectrum in the context of Primordial Black Holes and scalar-induced Gravitational Waves. We also compare the efficiency of different variables used in the literature to compute the scalar fluctuations. We intend to extend the framework to simulate the dynamics of a number of different quantities, including the computation of scalar-induced second-order tensor power spectrum in the near future.</description>

      <title>What does perturbative QCD really have to say about neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The implications of perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations on neutron stars are carefully examined. While pQCD calculations above baryon chemical potentials $\mu_B\sim2.4$ GeV demonstrate the potential of ruling out a wide range of neutron star equations of state (EOSs), such constraints only affect the most massive neutron stars in the vicinity of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit, resulting in constraints that are orthogonal to current or expected astrophysical bounds. In the most constraining scenario, pQCD considerations favor low values of the squared speed sound $C_s$ at high $\mu_B$ relevant for the most massive neutron stars, but leave predictions of the radii and tidal deformabilities almost unchanged. Such considerations become irrelevant if the maximum speed of sound squared inside neutron stars does not exceed about $C_{s,\mathrm{max}}\sim0.5$, or if pQCD breaks down below $\mu_B\simeq2.9$ GeV. Furthermore, the large pQCD uncertainties preclude any meaningful bounds on the neutron star EOS at the moment. Interestingly, if pQCD predictions for the pressure at around $\mu_B\simeq2.5$ GeV are refined and found to be low ($\lesssim 1.5$ GeV/fm$^3$), evidence for a soft neutron star inner core EOS in combination with the existence of two-solar-mass pulsars would indicate the presence of color superconductivity beyond neutron star densities. We point out that two-solar-mass pulsars place robust upper bounds on this non-perturbative effect and require the pairing gap to be less than $\Delta_\mathrm{CFL}\lesssim500$ MeV at $\mu_B\simeq2.5$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Thermalization in 2+1 dimensional SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16202v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present preliminary numerical evidence for the hypothesis that the Hamiltonian SU(2) gauge theory discretized on a lattice obeys the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). To do so we study three approximations: (a) a linear plaquette chain in a reduced Hilbert space limiting the electric field basis to $j=0,\frac{1}{2}$ , (b) a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice with periodic or closed boundary condition and the same Hilbert space constraint, and (c) a chain of only three plaquettes but such a sufficiently large electric field Hilbert space ($j \leq \frac{7}{2})$ that convergence of all energy eigenvalues in the analyzed energy window is observed. While an unconstrained Hilbert space is required to reach the continuum limit of SU(2) gauge theory, numerical resource constraints do not permit us to realize this requirement for all values of the coupling constant and large lattices. In each of the three studied cases we check first for random matrix theory (RMT) behavior in the eigenenergy spectrum and then analyze the diagonal as well as the off-diagonal matrix elements between energy eigenstates for a few operators. Within current uncertainties all results for (a), (b) and (c) agree with ETH predictions. Furthermore, we find the off-diagonal matrix elements of the electric energy operator exhibit RMT behavior in frequency windows that are small enough in (b) and (c). To unambiguously establish ETH behavior and determine for which class of operators it applies, an extension of our investigations is necessary.</description>

      <title>Standard siren cosmology in the era of the 2.5-generation ground-based gravitational wave detectors: bright and dark sirens of LIGO Voyager and NEMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11900v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 2.5-generation (2.5G) ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors LIGO Voyager and NEMO are expected to be operational in the late 2020s and early 2030s. In this work, we explore the potential of GW standard sirens observed by the 2.5G GW detectors in measuring cosmological parameters, especially for the Hubble constant. Using GWs to measure cosmological parameters is inherently challenging, especially for 2.5G detectors, given their limited capability, which results in weaker constraints on cosmological parameters from the detected standard sirens. However, the measurement of the Hubble constant using standard siren observations from Voyager and NEMO is still promising. For example, using bright sirens from Voyager and NEMO can measure the Hubble constant with a precision of about $2\%$ and $6\%$ respectively, and using the Voyager-NEMO network can improve the precision to about $1.6\%$. Moreover, bright sirens can be used to break the degeneracy of cosmological parameters generated by CMB data, and to a certain extent, 2.5G detectors can also play a role in this aspect. Observations of dark sirens by 2.5G detectors can achieve relatively good results in measuring the Hubble constant, with a precision of within $2\%$, and if combining observations of bright and dark sirens, the precision of the Hubble constant measurement can reach about $1.4\%$. Finally, we also discussed the impact of the uncertainty in the binary neutron star merger rate on the estimation of cosmological parameters. We conclude that the magnificent prospect for solving the Hubble tension is worth expecting in the era of the 2.5G ground-based GW detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15184v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy of Hamiltonian SU(2) lattice gauge theory in $2+1$ dimensions on linear plaquette chains and show that the entanglement entropies of both ground and excited states follow Page curves. The transition of the subsystem size dependence of the entanglement entropy from the area law for the ground state to the volume law for highly excited states is found to be described by a universal crossover function. Quantum many-body scars in the middle of the spectrum, which are present in the electric flux truncated Hilbert space, where the gauge theory can be mapped onto an Ising model, disappear when higher electric field representations are included in the Hilbert space basis. This suggests the continuum $(2+1)$-dimensional SU(2) gauge theory does not have such scarred states.</description>

      <title>Scalar perturbations from inflation in the presence of gauge fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19694v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how Abelian-gauge-field production during inflation affects scalar perturbations in the case when the gauge field interacts with the inflaton directly (by means of generic kinetic and axial couplings) and via gravity. The homogeneous background solution is defined by self-consistently taking into account the backreaction of the gauge field on the evolution of the inflaton and the scale factor. For the perturbations on top of this background, all possible scalar contributions coming from the inflaton, the metric, and the gauge field are considered. We derive a second-order differential equation for the curvature perturbation, $\zeta$, capturing the impact of the gauge field, both on the background dynamics and on the evolution of scalar perturbations. The latter is described by a source term in the $\zeta$ equation, which is quadratic in the gauge-field operators and leads to non-Gaussianities in the curvature perturbations. We derive general expressions for the induced scalar power spectrum and bispectrum. Finally, we apply our formalism to the well-known case of axion inflation without backreaction. Numerical results show that, in this example, the effect of including metric perturbations is small for values of the gauge-field production parameter $\xi&gt; 3$. This is in agreement with the previous results in the literature. However, in the region of smaller values, $\xi\lesssim 2$, our new results exhibit order-of-unity deviations when compared to previous results.</description>

      <title>Discrete $Z_4$ symmetry in quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00718v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the discrete $Z_4$ symmetry ${\hat {\bf i}}$, which takes place in the scenario of quantum gravity where the gravitational tetrads emerge as the order parameter. Under this symmetry operation $\hat {\bf i}$, the emerging tetrads are multiplied by the imaginary unit, $\hat {\bf i}\,e^a_\mu = - i e^a_\mu$. The existence of such symmetry and the spontaneous breaking of this symmetry are also supported by the consideration of the symmetry breaking scheme in the topological superfluid $^3$He-B. The order parameter $^3$He-B is the analogue of the tetrad field, but it has complex values. The $\hat {\bf i}$-symmetry operation changes the phase of the complex order parameter by $\pi/2$, which corresponds to the $Z_4$ discrete symmetry in quantum gravity. We also considered the alternative scenario of the breaking of this $Z_4$ symmetry, in which the $\hat {\bf i}$-operation changes sign of the scalar curvature, $\hat {\bf i} \,{\cal R} = - {\cal R}$, and thus the Einstein-Hilbert action violates the $\hat {\bf i}$-symmetry. In the alternative scenario of symmetry breaking, the gravitational coupling $K=1/16\pi G$ plays the role of the order parameter, which changes sign under $\hat {\bf i}$-transformation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational effects on fluid dynamics in cosmological first-order phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological first-order phase transition (FOPT) sources the stochastic gravitational wave background (SWGB) through bubble collisions, sound waves, and turbulence. So far, most studies on the fluid profile of an expanding bubble are limited to transitions that complete in a much shorter time scale than the cosmic expansion. In this study, we investigate gravitational effects on the fluid profile beyond the self-similar regime. For this purpose we combine a hydrodynamic scheme in the presence of gravity with a fluid computation scheme under energy injection from the bubble wall. By performing (1+1)d simulations of spherical bubble for constant wall velocities, we find that the fluid generally develops a thinner shell in our cosmological setup, which qualitatively agrees with previous studies discussing the late-time behavior of fluid in expanding spacetime. We also observe reduction in the energy budget for the fluid kinetic energy. Furthermore, we find that the fluid profile develops sub-structure for accelerating bubble walls. We also comment on the possible broadening of the SGWB spectral plateau.</description>
