      <title>Theoretical and numerical comparison between the pseudopotential and the free energy lattice Boltzmann methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pseudopotential and free energy models are two popular extensions of the lattice Boltzmann method for multiphase flows. Until now, they have been developed apart from each other in the literature. However, important questions about whether each method performs better needs to be solved. In this work, we perform a theoretical and numerical comparison between both methods. This comparison is only possible because we developed a novel approach for controlling the interface thickness in the pseudopotential method independently on the equation of state. In this way, it is possible to compare both methods maintaining the same equilibrium densities, interface thickness, surface tension and equation of state parameters. The well-balanced approach was selected to represent the free energy. We found that the free energy one is more practical to use, as it is not necessary to carry out previous simulations to determine simulation parameters (interface thickness, surface tension, etc). In addition, the tests proofed that the free energy model is more accurate than the pseudopotential model. Furthermore, the pseudopotential method suffers from a lack of thermodynamic consistency even when applying the corrections proposed in the literature. On the other hand, for both static and dynamic tests we verified that the pseudopotential method is more stable than the free energy one, allowing simulations with lower reduced temperatures. We hope that these results will guide authors in the use of each method.</description>

      <title>A component-level co-rotational 3D continuum finite element framework for efficient flexible multibody analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a systematic and novel component level co-rotational (CR) framework, for upgrading existing 3D continuum finite elements to flexible multibody analysis. Without using any model reduction techniques, the high efficiency is achieved through sophisticated operations in both modeling and numerical implementation phrases. In modeling phrase, as in conventional 3D nonlinear finite analysis, the nodal absolute coordinates are used as the system generalized coordinates, therefore simple formulations of the inertia force terms can be obtained. For the elastic force terms, inspired by existing floating frame of reference formulation (FFRF) and conventional element-level CR formulation, a component-level CR modeling strategy is developed. By in combination with Schur complement theory and fully exploring the nature of the component-level CR modeling method, an extremely efficient procedure is developed, which enables us to transform the linear equations raised from each Newton-Raphson iteration step into linear systems with constant coefficient matrix. The coefficient matrix thus can be pre-calculated and decomposed only once, and at all the subsequent time steps only back substitutions are needed, which avoids frequently updating the Jacobian matrix and avoids directly solving the large-scale linearized equation in each iteration. Multiple examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Neural-network density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep-learning density functional theory (DFT) shows great promise to significantly accelerate material discovery and potentially revolutionize materials research, which demands a close combination between neural networks and DFT computation. However, current research in this field primarily relies on supervised learning, making the developments of neural networks and DFT isolated from each other. In this work, we present a theoretical framework of neural-network DFT, which unifies the optimization of neural networks with the variational computation of DFT, enabling physics-informed unsupervised learning. Moreover, we develop a differential DFT code incorporated with deep-learning DFT Hamiltonian, and introduce algorithms of automatic differentiation and backpropagation to DFT, demonstrating the concept of neural-network DFT. The advanced neural-network architecture not only surpasses conventional approaches in accuracy and efficiency, but offers a new paradigm for developing deep-learning DFT methods.</description>

      <title>Identification of mechanisms of magnetic transitions using an efficient method for converging on first order saddle points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method for locating first order saddle points on the energy surface of magnetic systems is described and several applications presented. The starting point of the iterative algorithm involved in the method can be anywhere, even close to a local energy minimum representing an initial state of a magnetic system and, in contrast to chain-of-states methods, the final state need not be specified. Convergence on the saddle points is guided by a negative energy gradient whose component along the minimum mode of the system is inverted, effectively transforming the neighbourhood of the saddle point to that of a local minimum. The method requires only the lowest two eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of the Hessian of the system's energy and they are found using a quasi-Newton limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno solver for the minimization of the Rayleigh quotient without evaluation of the Hessian itself. The efficient implementation of the method and its linear scaling with the system size make it applicable to large systems. Applications are presented to transitions in systems that reveal significant complexity of co-existing magnetic states, such as skyrmions, skyrmion bags, skyrmion tubes, chiral bobbers and globules.</description>

      <title>The hybrid anti-symmetrized coupled channels method (haCC) for the tRecX code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new implementation of the hybrid antisymmetrized Coupled Channels (haCC) method in the framework of the tRecX [A. Scrinzi, Comp. Phys. Comm., 270:108146, 2022.]. The method represents atomic and molecular multi-electron functions by combining CI functions, Gaussian molecular orbitals, and a numerical single-electron basis. It is suitable for describing high harmonic generation and the strong-field dynamics of ionization. Fully differential photo\-emission spectra are computed by the tSurff method. The theoretical background of haCC is outlined and key improvements compared to its original formulation are highlighted. We discuss control of over-completeness resulting from the joint use of the numerical basis and Gaussian molecular orbitals by pseudo-inverses based on the Woodbury formula. Further new features of this tRecX release are the iSurff method, new input features, and the AMOS gateway interface. The mapping of haCC into the tRecX framework for solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation is shown. Use, performance, and accuracy of haCC are discussed on the examples of high-harmonic generation and strong-field photo-emission by short laser pulses impinging on the Helium atom and on the linear molecules $N_2$ and $CO$.</description>

      <title>Localization-delocalization transition for light particles in turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small bubbles in fluids raise to the surface due to Archimede's force. Remarkably, in turbulent flows this process is severely hindered by the presence of vortex filaments, which act as moving potential wells, dynamically trapping light particles and bubbles. Quantifying the statistical weights and roles of vortex filaments in turbulence is, however, still an outstanding experimental and computational challenge due to their small scale, fast chaotic motion, and transient nature. Here we show that, under the influence of a modulated oscillatory forcing, the collective bubble behaviour switches from a dynamically localized (insulator) to a delocalized (conductor) state. Additionally, we find that by varying the forcing frequency and amplitude, a remarkable resonant phenomenon between light particles and small-scale vortex filamenents emerges, likening particle behavior to a forced damped oscillator. We discuss how these externally actuated bubbles can be used as a new type of microscopic probes to investigate the space-time statistical properties of the smallest turbulence scales, allowing to quantitatively measure physical characteristics of vortex filaments. We develop a superposition model that is in excellent agreement with the simulation data of the particle dynamics which reveals the fraction of localized/delocalized particles as well as characteristics of the potential landscape induced by vortices in turbulence. Our approach paves the way to innovative ways to accurately measure turbulent properties and to the possibility to control light particles and bubble motions in turbulence with potential applications to wave breaking, medical imaging, drug/gene delivery, chemical reactions, wastewater treatment, and industrial mixing.</description>

      <title>Capturing thin structures in VOF simulations with two-plane reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel interface reconstruction strategy for volume of fluid (VOF) methods is introduced that represents the liquid-gas interface as two planes that co-exist within a single computational cell. In comparison to the piecewise linear interface calculation (PLIC), this new algorithm greatly improves the accuracy of the reconstruction, in particular when dealing with thin structures such as films. The placement of the two planes requires the solution of a non-linear optimization problem in six dimensions, which has the potential to be overly expensive. An efficient solution to this optimization problem is presented here that exploits two key ideas: an algorithm for extracting multiple plane orientations from transported surface data, and an efficient and mass-conserving distance-finding algorithm that accounts for two planes with arbitrary orientation. Additionally, a simple and robust strategy is presented to accurately represent the surface tension forces produced at the interface of subgrid-thickness films. The performance of this new VOF reconstruction is demonstrated on several test cases that illustrate the capability to handle arbitrarily thin films.</description>

      <title>Deep learning generative model for crystal structure prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning generative models (GMs) have created unprecedented high capabilities in accessing and assessing complex high-dimensional data, allowing superior efficiency in navigating vast material configuration space in search of viable structures. Coupling such capabilities with physically significant data to construct trained models for materials discovery is crucial to moving this emerging field forward. Here, we present a universal GM for crystal structure prediction (CSP) via a conditional crystal diffusion variational autoencoder (Cond-CDVAE) approach, which is tailored to allow user-defined material and physical parameters such as composition and pressure. This model is trained on an expansive dataset containing over 670,000 local minimum structures, including a rich spectrum of high-pressure structures, along with ambient-pressure structures in Materials Project database. We demonstrate that the Cond-CDVAE model can generate physically plausible structures with high fidelity under diverse pressure conditions without necessitating local optimization, accurately predicting 59.3% of the 3,547 unseen ambient-pressure experimental structures within 800 structure samplings, with the accuracy rate climbing to 83.2% for structures comprising fewer than 20 atoms per unit cell. These results meet or exceed those achieved via conventional CSP methods based on global optimization. The present findings showcase substantial potential of GMs in the realm of CSP.</description>

      <title>Computationally feasible bounds for the free energy of nonequilibrium steady states, applied to simple models of heat conduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study computationally feasible bounds for relative free energies between two many-particle systems. Specifically, we consider systems out of equilibrium that do not necessarily satisfy a fluctuation-dissipation relation, but that nevertheless admit a nonequilibrium steady state that is reached asymptotically in the long-time limit. The bounds that we suggest are based on the well-known Bogoliubov inequality and variants of Gibbs' and Donsker-Varadhan variational principles. As a general paradigm, we consider systems of oscillators coupled to heat baths at different temperatures. For such systems, we define the free energy of the system relative to any given reference system (that may or may not be in thermal equilibrium) in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between steady states. By employing a two-sided Bogoliubov inequality and a mean-variance approximation of the free energy (or cumulant generating function, we can efficiently estimate the free energy cost needed in passing from the reference system to the system out of equilibrium (characterised by a temperature gradient). A specific test case to validate our bounds are harmonic oscillator chains with ends that are coupled to Langevin thermostats at different temperatures; such a system is simple enough to allow for analytic calculations and general enough to be used as a prototype to estimate, e.g., heat fluxes or interface effects in a larger class of nonequilibrium particle systems.</description>

      <title>Liquid-Liquid Crossover in Water Model: Local Structure vs. Kinetics of Hydrogen Bonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In equilibrium and supercooled liquids, polymorphism is manifested by thermodynamic regions defined in the phase diagram, which are predominantly of different short- and medium-range order (local structure). It is found that on the phase diagram of the water model, the thermodynamic region corresponding to the equilibrium liquid phase is divided by a line of the smooth liquid-liquid crossover. In the case of the water model, this crossover is revealed by various local order parameters and corresponds to pressures of the order of $3\,150 \pm 350$ atm at ambient temperature. In the vicinity of the crossover, the dynamics of water molecules change significantly, which is reflected, in particular, in the fact that the self-diffusion coefficient reaches its maximum values. In addition, changes in the structure also manifest themselves in changes in the kinetics of hydrogen bonding, which is captured by values of such the quantities as the average lifetime of hydrogen bonding, the average lifetimes of different local coordination numbers, and the frequencies of changes in different local coordination numbers. An interpretation of the hydrogen bond kinetics in terms of the free energy landscape concept in the space of possible coordination numbers is proposed.</description>

Abstract: In this work we consider the problem of optimizing a stellarator subject to hard constraints on the design variables and physics properties of the equilibrium. We survey current numerical methods for handling these constraints, and summarize a number of methods from the wider optimization community that have not been used extensively for stellarator optimization thus far. We demonstrate the utility of new methods of constrained optimization by optimizing a QA stellarator for favorable physics properties while preventing strong shaping of the plasma boundary which can be difficult to create with external current sources.</description>

      <title>Theoretical investigation of the vertical dielectric screening dependence on defects for few-layered van der Waals materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-principle calculations were employed to analyze the effects induced by vacancies of molybdenum (Mo) and sulfur (S) on the dielectric properties of few-layered MoS2. We explored the combined effects of vacancies and dipole interactions on the dielectric properties of few-layered MoS2. In the presence of dielectric screening, we investigated uniformly distributed Mo and S vacancies, and then considered the case of concentrated vacancies. Our results show that the dielectric screening remarkably depends on the distribution of vacancies owing to the polarization induced by the vacancies and on the interlayer distances. This conclusion was validated for a wide range of wide-gap semiconductors with different positions and distributions of vacancies, providing an effective and reliable method for calculating and predicting electrostatic screening of dimensionally reduced materials. We further provided a method for engineering the dielectric constant by changing the interlayer distance, tuning the number of vacancies and the distribution of vacancies in few-layered van der Waals materials for their application in nanodevices and supercapacitors.</description>

      <title>Modified Steinberg-Guinan elasticity model to describe softening-hardening dual anomaly in vanadium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constitutive models are essential for describing the mechanical behavior of materials under high temperatures and pressures, among which the Steinberg-Guinan (SG) model is widely adopted. Recent work has discovered a peculiar dual anomaly of compression-induced softening and heating-induced hardening in the elasticity of compressed vanadium [Phys. Rev. B 104, 134102 (2021)], which is beyond the capability of the SG model to describe. In this work, a modified SG constitutive model is proposed to embody such an anomalous behavior. Elemental vanadium is considered as an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of this improved model in describing the dual anomalies of mechanical elasticity. This new variant of the SG model can also be applied to other materials that present an irregular variation in the mechanical elasticity, and is important to faithfully model and simulate the mechanical response of materials under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Shadow Hamiltonians of structure-preserving integrators for Nambu mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symplectic integrators are widely implemented numerical integrators for Hamiltonian mechanics, which preserve the Hamiltonian structure (symplecticity) of the system. Although the symplectic integrator does not conserve the energy of the system, it is well known that there exists a conserving modified Hamiltonian, called the shadow Hamiltonian. For the Nambu mechanics, which is one of the generalized Hamiltonian mechanics, we can also construct structure-preserving integrators by the same procedure used to construct the symplectic integrators. In the structure-preserving integrator, however, the existence of shadow Hamiltonians is non-trivial. This is because the Nambu mechanics is driven by multiple Hamiltonians and it is non-trivial whether the time evolution by the integrator can be cast into the Nambu mechanical time evolution driven by multiple shadow Hamiltonians. In the present paper we construct structure-preserving integrators for a simple Nambu mechanical system, and derive the shadow Hamiltonians in two ways. This is the first attempt to derive shadow Hamiltonians of structure-preserving integrators for Nambu mechanics. We show that the fundamental identity, which corresponds to the Jacobi identity in Hamiltonian mechanics, plays an important role to calculate the shadow Hamiltonians using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. It turns out that the resulting shadow Hamiltonians have indefinite forms depending on how the fundamental identities are used. This is not a technical artifact, because the exact shadow Hamiltonians obtained independently have the same indefiniteness.</description>

      <title>Crystalformer: Infinitely Connected Attention for Periodic Structure Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting physical properties of materials from their crystal structures is a fundamental problem in materials science. In peripheral areas such as the prediction of molecular properties, fully connected attention networks have been shown to be successful. However, unlike these finite atom arrangements, crystal structures are infinitely repeating, periodic arrangements of atoms, whose fully connected attention results in infinitely connected attention. In this work, we show that this infinitely connected attention can lead to a computationally tractable formulation, interpreted as neural potential summation, that performs infinite interatomic potential summations in a deeply learned feature space. We then propose a simple yet effective Transformer-based encoder architecture for crystal structures called Crystalformer. Compared to an existing Transformer-based model, the proposed model requires only 29.4% of the number of parameters, with minimal modifications to the original Transformer architecture. Despite the architectural simplicity, the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for various property regression tasks on the Materials Project and JARVIS-DFT datasets.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Tensor Basis Neural Networks for Reynolds stress modeling: application to plane channel and square duct flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several Tensor Basis Neural Network (TBNN) frameworks aimed at enhancing turbulence RANS modeling have recently been proposed in the literature as data-driven constitutive models for systems with known invariance properties. However, persistent ambiguities remain regarding the physical adequacy of applying the General Eddy Viscosity Model (GEVM). This work aims at investigating this aspect in an a priori stage for better predictions of the Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor, while preserving the Galilean and rotational invariances. In particular, we propose a general framework providing optimal tensor basis models for two types of canonical flows: Plane Channel Flow (PCF) and Square Duct Flow (SDF). Subsequently, deep neural networks based on these optimal models are trained using state-of-the-art strategies to achieve a balanced and physically sound prediction of the full anisotropy tensor. A priori results obtained by the proposed framework are in very good agreement with the reference DNS data. Notably, our shallow network with three layers provides accurate predictions of the anisotropy tensor for PCF at unobserved friction Reynolds numbers, both in interpolation and extrapolation scenarios. Learning the SDF case is more challenging because of its physical nature and a lack of training data at various regimes. We propose to alleviate this problem based on Transfer Learning (TL). To more efficiently generalize to an unseen intermediate $\mathrm{Re}_\tau$ regime, we take advantage of our prior knowledge acquired from a training with a larger and wider dataset. Our results indicate the potential of the developed network model, and demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the TL process in terms of training data size and training time. Based on these results, we believe there is a promising future by integrating these neural networks into an adapted in-house RANS solver.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Python functions distributed with this article can be used for calculating the parameters of multichannel quantum defect theory models describing excited bound states of complex atoms. These parameters are obtained by fitting a model to experimental data provided by the user. The two main formulations of the theory are supported, namely the one in which the parameters of the model are a set of eigen channel quantum defects and a transformation matrix, and the one where these parameters are the elements of a reactance matrix. The distribution includes programs for calculating theoretical energy levels, calculating mixing coefficients and channel fractions and producing Lu-Fano plots.</description>

      <title>Encoding of linear kinetic plasma problems in quantum circuits via data compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm for encoding of linear kinetic plasma problems in quantum circuits. The focus is made on modeling electrostatic linear waves in one-dimensional Maxwellian electron plasma. The waves are described by the linearized Vlasov-Amp\`ere system with a spatially localized external current that drives plasma oscillations. This system is formulated as a boundary-value problem and cast in the form of a linear vector equation $A\psi = b$ to be solved by using the quantum signal processing algorithm. The latter requires encoding of the matrix $A$ in a quantum circuit as a subblock of a unitary matrix. We propose how to encode $A$ in a circuit in a compressed form and discuss how the resulting circuit scales with the problem size and the desired precision.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the predictive capabilities of common DFT methods (GGA, GGA+$U$, and GGA+$U$+$V$) for determining the transition temperature of antiferromagnetic insulators. We utilize a dataset of 29 compounds and derive Heisenberg exchanges based on DFT total energies of different magnetic configurations. To obtain exchange parameters within a supercell, we have devised an innovative method that utilizes null space analysis to identify and address the limitations imposed by the supercell on these exchange parameters. With obtained exchanges, we construct Heisenberg Hamiltonian to compute Transition temperatures using classical Monte Carlo simulations. To refine the calculations, we apply linear response theory to compute on-site ($U$) and intersite ($V$) corrections through a self-consistent process. Our findings reveal that GGA significantly overestimates the transition temperature (by ~113%), while GGA+$U$ underestimates it (by ~53%). To improve GGA+$U$ results, we propose adjusting the DFT results with the $(S+1)/S$ coefficient to compensate for quantum effects in Monte Carlo simulation, resulting in a reduced error of 44%. Additionally, we discover a high Pearson correlation coefficient of approximately 0.92 between the transition temperatures calculated using the GGA+$U$ method and the experimentally determined transition temperatures. Furthermore, we explore the impact of geometry optimization on a subset of samples. Using consistent structures with GGA+U and GGA+U+V theories reduced the error.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials are revolutionizing large-scale, accurate atomistic modelling in material science and chemistry. Many potentials use atomic cluster expansion or equivariant message passing frameworks. Such frameworks typically use spherical harmonics as angular basis functions, and then use Clebsch-Gordan contraction to maintain rotational symmetry, which may introduce redundancies in representations and computational overhead. We propose an alternative: a Cartesian-coordinates-based atomic density expansion. This approach provides a complete set of polynormially indepedent features of atomic environments while maintaining interaction body orders. Additionally, we integrate low-dimensional embeddings of various chemical elements and inter-atomic message passing. The resulting potential, named Cartesian Atomic Cluster Expansion (CACE), exhibits good accuracy, stability, and generalizability. We validate its performance in diverse systems, including bulk water, small molecules, and 25-element high-entropy alloys.</description>

Abstract: We consider Global Sensitivity Analysis for Monte Carlo radiation transport applications. GSA is usually combined with Uncertainty Quantification, where the latter quantifies the variability of a model output in the presence of uncertain inputs and the former attributes this variability to the inputs. The additional noise inherent to MC RT solvers due to the finite number of particle histories presents an additional challenge to GSA and UQ, which are well-established for deterministic solvers. In this contribution, we apply variance deconvolution to the Saltelli method to address MC RT solver noise without having to over-resolve the MC RT simulation.</description>

      <title>Efficient Treatment of Relativistic Effects with Periodic Density Functional Methods: Energies, Gradients, and Stress Tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03817v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The implementation of an efficient self-consistent field (SCF) method including both scalar relativistic effects and spin-orbit interaction in density functional theory (DFT) is presented. We make use of Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs) and all integrals are evaluated in real space. Our implementation supports density functional approximations up to the level of meta-generalized gradient approximations (mGGAs) for SCF energies and gradients. The latter can be used to compute the stress tensor and consequently allow us to optimize the cell structure. Considering spin-orbit interaction requires the extension of the standard procedures to a two-component (2c) formalism and a non-collinear approach for open-shell systems. Here, we implemented both the canonical and the Scalmani-Frisch non-collinear DFT formalisms, with hybrid and range-separated hybrid functionals being presently restricted to SCF energies. We demonstrate both efficiency and relevance of spin-orbit effects for the electronic structure of discrete systems and systems periodic in one to three dimensions.</description>

Abstract: Large language models, like transformers, have recently demonstrated immense powers in text and image generation. This success is driven by the ability to capture long-range correlations between elements in a sequence. The same feature makes the transformer a powerful wavefunction ansatz that addresses the challenge of describing correlations in simulations of qubit systems. Here we consider two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays to demonstrate that transformers reach higher accuracies than conventional recurrent neural networks for variational ground state searches. We further introduce large, patched transformer models, which consider a sequence of large atom patches, and show that this architecture significantly accelerates the simulations. The proposed architectures reconstruct ground states with accuracies beyond state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo methods, allowing for the study of large Rydberg systems in different phases of matter and at phase transitions. Our high-accuracy ground state representations at reasonable computational costs promise new insights into general large-scale quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Finite Volume Graph Network(FVGN): Predicting unsteady incompressible fluid dynamics with finite volume informed neural network</title>

Abstract: The rapid development of deep learning has significant implications for the advancement of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Currently, most pixel-grid-based deep learning methods for flow field prediction exhibit significantly reduced accuracy in predicting boundary layer flows and poor adaptability to geometric shapes. Although Graph Neural Network (GNN) models for unstructured grids based unsteady flow prediction have better geometric adaptability, these models suffer from error accumulation in long-term predictions of unsteady flows. More importantly, fully data-driven models often require extensive training time, greatly limiting the rapid update and iteration speed of deep learning models when facing more complex unsteady flows. Therefore, this paper aims to balance the demands for training overhead and prediction accuracy by integrating physical constraints based on the finite volume method into the loss function of the graph neural network. Additionally, it incorporates a twice-massage aggregation mechanism inspired by the extended stencil method to enhance the unsteady flow prediction accuracy and geometric shape generalization ability of the graph neural network model on unstructured grids. We focus particularly on the model's predictive accuracy within the boundary layer. Compared to fully data-driven methods, our model achieves better predictive accuracy and geometric shape generalization ability in a shorter training time.</description>

Abstract: The cosmic large-scale structure (LSS) provides a unique testing ground for connecting fundamental physics to astronomical observations. Modeling the LSS requires numerical $N$-body simulations or perturbative techniques that both come with distinct shortcomings. Here we present the first unified numerical approach, enabled by new time integration and discreteness reduction schemes, and demonstrate its convergence at the field level. In particular, we show that our simulations (1) can be initialized directly at time zero, and (2) can be made to agree with high-order Lagrangian perturbation theory in the fluid limit. This enables fast, self-consistent, and UV-complete forward modeling of LSS observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a high-order boundary integral equation (BIE) method for the frequency-domain acoustic scattering of a point source by a singly-periodic, infinite, corrugated boundary. We apply it to the accurate numerical study of acoustic radiation in the neighborhood of a sound-hard two-dimensional staircase modeled after the El Castillo pyramid. Such staircases support trapped waves which travel along the surface and decay exponentially away from it. We use the array scanning method (Floquet--Bloch transform) to recover the scattered field as an integral over the family of quasiperiodic solutions parameterized by their on-surface wavenumber. Each such BIE solution requires the quasiperiodic Green's function, which we evaluate using an efficient integral representation of lattice sum coefficients. We avoid the singularities and branch cuts present in the array scanning integral by complex contour deformation. For each frequency, this enables a solution accurate to around 10 digits in a couple of seconds. We propose a residue method to extract the limiting powers carried by trapped modes far from the source. Finally, by computing the trapped mode dispersion relation, we use a simple ray model to explain an observed acoustic "raindrop" effect (chirp-like time-domain response).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new subgrid model for neutrino quantum kinetics, which is primarily designed to incorporate effects of collective neutrino oscillations into neutrino-radiation-hydrodynamic simulations for core-collapse supernovae and mergers of compact objects. We approximate the neutrino oscillation term in quantum kinetic equation by Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) relaxation-time prescription, and the transport equation is directly applicable for classical neutrino transport schemes. The BGK model is motivated by recent theoretical indications that non-linear phases of collective neutrino oscillations settle into quasi-steady structures. We explicitly provide basic equations of the BGK subgrid model for both multi-angle and moment-based neutrino transport to facilitate the implementation of the subgrid model in the existing neutrino transport schemes. We also show the capability of our BGK subgrid model by comparing to fully quantum kinetic simulations for fast neutrino-flavor conversion. We find that the overall properties can be well reproduced in the subgrid model; the error of angular-averaged survival probability of neutrinos is within $\sim 20 \%$. By identifying the source of error, we also discuss perspectives to improve the accuracy of the subgrid model.</description>

Abstract: We present an iterative generalisation of the quantum subspace expansion algorithm used with a Krylov basis. The iterative construction connects a sequence of subspaces via their lowest energy states. Diagonalising a Hamiltonian in a given Krylov subspace requires the same quantum resources in both the single step and sequential cases. We propose a variance-based criterion for determining a good iterative sequence and provide numerical evidence that these good sequences display improved numerical stability over a single step in the presence of finite sampling noise. Implementing the generalisation requires additional classical processing with a polynomial overhead in the subspace dimension. By exchanging quantum circuit depth for additional measurements the quantum subspace expansion algorithm appears to be an approach suited to near term or early error-corrected quantum hardware. Our work suggests that the numerical instability limiting the accuracy of this approach can be substantially alleviated beyond the current state of the art.</description>
