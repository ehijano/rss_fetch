      <title>Path integral predictions for pre-asymptotic false vacuum decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When tunneling occurs out of generic initial states, a significant fraction of probability is lost at early times during which the dynamics is governed by excited resonance states. However, first-principles analyses based on path integrals have only captured the leading asymptotic behavior during which the tunneling rate is dominated by the false vacuum contribution. In this work, we discuss the behavior in the pre-asymptotic regime from a first-principles path integral perspective. We demonstrate how the relevant expressions can be evaluated systematically through semi-classical methods in the recently developed steadyon picture. This approach allows one to trace the role of the relevant physical scales, making transparent the underlying assumptions and approximations and offering a clear path to establishing a systematically improvable framework to evaluate tunneling rates non-perturbatively.</description>

      <title>Quantum tunneling from excited states in the steadyon picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in the understanding of real-time path integrals led to the development of the ``steadyon picture'' for the semi-classical calculation of quantum tunneling rates. We discuss tunneling out of a generic localized initial state in this picture and present its application for the important example of a resonance state in a one-dimensional point particle potential. We find that the steadyon picture indeed reproduces existing results obtained using the WKB method. Our analysis furthermore demonstrates how applying this picture to physical states naturally addresses open conceptual questions regarding this framework. Finally, we perform a numerical study for a specific potential. We demonstrate in particular the existence of regimes in which the tunneling rate is dominated by higher resonances, rather than the false vacuum, as well as their importance.</description>

      <title>Massive Inflationary Amplitudes: New Representations and Degenerate Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The particle model building of cosmological collider physics often involves boost-breaking bilinear mixing between a heavy particle and the nearly massless inflaton mode. In cosmological correlators, such a mixing is obtained by taking a folded limit of a generic tree graph, which is a special case of degenerate kinematics. In this work, we continue our exploration of massive inflationary amplitudes with a focus on degenerate kinematics. With a suitable change of variables, we derive new differential equations and full analytical solutions for generic tree graphs, making it trivial to take the folded limit and partial-energy limit at a vertex. Our result shows that folded tree graphs generally involve functions of smaller transcendental weights than their nondegenerate counterparts. In particular, the inflaton bispectrum with triple massive exchanges can be expressed in terms of a trivariate Kamp\'e de F\'eriet function and simpler hypergeometric functions.</description>

      <title>Variational Method in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a variational framework for addressing two-dimensional non-integrable quantum field theories through the exact structure of their integrable counterparts. Concentrating on the $\varphi^4$ Landau-Ginzburg model, we use the analytical Vacuum Expectation Values and Form Factors of local operators in the sinh-Gordon theory as the foundation of a variational ansatz. In this way, we obtain controlled estimates of central physical quantities of the $\varphi^4$ theory - such as the finite-volume ground-state energy and the physical mass as a function of the coupling constant. The strengths of the variational methods are leveraged in combination with the Hamiltonian truncation techniques and the LeClair-Mussardo formula, which also allow to probe the accuracy of the variational approximation varying the system size. Within the weak-coupling regime, a detailed numerical analysis reveals the behaviour of the finite-volume spectrum, the ground-state energy, and the elastic part of the scattering matrix, showing how the rigorous machinery of integrable models can serve as a guiding light into the complex landscape of non-integrable quantum field dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Symmetry and Geometry in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of the quantum $R$-matrix in the double-scaled SYK model points to an underlying quantum group structure. In this work, we identify the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{su}(1,1))$ as a subalgebra of the chord algebra. Specifically, we construct the generators of $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{u}(1,1))$ from combinations of operators within the chord algebra and show that the one-particle chord Hilbert space decomposes into the positive discrete series representations of $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{u}(1,1))$. Using the coproduct structure of the quantum group, we build the multi-particle Hilbert space and establish its equivalence with previous results defined by the chord rules. In particular, we show that the quantum $R$-matrix acts as a swapping operator that reverses the ordering of open chords in each fusion channel while incorporating the corresponding $q$-weighted penalty factors. This action enables an explicit derivation of the chord Yang-Baxter relation. We further explore a realization of the quantum group generators on the quantum disk, and present a novel factorization formula for the bulk gravitational wavefunction in the presence of matter. We further discuss the relation between the $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{u}(1,1))$ structure uncovered here and the $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{l}(2, \mathbb{R}))$ algebra previously studied from the boundary perspective. Finally, we study the gravitational wavefunction with matter in the Schwarzian regime.</description>

      <title>Topological subregions in Chern Simons theory and topological string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard, gapped entanglement boundary condition in Chern Simons theory breaks the topological invariance of the theory by introducing a complex structure on the entangling surface. This produces an infinite dimensional subregion Hilbert space, a non-trivial modular Hamiltonion, and a UV-divergent entanglement entropy that is a universal feature of local quantum field theories. In this work, we appeal to the combinatorial quantization of Chern Simons theory to define a purely topological notion of a subregion. The subregion operator algebras are spaces of functions on a quantum group. We develop a diagrammatic calculus for the associated $q$-deformed entanglement entropy, which arise from the entanglement of anyonic edge modes. The $q$-deformation regulates the divergences of the QFT, producing a finite entanglement entropy associated to a $q$-tracial state. We explain how these ideas provide an operator algebraic framework for the entanglement entropy computations in topological string theory \cite{Donnelly:2020teo,Jiang:2020cqo, wongtopstring}, where a large- $N$ limit of the $q$-deformed subregion algebra plays a key role in the stringy description of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Gauged Soft Recursion: On-Shell Construction of Goldstone-Gauge Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new on-shell recursion relation for scattering amplitudes involving Nambu-Goldstone bosons with a gauged unbroken symmetry. A central challenge is that gauge interactions break Adler's zero condition for charged scalars, invalidating the standard soft recursion. To overcome this, we introduce a ``gauged soft recursion'' that leverages the soft theorems of the gauge bosons themselves, combined with a novel decomposition of amplitudes into gauge-invariant components where Adler's zero is partially restored. The formalism, which also incorporates internal gauge bosons via angular momentum constraints, enables the systematic construction of tree-level amplitudes with arbitrary numbers of Goldstone bosons and gauge bosons in both Abelian and non-Abelian theories, as we demonstrate with explicit examples.</description>

      <title>Celestial Mellin Amplitudes: Spin-1 and Spin-2 Exchange$\unicode{x2014}$and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We further develop celestial Mellin amplitudes arXiv:2412.11992 to capture the exchange of particles with spin. For massless external scalar fields, we derive closed-form celestial Mellin amplitudes for a spin-1 and spin-2 exchange$\unicode{x2014}$both massless and massive$\unicode{x2014}$and extract the associated OPE data in the direct-channel. For gauge-boson and graviton exchanges, we identify in the celestial OPE the spin-1 current and the spin-2 stress tensor, together with the boundary gauge boson and graviton. Perturbative time-ordered correlators involving spinning fields can be obtained from those of scalars through the action of differential operators on the external points. In Mellin space these actions become finite-difference (shift) operators in the Mellin variables, which we use to extend our results to arbitrary integer spin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the \emph{quantum} cohomology of a supercharge $Q$ in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory. Recent analyses have revealed a mismatch between the one-loop BPS spectra of the S-dual $SO(7)$ and $Sp(3)$ theories. The $SO(7)$ theory contains a pair of additional graviton (monotone) and non-graviton (fortuitous) cohomologies, whose net contributions cancel in the superconformal index. We show that the quantum-corrected $Q$, inferred from the generalized Konishi anomaly, pairs and lifts these extra cohomologies.</description>

      <title>Probing Topological Phases in a Strongly Correlated Ladder Model via Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26713v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between non-trivial band topology and strong electronic correlations is a central challenge in modern condensed matter physics. We investigate this competition on a two-leg ladder model with a p-wave-like hybridisation between the legs. This model hosts a symmetry-protected topological phase in its non-interacting limit. Using the density-matrix renormalisation group algorithm, we compute the comprehensive quantum phase diagram in the presence of a repulsive inter-leg density-density interaction. Our analysis, based on entanglement entropy and the entanglement spectrum, reveals a fascinating dichotomy in the stability of the topological phase. We find a non-trivial change in the value of the edge entanglement entropy as we include interaction. Furthermore, we find that the phase boundary separating a trivial insulator phase and a topological one with winding number two remains robustly pinned at its non-interacting location, irrespective of the interaction strength. Variation of the effective conformal field theory's central charge near the critical line explains the robustness of the gap. In contrast, the transition to an insulating phase with winding number one is heavily renormalised, with the critical line shifting significantly as the interaction increases. By successfully mapping the phase diagram and identifying the distinct behaviours of the phase boundaries, our work clarifies how interactions can selectively preserve or destroy different aspects of a topological phase.</description>

      <title>Design boosters: from constant-time quantum chaos to $\infty$-designs and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a counterintuitive property of 'conditioning' on the result of measuring a subsystem of a quantum state: such conditioning can boost design quality, at the cost of increased system size. We work in the setting of deep thermalization from many-body physics: starting from a bipartite state on a global system $(A,B)$ drawn from a $k$-design, we measure system $B$ in the computational basis, keep the outcome and examine the state that remains in system $A$, approximating the overall ensemble (the 'projected ensemble') by a $k'$-design. We ask: how does the design quality change due to this procedure, or how does $k'$ compare to $k$? We give the first rigorous example of unitary dynamics generating a state such that, projection at very early (constant) times can boost design randomness. These dynamics are those of quantum chaos, modeled by the evolution of a Hamiltonian drawn from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). We show that, even though a state generated by such dynamics at constant time only forms a $k=\mathcal{O}(1)$ design, the projected ensemble is Haar-random (or a $k'=\infty$ design) in the thermodynamic limit (i.e. when $N_B=\infty$). This phenomenon persists even with weaker and more physically realistic assumptions; our results can be appropriately applied to non-GUE Hamiltonians that nevertheless show likely chaotic signatures in their eigenbases. Moreover, we show that with no assumption on how the global state was generated, a $k$-design experiences a degradation in design quality to $k' = \lfloor k/2 \rfloor$. This improves upon best prior results on the deep thermalization of designs. Together, our contributions argue for design boosting as a result of chaos and showcase a novel mechanism to generate good designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel and more efficient approach to constructing the relativistic BKW (Bobylev, Krook, and Wu) solution. By introducing a class of ansatz functions for the distribution function, we demonstrate that within this specific ansatz space, only the equilibrium and BKW-type forms yield exact solutions to the nonlinear Boltzmann equation. Furthermore, guided by physical insight and drawing upon the framework of relativistic kinetic theory, we derive the Lie algebra of invariant transformations admitted by the relativistic Boltzmann equation. From this algebra, the corresponding symmetry group transformations can be systematically constructed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Ward-Takahashi identity at one-loop in the light-front (LF) formalism for a bound state of fermions. We consider a spinless bound state made up of two fermions in which the Ward-Takahashi identity is satisfied in the covariant formulation. Considering the same system in the light-front formalism, we investigate the proof of Ward-Takahashi identity by integrating the light-front energy component through the identification of the relevant ranges of the longitudinal LF momentum. We elucidate that the pair production diagram plays a crucial role in establishing the Ward-Takahashi identity. We also point out the necessity of taking into account the corresponding zero modes for truly establishing the Ward-Takahashi identity in the LF formalism.</description>

      <title>Did our Universe Tunnel out of the Wrong Higgs Vacuum?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores various aspects and implications of the initial configuration of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs field at the beginning of our Universe. It is well known that the SM Higgs field features a deeper, more stable minimum at large field values. While it is possible that our Universe began and remained in the electroweak vacuum at all times, this scenario is extremely fine-tuned from the point of view of initial conditions. This fine-tuning can be ameliorated by the exponential expansion of spacetime during inflation: intriguingly, this requires at least $\sim 40$ e-folds of inflation, tantalizingly close to the $50-60$ e-folds expected from horizon and flatness considerations. The Higgs could thus provide the reason for a prolonged epoch of inflation in our cosmic history. Otherwise, the most natural initial state corresponds to our Universe initialized in the more stable but "wrong" Higgs vacuum, and subsequently driven dynamically to the weak scale vacuum during reheating. An important, hitherto unexplored aspect of this dynamics is that the barrier between the two vacua persists when the electroweak vacuum becomes energetically favorable, becoming arbitrarily small as the temperature increases, and therefore triggers a first-order phase transition. This transition produces ultra-high (megahertz to gigahertz) frequency gravitational waves (GWs), serving as a challenging but unique SM target for GW experiments. Novel pathways for various beyond the Standard Model phenomena such as the production of dark matter and baryon asymmetry also become possible in this configuration.</description>

      <title>Thermal field theories coupled to curved spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal field theory is an essential tool for comprehending various physical phenomena, including astrophysical objects such as neutron stars and white dwarfs, as well as the early stages of the universe. Nonetheless, the traditional thermal field theory formulated in Minkowski spacetime is not capable of considering the effects originating from the curved spacetime. These effects are crucial for both astrophysical and cosmological observations, making it essential to extend the domain of thermal field theory to curved spacetimes. This article's primary focus is to explore the extension of thermal field theory to curved spacetimes and its implications. We employ Riemann-normal coordinates to describe thermal field theories in curved spacetime, and we also calculate several thermodynamic observables to demonstrate the curvature corrections explicitly.</description>

      <title>On the Limitations of a Generalized Vaidya Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that there can not be a smooth matching of the Generalized Vaidya metric with an exterior Schwarzschild/Vaidya patch across a finite boundary hypersurface unless the mass function is a function of the null coordinate alone. By explicitly deriving the extrinsic curvature components, we show that for $\partial m / \partial r \neq 0$ one has a discontinuity in the curvature and induces a surface stress-energy tensor, corresponding to a thin shell of matter. This discontinuity also appears in the geometric invariant $\mathcal{K} = K_{ab}K^{ab}$ and in the Kodama current, indicating a mismatch in quasi-local energy flux across the boundary. The analysis of timelike geodesics leads to the same condition, reinforcing that the generalized Vaidya geometry with $\partial m / \partial r \neq 0$ cannot represent a consistent stellar interior bounded by a regular surface. We therefore note that the generalized Vaidya spacetime should be interpreted as an unbounded geometry with intrinsic heat flux rather than a viable bounded source.</description>

      <title>The color force acting on a quark in the pion and nucleon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) of hard scattering amplitudes, the twist-3 operators describe local colored Lorentz forces acting on a quark, thereby providing a measure of the strength of the gluon fields. Its value is directly accessible from the nucleon twist-3 polarized $g_2$-parton distribution function. In the semiclassical (instanton-based) QCD vacuum models, the leading non-perturbative contribution stems from correlated instanton-anti-instanton pairs, or molecules. We analyze the magnitude of the color force on a 'struck' quark in light hadrons (pion and nucleon), in the context of the instanton liquid model (ILM). We derive explicitly the pertinent form factors associated to the color Lorenz force, and show that they are intimately related to the pertinent hadronic gravitational and transversity form factors. Using the ILM enhanced by molecules, we detail the ensuing colored force distribution in the transverse plane for luminal pions and nucleons. The results for the nucleons are in good agreement with those reported recently from a lattice collaboration.</description>

      <title>Emergent Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We entertain the possibility that the phenomena typically attributed to dark matter may have a fundamentally emergent nature, rather than arising from new particle degrees of freedom. To illustrate this idea, we consider a field-theoretic model of a three-form gauge field coupled to a cosmological fluid composed of ordinary matter and radiation. In the absence of interactions, the 3-form gauge theory describes only a global, non-propagating state, which can be associated with dark energy. However, when coupled to the cosmic fluid, the theory gives rise to an emergent, dynamical in-medium state. We identify this emergent state of the 3-form gauge field with dark matter. Thus, our proposal provides a unified framework for the dark sector of the universe within the context of an interacting three-form gauge theory. Furthermore, we speculate that the three-form field may have a gravitational origin, potentially supported by the lepton-number asymmetry in the primordial plasma. If this scenario is correct, conventional direct and indirect searches for dark matter would likely be futile.</description>

      <title>Deformations of Locally Conformal Spin(7) Instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the deformation theory of instantons on locally conformal (LC) $Spin(7)$ manifolds. These structures, characterized by a non-parallel fundamental 4-form $\Phi$ satisfying $d\Phi = \theta \wedge \Phi$, represent a significant, yet geometrically constrained, class of non-integrable $G$-structures. We analyze the infinitesimal deformation complex for $Spin(7)$-instantons in this setting.
  Our primary contribution is the reformulation of the linearized deformation equations -- comprising the linearized instanton condition and a gauge-fixing term -- using a $t$-parameter family of Dirac operators. We demonstrate that the $t$-dependent torsion terms arising from the Lee form $\theta$ cancel precisely. This unexpected simplification reveals that the deformation space $\mathcal{H}^1$ is governed entirely by the Levi-Civita geometry, effectively reducing the torsion-full problem to a more classical, torsion-free (Levi-Civita) setting.
  Using a Lichnerowicz-type rigidity theorem, we establish a general condition for an (LC) $Spin(7)$-instanton to be rigid (i.e., $\mathcal{H}^1 = \{0\}$). We apply this theory to the flat instanton ($A=0$) on known compact homogeneous (LC) $Spin(7)$ manifolds and conclude that the flat instanton on these spaces is non-rigid, thus possessing a non-trivial moduli space.</description>

      <title>Scalar field scattering in a Schwarzschild-de Sitter geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve analytically the low-frequency s-wave dynamics of a massless scalar field propagating on a Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole background. A rigorous application of the method of matched asymptotic expansions allows us to connect the scalar's evolution in the proximity of the black-hole horizon with that on cosmological scales. The scattering coefficients, greybody factors, and Wigner time delay are computed explicitly. We consider both small and large black holes, with black-hole to cosmological horizon radii parametrically small and of order unity, respectively. This extends previous studies confined to the small black-hole regime only. In addition, for small black holes we perform a calculation that remains agnostic about the relative size between the ratio of the geometry's horizons and the scalar's frequency in units of the black-hole radius. When the two are comparable, we find that they are interchangeable in the greybody factor, which is symmetric under $\omega\leftrightarrow 1/r_c$ (where $\omega$ is the scalar's frequency and $r_c$ the cosmological horizon radius).</description>

      <title>Parametrisation scale invariance of Parton Distribution Function fits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In global PDF analyses, parton distribution functions (PDFs) are parametrised at a fixed input scale $Q_0$ and evolved to higher scales using the DGLAP equations. Since QCD evolution is fully determined within perturbation theory, the fitted PDFs should, in principle, be independent of the arbitrary choice of $Q_0$. In this work, we test this within the NNPDF framework by performing a series of fits at different starting scales, namely $Q_0 \in {1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.65}$ GeV. We find that the resulting PDFs are consistent within uncertainties and the fit quality remains stable across this range, therefore confirming the invariance of PDF determinations with respect to the choice of starting scale.</description>

      <title>Infinite-component $BF$ field theory: Nexus of fracton order, Toeplitz braiding, and non-Hermitian amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the recent study of Toeplitz braiding by Li et al. [Phys. Rev. B 110, 205108 (2024)], we introduce \textit{infinite-component} $BF$ (i$BF$) theories by stacking topological $BF$ theories along a fourth ($w$) spatial direction and coupling them in a translationally invariant manner. The i$BF$ framework captures the low-energy physics of 4D fracton topological orders in which both particle and loop excitations exhibit restricted mobility along the stacking direction, and their particle-loop braiding statistics are encoded in asymmetric, integer-valued Toeplitz $K$ matrices. We identify a novel form of particle-loop braiding, termed \textit{Toeplitz braiding}, originating from boundary zero singular modes (ZSMs) of the $K$ matrix. In the thermodynamic limit, nontrivial braiding phases persist even when the particle and loop reside on opposite 3D boundaries, as the boundary ZSMs dominate the nonvanishing off-diagonal elements of $K^{-1}$ and govern boundary-driven braiding behavior. Analytical and numerical studies of i$BF$ theories with Hatano-Nelson-type and non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-type Toeplitz $K$ matrices confirm the correspondence between ZSMs and Toeplitz braiding. The i$BF$ construction thus forges a bridge between strongly correlated topological field theory and noninteracting non-Hermitian physics, where ZSMs underlie the non-Hermitian amplification effect. Possible extensions include 3-loop and Borromean-rings Toeplitz braiding induced by twisted topological terms, generalized entanglement renormalization, and foliation structures within i$BF$ theories. An intriguing analogy to the scenario of parallel universes is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Compton Scattering Total Cross Section at Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order and Resummation of Leading Logarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compton scattering is a fundamental process in QED with broad applications, yet its theoretical description at high energies is challenged by substantial next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections arising from double-logarithmic enhancements. To address this, we report the first calculation of the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) total cross section with full electron mass dependence. Our analysis reveals that the NNLO correction, albeit still containing double logarithms, is numerically small due to a suppressing prefactor. By identifying the origin of these logarithms in a kinematic regime featuring a Glauber electron exchange, we successfully resum the leading logarithmic series to all orders, obtaining a compact result in terms of a modified Bessel function. The all-order structure reveals a suppression mechanism, with double factorial terms in the denominator, which explains the negligible nature of higher-order contributions. The combination of our NNLO calculation and all-orders resummation delivers a reliable and precise prediction, poised to serve the needs of high-precision experiments in the foreseeable future.</description>

      <title>A $k$-contact Geometrical Approach to Pseudo-Gauge Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a starting point to the geometric description for the pseudo-gauge ambiguity in relativistic hydrodynamics, showing that it corresponds to the freedom to redefine the thermodynamic equilibrium state of the system. To do this, we develop for the first time a description of a relativistic hydrodynamic-like theory using $k$-contact geometry. In this approach, thermodynamic laws are encoded in a $k$-contact form, thermodynamical states are described via $k$-contact Legendrian submanifolds, and conservation laws emerge as a consequence of Hamilton-de Donder-Weyl (HdDW) equations. The inherent non-uniqueness of these solutions is identified as the source of the pseudo-gauge freedom. We explicitly demonstrate how this redefinition of equilibrium works in a model of a Bjorken-like expansion, where a pseudo-gauge transformation is shown to leave the physical dissipation invariant.</description>

Abstract: Random tensor network states are toy models for holographic duality, which have entanglement properties determined by graph geometry. In this paper, we propose a generalization of the random tensor network states which describe an ensemble of states preserving a given global symmetry. We show that Renyi entropy for this family of states can be described by a quantum extremal surface formula, with corrections to the area law term determined by a bulk gauge theory wavefunction. This provides a toy model of the correspondence between boundary global symmetry and bulk gauge symmetry in holographic duality. We discuss the boundary physical consequences of the bulk deconfined and confined phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06605v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a generalized Euler equation, $\epsilon+p=sT+\mu q+y\frac{\partial p}{\partial y}$, using the effective field theory formulation of perfect fluids. This generalization was achieved by introducing a new variable $y$ into the effective action, which encodes a geometrical scale of the spacetime where the fluid is on. Notably, the generalized Euler equation is independent of the AdS/CFT correspondence. However, when applied to a holographic perfect fluid, this equation naturally recovers the Smarr formula for AdS black holes, thus situating the physical interpretation of the Smarr formula within the framework of well-established physics. Finally, our findings raise important questions regarding the validity of treating the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ as a thermodynamic variable, as proposed in certain frameworks within the literature.</description>

Abstract: We consider soft graviton scattering for a theory where Einstein's gravity is minimally coupled to a scalar field in the presence of a cosmological constant, i.e. in a background de Sitter space. Employing a perturbative expansion in a small cosmological constant, we compute leading, subleading and sub-subleading corrections to Weinberg's soft graviton amplitude for the tree-level scatterings in the static patch of de Sitter space. We observe similar universal features of the soft graviton amplitude as found in [JHEP10(2023)055] for the soft photons.</description>

Abstract: In the present work, we study a fermionic Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) theory with a CPT-even extension and analyze its impact on the Casimir effect under the MIT bag boundary condition model in a low-dimensional setting, where results are obtained without any approximations for a null-temperature system. Moreover, the Matsubara formalism is applied to derive closed expressions for the influence of temperature on the physical observables: Casimir energy, Casimir force, and entropy associated with the system in a LIV context. For each thermal observable, the influence of the LIV correction term is considered in the analysis of both low- and high-temperature regimes. Additionally, we construct a condensed matter analogue using the SSH model, where nonlinear fermionic dispersion and boundary-induced vacuum energy emerge, reproducing the analytical structure of the LIV Casimir effect.</description>

Abstract: A study is made of Hawking radiation from four-dimensional black holes using effective field theory methods. The trace anomaly for the stress tensor in a general curved spacetime background is reproduced using Riegert's action. The semiclassical stress tensor is evaluated in a Schwarzschild background taking a time-independent limit for the quantum state. Imposing physical boundary conditions on an initial Cauchy surface leads to a unique state, analogous to the Unruh state with a vanishing ingoing flux and a finite outgoing flux. In particular, there is no sign of quantum hair arising from this nonlocal effective action.</description>

Abstract: In this work, holographic approach has been used to analyse the hydrodynamical properties of $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills thermal plasma with subleading 't Hooft coupling correction and flavour quarks dual to the AdS Gauss-Bonnet gravity in the presence of string cloud. The drag exerted on an external probe quark while translating through the thermal plasma enhances with probe velocity, flavour quark density, temperature and finite coupling correction. The jet quenching parameter gets enhanced on increase of flavour quark density, temperature and finite coupling correction. Quark-antiquark screening length is observed to reduce with rapidity parameter, flavour quark density, finite coupling correction and temperature which suggests an early transition to the thermal plasma phase of QGP. The screening length is found to be larger for the parallel orientation compared to the perpendicular configuration. Finally, the rotational dynamics of the heavy probe quark is studied. The rotational and drag energy loss increases with angular frequency and quark density, but is almost independent of the 't Hooft coupling.</description>

      <title>You've got a Freund--Rubin in Me: The Aretakis Instability of Extremal Black Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how the Aretakis instability affects non-dilatonic extremal black $p$-branes by focusing on their near-horizon geometry. Crucially, the strength of the instability, \textit{i.e.} the number of transverse derivatives needed to see non-decay/blow-up of fields on the horizon at late null time, is given by the scaling dimensions with respect to the near-horizon $\mathrm{AdS}_{p+2}$-factor. This renders the problem of determining the severity of the Aretakis instability equivalent to computing the Kaluza--Klein spectrum of fields on Freund--Rubin spaces. We use this to argue that non-dilatonic extremal black branes suffer from the Aretakis instability even in the absence of additional fields -- we find that this is weaker than for extremal black holes. We also argue that the scaling dimensions determine the smoothness of stationary deformations to the original black brane background -- here, our findings indicate that generically more modes can lead to worse curvature singularities compared to extremal black holes.</description>

      <title>High to low temperature: $O(N)$ model at large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $O(N)$ vector model for scalars with quartic interaction at large $N$ on $S^1\times S^2$ without the singlet constraint. The non-trivial fixed point of the model is described by a thermal mass satisfying the gap equation at large $N$. We obtain the free energy and the energy density for the model as a series at low temperature in units of the radius of the sphere. We show these results agree with the Borel-Pad\'{e} extrapolations of the high temperature expansions of the free energy and energy density obtained in our previous work. This agreement validates both the expansions and demonstrates that low temperature expansions obtained here correspond to the same solution of the gap equation studied earlier at high temperature. We obtain the ratio of the free energy of the theory at the non-trivial fixed point to that of the Gaussian theory at all values of temperature. This ratio begins at $4/5$ when the temperature is infinity, decreases to a minimum value of $0.760753$, then increases and approaches unity as the temperature is decreased.</description>

      <title>Fermion Parity Resolution of Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03605v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement is analyzed in the Majorana fermion conformal field theory (CFT) in the vacuum, in the fermion state, and in states built from conformal interfaces. In the boundary-state approach, the Hilbert space admits two factorizations for a single interval, producing distinct entanglement spectra determined by spin structures. Although R\'enyi and relative entropies are shown to be insensitive to these structures, symmetry-resolved entanglement naturally reveals their differences. The Majorana fermion's $\mathbb{Z}_2^F$ symmetry, generated by the fermion-parity operator $(-1)^F$, distinguishes bosonic from fermionic sectors, motivating the notion of fermion-parity resolution. While $\mathbb{Z}_2^F$ is naturally a symmetry of the vacuum and fermion reduced density matrices, the Hilbert space factorization is shown to stabilize this symmetry in conformal interface states. When an unpaired Majorana zero mode is present, fermion-parity-resolved entropies display equipartition at all orders in the UV cutoff; in its absence, the breaking of equipartition is quantified by Ramond-sector data. This behavior persists across all states considered. Connections with symmetry-protected topological phases of matter are outlined. All results are compared with twist field computations.</description>

Abstract: We present a historiographical review of algorithms and computer codes developed for solving integration-by-parts relations for Feynman integrals. This procedure is one of the key steps in the evaluation of Feynman integrals, since it enables to express integrals belonging to a given family as linear combinations of master integrals. In this review, we restrict ourselves to considering general algorithms which can, in principle, be applied to any family of Feynman integrals.</description>

      <title>Podolsky quantum electrodynamics for strongly coupled Dirac fermions in (2+1)D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate generalized quantum electrodynamics (GQED), a higher-derivative extension of QED in (3+1)D. We perform its dimensional reduction to (2+1)D by confining the Dirac current to a plane while allowing the gauge field to propagate out of the plane. The resulting model, which we call Pseudo Generalized QED (PGQED), is minimally coupled to massless Dirac fermions. In the strong-coupling regime, we show that a dynamical mass is generated through approximate solutions of the Schwinger-Dyson equations, leading to chiral symmetry breaking and modifications of the fermion dispersion relation. We derive an analytic critical coupling $\alpha_{c}(\mu)$ and flavors critical number $N_{c}(\mu)$, dependent on the Podolsky parameter $\mu$ and the ultraviolet cutoff $\Lambda$. These analytical results are found to be consistent with the numerical analysis. Finally, we connect our results to graphene, estimating a range for $\mu$ in the ultrarelativistic limit and highlighting implications for two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Bulk-to-bulk photon propagator in AdS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the photon bulk-to-bulk propagator in AdS in various gauges, including axial, Coulomb, and the standard covariant gauge. We compute the propagator using both momentum and position space techniques. We ensure the propagators obtained obey the right subsidiary conditions arising from gauge invariance. In particular, BRST invariance implies a relation between the longitudinal components of the gauge field propagator and the ghost bulk-to-bulk propagator. Our method relies on decomposing the components of the propagator in terms of independent tensor structures and solving for the form factors. We recover some previously existing results and obtain new expressions for the propagator in other gauges. The propagator in axial and Coulomb gauge is simpler in momentum space, as momentum space makes manisfest the translational invariance in the boundary directions, while the position space expression is the simplest in the covariant Fried-Yennie gauge. In this gauge the propagator has an improved IR behavior, somewhat analogous to the UV improved behavior associated with the Landau gauge in flat space. The results readily extend to Yang-Mills fields.</description>

Abstract: According to the flat/CCFT correspondence, Carrollian conformal field theories (CCFT) in d dimensions are dual to asymptotically flat spacetimes in d+1 dimensions. In this paper, starting from the holographic interpretation of pseudo-entropy in the (A)dS$_3$/CFT$_2$, we show that both extremal spacelike and timelike curves possess a well-defined flat-space limit. The length of these curves can be regarded as the real and imaginary parts of the pseudo-entropy for the underlying field theory, where only the real part has been considered thus far. Our calculations can confirm that the entanglement entropy in the CCFTs is fundamentally pseudo-entropy, and these theories are non-unitary.</description>

Abstract: We present a family of exact neutral hairy black-hole solutions with spherical horizon topology in extended supergravity with Fayet--Iliopoulos terms. We consider a consistent dilaton truncation and analyze in detail a sector where the magnetic part of the FI terms vanishes. Using appropriate dilaton counterterms, we compute the thermodynamic quantities and show the existence of Hawking--Page phase transitions. As a holographic application, we derive the thermal superpotential in closed form and use it as a counterterm, explicitly demonstrating that no additional finite counterterms are required to regularize the Euclidean action and the quasi-local stress tensor. The dual stress tensor matches that of a thermal gas of massless particles and is consistent with mixed dilaton boundary conditions that preserve conformal symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We derive a general relativistic Hamiltonian valid for both bound and scattering systems by reducing the four-component Dirac equation to a two-component Dirac-Pauli form. Unlike conventional approaches, our formulation includes first-order relativistic corrections in a compact, gauge-consistent expression applicable to arbitrary electromagnetic fields - including non-uniform and time-dependent configurations. As an application, we compute the O(alpha^2) relativistic correction to the Lande g-factor in hydrogen-like atoms, revealing a novel mj^2-dependent term that generalizes the Breit result. This correction is experimentally testable in Penning trap spectroscopy. We further show that relativistic effects become comparable to QFT corrections in highly charged ions where Z ~ 1/sqrt(alpha)</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18295v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a new approach to generally covariant quantum mechanics applied in the case of an FLRW cosmological background. For positive spatial curvature we find a discrete series of solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation that can reasonably be called gravitationally bound `cosmological atom' states. For all cases of curvature, these modes, as well as more conventional atomic spatial modes bound by an external potential, extend to solutions of the Klein-Gordon equations viewed as stationary modes of Klein-Gordon quantum mechanics where wavefunctions are over spacetime and evolution is with respect to an external `geodesic time' parameter $s$. For general nonstationary states with fixed spatial eigenvector, the theory reduces to a novel 1-dimensional quantum system on the time $t$ axis with potential $1/a(t)^2$, where $a(t)$ is the Friedmann expansion factor. Its behaviour, and hence the evolution of spatial states, changes critically when the Hubble constant exceeds $2/3$ of the particle mass, as typically occurs during inflation. We also find washout of the evolution of spatial observables at late times and a backward-traveling reflected mode generated when the value of $H$ transitions to a larger value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01582v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-stabilizerness or quantum magic of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev ($\rm SYK$) model, a prototype example of maximally chaotic quantum matter. We show that the Majorana spectrum of its ground state, encoding the spreading of the state in the Majorana basis, displays a Gaussian distribution as expected for chaotic quantum many-body systems. We compare our results with the case of the $\rm SYK_2$ model, describing non-chaotic random free fermions, and show that the Majorana spectrum is qualitatively different in the two cases, featuring an exponential Laplace distribution for the $\rm SYK_2$ model rather than a Gaussian. From the spectrum we extract the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy (SRE) and show that for both models it displays a linear scaling with system size, with a prefactor that is larger for the SYK model, which has therefore higher magic. Finally, we discuss the spreading of quantun magic under unitary dynamics, as described by the evolution of the Majorana spectrum and the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy starting from a stabilizer state. We show that the SRE for the $\rm SYK_2$ model equilibrates rapidly, but that in the steady-state the interacting chaotic SYK model has more magic than the simple $\rm SYK_2$. Our results suggest that the Majorana spectrum is qualitatively distinct in chaotic and non-chaotic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>On the prospects of thermalization of axion-SU(2) inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axion inflation models coupled to a gauge sector via a Chern-Simons term exhibit an array of interesting phenomenology including a chiral gravitational wave spectrum and primordial black hole production. They may also provide a useful mechanism for generating lepton asymmetry. The possibility to embed this class of models in UV-finite theories and their intriguing, testable, signatures make for a compelling candidate for early acceleration. Due to the Chern-Simons coupling, gauge modes may undergo a finite tachyonic growth during which non-linearities become important. Naturally, this raises the question of whether such (self) interactions can lead to thermalization during inflation. We provide a set of useful criteria for sustained thermalization in an axion-$SU(2)$ model and chart the parameter space of the model accordingly. We find that the cold inflation regime constitutes a very significant fraction of the parameter space. Our analysis accounts for a initially vanishing as well as non-zero gauge field vacuum expectation value (VEV). We also consider the possibility of a dynamically generated VEV.</description>

      <title>SMEFT ATLAS: The Landscape Beyond the Standard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) based on the unbroken gauge group $\text{SU(3)}_C\otimes\text{SU(2)}_L\otimes\text{U(1)}_Y$ and containing only particles of the Standard Model (SM) has developed in the last decade to a mature field. It is the framework to be used in the energy gap from scales sufficiently higher than the electroweak scale up to the lowest energy scale at which new particles show up. We summarize the present status of this theory with a particular emphasize on its role in the indirect search for new physics (NP). While flavour physics of both quarks and leptons is the main topic of our review, we also discuss electric dipole moments, anomalous magnetic moments $(g-2)_{\mu,e}$, $Z$-pole observables, Higgs observables and high-$p_T$ scattering processes within the SMEFT. We group the observables into ten classes and list for each class the most relevant operators and the corresponding renormalization group equations (RGEs). We exhibit the correlations between different classes implied both by the operator mixing and the $\text{SU(2)}_L$ gauge symmetry. Our main goal is to provide an insight into the complicated operator structure of this framework which hopefully will facilitate the identification of valid ultraviolet completions behind possible anomalies observed in future data. Numerous colourful charts, and 85 tables, while representing rather complicated RG evolution from the NP scale down to the electroweak scale, beautify the involved SMEFT landscape. Over 950 references to the literature underline the importance and the popularity of this field. We discuss both top-down and bottom-up approaches as well as their interplay. This allows us eventually to present an atlas of different landscapes beyond the SM that includes heavy gauge bosons and scalars, vector-like quarks and leptons and leptoquarks.</description>

      <title>Can Static Black Holes in Massive Gravity Serve as Candidates for Aschenbach-Like Phenomena?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Aschenbach effect is widely regarded as a manifestation of two quintessential relativistic features: frame dragging and extreme spacetime curvature. Traditionally associated with rotating geometries, this non-monotonic behavior in orbital angular velocity challenges Newtonian intuition. In our previous work, however, we demonstrated that this velocity irregularity is not exclusive to spinning spacetimes. Specifically, we showed that the presence of a stable minimum in the gravitational potential, corresponding to a stable photon sphere, can reproduce Aschenbach-like behavior in static black holes as well. This observation suggests that, even in the absence of rotational frame dragging, curvature alone (if encoded through appropriate geometric extrema) may be sufficient to induce non-monotonic velocity profiles.
  In this study, we build upon that foundation to investigate whether black hole architectures in theories of Massive Gravity can inherently support the emergence of Aschenbach-like phenomena. Furthermore, can this Aschenbach-like phenomenon in static configurations be considered as an observable signature in the dynamics of general relativity, similar to the original Aschenbach effect in rotating spacetimes?</description>

      <title>Reionization optical depth and CMB-BAO tension in punctuated inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the standard six-parameter Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, a $2$-$3\sigma$ tension persists between baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Although this tension has often been interpreted as evidence for dynamical dark energy or a sum of neutrino masses below the established minimum, recent studies suggest it may instead originate from an underestimation of the reionization optical depth, particularly when inferred from large-scale CMB polarization. Jhaveri et al. propose that a suppression of large-scale primordial curvature power could partially cancel the contribution of $\tau$ to the CMB low-$\ell$ polarization power spectrum, leading to a biased low $\tau$ measurement in standard analyses. In this work, we investigate whether punctuated inflation - which generates a suppression of primordial power on large scales through a transient fast-roll phase - can raise the inferred $\tau$ value and thereby reconcile the consistency between CMB and BAO. For simple models with step-like features in the inflaton potential, we find that the constraint on $\tau$ and the CMB-BAO tension remain nearly identical to those in the standard six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model. We provide a physical explanation for this negative result.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Sum Rule from Higher-Form Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an entanglement sum rule for $(d-1)$-dimensional quantum lattice models with finite abelian higher-form symmetries, obtained by minimally coupling a sector on $p$-simplices carrying a $p$-form $G$ symmetry to a sector on $(p+1)$-simplices carrying the dual $(d-p-2)$-form $\widehat G$ symmetry (with $\widehat G$ being the Pontryagin dual of $G$). The coupling is introduced by conjugation with a symmetry-preserving operator $\mathcal{U}$ that dresses symmetry-invariant operators with appropriate Wilson operators. Our main result concerns symmetric eigenstates of the coupled model that arise by acting with $\mathcal{U}$ on direct-product symmetric eigenstates of the decoupled model: provided a topological criterion formulated via the Mayer--Vietoris sequence holds for the chosen bipartition, $\mathcal{U}$ factorizes across the cut when acting on the symmetric state, and the entanglement entropy equals the sum of the entropies of the two sectors. This framework explains and generalizes known examples in fermion-$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, identifies when topology obstructs the sum rule, and provides a procedure to construct new examples by gauging higher-form symmetries.</description>

      <title>Temperley-Lieb integrable models and fusion categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that every fusion category containing a non-invertible, self-dual object $a$ gives rise to an integrable anyonic chain whose Hamiltonian density satisfies the Temperley-Lieb algebra. This spin chain arises by considering the projection onto the identity channel in the fusion process $a\otimes a$. We relate these models to Pasquier's construction of ADE lattice models. We then exploit the underlying Temperley-Lieb structure to discuss the spectrum of these models and argue that these models are gapped when the quantum dimension of $a$ is greater than 2. We show that for fusion categories where the dimension is close to 2, such as the Fib$\times$Fib and Haagerup fusion categories, the finite size effects are large and they can obscure the numerical analysis of the gap.</description>

      <title>Quantum enforcement of strong cosmic censorship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the trace anomaly of quantum field theory is sufficient to enforce strong cosmic censorship in any stationary spacetime with an inner horizon of nonzero surface gravity. In the two-dimensional dilaton reduction of four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory coupled to $N$ conformal fields, the anomaly-induced Polyakov term yields a finite $\langle T_{vv}\rangle \to \frac{N}{48\pi}\kappa_-^2$ near the Cauchy horizon, while the affine-frame energy grows as $T_{kk}\propto e^{2\kappa_- v}$. The resulting tidal blow-up converts the inner horizon into a null, Tipler-strong singularity. The mechanism is local, universal, and state-independent, and extends to Kerr/Kerr-Newman, $\Lambda&gt;0$, and nonsingular interiors. Thus, the trace anomaly is the minimal quantum ingredient restoring strong cosmic censorship.</description>
