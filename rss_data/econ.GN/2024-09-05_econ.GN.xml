      <title>Impact Evaluations in Data Poor Settings: The Case of Stress-Tolerant Rice Varieties in Bangladesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impact evaluations of new technologies are critical to assessing and improving investment in national and international development goals. Yet many of these technologies are introduced and promoted at times and in places that lack the necessary data to conduct a strongly identified impact evaluation. We present a new method that combines remotely sensed Earth observation (EO) data, recent advances in machine learning, and socioeconomic survey data so as to allow researchers to conduct impact evaluations of a certain class of technologies when traditional economic data is missing. To demonstrate our approach, we study stress tolerant rice varieties (STRVs) that were introduced in Bangladesh more than a decade ago. Using 20 years of EO data on rice production and flooding, we fail to replicate existing RCT and field trial evidence of STRV effectiveness. We validate this failure to replicate with administrative and household panel data as well as conduct Monte Carlo simulations to test the sensitivity to mismeasurement of past evidence on the effectiveness of STRVs. Our findings speak to conducting large scale, long-term impact evaluations to verify external validity of small scale experimental data while also laying out a path for researchers to conduct similar evaluations in other data poor settings.</description>

      <title>Coping or Hoping? Livelihood Diversification and Food Insecurity in the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the impact of livelihood diversification on food insecurity amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis uses household panel data from Ethiopia, Malawi, and Nigeria in which the first round was collected immediately prior to the pandemic and extends through multiple rounds of monthly data collection during the pandemic. Using this pre- and post-outbreak data, and guided by a pre-analysis plan, we estimate the causal effect of livelihood diversification on food insecurity. Our results do not support the hypothesis that livelihood diversification boosts household resilience. Though income diversification may serve as an effective coping mechanism for small-scale shocks, we find that for a disaster on the scale of the pandemic this strategy is not effective. Policymakers looking to prepare for the increased occurrence of large-scale disasters will need to grapple with the fact that coping strategies that gave people hope in the past may fail them as they try to cope with the future.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Economic Productivity: Experimental Evidence in LLM-Assisted Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper derives 'scaling laws' -- empirical relationships between the amount of training compute used for a Large Language Model (LLM) and its performance -- for economic outcomes. In a preregistered experiment, 300 professional translators completed 1800 tasks with access to one of thirteen LLMs with differing model training compute sizes (or a control). Our results show that model scaling substantially raises productivity: for every 10x increase in model compute, translators completed tasks 12.3% quicker, received 0.18 s.d. higher grades, and earned 16.1% more per minute (including bonus payments). Further, the gains from model scaling are much higher for lower-skilled workers who gain a 4x larger improvement in task completion speed. These results imply further frontier model scaling -- which is currently estimated at 4x increase per year -- may have significant economic implications.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Multi-Country GDP Prediction: A Study of Model Performance and Data Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GDP is a vital measure of a country's economic health, reflecting the total value of goods and services produced. Forecasting GDP growth is essential for economic planning, as it helps governments, businesses, and investors anticipate trends, make informed decisions, and promote stability and growth. While most previous works focus on the prediction of the GDP growth rate for a single country or by machine learning methods, in this paper we give a comprehensive study on the GDP growth forecasting in the multi-country scenario by deep learning algorithms. For the prediction of the GDP growth where only GDP growth values are used, linear regression is generally better than deep learning algorithms. However, for the regression and the prediction of the GDP growth with selected economic indicators, deep learning algorithms could be superior to linear regression. We also investigate the influence of the novel data -- the light intensity data on the prediction of the GDP growth, and numerical experiments indicate that they do not necessarily improve the prediction performance.

      <title>The increasing share of low-value transactions in international trade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper documents a new feature of international trade: the increase in the share of low-value transactions in the total volume of transactions. Using Spanish data, we show that the share of low-value transactions in the total number of transactions increased from 9% to 61% in exports and from 14% to 54% in imports between 1997 and 2023. The increase in the number of low-value trade transactions is explained by the rise of e-commerce and direct-to-customer sales facilitated by online retail platforms, and the fast-fashion strategy followed by clothing firms.</description>

      <title>Can AI Replace Human Subjects? A Large-Scale Replication of Psychological Experiments with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being integrated into scientific research, particularly in the social sciences, where understanding human behavior is critical. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have shown promise in replicating human-like responses in various psychological experiments. However, the extent to which LLMs can effectively replace human subjects across diverse experimental contexts remains unclear. Here, we conduct a large-scale study replicating 154 psychological experiments from top social science journals with 618 main effects and 138 interaction effects using GPT-4 as a simulated participant. We find that GPT-4 successfully replicates 76.0 percent of main effects and 47.0 percent of interaction effects observed in the original studies, closely mirroring human responses in both direction and significance. However, only 19.44 percent of GPT-4's replicated confidence intervals contain the original effect sizes, with the majority of replicated effect sizes exceeding the 95 percent confidence interval of the original studies. Additionally, there is a 71.6 percent rate of unexpected significant results where the original studies reported null findings, suggesting potential overestimation or false positives. Our results demonstrate the potential of LLMs as powerful tools in psychological research but also emphasize the need for caution in interpreting AI-driven findings. While LLMs can complement human studies, they cannot yet fully replace the nuanced insights provided by human subjects.</description>
