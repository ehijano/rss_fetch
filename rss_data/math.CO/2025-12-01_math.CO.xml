      <title>Ealy's conjecture in odd characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve Ealy's conjecture from 1977 by showing that for each odd prime $p$, a finite generalized quadrangle each point of which admits a central symmetry of order $p$, is either a classical symplectic quadrangle in dimension $3$, or a Hermitian quadrangle in dimension $3$ or $4$. As a byproduct, we vastly generalize the aforementioned result by determining the finite generalized quadrangles whose every point admits at least one nontrivial central symmetry.</description>

      <title>Rectangulations avoiding a pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix a strong rectangulation pattern $P$ of size $L$. We show that the growth constant of the class of strong rectangulations avoiding $P$ is strictly smaller than $\Lambda =27/2$, the growth constant for all strong rectangulations. More precisely, forbidding any such $P$ yields a pattern-uniform exponential drop of at least $\Lambda - 1/\Lambda^{3L-1}$. Consequently, the proportion of $P$-avoiding rectangulations among all rectangulations tends to zero as $n\to \infty$. This is the first result on the uniform drop of exponential growth for pattern-avoiding rectangulations. The proof utilizes the standard correspondence with leftmost history quadrant walks, along with a pattern-insertion scheme that controls the radius of convergence of the associated generating functions, thereby establishing the first uniform exponential upper bound for rectangulation classes defined by geometric avoidance.</description>

      <title>Cohen-Macauleyness of the Zero-Divisor Graph of a Boolean Poset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the zero-divisor graph $\Gamma(P)$ of a Boolean poset $P$ is both well-covered and Cohen--Macaulay. Furthermore, for a poset $\mathbf{P} = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P_i$ $(n \ge 3)$, where each $P_i$ is a finite bounded poset satisfying $Z(P_i) = \{0\}$ for all $i$, and $\le |P_1| \le |P_2| \le \cdots \le |P_n|, $ we show that the zero-divisor graph $\Gamma(\mathbf{P})$ is Cohen--Macaulay if and only if $\mathbf{P}$ is a Boolean lattice.</description>

      <title>Large flames in rooted acyclic digraphs without backward-infinite paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $r$-rooted digraph is a flame if for each non-root vertex $v$, there is a set of edge-disjoint directed paths from $r$ to $v$ that covers all ingoing edges of $v$. The study of flames was initiated by Lov\'asz, who showed that in a finite rooted digraph, the edge-minimal subgraphs that preserve all local edge-connectivities from the root are always flames. It is known that the edge sets of the flame subgraphs of any finite rooted digraph form a greedoid. Szeszl\'er showed recently that if the digraph is acyclic, then the bases of this greedoid are the bases of a matroid. We show that a suitable formulation of Szeszl\'er's theorem is valid for infinite digraphs under the additional assumption that there are no backward-infinite directed paths (which assumption is indeed essential). We also prove that the ''correct'' infinite generalisation of Lov\'asz's theorem also holds for this class of digraphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an involution proof of a Catalan-tangent number identity arising from the study of peak algebra that was found by Aliniaeifard and Li. In the course, we find a new combinatorial identity for the tangent numbers $T_{2n+1}$: $$ \sum_{k=0}^{n}(-1)^{k}{2n+1\choose 2k}2^{2n-2k}T_{2k+1}=(-1)^nT_{2n+1}. $$ Moreover, we derive two different $q$-analogs of the above identity from the combinatorial perspective.</description>

      <title>Optimal Tree-Decompositions with Bags of Bounded Treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that several natural graph classes have tree-decompositions with minimum width such that each bag has bounded treewidth. For example, every planar graph has a tree-decomposition with minimum width such that each bag has treewidth at most 3. This treewidth bound is best possible. More generally, every graph of Euler genus $g$ has a tree-decomposition with minimum width such that each bag has treewidth in $O(g)$. This treewidth bound is best possible. Most generally, every $K_p$-minor-free graph has a tree-decomposition with minimum width such that each bag has treewidth at most some polynomial function $f(p)$.
  In such results, the assumption of an excluded minor is justified, since we show that analogous results do not hold for the class of 1-planar graphs, which is one of the simplest non-minor-closed monotone classes. In fact, we show that 1-planar graphs do not have tree-decompositions with width within an additive constant of optimal, and with bags of bounded treewidth. On the other hand, we show that 1-planar $n$-vertex graphs have tree-decompositions with width $O(\sqrt{n})$ (which is the asymptotically tight bound) and with bounded treewidth bags. Moreover, this result holds in the more general setting of bounded layered treewidth, where the union of a bounded number of bags has bounded treewidth.</description>

      <title>Blind cop-width and balanced minors of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a pursuit-evasion game on an undirected graph in which a robber, moving at a fixed constant speed, attempts to evade a team of cops who are blind to the robber's location and can quickly travel between any pair of vertices in the graph. The blind cop-width is the minimum number of cops needed to catch the robber on a given graph. We link it with other known graph parameters defined in terms of pursuit-evasion games, and show a new lower bound with respect to treewidth. The proof introduces the notion of balanced minors, where all branch sets of a minor model have equal size.</description>

      <title>On Universal Graphs for Trees and Tree-Like Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chung and Graham~[\textit{J.~London Math.\ Soc.\ }1983] claimed to prove that there exists an $n$-vertex graph $G$ with \( \frac{5}{2}n \log_2 n + \bigo(n)\) edges that contains every $n$-vertex tree as a subgraph. Frati, Hoffmann and T\'oth~[\textit{Combin.\ Probab.\ Comput.} 2023] discovered an error in the proof. By adding more edges to $G$ the error can be corrected, bringing the number of edges in $G$ to \(\frac{7}{2}n \log_2 n + \bigo(n). \)
  We make the first improvement to Chung and Graham's bound in over four decades by showing that there exists an $n$-vertex graph with \(\frac{14}{5}n \log_2 n + \bigo(n) \) edges that contains every $n$-vertex tree as a subgraph.
  Furthermore, we generalise this bound for treewidth-$k$ graphs by showing that there exists a graph with $\bigo(kn\log n)$ edges that contains every $n$-vertex treewidth-$k$ graph as a subgraph. This is best possible in the sense that $\Omega(kn\log{n})$ edges are required.</description>

      <title>The spectral radii and extremal graphs of two types of minimal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A connected nontrivial graph $G$ is {\it matching covered} if every edge of $G$ is contained in some perfect matching of $G$. A matching covered graph $G$ is {\it minimal} if $G-e$ is not matching covered for each edge $e$ of $G$. A graph is said to be {\it factor-critical} if $G-v$ has a perfect matching for every $v\in V(G)$. A factor-critical graph $G$ is said to be {\it minimal factor-critical} if $G-e$ is not factor-critical graph for each edge $e\in E(G)$. In this paper, by employing ear decomposition and edge-exchange techniques, the greatest spectral radii of minimal matching covered bipartite graphs and minimal factor-critical graphs are determined, and the corresponding extremal graphs are characterized.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lonely Runner Conjecture of Wills and Cusick states that if $k+1$ runners start running at distinct constant speeds around a unit-length circular track, then for each runner there is a time when he/she is at least $1/(k+1)$ away from all other runners. Rosenfeld recently obtained a computer-assisted proof of the conjecture for $8$ runners. By refining his approach with a sieve, we obtain proofs (also computer-assisted) for $9$ and $10$ runners.</description>

      <title>On the Steiner $k$-diameter and Steiner ($k,k^{\prime}$)-radius of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a connected graph $G=(V,E)$ and a $k$-set $S\subseteq V(G)$, the $Steiner$ $distance$ $d_{G}(S)$ of $S$ is defined as the size of a minimum tree including $S$ in $G$. The $Steiner$ $k$-$eccentricity$ of a vertex $v$ in $G$ is the maximum value of $d_G(S)$ over all $S\subseteq V(G)$ with $|S|=k$ and $v\in S$. The minimum Steiner $k$-eccentricity over all vertices, denoted by $Sr_k(G)$, is called the $Steiner$ $k$-$radius$ of $G$ and the maximum Steiner $k$-eccentricity over all vertices, denoted by $Sd_k(G)$, is its $Steiner$ $k$-$diameter$. The $Steiner$ $(k,k^{\prime})$-$eccentricity$ of a $k^{\prime}$-subset $S^{\prime}$ of $V(G)$, which is an extension of the Steiner $k$-eccentricity of a vertex $v$, is defined as the maximum Steiner distance over all $k$-subsets of $V(G)$ containing $S^{\prime}$. The minimum Steiner $(k,k^{\prime})$-eccentricity among all $k^{\prime}$-subsets of $V(G)$, denoted by $Sr_{k,k^{\prime}}(G)$, is called the $Steiner$ $(k,k^{\prime})$-$radius$ of $G$. In 1989, Chartrand, Oellermann, Tian and Zou showed that for any $k\geq3$, $Sd_k(T)\leq \frac{k}{k-1}Sr_k(T)$ for any tree $T$. In this paper, we generalize this result and show that $Sd_k(T)\leq \frac{k}{k-k^{\prime}}Sr_{k,k^{\prime}}(T)$ for any $k\geq3$, $k&gt;k^{\prime}\geq1$. Furthermore, for $k^{\prime}=2$ and $k^{\prime}=3$, we obtain a tight upper bound of the Steiner $k$-diameter by the Steiner $(k,k^{\prime})$-radius for all trees.</description>

      <title>The 3-restricted edge-connectivity of the direct product graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An edge subset \( S \subseteq E(G) \) is called a 3-restricted edge-cut if \( G - S \) is disconnected and each component of \( G - S \) contains at least three vertices. The 3-restricted edge-connectivity of a graph \( G \), denoted by \( \lambda_3(G) \), is defined as the minimum cardinality among all 3-restricted edge-cuts if there are at least one; otherwise, \( \lambda_3(G) = +\infty \). It is proved that $\lambda_3(G)\leq\xi_3(G)$ if $G$ has a 3-restricted edge-cut, where $\xi_3(G) = \min \left\{ |[X, V(G) \setminus X]_G|:|X| = 3 \text{ and } G[X] \text{ is connected} \right\}.$ If \( \lambda_3(G) = \xi_3(G) \), then \( G \) is said to be maximally 3-restricted edge-connected. The direct product of two graphs $G$ and $H$, denoted by $G \times H$, is defined as the graph with vertex set \( V(G \times H) = V(G) \times V(H) \), where two vertices \( (u_1, v_1) \) and \( (u_2, v_2) \) are adjacent in \( G \times H \) if and only if \( u_1u_2 \in E(G) \) and \( v_1v_2 \in E(H) \). In this paper, we determine, for a regular connected graph \( G\), the 3-restricted edge-connectivity of \( G \times C_n \), \( G \times K_n \) and \( G \times T_n \), where \( C_n \), \( K_n \) and \( T_n \) are the cycle, the complete graph and the total graph with \( n \) vertices, respectively. As corollaries, we establish sufficient conditions for the direct product graphs \( G \times C_n \), \( G \times K_n \) and \( G \times T_n \) to be maximally 3-restricted edge-connected.</description>

      <title>Making an oriented graph acyclic using inversions of bounded or prescribed size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an oriented graph $D$, the inversion of a subset $X$ of vertices consists in reversing the orientation of all arcs with both endpoints in $X$. When the subset $X$ is of size $p$ (resp. at most $p$), this operation is called an $(=p)$-inversion (resp. $(\leq p)$-inversion). Then, an oriented graph is $(=p)$-invertible if it can be made acyclic by a sequence of $p$-inversions. We observe that, for $n=|V(D)|$, deciding whether $D$ is $(=n-1)$-invertible is equivalent to deciding whether $D$ is acyclically pushable, and thus NP-complete. In all other cases, when $p \neq n-1$, we construct a polynomial-time algorithm to decide $(=p)$-invertibility.
  We then consider the $(= p)$-inversion number, $\text{inv}^{= p}(D)$ (resp. $(\leq p)$-inversion number, $\text{inv}^{\leq p}(D)$), defined as the minimum number of $(=p)$-inversions (resp. $(\leq p)$-inversions) rendering $D$ acyclic. We show that every $(=p)$-invertible digraph $D$ satisfies $\text{inv}^{= p}(D) \leq |A(D)|$ for every integer $p\geq 2$. When $p$ is even, we bound $\text{inv}^{= p}$ by a (linear) function of the feedback arc set number, and rule out the existence of any bounding function for odd $p$.
  Finally, we study the complexity of deciding whether the $(= p)$-inversion number, or the $(\leq p)$-inversion number, of a given oriented graph is at most a given integer $k$. For any fixed positive integer $p \geq 2$, when $k$ is part of the input, we show that both problems are NP-hard even in tournaments. In general oriented graphs, we prove $W[1]$-hardness for both problems when parameterized by $p$, even for $k=1$. In contrast, we exhibit polynomial kernels in $p + k$ for both problems in tournaments.</description>

      <title>Counting fibres of the Hadamard product using Bergman fans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generic fibre of the Hadamard product of linear spaces via matroid theory and tropical geometry. To do so, we introduce the flip product, a numerical invariant associated to a pair of matroids defined via the stable intersection of their (flipped) Bergman fans. Our first main result is that the cardinality of a generic fibre for the Hadamard product of linear spaces is exactly the flip product of their matroids. We also provide a recursive algorithm for computing the flip product of any pair of matroids. As an application of our techniques, we extend the notion of realisation numbers from rigidity theory to rotational-symmetric and periodic realisation numbers and we provide combinatorial algorithms to compute them. Finally, we show a number of existing matroid invariants are specialisations of the flip product, including the beta invariant.</description>

      <title>Multipartite and Structural Results on Transparent Rectangle Visibility Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22660</link>

Abstract: We consider a graph representation in the plane, called the transparent rectangle visibility graph (TRVG), where each vertex is represented by a rectangle in the plane with sides parallel to the plane axes, in a way that any two vertices are adjacent if and only if a vertical or horizontal line can be drawn from the interior of one rectangle to the other. Expanding upon previously done work by Juntarapomdach and Kittipassorn, we show that $K_{3,3,3}$ is not a TRVG, and classify complete $k$-partite TRVGs. We also prove that the complement of $C^2_n$ is not a TRVG whenever $n \geq 15$, and that every $k$-partite TRVG with $n$ vertices has at most $2(k-1)n-k(k-1)$ edges. Furthermore, we introduce a novel representation, the intersecting transparent rectangle visibility graph (ITRVG), and show that there exists a graph that is an ITRVG but not a TRVG.</description>

      <title>On minimal codes arising from projective embeddings of point-line geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let ${\mathcal C}(\Omega)$ be the linear code arising from a projective system $\Omega$ of $\mathrm{PG}(V).$ Consider the point-line geometry $\Gamma=({\mathcal P},{\mathcal L})$ and a projective embedding $\varepsilon\colon \Gamma\rightarrow \mathrm{PG}(V)$ of $\Gamma.$ We show that the projective code obtained by taking as projective system $\Omega:=\varepsilon(\mathcal{P})$ is minimal if the graph induced on the set $\Gamma\setminus\varepsilon^{-1}(H)$ by the collinearity graph of $\Gamma$ is connected for any hyperplane $H$ of $\mathrm{PG}(V)$. As an application, Grassmann codes, Segre codes, polar Grassmann codes of orthogonal, symplectic, hermitian type and codes arising from the point-hyperplane geometry of a projective space are minimal codes.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial proof of an inequality on some partitions separated by parity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2019, Andrews investigated integer partitions in which all parts of a given parity are smaller than those of the opposite parity and introduced eight partition functions based on the parity of the smaller parts and parts of a given parity appearing at most once or an unlimited number of times. Recently, Bringmann, Craig and Nazaroglu studied the asymptotic behavior of the eight partition functions proved several inequalities for sufficiently large $n$. At the end of their paper, they asked for combinatorial proofs of those inequalities. In this paper, we prove that an inequality on partitions separated by parity holds for $n\geq 373$ by a combinatorial method. This answers a question posed by Bringmann, Craig and Nazaroglu.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Obstructions and the Collapse of Elementary Structure in the Kronecker Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Kronecker coefficients $g(\lambda,\mu,\nu)$ with bounded rows are polynomial-time computable via lattice-point methods, no explicit closed-form formulas have been obtained for genuinely three-row cases in the 87 years since Murnaghan's foundational work. This paper provides such formulas for the first time and identifies a universal structural boundary at parameter value 5 where elementary combinatorial patterns collapse.
  We analyze two independent families of genuinely three-row coefficients and establish that for $k \leq 4$, the formulas exhibit elementary structure: oscillation bounds follow the triangular-Hogben pattern, and polynomial expressions factor completely over $\mathbb{Z}$. At the critical threshold $k=5$, this structure collapses: the triangular pattern fails, and algebraic obstructions -- irreducible quadratic factors with negative discriminant -- emerge.
  We develop integer forcing, a proof technique exploiting the tension between continuous asymptotics and discrete integrality. As concrete results, we prove that $g((n,n,1)^3) = 2 - (n \mod 2)$ for all $n \geq 3$ -- the first explicit formula for a genuinely three-row Kronecker coefficient -- derive five explicit polynomial formulas for staircase-hook coefficients, and verify Saxl's conjecture for 132 three-row partitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twinned chain polytopes form a broad class of non-centrally symmetric reflexive polytopes and exhibit intriguing structures. In the present paper, we show that the number of facets of $d$-dimensional twinned chain polytopes is at most $6^{d/2}$. In case $d$ is even, the equality holds if and only if the polytope is isomorphic to a free sum of $d/2$ copies of del Pezzo polygons. This result contributes a partial answer to Nill's conjecture: the number of facets of a $d$-dimensional reflexive polytope is at most $6^{d/2}$.</description>

      <title>Generalized Latin Square Graphs of Semigroups: A Counting Framework for Regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the generalized Latin square graph $\Gamma(S)$ for a finite semigroup $S$, extending the combinatorial concept of Latin rectangle graphs. By analyzing factorization multiplicities $(N_S)$ and cancellation failure $(N_R,N_C)$, we derive the degree formula $\deg(v) = 2n - 3 + Q(i,j)$. We prove that graph regularity is equivalent to $Q(i,j)$ being constant -- a condition termed \emph{compensated factorization} -- which often arises from congruence-induced symmetries. A non-cancellative semigroup of order 4 generating a 9-regular graph is constructed. Finally, computational enumeration up to order $n = 6$ (using the \textsf{smallsemi} package for GAP) confirms that regularity is a rare property which decreases significantly as the order increases.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the Gerver-Ramsey collinearity problem of determining the maximum number of points in a north-east lattice path without $k$ collinear points. Using a satisfiability solver, up to isomorphism we enumerate all north-east lattice paths avoiding $k$ collinear points for $k \leq 6$. We also find a north-east lattice path avoiding $k = 7$ collinear points with 327 steps, improving on the previous best length of 260 steps found by Shallit.</description>

Abstract: We reduce the $p^2$ block all-one matrices in the generalized block Laplacian spectrum of graphs to $p$ block all-one matrices in the generalized block diagonal Lapalcian spectrum of graphs introduced by Wang and the second author (\textit{Adv. Appl. Math.} 173B (2026)). In this case the matrices are all real symmetric, and hence the spectrum is real, which does not hold for the generalized block Laplacian spectrum. We also investigate the analogue by Hermitian adjacency matrix of digraphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the structure of the complete asymptotic expansion of the probability that a large combinatorial object is irreducible or consists of a given number of irreducible parts, where irreducibility is understood in terms of combinatorial construction SEQ, labeled or unlabeled. We show that for rapidly growing (i.e. gargantuan) combinatorial classes, the coefficients that appear in this expansion are integers and can be interpreted as linear combinations of the counting sequences of three closely related combinatorial classes. We apply this general asymptotic result to labeled and unlabeled (multi-)tournaments, as well as to (multi-)permutations and (multi-)matchings. We also explore the limits of our approach with respect to other combinatorial constructions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\textit{$m$-deck}$ of an $n$-vertex graph is the multiset of unlabeled induced subgraphs with $m$ vertices. Caterpillars are trees in which all nonleaf vertices lie on a single path. We prove for $n\ge48$ that any $n$-vertex caterpillar is reconstructible (up to isomorphism) from its $m$-deck when $m&gt;n/2$. The result is sharp, since for $n\ge6$ there are two $n$-vertex caterpillars having the same $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$-deck. Our result proves the special case for caterpillars of a 1990 conjecture by N\'ydl about trees.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we delve into the study of the 2-switch-degree of a graph $G$, which is nothing more than the degree of $G$ as a vertex of the realization graph $\mathcal{G}(s)$ associated with the degree sequence $s$ of $G$. We explore the characteristics of active and inactive vertices, the basic properties of the degree, explicit formulas for its computation, and its behavior in specific families of graphs, such as trees and unicyclic graphs.</description>

      <title>Bounds for Hypergraph Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $\Gamma$ is said to be universal for a class of graphs $\mathcal{H}$ if $\Gamma$ contains a copy of every $H \in \mathcal{H}$ as a subgraph. The number of edges required for a host graph $\Gamma$ to be universal for the class of $D$-degenerate graphs on $n$ vertices has been shown to be $O(n^{2-1/D}(\log n)^{2/D}(\log\log n)^{5})$. We generalise this result to $r$-uniform hypergraphs, showing the following. Given $D, r \ge 2$ and $n$ sufficiently large, there exists a constant $C = C(D, r)$ such that there exists a graph with at most \[Cn^{r-1/D}(\log n)^{2/D}(\log\log n)^{2r+1}\] edges which is universal for the class of $D$-degenerate $r$-uniform hypergraphs on $n$ vertices. This is tight up to the polylogarithmic term.</description>

We describe its cell structure and show that each cell admits a representation by a rotationally symmetric (not necessarily reduced) plabic graph. Along the way, we develop new techniques for working with non-reduced plabic graphs.</description>

      <title>Local Geometric and Transport Properties of Networks that are Generated from Hyperuniform Point Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperuniformity, which is a type of long-range order that is characterized by the suppression of long-range density fluctuations in comparison to the fluctuations in standard disordered systems, has emerged as a powerful concept to aid in the understanding of diverse natural and engineered phenomena. In the present paper, we harness hyperuniform point patterns to generate a class of disordered, spatially embedded networks that are distinct from both perfectly ordered lattices and uniformly random geometric graphs. We refer to these networks as \emph{hyperuniform-point-pattern-induced (HuPPI) networks}, and we compare them to their counterpart \emph{Poisson-point-pattern-induced (PoPPI) networks}. By computing the local geometric and transport properties of HuPPI networks, we demonstrate how hyperuniformity imparts advantages in both transport efficiency and robustness. Specifically, we show that HuPPI networks have systematically smaller total effective resistances, slightly faster random-walk mixing times, and fewer extreme-curvature edges than PoPPI networks. Counterintuitively, we also find that HuPPI networks simultaneously have more negative mean Ollivier--Ricci curvatures and smaller global resistances than PoPPI networks, indicating that edges with moderately negative curvatures need not create severe bottlenecks to transport. We also demonstrate that the network-generation method strongly influences these properties and in particular that it often overshadows differences that arise from underlying point patterns. These results collectively demonstrate potential advantages of hyperuniformity in network design and motivate further theoretical and experimental exploration of HuPPI networks.</description>

Abstract: Classical spectral graph theory characterizes graphs with logarithmic mixing time. In this work, we present a combinatorial characterization of graphs with constant mixing time. The combinatorial characterization is based on the small-set bipartite density condition, which is weaker than having near-optimal spectral radius and is stronger than having near-optimal small-set vertex expansion.</description>

Abstract: Motzkin and Taussky (and independently, Gerstenhaber) proved that the unital algebra generated by a pair of commuting $d\times d$ matrices over a field has dimension at most $d$. Since then, it has remained an open problem to determine whether the analogous statement is true for triples of matrices which pairwise commute. We answer this question for combinatorially-motivated classes of such triples.</description>

      <title>Interactive Proofs For Distribution Testing With Conditional Oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the framework of interactive proofs for distribution testing, first introduced by Chiesa and Gur (ITCS 2018), which has recently experienced a surge in interest, accompanied by notable progress (e.g., Herman and Rothblum, STOC 2022, FOCS 2023; Herman, RANDOM~2024). In this model, a data-poor verifier determines whether a probability distribution has a property of interest by interacting with an all-powerful, data-rich but untrusted prover bent on convincing them that it has the property. While prior work gave sample-, time-, and communication-efficient protocols for testing and estimating a range of distribution properties, they all suffer from an inherent issue: for most interesting properties of distributions over a domain of size $N$, the verifier must draw at least $\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ samples of its own. While sublinear in $N$, this is still prohibitive for large domains encountered in practice.
  In this work, we circumvent this limitation by augmenting the verifier with the ability to perform an exponentially smaller number of more powerful (but reasonable) \emph{pairwise conditional} queries, effectively enabling them to perform ``local comparison checks'' of the prover's claims. We systematically investigate the landscape of interactive proofs in this new setting, giving polylogarithmic query and sample protocols for (tolerantly) testing all \emph{label-invariant} properties, thus demonstrating exponential savings without compromising on communication, for this large and fundamental class of testing tasks.</description>

      <title>Switching rook polynomial of collections of cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the novel connection between rook placements on collections of cells, also known as pruned chessboards, and the algebraic properties of ideals generated by $2$-minors. We design an algorithm to compute the switching rook polynomial of a collection of cells and show that it coincides with the $h$-polynomial of the associated coordinate ring for all collections up to rank 10 and polyominoes up to rank 12. Motivated by this evidence, we conjecture that the correspondence holds in general, and we prove it for certain convex collections of cells by algebraic tools.</description>

      <title>Posets of decompositions in spherical buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose definitions of the common bases complex, the poset of decompositions, and the poset of partial decompositions for arbitrary spherical buildings. We show that the poset of decompositions is Cohen-Macaulay, and that the poset of partial decompositions is spherical and homotopy equivalent to the common bases complex. To prove these results, we rely on the concepts of opposition, Levi spheres, and convexity in buildings.
  In particular, our results extend the already known constructions for the linear case (vector spaces) to arbitrary buildings. As a byproduct, we see that the poset of ordered partial decompositions carries the square of the Steinberg representation.</description>

      <title>Improved exploration of temporal graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A temporal graph $G$ is a sequence $(G_t)_{t \in I}$ of graphs on the same vertex set of size $n$. The \emph{temporal exploration problem} asks for the length of the shortest sequence of vertices that starts at a given vertex, visits every vertex, and at each time step $t$ either stays at the current vertex or moves to an adjacent vertex in $G_t$. Bounds on the length of a shortest temporal exploration have been investigated extensively. Perhaps the most fundamental case is when each graph $G_t$ is connected and has bounded maximum degree. In this setting, Erlebach, Kammer, Luo, Sajenko, and Spooner [ICALP 2019] showed that there exists an exploration of $G$ in $\mathcal{O}(n^{7/4})$ time steps. We significantly improve this bound by showing that $\mathcal{O}(n^{3/2} \sqrt{\log n})$ time steps suffice.
  In fact, we deduce this result from a much more general statement. Let the \emph{average temporal maximum degree} $D$ of $G$ be the average of $\max_{t \in I} d_{G_t}(v)$ over all vertices $v \in V(G)$, where $d_{G_t}(v)$ denotes the degree of $v$ in $G_t$. If each graph $G_t$ is connected, we show that there exists an exploration of $G$ in $\mathcal{O}(n^{3/2} \sqrt{D \log n})$ time steps. In particular, this gives the first subquadratic upper bound when the underlying graph has bounded average degree. As a special case, this also improves the previous best bounds when the underlying graph is planar or has bounded treewidth and provides a unified approach for all of these settings. Our bound is subquadratic already when $D=o(n/\log n)$.</description>

      <title>Barile-Macchia Resolutions and the closed neighborhood ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the minimal free resolutions of closed neighborhood ideals of graphs within the framework of Barile-Macchia (BM) resolutions. We show that for any tree $T$, the closed neighborhood ideal $NI(T)$ is bridge-friendly, and hence its BM resolution is minimal. The combinatorial structure of trees further allows us to construct a maximal critical cell of size $\alpha(T)$, leading to the equality $\mathrm{pdim}(R/NI(T)) = \alpha(T)$, where $\alpha(T)$ denotes the independence number of $T$ and $\mathrm{pdim}$ is the projective dimension. Using Betti splitting techniques, we also obtain explicit formulas for the graded Betti numbers of $NI(P_n)$, where $P_n$ is the path graph on $n$ vertices. Finally, we make some observations on the bridge-friendly condition of the closed neighborhood ideals of chordal and bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the sequence length sufficient to reconstruct level-1 phylogenetic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees and networks are graphs used to model evolutionary relationships, with trees representing strictly branching histories and networks allowing for events in which lineages merge, called reticulation events. While the question of data sufficiency has been studied extensively in the context of trees, it remains largely unexplored for networks. In this work we take a first step in this direction by establishing bounds on the amount of genomic data required to reconstruct binary level-$1$ semi-directed phylogenetic networks, which are binary networks in which reticulation events are indicated by directed edges, all other edges are undirected, and cycles are vertex-disjoint. For this class, methods have been developed recently that are statistically consistent. Roughly speaking, such methods are guaranteed to reconstruct the correct network assuming infinitely long genomic sequences. Here we consider the question whether networks from this class can be uniquely and correctly reconstructed from finite sequences. Specifically, we present an inference algorithm that takes as input genetic sequence data, and demonstrate that the sequence length sufficient to reconstruct the correct network with high probability, under the Cavender-Farris-Neyman model of evolution, scales logarithmically, polynomially, or polylogarithmically with the number of taxa, depending on the parameter regime. As part of our contribution, we also present novel inference rules for quartet data in the semi-directed phylogenetic network setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polyomino ideals, defined as the ideals generated by the inner $2$-minors of a polyomino, are a class of binomial ideals whose algebraic properties are closely related to the combinatorial structure of the underlying polyomino. We provide a unified account of recent advances on two central themes: the characterization of prime polyomino ideals and the emerging connection between the Hilbert-Poincar\'e series and Gorensteinness of $K[\mathcal{P}]$ with the classical rook theory. Some further related properties, as radicality, primary decomposition, and levelness are discussed, and a \textit{Macaulay2} package, namely \texttt{PolyominoIdeals}, is also presented.</description>

      <title>The spherical growth series of amalgamated free products of infinite cyclic groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $n$ be an integer greater than $1$. We consider a group presented as $G(p_1,p_2,\dots,p_n)=\langle x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n \mid x_1^{p_1} =x_2^{p_2}=\cdots =x_n^{p_n} \rangle$, with integers $p_1,p_2,\dots,p_n$ satisfying $2 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq \cdots \leq p_n$. This group is an amalgamated free product of infinite cyclic groups and is geometrically realized as the fundamental group of a Seifert fiber space over the 2-dimensional disk with $n$ cone points whose associated cone angles are $\frac{2\pi}{p_1},\frac{2\pi}{p_2},\dots,\frac{2\pi}{p_n}$. In this paper, we present a formula for the spherical growth series of the group $G(p_1,\dots,p_n)$ with respect to the generating set $\{x_1,\dots,x_n,x_1^{-1},\dots,x_n^{-1}\}$. We show that from this formula, a rational function expression for the spherical growth series of $G(p_1,\dots,p_n)$ can be derived in concrete form for given $p_1,\dots,p_n$. In fact, we wrote an elementary computer program based on this formula that yields an explicit form of a single rational fraction expression for the spherical growth series of $G(p_1,\dots,p_n)$. We present such expressions for several tuples $(p_1,\dots,p_n)$. In 1999, C. P. Gill obtained a similar formula for the same group in the case $n=2$ and showed that there exists a rational function expression for the spherical growth series of $G(p_1,\dots,p_n)$ for $n \geq 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study rooted products of graphs from the perspective of combinatorial commutative algebra. For edge ideals, we introduce the 2-Cohen-Macaulayness with respect to a vertex and use it to investigate when edge ideals of rooted products of graphs are Cohen-Macaulay. Moreover, we completely determine when attaching a graph on at most six vertices to a given graph as rooted products, yields a Cohen-Macaulay edge ideal. Also, we define mulit-clique corona graphs as a generalization of clique-corona graphs and multi-whisker graphs. We prove that multi-clique corona graphs are vertex decomposable and hence sequentially Cohen-Macaulay. Also, we give formulas for the projective dimension and the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity.</description>

Abstract: We prove that one variable equations in the lamplighter group $\MZ_2\wr \MZ$ are decidable and describe an algorithm for solving such equations. The algorithm has super-exponential time complexity in the worst case. We also show that, for most equations, decidability can be determined in nearly quadratic time; that is, the problem admits a nearly quadratic-time solution in the generic case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine ordered graphs, defined as graphs with linearly ordered vertices, from the perspective of homomorphisms (and colorings) and their complexities. We demonstrate the corresponding computational and parameterized complexities, along with algorithms associated with related problems. These questions are interesting, and we show that numerous problems lead to various complexities. The reduction from homomorphisms of unordered structures to homomorphisms of ordered graphs is proved, achieved with the use of ordered bipartite graphs. We then determine the NP-completeness of the problem of finding ordered homomorphisms of ordered graphs and the XP and W[1]-hard nature of this problem parameterized by the number of vertices of the image ordered graph. Classes of ordered graphs for which this problem can be solved in polynomial time are also presented.</description>

      <title>On Computational Aspects of Ordered Matching Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ordered matchings, defined as graphs with linearly ordered vertices, where each vertex is connected to exactly one edge, play a crucial role in the area of ordered graphs and their homomorphisms. Therefore, we consider related problems from the complexity point of view and determine their corresponding computational and parameterized complexities. We show that the subgraph of ordered matchings problem is NP-complete and we prove that the problem of finding ordered homomorphisms between ordered matchings is NP-complete as well, implying NP-completeness of more generic problems. In parameterized complexity setting, we consider a natural choice of parameter - a number of vertices of the image ordered graph. We show that in contrast to the complexity context, finding homomorphisms if the image ordered graph is an ordered matching, this problem parameterized by the number of vertices of the image ordered graph is FPT, which is known to be W[1]-hard for the general problem. We also determine that the problem of core for ordered matchings is solvable in polynomial time which is again in contrast to the NP-completeness of the general problem. We provide several algorithms and generalize some of these problems into ordered graphs with colored edges.</description>

      <title>On Computational Aspects of Cores of Ordered Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An ordered graph is a graph enhanced with a linear order on the vertex set. An ordered graph is a core if it does not have an order-preserving homomorphism to a proper subgraph. We say that $H$ is the core of $G$ if (i) $H$ is a core, (ii) $H$ is a subgraph of $G$, and (iii) $G$ admits an order-preserving homomorphism to $H$. We study complexity aspects of several problems related to the cores of ordered graphs. Interestingly, they exhibit a different behavior than their unordered counterparts. We show that the retraction problem, i.e., deciding whether a given graph admits an ordered-preserving homomorphism to its specific subgraph, can be solved in polynomial time. On the other hand, it is \NP-hard to decide whether a given ordered graph is a core. In fact, we show that it is even \NP-hard to distinguish graphs $G$ whose core is largest possible (i.e., if $G$ is a core) from those, whose core is the smallest possible, i.e., its size is equal to the ordered chromatic number of $G$. The problem is even \wone-hard with respect to the latter parameter.</description>

Abstract: Determining the complexity of colouring ($4K_1, C_4$)-free graph is a long open problem. Recently Penev showed that there is a polynomial-time algorithm to colour a ($4K_1, C_4, C_6$)-free graph. In this paper, we will prove that if $G$ is a ($4K_1, C_4, P_6$)-free graph that contains a $C_6$, then $G$ has bounded clique-width. To this purpose, we use a new method to bound the clique-width, that is of independent interest. As a consequence, there is a polynomial-time algorithm to colour ($4K_1, C_4, P_6$)-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Decoding Trombetti-Zhou codes: a new syndrome-based decoding approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2019, Trombetti and Zhou introduced a new family of $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$-linear Maximum Rank Distance (MRD) codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q^{2n}}$. For such codes we propose a new syndrome-based decoding algorithm. It is well known that a syndrome-based decoding approach relies heavily on a parity-check matrix of a linear code. Nonetheless, Trombetti-Zhou codes are not linear over the entire field $\mathbb{F}_{q^{2n}}$, but only over its subfield $\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}$. Due to this lack of linearity, we introduce the notions of $\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}$-generator matrix and $\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}$-parity-check matrix for a generic $\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}$-linear rank-metric code over $\mathbb{F}_{q^{rn}}$ in analogy with the roles that generator and parity-check matrices play in the context of linear codes. Accordingly, we present an $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$-generator matrix and $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$-parity-check matrix for Trombetti-Zhou codes as evaluation codes over an $\mathbb{F}_q$-basis of $\mathbb{F}_{q^{2n}}$. This relies on the choice of a particular basis called \emph{trace almost dual basis}. Subsequently, denoting by $d$ the minimum distance of the code, we show that if the rank weight $t$ of the error vector is strictly smaller than $\frac{d-1}{2}$, the syndrome-based decoding of Trombetti-Zhou codes can be converted to the decoding of Gabidulin codes of dimension one larger. On the other hand, when $t=\frac{d-1}{2}$, we reduce the decoding to determining the rank of a certain matrix. The complexity of the proposed decoding for Trombetti-Zhou codes is also discussed.</description>

      <title>On a kind of generilized multi-harmonic sums</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime, Jianqiang Zhao has established a curious congruence, which is $$
  \sum_{i+j+k=p \atop i,j,k &gt; 0} \frac{1}{ijk} \equiv -2B_{p-3}\pmod p , $$ where $B_{n}$ denotes the $n$-th Bernoulli number. In this paper, we will generalize this kind of sums and prove a family of similar congruences modulo prime powers $p^r$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Polymorphisms and Commutativity Gadgets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of quantum polymorphisms to the complexity theory of non-local games. We use this notion to give a full characterisation of the existence of commutativity gadgets for relational structures, introduced by Ji as a method for achieving quantum soundness of classical CSP reductions. Prior to our work, a classification was only known in the Boolean case [Culf--Mastel, STOC'25]. As an application of our framework, we prove that the entangled CSP parameterised by odd cycles is undecidable. Furthermore, we establish a quantum version of Galois connection for entangled CSPs in the case of non-oracular quantum homomorphisms.</description>

Abstract: We prove a no-dimensional Helly theorem for affine spaces and convex sets using the unboundedness framework of Aronov, Goodman, and Pollack (Computational Geometry, 2002). This generalizes the fundamental result of Adiprasito, B\'ar\'any, Mustafa, and Terpai on the no-dimensional Helly theorem for points and convex sets (Discrete &amp; Computational Geometry, 2020). Additionally, we establish the optimality of our result.</description>

      <title>On a radial projection conjecture and pinned directions in finite spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give upper bounds on the number of exceptional radial projections of arbitrary subsets of vector spaces over finite fields. Our bounds do not depend on the dimension of the ambient space.
  Let $\mathbb{F}_q^d$ be the $d$-dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{F}_q$, let $k \in \{1,2,\ldots,d-1\}$, and let $E \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^d$ be an arbitrary set of points. We prove two results. First, if $q^{k-1} &lt; |E| \leq 100^{-1}q^{k}$, then the number of points $y$ such that the projection of $E$ from $y$ contains fewer than $50^{-1}|E|$ points is bounded above by $40q^k$. This establishes a conjecture of Lund, Pham, and Thu. Second, if $30q^{k} \leq |E| \leq q^{k+1}$, then the number of points $y$ such that the projection of $E$ from $y$ contains fewer than $M \leq 4^{-1}q^k$ points is bounded above by $300q^kM|E|^{-1}$. We also have an application to a pinned directions problem. Specifically, if $E\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$ with $|E| &gt; 30q^k$, then there is a point $y \in E$ such that the set of lines incident to $y$ and at least one other point of $E$ determines $q^k/4$ distinct slopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an upper bound on the number of exceptional orthogonal projections of a small set of points in a plane over a prime order field, which makes progress toward a conjecture of Chen (2018). This theorem relies on a new upper bound on the number of incidences between an arbitrary set of points and a set of lines pointing in a reasonably small number of distinct directions. We also prove a new upper bound on the number of incidences between points and lines when both are Cartesian products in an appropriate sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit some combinatorial and information-theoretic extension techniques for detecting non-algebraic matroids. These are the Dress-Lov\'asz and Ahlswede-K\"orner extension properties. We provide optimizations of these techniques to reduce their computational complexity, finding new non-algebraic matroids on 9 and 10 points. In addition, we use the Ahlswede-K\"orner extension property to find better lower bounds on the information ratio of secret sharing schemes for ports of non-algebraic matroids.</description>

      <title>Blowups of triangle-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A highly influential result of Nikiforov states that if an $n$-vertex graph $G$ contains at least $\gamma n^h$ copies of a fixed $h$-vertex graph $H$, then $G$ contains a blowup of $H$ of order $\Omega_{\gamma,H}(\log n)$. While the dependence on $n$ is optimal, the correct dependence on $\gamma$ is unknown; all known proofs yield bounds that are polynomial in $\gamma$, but the best known upper bound, coming from random graphs, is only logarithmic in $\gamma$. It is a major open problem to narrow this gap. We prove that if $H$ is triangle-free, then the logarithmic behavior of the upper bound is the truth. That is, under the assumptions above, $G$ contains a blowup of $H$ of order $\Omega_H (\log n/{\log(1/\gamma)})$. This is the first non-trivial instance where the optimal dependence in Nikiforov's theorem is known. As a consequence, we also prove an upper bound on multicolor Ramsey numbers of blowups of triangle-free graphs, proving that the dependence on the number of colors is polynomial once the blowup is sufficiently large. This shows that, from the perspective of multicolor Ramsey numbers, blowups of fixed triangle-free graphs behave like bipartite graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conditional independence (CI) relation of a distribution in a max-linear Bayesian network depends on its weight matrix through the $C^\ast$-separation criterion. These CI~models, which we call maxoids, are compositional graphoids which are in general not representable by Gaussian random variables. We prove that every maxoid can be obtained from a transitively closed weighted DAG and show that the stratification of generic weight matrices by their maxoids yields a polyhedral~fan. We also use this connection to polyhedral geometry to develop an algorithm for solving the conditional independence implication problem for maxoids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trades are important objects in combinatorial design theory that may be realized as certain elements of kernels of inclusion matrices. Total trades were introduced recently by Ghorbani, Kamali and Khosravshahi, who showed that over a field of characteristic zero the vector space of trades decomposes into a direct sum of spaces of total trades. In this paper, we show that the vector space spanned by the permutations of a total trade is an irreducible representation of the symmetric group. As a corollary, the previous decomposition theorem is recovered. Also, a basis is obtained for the module of total trades in the spirit of Specht polynomials. More generally, in the second part of the paper we consider intersection matrices and determine the irreducible decompositions of their images. This generalizes previously known results concerning ranks of special cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the sign patterns of coefficients in the Ehrhart polynomial of the Cartesian product between the $r$-th pyramid over the Reeve tetrahedron and the hypercube $[0, n]^n$. This investigation yields partial results on the sign pattern problem for Ehrhart polynomials. Moreover, we show that for each dimension $d \geq 4$, there exists a $d$-dimensional integral polytope $\mathcal{P}$ such that arbitrarily many of the low-degree coefficients in the Ehrhart polynomial $i(\mathcal{P}, t)$ are negative, while all higher-degree coefficients are positive. Finally, we establish five embedding theorems that enable the sign pattern of a lower-dimensional integral polytope to be embedded into a higher-dimensional integral polytope in various ways. As an application, we completely resolve the Ehrhart coefficient sign pattern problem for dimensions $d = 7, 8, 9$.</description>

Similar to how a transitive group action produces a Schurian classical association scheme, a two-transitive group action produces an AST.

Abstract: We study a transport phenomenon in certain coined quantum walks where a subspace of states localized at a vertex gets transferred to another vertex. We first develop characterizations for perfect and pretty good subspace state transfer using the spectral properties of a Hermitian weighted digraph obtained from the underlying graph. We then provide a polynomial-time algorithm that tests whether pointwise perfect subspace state transfer occurs at an integer step, given that the subspace and coins are rational. Finally, we construct several infinite families of examples that admit pointwise perfect $d$-dimensional subspace state transfer where $d\ge 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish several independent results concerning extremal, left modular, congruence uniform, and semidistributive lattices. An equivalent characterization of left modular lattices is obtained in terms of edge-labellings, together with necessary and sufficient conditions on the doubling steps in the construction of congruence normal lattices that ensure left modularity or extremality. We prove that a congruence uniform lattice is shellable if and only if it is extremal. We answer a question of Barnard by constructing a counterexample showing that an induced subcomplex of a canonical join complex need not itself be such a complex. Finally, we show that the order dimension of a semidistributive extremal lattice equals the chromatic number of the complement of its Galois graph, generalizing a theorem of Dilworth for distributive lattices. As an application, we determine the dimensions of generalizations of the Hochschild lattice, of the parabolic Tamari lattice, and of some lattices of torsion classes.</description>

      <title>Odd and even cycle lengths, minimum degree and chromatic number in graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove similar results for odd and even cycle lengths. Let $L_o(G)$ denote the set of odd cycle lengths of $G$ and $\ell_o(G)$ denote the longest odd cycle length. In 1992, Gy\'arf\'as proved that $\chi(G)\leq 2|L_o(G)|+2$, and if $w(G)\leq 2|L_o(G)|+1$, then $\chi(G)\leq 2|L_o(G)|+1$. We first prove that if $G$ is a 2-connected non-bipartite graph with $\delta(G)\geq 2k$, then $|L_o(G)|\geq k$. Moreover, if $|L_o(G)|=k$, then $2|L_o(G)|+1=\ell_o(G)$, and either $K_{2k+1}\subseteq G$ or $\chi(G)\leq 2k$. Applying this result, we prove that if $w(G)\leq 2|L_o(G)|$, then $\chi(G)\leq 2|L_o(G)|$ for $|L_o(G)|\geq 2$, improving the result of Gy\'arf\'as. We also construct a class of graphs with $w(G)=2|L_o(G)|-1$ but $\chi(G)=2|L_o(G)|$ for every $|L_o(G)|\geq 2$. Using our result, we give a short proof of a similar result of $\chi(G)$ and $\ell_o(G)$ proved by Kenkre and Vishwanathan.
  Our second part is about even cycle lengths. Let $L_e(G)$ denote the set of even cycle lengths of $G$ and $\ell_e(G)$ denote the longest even cycle length. In 2004, Mih\'ok and Schiermeyer proved that $\chi(G)\leq 2|L_e(G)|+3$, and if $w(G)\leq 2|L_e(G)|+2$, then $\chi(G)\leq 2|L_e(G)|+2$. We first prove that if $G$ is a 2-connected graph with $\delta(G)\geq 2k+1$, then $|L_e(G)|\geq k$. Moreover, if $|L_e(G)|=k$, then $2|L_e(G)|+2=\ell_e(G)$, and either $K_{2k+2}\subseteq G$ or $\chi(G)\leq 2k+1$. Applying this result, we prove that if $w(G)\leq 2|L_e(G)|+1$, then $\chi(G)\leq 2|L_e(G)|+1$ for $|L_e(G)|\geq 2$, improving the result of Mih\'ok and Schiermeyer. We also construct a class of graphs with $w(G)=2|L_e(G)|$ but $\chi(G)=2|L_e(G)|+1$ for every $|L_e(G)|\geq 2$. Our result can deduce a similar result of $\chi(G)$ and $\ell_e(G)$.
  The above results also improve some results of consecutive odd or even cycle lengths.</description>

Abstract: Given a word $w$, what is the maximum possible number of appearances of $w$ reading contiguously along any of the directions in $\{-1, 0, 1\}^d \setminus \{\mathbf{0}\}$ in a large $d$-dimensional grid (as in a word search)? Patchell and Spiro first posed a version of this question, which Alon and Kravitz completely answered for a large class of "well-behaved" words, including those with no repeated letters. We study the general case, which exhibits greater variety and is often more complicated (even for $d=1$). We also discuss some connections to other problems in combinatorics, including the storied $n$-queens problem.</description>

      <title>Toric ideal of matching polytopes and edge colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we investigate the maximal degree of minimal generators of the toric ideal of the matching polytope of a graph. It is known that the toric ideal associated to a bipartite graph is generated by binomials of degree at most $3$. We show that this fact is equivalent to a result in the theory of edge colorings of bipartite multigraphs. Moreover, a characterization of bipartite graphs whose toric ideals are generated by quadratic binomials is given. Finally, we discuss the maximal degree of minimal generators of the toric ideal associated to a general graph and give a conjecture.</description>

      <title>Functional Central Limit Theorem for the simultaneous subgraph count of dynamic Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a dynamic Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph with independent identically distributed edge processes. Our aim is to describe the joint evolution of the entries of a subgraph count vector. The main result of this paper is a functional central limit theorem: we establish, under an appropriate centering and scaling, the joint functional convergence of the vector of subgraph counts to a specific multidimensional Gaussian process. The result holds under mild assumptions on the edge processes, most notably a Lipschitz-type condition.</description>

      <title>Treewidth of Outer $k$-Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Treewidth is an important structural graph parameter that quantifies how closely a graph resembles a tree-like structure. It has applications in many algorithmic and combinatorial problems. In this paper, we study the treewidth of outer $k$-planar graphs, that is, graphs admitting a convex drawing (a straight-line drawing where all vertices lie on a circle) in which every edge crosses at most $k$ other edges. We also consider the more general class of outer min-$k$-planar graphs, which are graphs admitting a convex drawing where for every crossing of two edges at least one of these edges is crossed at most $k$ times.
  Firman, Gutowski, Kryven, Okada and Wolff [GD 2024] proved that every outer $k$-planar graph has treewidth at most $1.5k+2$ and provided a lower bound of $k+2$ for even $k$. We establish a lower bound of $1.5k+0.5$ for every odd $k$. Additionally, they showed that every outer min-$k$-planar graph has treewidth at most $3k+1$. We improve this upper bound to $3 \cdot \lfloor k/2 \rfloor+4$.
  Our approach also allows us to upper bound the separation number, a parameter closely related to treewidth, of outer min-$k$-planar graphs by $2 \cdot \lfloor k/2 \rfloor+4$. This improves upon the previous bound of $2k+1$ and achieves a bound with an optimal multiplicative constant.</description>
