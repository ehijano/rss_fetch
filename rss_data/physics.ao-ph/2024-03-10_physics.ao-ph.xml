      <title>A Neural Network-Based Submesoscale Vertical Heat Flux Parameterization and Its Implementation in Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Submesoscale processes, with spatio-temporal scales of O(0.01-10) km and hours to 1 day which are hardly resolved by current ocean models, are important sub-grid processes in ocean models. Due to the strong vertical currents, submesoscale processes can lead to submesoscale vertical heat flux (SVHF) in the upper ocean which plays a crucial role in the heat exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean interior, and further modulates the global heat redistribution. At present, simulating a submesoscale-resolving ocean model is still expensive and time-consuming. Parameterizing SVHF becomes a feasible alternative by introducing it into coarse-resolution models. Traditionally, researchers tend to parameterize SVHF by a mathematically fitted relationship based on one or two key background state variables, which fail to represent the relationship between SVHF and the background state variables comprehensively. In this study, we propose a data-driven SVHF parameterization scheme based on a deep neural network and implement it into the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). In offline tests, our scheme can accurately calculate SVHF using mesoscale-averaged variables and characterize how it varies with depth. In online tests, we simulate an idealized model of an anticyclonic mesoscale eddy and a realistic model of the Gulf Stream, respectively. Compared to the coarse-resolution cases without the SVHF effect, the coarse-resolution cases with the SVHF scheme tend to reproduce results closer to the high-resolution case and the observational state in terms of the temperature structure and mixed layer depth, indicating a good performance of the neural network-based SVHF scheme. Our results show the potential of applying the neural network in parameterizing sub-grid processes in ocean models.</description>

      <title>Storm Surge Modeling in the AI ERA: Using LSTM-based Machine Learning for Enhancing Forecasting Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics simulation results of natural processes usually do not fully capture the real world. This is caused for instance by limits in what physical processes are simulated and to what accuracy. In this work we propose and analyze the use of an LSTM-based deep learning network machine learning (ML) architecture for capturing and predicting the behavior of the systemic error for storm surge forecast models with respect to real-world water height observations from gauge stations during hurricane events. The overall goal of this work is to predict the systemic error of the physics model and use it to improve the accuracy of the simulation results post factum. We trained our proposed ML model on a dataset of 61 historical storms in the coastal regions of the U.S. and we tested its performance in bias correcting modeled water level data predictions from hurricane Ian (2022). We show that our model can consistently improve the forecasting accuracy for hurricane Ian -- unknown to the ML model -- at all gauge station coordinates used for the initial data. Moreover, by examining the impact of using different subsets of the initial training dataset, containing a number of relatively similar or different hurricanes in terms of hurricane track, we found that we can obtain similar quality of bias correction by only using a subset of six hurricanes. This is an important result that implies the possibility to apply a pre-trained ML model to real-time hurricane forecasting results with the goal of bias correcting and improving the produced simulation accuracy. The presented work is an important first step in creating a bias correction system for real-time storm surge forecasting applicable to the full simulation area. It also presents a highly transferable and operationally applicable methodology for improving the accuracy in a wide range of physics simulation scenarios beyond storm surge forecasting.</description>

      <title>Lee-Wave Energy Sinks in Bottom-Intensified Flow: Reabsorption, Dissipation and Nonlinear Spectral Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Idealized numerical simulation is used to explore energy sinks for lee waves trapped in their bottom-intensified generating flow. In addition to the loss to explicit dissipation and reabsorption predicted by linear wave action conservation, indirect dissipation due to a nonlinear forward cascade by parametric subharmonic instability represents a significant sink that substantially reduces reabsorption. The partition of lee-wave energy loss between reabsorption and (explicit plus indirect) dissipation is independent of subgridscale damping parameterization. Remote dissipation of freely propagating internal waves generated by shear instability at the lee-wave critical layer proves to be small. A general parameterization for lee-wave dissipation of the balanced flow requires a more complete exploration of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Langmuir turbulence in suspended kelp farms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of suspended kelp farms on ocean mixed layer hydrodynamics in the presence of currents and waves. We use the large eddy simulation method, where the wave effect is incorporated by solving the wave-averaged equations. Distinct Langmuir circulation patterns are generated within various suspended farm configurations, including horizontally uniform kelp blocks and spaced kelp rows. Intensified turbulence arises from the farm-generated Langmuir circulation, as opposed to the standard Langmuir turbulence observed without a farm. The creation of Langmuir circulation within the farm is attributed to two primary factors depending on farm configuration: (1) enhanced vertical shear due to kelp frond area density variability, and (2) enhanced lateral shear due to canopy discontinuity at lateral edges of spaced rows. Both enhanced vertical and lateral shear of streamwise velocity, representing the lateral and vertical vorticity components respectively, can be tilted into downstream vorticity to create Langmuir circulation. This vorticity tilting is driven by the Craik- Leibovich vortex force associated with the Stokes drift of surface gravity waves. In addition to the farm-generated Langmuir turbulence, canopy shear layer turbulence is created at the farm bottom edge due to drag discontinuity. The intensity of different types of turbulence depends on both kelp frond area density and the geometric configuration of the farm. The farm-generated turbulence has substantial consequences for nutrient supply and kelp growth. These findings also underscore the significance of the presence of obstacle structures in modifying ocean mixed layer characteristics.</description>

      <title>Neural General Circulation Models for Weather and Climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07222v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General circulation models (GCMs) are the foundation of weather and climate prediction. GCMs are physics-based simulators which combine a numerical solver for large-scale dynamics with tuned representations for small-scale processes such as cloud formation. Recently, machine learning (ML) models trained on reanalysis data achieved comparable or better skill than GCMs for deterministic weather forecasting. However, these models have not demonstrated improved ensemble forecasts, or shown sufficient stability for long-term weather and climate simulations. Here we present the first GCM that combines a differentiable solver for atmospheric dynamics with ML components, and show that it can generate forecasts of deterministic weather, ensemble weather and climate on par with the best ML and physics-based methods. NeuralGCM is competitive with ML models for 1-10 day forecasts, and with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ensemble prediction for 1-15 day forecasts. With prescribed sea surface temperature, NeuralGCM can accurately track climate metrics such as global mean temperature for multiple decades, and climate forecasts with 140 km resolution exhibit emergent phenomena such as realistic frequency and trajectories of tropical cyclones. For both weather and climate, our approach offers orders of magnitude computational savings over conventional GCMs. Our results show that end-to-end deep learning is compatible with tasks performed by conventional GCMs, and can enhance the large-scale physical simulations that are essential for understanding and predicting the Earth system.</description>

      <title>Beyond Ensemble Averages: Leveraging Climate Model Ensembles for Subseasonal Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Producing high-quality forecasts of key climate variables, such as temperature and precipitation, on subseasonal time scales has long been a gap in operational forecasting. This study explores an application of machine learning (ML) models as post-processing tools for subseasonal forecasting. Lagged numerical ensemble forecasts (i.e., an ensemble where the members have different initial dates) and observational data, including relative humidity, pressure at sea level, and geopotential height, are incorporated into various ML methods to predict monthly average precipitation and two-meter temperature two weeks in advance for the continental United States. Regression, quantile regression, and tercile classification tasks using linear models, random forests, convolutional neural networks, and stacked models (a multi-model approach based on the prediction of the individual ML models) are considered. Unlike previous ML approaches that often use ensemble mean alone, we leverage information embedded in the ensemble forecasts to enhance prediction accuracy. Additionally, we investigate extreme event predictions that are crucial for planning and mitigation efforts. Considering ensemble members as a collection of spatial forecasts, we explore different approaches to address spatial variability. Trade-offs between different approaches may be mitigated with model stacking. Our proposed models outperform standard baselines such as climatological forecasts and ensemble means. This paper further includes an investigation of feature importance, trade-offs between using the full ensemble or only the ensemble mean, and different modes of accounting for spatial variability.</description>

      <title>Generative ensemble deep learning severe weather prediction from a deterministic convection-allowing model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An ensemble post-processing method is developed for the probabilistic prediction of severe weather (tornadoes, hail, and wind gusts) over the conterminous United States (CONUS). The method combines conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs), a type of deep generative model, with a convolutional neural network (CNN) to post-process convection-allowing model (CAM) forecasts. The CGANs are designed to create synthetic ensemble members from deterministic CAM forecasts, and their outputs are processed by the CNN to estimate the probability of severe weather. The method is tested using High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) 1--24 hr forecasts as inputs and Storm Prediction Center (SPC) severe weather reports as targets. The method produced skillful predictions with up to 20% Brier Skill Score (BSS) increases compared to other neural-network-based reference methods using a testing dataset of HRRR forecasts in 2021. For the evaluation of uncertainty quantification, the method is overconfident but produces meaningful ensemble spreads that can distinguish good and bad forecasts. The quality of CGAN outputs is also evaluated. Results show that the CGAN outputs behave similarly to a numerical ensemble; they preserved the inter-variable correlations and the contribution of influential predictors as in the original HRRR forecasts. This work provides a novel approach to post-process CAM output using neural networks that can be applied to severe weather prediction.</description>
