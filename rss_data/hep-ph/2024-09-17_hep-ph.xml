      <title>Fermion masses and mixings in the supersymmetric Pati-Salam landscape from Intersecting D6-Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the complete landscape of three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from intersecting D6-branes on a type IIA $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2)$ orientifold has been enumerated consisting of 33 independent models with distinct gauge coupling relations at the string scale. Here, we study the phenomenology of all such models by providing the detailed particle spectra and the analysis of the possible 3-point and the 4-point Yukawa interactions in order to accommodate all standard-model fermion masses and mixings. We find that only 17 models contain viable Yukawa textures to explain quarks masses, charged-leptons' masses, neutrino-masses, quarks' mixings and leptons' mixings. These viable models split into four classes, viz. a single model with 3 Higgs fields from the bulk and sixteen models with either 6, 9 or 12 Higgs from the $\mathcal{N}=2$ sector. The models perform successively better with the increasing number of Higgs pairs. Remarkably, the class of models with 12 Higgs naturally predicts the Dirac-type neutrino masses in normal ordering consistent with both the experimental constraints as well as the bounds from the swampland program.</description>

      <title>Hot Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a class of leptogenesis scenarios in which the sector containing the lightest right-handed neutrino establishes kinetic equilibrium at a temperature $T_{N_1} &gt; T_\text{SM}$, where $T_\text{SM}$ is the temperature of the Standard Model sector. We study the reheating processes which realise this "hot leptogenesis" and the conditions under which kinetic and chemical equilibrium can be maintained. We derive and solve two sets of evolution equations, depending on the presence of chemical equilibrium within the hot sector, and numerically solve these for benchmark scenarios. We compare the viable parameter space of this model with standard leptogenesis scenarios with a thermal initial condition and find that hot leptogenesis resolves the neutrino and Higgs mass fine-tuning problems present in the standard scenario.</description>

      <title>The Large Magellanic Cloud: expanding the low-mass parameter space of dark matter direct detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) impacts the predicted signals in near-future direct detection experiments for non-standard dark matter (DM) interactions, using the Auriga cosmological simulations. We extract the local DM distribution of a simulated Milky Way-like halo that has an LMC analogue and study the expected signals in DarkSide-20k, SBC, DARWIN/XLZD, SuperCDMS, NEWS-G, and DarkSPHERE considering DM-nucleon effective interactions, as well as inelastic DM scattering. We find that the LMC causes substantial shifts in direct detection exclusion limits towards smaller cross sections and DM masses for all non-relativistic effective field theory (NREFT) operators, with the impact being highly pronounced for velocity-dependent operators at low DM masses. For inelastic DM, where the DM particle up-scatters to a heavier state, the LMC shifts the direct detection exclusion limits towards larger DM mass splitting and smaller cross sections. Thus, we show that the LMC significantly expands the parameter space that can be probed by direct detection experiments towards smaller DM-nucleon cross sections for all NREFT operators and larger values of mass splitting for inelastic DM.</description>

      <title>A Closer Look at Dark Vector Splitting Functions in Proton Bremsstrahlung</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High luminosity colliders and fixed target facilities using proton beams are sensitive to new weakly coupled degrees of freedom across a broad mass range. Among the various production modes, bremsstrahlung is particularly important for dark sector degrees of freedom with masses between 0.5 and 2.0 GeV, due to mixing with hadronic resonances. In this paper, we revisit the calculation of dark vector production via initial state radiation in non-single diffractive scattering, using an improved treatment of the splitting functions and timelike electromagnetic form-factors. The approach is benchmarked by applying an analogous calculation to model inclusive $\rho$-meson production, indicating consistency with data from NA27 in the relevant kinematic range.</description>

      <title>EW corrections and Heavy Boson Radiation at a high-energy muon collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate several phenomenological and technical aspects related to electroweak (EW) corrections at a high-energy muon collider, focusing on direct production processes (no VBF configurations). We study in detail the accuracy of the Sudakov approximation, in particular the Denner-Pozzorini algorithm, comparing it with exact calculations at NLO EW accuracy. We also assess the relevance of resumming EW Sudakov logarithms (EWSL) at 3 and 10 TeV collisions. Furthermore, we scrutinise the impact of additional Heavy Boson Radiation (HBR), namely the weak emission of $W, Z$, and Higgs bosons in inclusive and semi-inclusive configurations. All results are obtained via the fully automated and publicly available code MadGraph5_aMC@NLO.</description>

      <title>Towards a unified description of hadron scattering at all energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of general amplitudes satisfying symmetries and $S$-matrix constraints has been the primary tool in studying the spectrum of hadrons for over half a century. In this work, we present a new parameterization, which can fulfill many expectations of $S$-matrix and Regge theory and connects the essential physics of hadron scattering in the resonance region and in asymptotic limits. In this construction, dynamical information is entirely contained in Regge trajectories that generalize resonance poles in the complex energy plane to moving poles in the angular momentum plane. We highlight the salient features of the model, compare with existing literature on dispersive and dual amplitudes, and benchmark the formalism with an initial numerical application to the $\rho$ and $\sigma/f_0(500)$ mesons in $\pi\pi$ scattering.</description>

      <title>N$^{\mathbf{3}}$LL + $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$ predictions of lepton-jet azimuthal angular distribution in deep-inelastic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of lepton-jet azimuthal decorrelation in deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (N$^{3}$LL) accuracy, combined with fixed-order corrections at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$. In this study, jets are defined in the lab frame using the anti-$k_T$ clustering algorithm and the winner-take-all recombination scheme. The N$^{3}$LL resummation results are derived from the transverse-momentum dependent factorization formula within the soft-collinear effective theory, while the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$ fixed-order matching distribution is calculated using the {\tt NLOJET++} event generator. The azimuthal decorrelation between the jet and electron serves as a critical probe of the three-dimensional structure of the nucleon. Our numerical predictions provide a robust framework for precision studies of QCD and the nucleon's internal structure through jet observables in DIS. These results are particularly significant for analyses involving jets in HERA data and the forthcoming electron-ion collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Tachyonic effects on K\"ahler moduli stabilized inflaton potential in type-IIB/F theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of inclusion of charged tachyonic open-string scalars in the perturbative and the non-perturbative K\"ahler moduli stabilizations in a geometry of three intersecting magnetized D7-brane stacks in type-IIB/F theory and also study the overall influence of this process on the inflaton potential, in a hybrid inflation scenario. We find that a tachyon lowers the minimum of the inflaton potential and assists to end the inflation. For simplicity, we have included one tachyon at a time in the present work and observe that this procedure preserves the features of slow-roll plateau of the potential. An interesting observation here is that the tachyonic part of the potential can be fine-tuned to get an almost zero minimum of the potential, thereby conforming to the small experimental value of the cosmological constant</description>

      <title>Study of quasi-two-body B^{0}\rightarrow T(\pi\pi, K\bar{K},\pi\eta) decays in perturbative QCD approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we calculate the CP-averaged branching ratios and the direct CP-violating asymmetries of the three body decays B^{0}\rightarrow T(\pi\pi, K\bar{K},\pi\eta) in the perturbative QCD (PQCD) approach, where T denotes tensor mesons a_{2}(1320), K^{*}_{2}(1430), f_{2}(1270) and f^{'}_{2}(1525), the daughter branching is f_{0}(980)\rightarrow \pi\pi, K\bar{K},f_{0}(500)\rightarrow \pi\pi, a_{0}(980)\rightarrow K\bar{K}, \pi\eta. By introducing two-meson distribution amplitudes parameterized by the time-like form factors, the three-body decay is simplified to quasi-two-body decay. Based on the two-quark structure, considering the effect of mixing angle \theta between f_{0}(980) and f_{0}(500), \phi between f_{2}(1270) and f^{'}_{2}(1525) on our calculations. We found that (a) Taking \theta=135^{\circ}, under the narrow-width approximation we extract the decays B^{0}\rightarrow K^{*}_{2}(1430)^{0}f_{0}(980) branching fractions is agree with the current experimental data well. (b) The decay rates for the considered decay modes are generally in the order of 10^{-8}$ to $10^{-5}. (c)The branching fractions are sensitive to the \theta, and the opposite is true for \phi. The \phi is really small, so the decay branching ratio only has little change, except for some decays involving f^{'}_{2}(1525). (d)The \theta and \phi can bring remarkable change to the direct CP asymmetries of pure penguin processes so that it is not 0. (e)We calculate the relative partial decay widths {\Gamma}(a_{0} \rightarrow K\overline{K})/{\Gamma}(a_{0} \rightarrow \pi\eta) and the ratio {\cal B}(f_{0} \rightarrow K^{+}K^{-})/{\cal B}(f_{0} \rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{-}), which are in agreement with the existing experimental values. Our results can help to understand the internal structure of scalar mesons and the nature of tensor mesons and be tested by future experiments.</description>

      <title>Heavy top quark mass in the minimal universal seesaw model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the hierarchy between $M_T, v_L$, and $v_R$, the relevant energy scales of the Minimal Universal Seesaw Model (MUSM), where the two lightest quark families remain massless at tree level. We also predict the heavy top quark mass, $m_{t'}$. We do some numerical analysis using recent experimental data. Our numerical analysis demonstrates that $M_T$ is sensitive to the values of the Yukawa couplings. The heavy top quark mass $(m_{t'})$ is predicted to be within the range from 1.4 TeV to 7.2 TeV.</description>

      <title>Insight into the nature of the $P_{c}(4457)$ and related pentaquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically study the electromagnetic properties of pentaquark states from different perspectives to better understand their nature, internal structure, and quantum numbers, determine their hadronization processes, and shed light on their true nature. The present study examines the magnetic moments of the $P_{c}(4457)$ and related hidden-charm pentaquark states with and without strangeness ($[d d][u c] \bar c$, $[u u][s c] \bar c$, $[dd ][s c] \bar c$, $[s s][u c] \bar c$ and $[s s][d c] \bar c$), employing a comprehensive analysis that encompasses both the compact pentaquark configuration and $J^P = \frac{3}{2}^-$ quantum numbers. The present study compares the results regarding the magnetic moment of the $P_{c}(4457)$ pentaquark state with those reported in the existing literature. The numerical results obtained in this study, when considered alongside existing literature, indicate that the magnetic moments of hidden-charm pentaquark states may offer insights into their underlying structures, which in turn can inform the distinction between their spin-parity quantum numbers. It seems that for the future experimental search of the family of hidden-charm pentaquark states, studying the electromagnetic properties of the hidden-charm pentaquark states can provide valuable information.</description>

      <title>High-Energy and Ultra-High-Energy Neutrinos from Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are capable of emitting extremely energetic particles independent of their interactions with the Standard Model. In this work, we investigate a particularly interesting scenario in which PBHs evaporating in the early universe may be responsible for some of the observed high-energy neutrinos above the TeV or PeV scale in the present universe. We compute the energy spectrum of neutrinos directly emitted by PBHs with a monochromatic mass function and estimate the wash-out point, which determines the maximum energy of the spectrum. We find that the spectrum generally extends to high energies following a power law of $E_{\nu}^{-3}$ until it reaches the wash-out point, which crucially depends on the PBH mass. For PBHs of $10^{13}$ grams, the spectrum can extend up to the PeV scale, though the flux is too low for detection. We also consider an indirect production mechanism involving dark particles that are emitted by PBHs and decay into neutrinos at a much later epoch. This mechanism allows lighter (such as those in the gram to kilogram range) PBHs to produce more energetic neutrino fluxes without being washed out by the thermal plasma in the early universe. In this scenario, we find that ultra-high-energy neutrinos around or above the EeV scale can be generated, with sufficiently high fluxes detectable by current and future high-energy neutrino observatories such as IceCube and GRAND.</description>

      <title>Light Right-handed Smuons at the LHC: Natural Dark Matter and $g_{\mu}-2$ in an Unexplored Realm of the pMSSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an in-depth study of an unprobed pMSSM region offering a natural solution to dark matter. Since the 1980s this region has been referred to as the "bulk", consisting of sub 200 GeV neutralinos and right-handed smuons. The bulk satisfies recent muon $g_{\mu}-2$ measurements and sustains consistency with $all$ presently operating SUSY experiments and LHC constraints. Initial ingress into the bulk will arrive soon via the LUX-ZEPLIN 1000-day experiment. Observation of these light right-handed smuon events could optimistically occur at the ongoing LHC Run 3 or forthcoming High-Luminosity LHC. If these light smuon events are ultimately deemed inaccessible at the LHC, then the future FCC-ee and CEPC circular colliders should handily observe the events.</description>

      <title>Metamorphosis of Positronium Moving Across a Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positronium spectrum and lifetimes are known with a high precision. The situation is different for positronium moving across a magnetic field. The total momentum does not commute with the Hamiltonian and is replaced by conserved pseudomomentum. The internal dynamics is not separated from the motion of the system as a whole. The Coulomb potential well is distorted and a wide outer potential well is created. We analytically determine the energy spectrum for a broad range of the magnetic field and pseudomomentum values. We locate the region of these parameters for which the ground state resides in the outer well. The results may play a role in the supression of pulsars radio emission (polar cap problem).</description>

      <title>Neutral pion to two-photons transition form factor revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based upon a combined formalism of Schwinger-Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), we propose a QCD kindred algebraic model for the dressed quark propagator, for the Bethe-Salpeter amplitude of the pion and the electromagnetic quark-photon interaction vertex. We then compute the $\gamma^{*}\pi^0\gamma$ transition form factor $G^{\gamma^{*}\pi^0\gamma}(Q^2)$ for a wide range of photon momentum transfer squared $Q^2$. The quark propagator is expanded out in its perturbative functional form but with dynamically generated dressed quark mass. It has complex conjugate pole singularities in the complex-momentum plane which is motivated by the solution of the quark gap equation with rainbow-ladder truncation of the infinite set of Schwinger-Dyson equations. This complex pole singularity structure of the quark propagator can be associated with a signal of confinement which prevents quarks to become stable asymptotic states. The Bethe-Salpeter amplitude is expressed without a spectral density function, which encapsulate its low and large momentum behaviour. The QCD evolution of the distribution amplitude is also incorporated into our model through the direct implementation of Efremov-Radyushkin-Brodsky-Lepage evolution equations. We include the effects of the quark anomalous magnetic moment in the description of the quark-photon vertex whose infrared enhancement is known to dictate hadronic properties. Once the QCD kindred model is constructed, we calculate the form factor $G^{\gamma^{*}\pi^0\gamma}(Q^2)$ and find it consistent with direct QCD-based studies as well as most available experimental data. It slightly exceeds the conformal limit for large $Q^2$ which might be attributed to the scaling violations in QCD. The associated interaction radius and neutral pion decay width turn out to be compatible with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Two-loop QED/QCD corrections for polarized $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$ process in SANCphot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The new version of the SANCphot integrator has been prepared for fast and stable numerical calculations up to two loops for polarized light-by-light scattering. One-loop modules based on the helicity formalism with massive particles and two-loop modules with massless particles inside the loops are used. The presented study is driven by the potential of polarized photon beams to probe the high energy region. This study is a contribution to the research program of the CEPC project being under development in China.</description>

      <title>Evolution of unpolarized transverse momentum dependent parton distributions of twist-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the calculation of the evolution equations for four unpolarized twist-3 transverse momentum dependent (TMD) parton distribution functions (PDFs) at $\mathcal {O}(\alpha_s)$. Unlike the existing calculations in the literature, which are based on the background field method, we derive the evolution equations directly through diagram expansion. Additionally, instead of using the $\delta$ regulator, we employ the exponential regulator to regularize the rapidity divergences. We find that the evolutions of the four twist-3 TMD PDFs are governed by eight homogeneous equations. Our evolution kernels agree with one set of results in the literature, but differ from another by a sign. Thus, our results help clarify the discrepancies between the evolution kernels reported in the literature. Moreover, considering the advantages of the exponential regulator in high-order perturbative calculations, our results are crucial for computing the twist-3 TMD PDFs at $\mathcal {O}(\alpha_s^2)$.</description>

      <title>Revealing the $q^2$ dependence in $b \to s \mu^+ \mu^-$ baryonic decay modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements from the LHCb experiment and $B$ factories have revealed several discrepancies in angular observables of rare semileptonic $B$ decays involving the quark-level transition $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$. In this work, we conduct a model-independent comparative analysis of the rare semileptonic decays of baryons $\Lambda_b$, $\Sigma_b$ and $\Xi_b$, exploring various new physics scenarios. Our analysis includes predictions for branching ratios and angular observables, including forward-backward asymmetry, longitudinal polarization fractions, and lepton flavor universality ratios, both within the Standard Model and across six distinct new physics scenarios. Notably, we find that certain new physics scenarios significantly affect the observables in the $(\Lambda_b, \Sigma_b, \Xi_b) \to (\Lambda, \Sigma, \Xi) \mu^+ \mu^-$ processes.</description>

      <title>More is Different: Multi-Axion Dynamics Changes Topological Defect Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study topological defects in multi-axion models arising from multiple Peccei-Quinn (PQ) scalars. Using a simplified two-axion system, we reveal fundamental differences in the evolution of these defects compared to single-axion scenarios. This finding is particularly significant because, despite the fact that integrating out heavier axions reduces these models to an effective single PQ scalar theory at low energies, the actual physical behavior of topological defects differs markedly from single-axion predictions. Unlike single-axion models where conventional cosmic strings form, multi-axion scenarios with post-inflationary or mixed initial conditions generically produce networks of strings interconnected by high-tension domain walls. This results in a severe cosmological domain wall problem. We determine string-wall network instability conditions and discuss cosmological implications including the application to the QCD axion and gravitational wave generation. Our findings highlight that multi-axion dynamics can lead to qualitatively different outcomes for topological defects, challenging the conventional picture of cosmic evolution of topological defects based on single-axion models.</description>

      <title>Detection of Dark Matter Coherent Scattering via Torsion Balance with Test Bodies of Different Sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter with mass in the crossover range between wave dark matter and particle dark matter, around $(10^{-3},\, 10^3)\,$eV, remains relatively unexplored by terrestrial experiments. In this mass regime, dark matter scatters coherently with macroscopic objects. The effect of the coherent scattering greatly enhances the accelerations of the targets that the dark matter collisions cause by a factor of $\sim 10^{23}$. We propose a novel torsion balance experiment with test bodies of different geometric sizes to detect such dark matter-induced acceleration. This method provides the strongest constraints on the scattering cross-section between the dark matter and a nucleon in the mass range $(10^{-5}, 10^3)\,$eV.</description>

      <title>Roles of the scalar $f_0(500)$ and $f_0(980)$ in the process $D^0\to \pi^0\pi^0 \bar{K}^0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the near-threshold enhancement and the dip structure around 1~GeV in the $\pi^0\pi^0$ invariant mass distribution of the process $D^0\to \pi^0\pi^0\bar{K}^0$ observed by the CLEO Collaboration, we have investigated this process by taking into account the contribution from the $S$-wave pseudoscalar meson-pseudoscalar meson interactions within the chiral unitary approach, and also the one from the intermediate resonance $K^{*}(892)$. Our results are in good agreement with the CLEO measurements, which implies that, the near-threshold enhancement near the $\pi^0\pi^0$ threshold is mainly due to the contributions from the scalar meson $f_0(500)$ and the intermediate $K^*$, and the cusp structure around 1~GeV in the $\pi^0\pi^0$ invariant mass distribution should be associated with the scalar meson $f_0(980)$.</description>

Abstract: The subtitle of my talk is ``The quest for understanding the origin of neutrino masses''. After reviewing why the discovery of neutrino masses is also the discovery of New Physics, the substance of the talk details mechanisms for generating Majorana neutrino masses and implications for experimental searches and/or cosmology. I review high-scale seesaw, low-scale seesaw and radiative mechanisms, asking at every turn how testable the scenario is. While it is clear that determining the origin of neutrino masses -- knowing what Lagrangian to put into textbooks -- is a distant and ambitious goal, I end with experimental advances that we can reasonably hope for that would constitute progress.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning-based statistical search strategy for an axion model from flavor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning-based search strategy to explore new physics beyond the Standard Model. The reinforcement learning, which is one of machine learning methods, is a powerful approach to find model parameters with phenomenological constraints. As a concrete example, we focus on a minimal axion model with a global $U(1)$ flavor symmetry. Agents of the learning succeed in finding $U(1)$ charge assignments of quarks and leptons solving the flavor and cosmological puzzles in the Standard Model, and find more than 150 realistic solutions for the quark sector taking renormalization effects into account. For the solutions found by the reinforcement learning-based analysis, we discuss the sensitivity of future experiments for the detection of an axion which is a Nambu-Goldstone boson of the spontaneously broken $U(1)$. We also examine how fast the reinforcement learning-based searching method finds the best discrete parameters in comparison with conventional optimization methods. In conclusion, the efficient parameter search based on the reinforcement learning-based strategy enables us to perform a statistical analysis of the vast parameter space associated with the axion model from flavor.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Model in Left-Right Symmetric Linear Seesaw Augmented with $A_4$ Modular Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have implemented $A_4$ modular symmetry in the left-right symmetric linear seesaw model. Interestingly, such modular symmetry restricts the proliferation of flavon fields, and as a result, the predictibility of the model is enhanced. The fermion sector of the model comprises of quarks, leptons and a sterile fermion in each generation, while the scalar sector consists of Higgs doublets and bidoublets. We investigate numerically various Yukawa coupling co-efficients, the neutrino masses and mixing parameters in our intended model and predictions become consistent with $3\sigma$ range of current neutrino oscillation data. We also studied the non-unitarity, effects on lepton flavor violation in our model and evolution of lepton asymmetry to explain the current baryon asymmetry of the universe.</description>

Abstract: Anomalous dimensions of twist-two operators govern the scale evolution of parton distribution functions. For off-shell external states, the physical twist-two operators mix with unknown gauge-variant operators under renormalization. In this talk, we apply the method proposed by us in~\cite{Gehrmann:2023ksf} to compute all gauge-variant one-loop counterterm Feynman rules with five legs, which enter the determination of the four-loop splitting functions in QCD.</description>

      <title>Probing dimension-8 SMEFT operators through neutral meson mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of effective interactions of dimension-8 (dim-8) operators in the standard model effective field theory (SMEFT) on neutral meson mixing, focusing on the $K^0-\bar K^0$, $B_{d,s}-\bar B_{d,s}$, and $D^0-\bar D^0$ systems. Within the framework of the low energy effective field theory (LEFT), each system is governed by eight dim-6 operators, with four originating at tree level from dim-6 SMEFT operators and the other four from dim-8 SMEFT operators. Notably, in certain UV complete models those dim-8 operators instead of the dim-6 ones are generated at the leading order. Our analysis focuses on those dim-8 operators and includes their one-loop QCD renormalization group running effects. By leveraging the LEFT master formula we impose stringent constraints on the effective scales associated with these dim-8 operators. We find that neutral meson mixing can probe an effective scale up to 50 TeV for some operators, surpassing the constraints imposed on other dim-8 operators by other observables. Lastly, we present a UV complete model capable of generating dim-8 operators at the leading order, thus offering a unique perspective on the interplay between different operator dimensions in probing new physics phenomena.</description>

      <title>$J/\psi$ photoproduction near threshold and signals for the hidden charm pentaquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $J/\psi$ photoproduction $\gamma p\to J/\psi p$ near threshold to investigate the role played by the open charm channels and possible signals from the hidden charm $P_c$ pentaquark states. With the diffractive mechanism described by a Pomeron exchange model extrapolated from high energies to the lower energy region, it shows that the differential cross sections compared with the recent results from the GlueX Collaboration have apparent deficits in the large scattering angles. The inclusion of the open charm channels and intermediate $P_c$ states can significantly improve the descriptions of the differential cross section data, in particular, at the energy regions of the $\Lambda_c\bar{D}^{(*)}$ thresholds. This can explain the structures observed by the GlueX Collaboration at the $\Lambda_c\bar{D}^{(*)}$ thresholds as the open charm CUSP effects. Given that these $P_c$ pentaquark states are hadronic molecules dynamically generated by the $\Sigma_c\bar{D}^{(*)}$, we find that the production of these $P_c$ states should be suppressed at leading order since their couplings to both $\gamma p$ and $J/\psi p$ are through loop transitions. This can explain why no obvious signals for the $P_c$ states are observed by the present datasets. In order to further disentangling the role played by $s$-channel mechanisms, we also investigate the polarized beam asymmetry which shows sensitivities to the open charm threshold effects and interferences from the $P_c$ productions. Experimental measurement of this observable at the Jefferson Laboratory is strongly encouraged.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Deconvolution with Profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many experimental contexts, it is necessary to statistically remove the impact of instrumental effects in order to physically interpret measurements. This task has been extensively studied in particle physics, where the deconvolution task is called unfolding. A number of recent methods have shown how to perform high-dimensional, unbinned unfolding using machine learning. However, one of the assumptions in all of these methods is that the detector response is accurately modeled in the Monte Carlo simulation. In practice, the detector response depends on a number of nuisance parameters that can be constrained with data. We propose a new algorithm called Profile OmniFold (POF), which works in a similar iterative manner as the OmniFold (OF) algorithm while being able to simultaneously profile the nuisance parameters. We illustrate the method with a Gaussian example as a proof of concept highlighting its promising capabilities.</description>

      <title>A study of pure multi-strange hadrons production in Pb+Pb collisions at LHC energies using HYDJET++ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the present work, we have used the HYDJET++ model to explore the production of pure multi-strange hadrons in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 2.76 TeV and $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 5.02 TeV collision energies, respectively. We have simulated the $p_{T}$-spectra and elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) of $\phi$-meson and $\Omega$-baryons comparing our results with ALICE experimental data and several phenomenological models (HIJING/$B\overline{B}$, VISHNU, EPOS, AMPT, and Krakow) across various centrality intervals. Additionally, we have calculated the nuclear modification factors ($R_{AA}$ and $R_{CP}$), which provide a perception of jet quenching phenomena. Hence, our findings enable the study of the energy and system dependence of $\phi$ and $\Omega$ hadrons production over a wide range of ultra-relativistic collision energies. We also present the particle ratios ($\Omega/\phi$, $\overline{\Omega}^{+}/\Omega^{-}$, $\Omega/\pi$, and $\phi/\pi$), offering insights on the strangeness enhancement and chemical properties of the medium at both LHC collision energies.</description>

      <title>What we can learn from the angular differential rates (only) in semileptonic $B \to D^* \ell \nu_\ell$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new, simple approach to the study of semileptonic $B \to D^* \ell \nu_\ell$ decays based on the angular distributions of the final state particles only. Our approach is model independent and never requires the knowledge of $\vert V_{cb}\vert$. By studying such distributions in the case of light leptons, a comparison between results from different data sets from the Belle and BelleII Collaborations and between data and Standard Model calculations is also given for several interesting quantities. A good consistency is observed between some of the experimental results and the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Improved $\pi^0,\eta,\eta^{\prime}$ transition form factors in resonance chiral theory and their $a_\mu^{\rm{HLbL}}$ contribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Working with Resonance Chiral Theory, within the two resonance multiplets saturation scheme, we satisfy leading (and some subleading) chiral and asymptotic QCD constraints and accurately fit simultaneously the $\pi^{0},\eta,\eta^{\prime}$ transition form factors, for single and double virtuality. In the latter case, we supplement the few available measurements with lattice data to ensure a faithful description. Mainly due to the new results for the doubly virtual case, we improve over existing descriptions for the $\eta$ and $\eta^\prime$. Our evaluation of the corresponding pole contributions to the hadronic light-by-light piece of the muon $g-2$ read: $a_\mu^{\pi^{0}\text{-}\rm{pole}}=\left(60.4\pm0.5^{+3.2}_{-1.8}\right)\times10^{-11}$, $a_\mu^{\eta\text{-}\mathrm{pole}}=\left(15.2\pm0.5^{+1.1}_{-0.7}\right)\times10^{-11}$ and $a_\mu^{\eta^\prime\text{-}\rm{pole}}=\left(14.4\pm0.8^{+1.4}_{-1.0}\right)\times10^{-11}$, for a total of $a_\mu^{\pi^0+\eta+\eta^{\prime}\text{-}\rm{pole}}=\left(90.0\pm1.1^{+3.7}_{-2.2}\right)\times10^{-11}$, where the first and second error are the statistical and systematic uncertainties, respectively.</description>

      <title>Diffuse Neutrino Background from Magnetorotational Stellar Core Collapses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A statistically significant detection of the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) is around the corner. To this purpose, we assess the contribution to the DSNB of magnetorotational collapses of massive stars, relying on a suite of state-of-the-art three-dimensional neutrino-magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We find that neutrinos from magnetorotational core collapses boost the high-energy tail of the DSNB spectrum, similar to what is expected from neutrino-driven black hole-forming collapses. The latest data from the Super-Kamiokande Collaboration can already exclude that more than $13\%$ of all collapsing massive stars undergo magnetorotational collapses under optimistic assumptions. A DSNB detection at $3 \sigma$ could take place up to $4$ yr earlier at Super-Kamiokande-Gadolinium or JUNO if the fraction of magnetorotational collapses should be larger than $10\%$. Fascinatingly, if the fraction of magnetorotational stellar collapses should be larger than $7\%$, Hyper-Kamiokande could measure such a fraction at $3\sigma$ after $20$ yr of DSNB data taking. The combination of DSNB and electromagnetic data has the potential to resolve the degenerate contributions from magnetorotational and neutrino-driven black hole-forming collapses, providing crucial insight on the properties of the population of collapsing massive stars.</description>

      <title>Cambridge Lectures on The Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These lecture notes cover the Standard Model (SM) course for Part III of the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos, taught during the years 2020-2023. The course comprised 25 lectures and 4 example classes. Following a brief historical introduction, the SM is constructed from first principles. We begin by demonstrating that essentially only particles with spin/helicity $0, \frac{1}{2}, 1, \frac{3}{2}, 2$ can describe matter and interactions, using spacetime symmetries, soft theorems, gauge redundancies, Ward identities, and perturbative unitarity. The remaining freedom lies in the choice of the Yang-Mills gauge group and matter representations. Effective field theories (EFTs) are a central theme throughout the course, with the 4-Fermi interactions and chiral perturbation theory serving as key examples. Both gravity and the SM itself are treated as EFTs, specifically as the SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory). Key phenomenological aspects of the SM are covered, including the Higgs mechanism, Yukawa couplings, the CKM matrix, the GIM mechanism, neutrino oscillations, running couplings, and asymptotic freedom. The discussion of anomalies and their non-trivial cancellations in the SM is detailed. Simple examples of calculations, such as scattering amplitudes and decay rates, are provided. The course concludes with a brief overview of the limitations of the SM and an introduction to the leading proposals for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Birefringence in Symmetron Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The symmetron is a light scalar which provides a screening mechanism so as to evade the strong constraints from local gravity tests. In order to achieve this goal, a $Z_2$ symmetry is imposed on the symmetron model. In this paper, we introduce a new symmetron Chern-Simons-like gravitational interaction which is $Z_2$ invariant but breaks the parity symmetry explicitly. As a result, it is found that this coupling can generate gravitational wave (GW) amplitude birefringence when GWs propagate over the symmetron backgrounds. Due to the matter density difference, the symmetron profile changes significantly when entering the galaxy, so that we need to discuss the extra-galactic and galactic situations separately. On the one hand, the cosmological symmetron field follows the adiabatic solution, which induces a parity-violating GW amplitude correction with its exponent proportional to the GW frequency and the traveling distance. On the other hand, the symmetron takes the screening solution within the Milky Way, and the generated GW birefringence is only a function of the GW frequency. By further comparing these two contributions, we find that the extra-galactic symmetron field produces the dominant birefringence effects. Finally, with the latest GW data from LIGO-Virgo-Kagra, we place a reasonable constraint on the parity-violating coupling parameter in this symmetron model.</description>

      <title>Pion-nucleon scattering with decuplet contribution in heavy baryon SU(3) chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the complete $T$ matrices with decuplet contributions for pion-nucleon scattering to order $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^3)$ in heavy baryon SU(3) chiral perturbation theory. The baryon mass in the chiral limit $M_0$ and the low-energy constants are determined by fitting to phase shifts of $\pi N$, the experimental octet-baryon masses, and the value of $\sigma_{\pi N}$ simultaneously. By using these constants, we obtain the accurate $KN$ $\sigma$ terms, $\sigma_{KN}^{(1)}=(375.07\pm33.02)$ MeV and $\sigma_{KN}^{(2)}=(275.32\pm32.24)$ MeV. An excellent description of the phase shifts is obtained for all partial waves. We also present results for scattering lengths and scattering volumes. In addition, the convergence of the approach is also discussed.</description>

Abstract: We consider the nonplanar universal anomalous dimension of twist-two operators at four loops in N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and push its direct diagrammatic calculation through Lorentz spin j=20, one unit beyond the state of the art, so as to confirm the correctness of the general, all-j result conjectured previously by us [1] imposing certain constraints on its analytic form. Thanks to our new result, such constraints can be eliminated altogether. By the same token, this allows us to re-derive, in a completely independent way, the nonplanar four-loop cusp anomalous dimension by taking the large-j limit of the general result.</description>

      <title>New Soft Theorems for Two-Scalar Sigma Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the scattering amplitudes and soft theorems for the sigma models with two scalars. We show that if the particles are Goldstone bosons, then you necessarily get Adler zero with no possibility for non-trivial soft theorems. For non-Goldstone bosons, the soft behavior is generically captured by the geometric soft theorem studied by Cheung et al., and the right-hand side contains derivatives of lower-point amplitudes. Inspired by the recent work on the 2D sigma models, we study one special two-scalar sigma model, where the presence of symmetries in the target space translates into a special but non-trivial soft theorem without derivatives. We further generalize the construction to two larger classes of such models and derive certain soft theorem sum rules, again avoiding the derivatives of amplitudes. Our analysis provides an interesting hierarchy of two-scalar sigma models and soft theorems, ranging from Goldstone boson case to a generic target space, and showing that there are interesting theories in between.</description>

      <title>Photon Ring Dimming as a Signature of Photon-Axion Conversion in Janis-Newman-Winicour Naked Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possible existence of axions in the universe introduces the intriguing possibility of photon-axion conversion in strong magnetic fields, particularly near compact objects like supermassive black holes or even naked singularity. In this study, we investigate the conversion of photons into axions in the vicinity of a Janis-Newman-Winicour (JNW) spacetime, a well-known naked singularity solution. Our analysis reveals that photons can efficiently convert into axions with masses less than $100 \rm \ neV$. We calculate the conversion probability and find that it is significantly influenced by the characteristic parameter of the JNW spacetime. The potential observational signatures of this conversion, would be the dimming of photon ring in the X-ray and gamma-ray spectrum. Our findings suggest that compact objects like M87* could be prime candidates for detecting photon-axion conversion effects, provided future advances in high-resolution observations.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy logic for reconstructing arbitrary moments of multiplicity distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Identity Method is a statistical technique developed to reconstruct moments of multiplicity distributions of particles produced in high-energy nuclear collisions. The method leverages principles from fuzzy logic, allowing for a more nuanced representation of particle identification by assigning degrees of membership to different particle types based on detector signals. In this contribution, a mathematical framework, based on a multivariate moment generation function, is developed that allows the derivation of the formulas used in the Identity Method in a more robust way. Moreover, within the introduced framework, the Identity Method is easily extended to cope with arbitrarily higher-order moments. The techniques developed here offer significant potential for improving the accuracy of multiplicity distribution analyses in high-energy nuclear collisions. While the primary focus of the work presented is on applications in high-energy and nuclear physics, it can also be applied in other areas where signal identification is probabilistic and data are noisy, such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and various other fields of experimental science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain walls are topological defects produced by the spontaneous symmetry-breaking of discrete symmetry during cosmological phase transitions. The horizon-size domain wall can significantly contribute to the energy density in the late-evolution stage. We propose that the density perturbations from the fluctuations in the number density of the horizon-size domain wall could collapse to form primordial black holes. This mechanism becomes effective when the domain wall energy density ratio to that of the radiation reaches about 0.1 in the radiation-dominated universe. We find that models with $Z_2$ symmetry are excluded for interpreting pulsar timing array observations on the nano-Hz gravitational wave background since this model's domain wall number density fluctuations could lead to an overabundance of the primordial black holes. Moreover, models with $N\sim 10$ domain walls also suffer strong constraints from the overabundance of primordial black holes.</description>

Abstract: We present a lattice calculation of dibaryons composed of single-flavor quarks with either charm or strange quark mass. We utilize a set of lattice QCD ensembles with $N_f=2+1+1$ dynamical HISQ fields, two spatial volumes, and four different lattice spacings generated by the MILC collaboration. By using an overlap action for the valence quark propagators, we calculate the ground state energies of dibaryons in $S = 0$ and $S = 2$ spin channels. By analyzing the energy difference of the ground state of the dibaryon with respect to the relevant threshold, we provide insights into the interactions involved in different spin channels at the charm and the strange quark masses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential primordial connection between the black hole merger events detected by LIGO and the nano-Hz stochastic gravitational wave background observed by pulsar timing arrays. We propose an innovative mechanism for the formation of primordial black holes, suggesting that the Poisson fluctuations within the domain wall network can give rise to horizon-sized overdense regions. Our results indicate a plausible common origin for gravitational wave observations in two different frequency bands, potentially linked to the annihilation of the domain wall network at the QCD scale, while accounting for the accretion effects on primordial black holes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the bias potential induced by the QCD instanton effect may naturally facilitate the annihilation of the domain wall network during the QCD phase transition. Additionally, our scenario can yield the correct axion dark matter relic abundance, particularly if realized within the clockwork axion framework.</description>

      <title>Multiple rescattering effects in the hard knockout reaction $\mathbf{^2\mbox{H}(p,2p)n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of a proton with a deuteron is the simplest nuclear reaction. However, it allows the study of precursors of nuclear medium effects such as initial-state/final-state interactions (ISI/FSI). In case of hard proton knockout, the deviation of ISI/FSI from the 'standard' values may carry a signal of color transparency. In this regard, it is important to define the 'standard' as precisely as possible. This work continues previous studies within the framework of the Generalized Eikonal Approximation (GEA). The focus is on processes where the participating protons experience multiple soft rescattering on the spectator neutron. It is shown that correct treatment of deviations of the trajectories of outgoing protons from the longitudinal direction leads to a significant modification of partial amplitudes with soft rescattering of two outgoing protons and non-vanishing amplitudes with rescattering of incoming and outgoing protons. The new treatment of multiple rescattering is important in kinematics with a forward spectator neutron.</description>

      <title>L\'evy walk of pions in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process of L\'evy walk, i.e., movement patterns described by heavy-tailed random walks, play a role in many different phenomena, from chemical and microbiological systems through marine predators to climate change. Recent experiments have suggested that this phenomenon also appears in heavy-ion collisions. However, the theoretical background is not yet well understood. In high-energy collisions of heavy nuclei, the strongly interacting Quark Gluon Plasma is created, which, similarly to the early Universe, undergoes a rapid expansion and transition back to normal hadronic matter. In the subsequent expanding hadron gas, particles interact until kinetic freeze-out, when their momenta become fixed, and they freely transition toward the detectors. Measuring spatial freeze-out distributions is a crucial tool in understanding the dynamics of the created matter as well as the interactions among its constituents. In this paper, we present a novel three-dimensional analysis of the spatial freeze-out distribution of pions (the most abundant particles in such collisions). Utilizing Monte-Carlo simulations of high-energy collisions, we show that the chain of processes ending in a final state pion has a step length distribution leading to L\'evy-stable distributions. Subsequently, we show that pion freeze-out distributions indeed exhibit heavy tails and can be described by a three-dimensional elliptically contoured symmetric L\'evy-stable distribution.</description>

Since it offers a well-motivated starting point for the study of physics at very high energies, we incorporate an $R^2$ term in the Palatini gravity. In addition, afterward the inflation, the inflaton oscillates about the minimum of the inflation potential, and reheats the universe. This occurs during the reheating phase, at which the inflaton decays into the standard model particles, which fill the universe. We extend our examination by considering the reheating effects on inflationary observables by employing the different scenarios of the reheat temperature. Supposing the standard thermal history after inflation, we display the inflationary predictions, $n_s, r, \mathrm{d}n_s/\mathrm{d}\ln k$ of $\beta$-exponential potential with minimal coupling in Palatini $R^2$ gravity. Also, different kinds of constraints from a variety of observations, such as BICEP/Keck, Planck 2018, as well as future possible detectable sensitivities that might be reached by CMB experiments: CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD are taken into account in this work. We indicate that our results are consistent with both the latest data and the future sensitivity forecasts of LiteBIRD/Planck and CMB-S4. Finally, the results in this study highlight the viability of our model even in the case of the existence of more stringent constraints expected from future achievable confidence level limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study conversion processes between gravitons and dark photons and reveal the effects of dark photons on the polarization of gravitational waves. Considering cosmological dark magnetic fields, we investigate the evolution of the intensity and polarization of gravitational waves through the conversion. Specifically, we demonstrate that for minimal coupling between gravitons and dark photons, the intensity, circular polarization, and linear polarization evolve separately. We derive explicit formulas for the statistical mean and variance of the intensity and polarization when the gravitational waves pass through magnetic fields with random orientation. The formulas capture how the initial polarization of dark photons will be imprinted on the observed gravitational wave background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalised version of Gross-Neveu model in 2+1 dimensions. The model is inspired from graphene which shows a linear dispersion relation near the Dirac points. The phase structure and the thermodynamic properties in the mean field approximation have been studied before. Here we go beyond the mean field level by deriving a Beth-Uhlenbeck equation for Gaussian fluctuations, solutions of which we explore numerically, for the first time including their momentum dependence. We discuss the excitonic mass, fluctuation pressure and phase shifts. We also perform a comparison with the NJL model in 3+1 dimension and discuss its implication for graphene.</description>

      <title>Constraints on axions from patchy screening of the cosmic microwave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The resonant conversion of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons into axions within large-scale structure induces an anisotropic spectral distortion in CMB temperature maps. Applying state-of-the-art foreground cleaning techniques to $\textit{Planck}$ CMB observations, we construct maps of axion-induced "patchy screening" of the CMB. We cross-correlate these maps with data from the $\textit{unWISE}$ galaxy survey and find no evidence of axions. We constrain the axion-photon coupling, $g_{a\gamma\gamma} \lesssim 2 \times 10^{-12}~{\rm GeV}^{-1}$, at the 95% confidence level for axion masses in the range $10^{-13}~{\rm eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 10^{-12}~{\rm eV}$. These constraints are competitive with the tightest astrophysical axion limits in this mass range and are inferred from robust population-level statistics, which makes them complementary to existing searches that rely on modeling of individual systems.</description>

      <title>An appropriate statistical approach for nonequilibrium particle production</title>

Abstract: The incapability of thermal models to accurately reproduce the horn-like structure of the Kaon-to-pion ratio measured at AGS, SPS, and low RHIC energies, as well as confirmed in the beam energy scan program, has long been a persistent problem. This issue is believed to have arisen due to the inappropriate application of statistics, particularly the extensive additive Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) statistics. The assumption that the analysis of particle production, a dynamic nonequilibrium process, should be primarily conducted using extensive BG or nonextensive Tsallis statistics, has proven to be an unsuccessful approach that has been followed for several decades. By employing generic (non)extensive statistics, two equivalence classes $(c,d)$ emerge, thereby undermining the validity of any ad hoc assumption. Consequently, the degree of (non)extensivity exhibited by the statistical ensemble is determined by its own characteristics. This encompasses both extensive BG statistics, characterized by $(1,1)$, and nonextensive Tsallis statistics, characterized by $(0,q)$. The energy dependence of light-, $\gamma_q$, and strange-quark occupation factor, $\gamma_s$, suggests that the produced particles are most appropriately described as a nonequilibrium ensemble. This is evidenced by a remarkable nonmonotonic behavior observed in the $\mathrm{K}^+/\pi^+$ horn, for instance. On the other hand, the resulting equivalence classes $(c,d)$ are associated with a generic nonextensivity related to extended exponential and Lambert-$W_0$ exponentially generating distribution function, which evidently arise from free, short- and long-range correlations. The incorporation of generic nonextensive statistics into the hadron resonance gas model yields an impressive ability to rightfully reproduce the nonmonotonic $\mathrm{K}^+/\pi^+$ ratio.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the weak decays of ground-state triply heavy baryons. We first obtain the form factors using the light-front quark model in the three-quark picture, and then apply them to arrive at some phenomenological predictions, including the decay widths of semileptonic decays and nonleptonic decays. Our results are expected to be helpful for the experimental search for triply heavy baryons.</description>

      <title>Applicability of Hydrodynamics in Hadronic Phase of Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hadronic phase and its dynamics in relativistic heavy-ion collisions are topics of immense discussion. The hadronic phase contains various massive hadrons with an abundance of the lightest hadron, i.e., $\pi$-mesons. In this work, we consider that pions are in the thermal equilibrium in the hadronic phase and use second-order massive viscous hydrodynamics to obtain its expansion to the boundary of the kinetic freeze-out. We achieve the kinetic freeze-out boundary with the Knudsen number ($Kn$) limit: $Kn&gt;1$. When this condition is met, hydrodynamics expansion breaks down, and the mean free path becomes sufficiently large in comparison with the system size so that the particle yields get preserved. Further, we investigate the effect of the massive fluid on the resonance particle yields, including re-scattering and regeneration, along with their natural decay width. These resonances can play an important role in determining the characteristics of the hadronic phase as they have sufficiently small lifetimes, which may be comparable to the hadronic phase lifetime. In the current study, we predict the hadronic phase lifetime, which is further used to determine the $K^*(892)^0/K$, $\phi(1020)/K$, and $\rho(770)^0/\pi$ ratios at the kinetic freeze-out. We obtain these ratios as a function of charged particle multiplicity and transverse momentum and compare our findings with experimental data. Our results qualitatively agree with the experimental data indicating the possible hydrodynamical evolution of the hadronic phase.</description>

      <title>Probing Cosmic Neutrino Background Charge via Unconventional Interferometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08246v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If neutrinos carry non-zero electric charge, they would interact directly with photons. This would induce a phase shift along the photon path in the optical experiment. We propose a novel idea to detect this phase shift induced by cosmic neutrino background (CNB) and the photon interaction using laser interferometry experiment. We show that our setup can probe the CNB neutrino charge in the order of $10^{-18} \,e- 10^{-17}\, e$. This is quite competitive with the existing upper bound on neutrino charge from both laboratory experiments and astrophysical observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01848v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the quark mass dependence - light and heavy - of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ properties, such as, mass, coupling to $DK$, scattering lengths and compositeness, from a global analysis of $DK$ energy levels from LQCD. In particular, we analyze the HSC energy levels for $DK$ scattering in $I=0$ for different boosts and two pion masses. The formalism is based in the local hidden-gauge interaction of Weinberg-Tomozawa type which respects chiral and heavy quark spin symmetries, supplemented by a term that takes into account the $D^{(*)}K$ coupling to a bare $c\bar{s}$ component. The isospin violating decay of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)\to D_{s}^+\pi^0$ is also evaluated.</description>

      <title>Factorization of Non-Global LHC Observables and Resummation of Super-Leading Logarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic formalism based on a factorization theorem in soft-collinear effective theory to describe non-global observables at hadron colliders, such as gap-between-jets cross sections. The cross sections are factorized into convolutions of hard functions, capturing the dependence on the partonic center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{\hat s}$, and low-energy matrix elements, which are sensitive to the low scale $Q_0\ll\sqrt{\hat s}$ characteristic of the veto imposed on energetic emissions into the gap between the jets. The scale evolution of both objects is governed by a renormalization-group equation, which we derive at one-loop order. By solving the evolution equation for the hard functions for arbitrary $2\to M$ jet processes in the leading logarithmic approximation, we accomplish for the first time the all-order resummation of the so-called "super-leading logarithms" discovered in 2006, thereby solving an old problem of quantum field theory. We study the numerical size of the corresponding effects for different partonic scattering processes and explain why they are sizable for $pp\to 2\,\text{jets}$ processes, but suppressed in $H/Z$ and $H/Z$+jet production. The super-leading logarithms are given by an alternating series, whose individual terms can be much larger than the resummed result, even in very high orders of the loop expansion. Resummation is therefore essential to control these effects. We find that the asymptotic fall-off of the resummed series is much weaker than for standard Sudakov form factors.</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on additional inspections concerning the fermionic sector of the Standard Model Extension (SME). In this context, our main effort in this contribution is to investigate effects of Lorentz-symmetry violation (LSV) on the Klein Paradox, the Zitterbewegung and its phenomenology in connection to Condensed Matter Physics, Atomic Physics, and Astrophysics. Finally, we discuss a particular realization of LSV in the Dirac equation, considering an asymmetry between space and time due to a scale factor present in the linear momentum of the fermion, but which does not touch its time derivative. We go further and extend the implications of this asymmetry in the situation the scale factor becomes space-time dependent to compute its influence on the kinematics of the Compton effect with the extended dispersion relation for the fermion that scatters the photon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two excited vector charmonium states $Y(4220)$ and $Y(4360)$ are difficult to be understood as pure $c\bar{c}$ charmonium states. Since they are located close to the mass thresholds of $\bar{D}D_{1}$ and $\bar{D}^*D_{1}$, they can be viewed as $\bar{D}D_{1}$ and $\bar{D}^*D_{1}$ molecules. Furthermore, recent studies indicated that the exotic states $X(3872)$/$Z_c(3900)$ and $X_2(4013)$/$Z_c(4020)$ are the isoscalar/isovector $\bar{D}D^{*}$ and isoscalar/isovector $\bar{D}^*D^{*}$ molecules, respectively. In this work, in the molecular picture, we employ the triangle diagram mechanism to study the productions of $ Z_{c}(3900) $ and $X(3872)$ in the pionic and radiative decays of $Y(4220)$, as well as their heavy-quark spin symmetry (HQSS) partners, i.e., the productions of $Z_{c}(4020)$ and $X_2(4013)$ in the pionic and radiative decays of $Y(4360)$. Using the effective Lagrangian approach, we obtain the ratios of the branching fractions $\mathcal{B}[Y(4360) \to Z_c(4020)\pi]/\mathcal{B}[Y(4220)\to Z_c(3900)\pi]=1.2$ and $\mathcal{B}[Y(4360)\to X_2(4013) \gamma]/\mathcal{B}[Y(4220)\to X(3872)\gamma]=0.5$, almost independent of model parameters, which indicate that the productions of $X_2(4013)$ and $Z_c(4020)$ in the radiative and pionic decays of $Y(4360)$ are likely to be measured in the future. The experimental studies of the predicted decay modes will help verify the molecular nature of $X(3872)$, $Z_c(3900)$, and $Y(4220)$. We hope the present work can stimulate experimental and further theoretical studies on these decay modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the possible production of a MeV-scale sterile fermion through the up-scattering of neutrinos on nuclei and atomic electrons at different facilities. We consider a phenomenological model that adds a new fermion to the particle content of the Standard Model and we allow for all possible Lorentz-invariant non-derivative interactions (scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial-vector and tensor) of neutrinos with electrons and first-generation quarks. We first explore the sensitivity of the DUNE experiment to this scenario, by simulating elastic neutrino-electron scattering events in the near detector. We consider both options of a standard and a tau-optimized neutrino beams, and investigate the impact of a mobile detector that can be moved off-axis with respect to the beam. Next, we infer constraints on the typical coupling, new fermion and mediator masses from elastic neutrino-electron scattering events induced by solar neutrinos in two current dark matter direct detection experiments, XENONnT and LZ. Under the assumption that the new mediators couple also to first-generation quarks, we further set constraints on the up-scattering production of the sterile fermion using coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering data from the COHERENT experiment. Moreover, we set additional constraints assuming that the sterile fermion may decay within the detector. We finally compare our results and discuss how these facilities are sensitive to different regions of the relevant parameter space due to kinematics arguments and can hence provide complementary information on the up-scattering production of a sterile fermion.</description>

Abstract: We propose a neutrino mass matrix texture bearing a suitable correlation $m_{22}=-2\,m_{13}$ and study its phenomenological implications. In light of both normal and inverted hierarchies, the texture imposes specific bounds on some observational parameters. As a potential application, the prediction of effective Majorana neutrino mass $m_{\beta\beta}$ is visualized for both hierarchies. To understand the proposed texture from the first principle, we incorporate the type-I+II seesaw mechanism in association with $A_4 \times Z_{10} \times Z_2$ group.</description>

For a fermionc dark sector particle coupled with quarks and neutrino via absorption operators, its production is always accompanied by an invisible neutrino. We study in details the mono-X (photon, jet, and $Z$) productions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). To make easy comparison between the collider and direct detection experiments, we start from the quark-level absorption operators for the first time. In other words, we study the model-independent constraints on a generic fermionic absorption dark fermion. In addition, the interplay and comparison with the possible detection at the neutrino experiment especially Borexino is also briefly discussed. We find that for both spin-dependent and spin-independent absorption of the dark fermion, the experiments with light nuclear target can provide the strongest constraints.</description>

      <title>Exploring Exotic Decays of the Higgs Boson to Multi-Photons at the LHC via Multimodal Learning Approaches</title>

Abstract: The Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson, the most recently discovered elementary particle, may still serve as a mediator between the SM sector and a new physics sector related to dark matter (DM). The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has not yet fully constrained the physics associated with the Higgs boson, leaving room for such possibilities. Among the various potential mass scales of the dark sector, the sub-GeV mass range is particularly intriguing. This parameter space presents significant challenges for DM direct detection experiments that rely on nuclear recoils. Various innovative experimental methods are currently under investigation to explore this sub-GeV dark sector. The LHC, functioning as a Higgs factory, could explore this sector once the challenge of identifying DM signals is resolved. Due to the significantly lower mass of particles in the dark sector compared to the Higgs boson, these particles are expected to be highly boosted following the Higgs boson's decay. However, detecting and identifying these highly boosted particles remains a considerable challenge at the LHC, despite their eventual decay into SM particles. We employ a well-motivated leptophobic $Z^{\prime}_B$ model as a prototype to analyze the distinctive signatures from Higgs boson exotic decays into multi-photons. These signatures consist of collimated photons that fail to meet the photon isolation criteria, forming jet-like objects. Conventional analyses relying solely on the purity of energy deposits in the electromagnetic calorimeter would fail to detect these signatures, as they would be overwhelmed by background events from Quantum Chromodynamics. To effectively distinguish between such novel signal signatures and SM background events, we leverage advanced machine learning techniques, specifically the transformer encoder in a multimodal network structure.</description>

      <title>Impacts of ALP on the Constraints of Dark Photon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark sector may exist and interact with Standard Model (SM) through the $U(1)$ kinetic mixing. Through this portal-type interaction, dark photon from dark sector couples to SM fermions, and may explain the discrepancy between experimental data and SM calculations on muon anomalous magnetic moment, muon $g-2$. However, current searches for dark photon impose stringent constraints on the mixing parameter $\varepsilon$ for various dark photon masses, excluding the favorite parameter space for muon $g-2$. In this paper, we study the case where a global $U(1)$ in dark sector is spontaneously broken, resulting a light pseudo-Goldstone, axion-like particle (ALP) $a$, which couples to dark photon and SM photon, $g_{a\gamma\gamma'}$. Through this interaction, dark photon may decay into photon and ALP when this channel is kinematically allowed. As a result, the experimental constraints on dark photon change significantly, and dark photon is able to explain the muon $g-2$ anomaly when its mass is heavier than $10$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Strong decays of the isovector-scalar $D^\ast\bar{D}^\ast$ hadronic molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We adopt the effective Lagrangian approach to study the strong decays of the $1^-(0^{++})$ $D^\ast\bar{D}^\ast$ molecular state [denoted as $T_{\psi0}^a(4010)$ according to the LHCb naming convention] through triangle diagrams. The decay channels include the open-charm $D\bar{D}$, and the hidden-charm $\eta_c\pi$, $J/\psi\rho$, and $\chi_{c1}\pi$. The coupling between the $T_{\psi0}^a(4010)$ and its constituents $D^\ast\bar{D}^\ast$ is obtained by solving for the residue of the scattering $T$-matrix at the pole. Our calculations yield a total width of few tens MeV for the $T_{\psi0}^a(4010)$ state using three different form factors, with its main decay channels being $\eta_c\pi$ and $\chi_{c1}\pi$. The $X(4100)$ and $X(4050)$ have similar masses and widths, with both masses being close to the $D^\ast\bar{D}^\ast$ threshold. Additionally, their decay final states are consistent with those of the $T_{\psi0}^a(4010)$. Therefore, it is likely that they represent the same state and both potentially correspond to the $T_{\psi0}^a(4010)$. We suggest that future experiments focus on searching for the $T_{\psi0}^a(4010)$ signal in the final states $\eta_c\pi^-$, $\chi_{c1}\pi^-$ and $D^0D^-$ of the $B^0\to\eta_c\pi^-K^+$, $\chi_{c1}\pi^- K^+$ and $D^0D^-K^+$ processes, respectively, as well as further investigating its resonance parameters with Flatt\'e-like formula.</description>

      <title>Decay of CP-even Higgs $H\rightarrow h \gamma \gamma$ in Two Higgs Doublet Model: (I) one-loop analytic results, ward identity checks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first analytical expressions for one-loop induced contributions for the decay channels of CP-even Higgs $H\rightarrow h \gamma \gamma$ with $h$ being standard model-like Higgs boson within the framework of Two Higgs Doublet Model in this paper. One-loop form factors for the decay processes are written in terms of the scalar Passarino-Veltman functions following the general notations of the package~{\tt LoopTools} as well as the library {\tt Collier}. Subsequently, physical results for the decay processes can be generated numerically by using one of the above-mentioned packages. The analytical expressions shown in this paper, are verified by several numerical checks, for examples, the ultraviolet (UV) and the infrared (IR) finiteness for one-loop amplitude. Furthermore, the amplitude must be followed the so-called ward identity due to on-shell photons in final states. The identity can also be tested numerically in this work. We find that the numerical results for the checks are good stability. In phenomenological studies, the differential decay rates as functions of the invariant of two photons in final state of $H\rightarrow h \gamma \gamma$ are first studied in parameter space for all types of Two Higgs Doublet Models.</description>

      <title>Determination of Strong Coupling Constant from Inclusive Semileptonic Decays of Charmed Mesons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16119v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employing the heavy quark expansion model with the kinetic scheme, we evaluate $\alpha_S(m_c^2)$, the strong coupling constant at the charm quark mass $m_c$ with data on inclusive semileptonic decays of charmed mesons. Using the experimental values of semileptonic decay widths of the $D^0$ and the $D^+$, the value of $\alpha_{s}(m_c^{2})$ is determined to be $0.445\pm0.009\pm0.114$, where the first uncertainty is experimental and the second systematic. This reported $\alpha_{s}(m_c^{2})$ is in good agreement with the value of $\alpha_{s}(m_c^{2})$ calculated by running $\alpha_S(m_Z^2)$ at the $Z^0$ boson mass $m_Z$ with the renormalization group evolution equation. In addition, values of $\alpha_{s}(m_c^{2})$ obtained individually from each of the $D^0$, $D^+$, and $D_s^+$ mesons are found to be consistent being of the same origin.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we aim to explore the potential for generating events related to dark matter (DM) in conjunction with a neutral heavy gauge boson (Z$^{\prime}$) decaying leptonically during proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). These collisions occur at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}$ = 14 TeV, with a high integrated luminosity equivalent to 1000 fb$^{-1}$. Our analysis involves interpreting the outcomes through Monte Carlo simulation of the effective field theory (EFT) framework. If no new physics is detected, we establish constraints on various parameters within the EFT context, such as the scenario cutoff scale ($\Lambda$) and the Z$^{\prime}$ mass.</description>

      <title>Transition magnetic moment about neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the neutrino transition magnetic moment in the $U(1)_X$SSM. $U(1)_X$SSM is the $U(1)$ extension of Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and its local gauge group is extended to $SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y\times U(1)_X$. To obtain this model, three singlet new Higgs superfields and right-handed neutrinos are added to the MSSM, which can explain the results of neutrino oscillation experiments. The neutrino transition magnetic moment is induced by electroweak radiative corrections. By applying effective Lagrangian method and on-shell scheme, we study the associated Feynman diagrams and the transition magnetic moment of neutrinos in the model. We fit experimental data for neutrino mass variances and mixing angle. Based on the range of data selection, the influences of different sensitive parameters on the results are analysed. The numerical analysis shows that many parameters have an effect on the neutrino transition moment, such as $g_X$, $M_2$, $\lambda_H$ and $g_{YX}$. For our numerical results, the order of magnitude of $\mu_{ij}^M/\mu_B$ is around $10^{-20}$ $\sim$ $10^{-19}$.</description>

      <title>Vector meson's spin alignments in high energy reactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global spin alignment of vector mesons has been observed by the STAR collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). It provides a unique opportunity to probe the correlation between the polarized quark and antiquark in the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions, opening a new window to explore the properties of sQGP. In addition, spin alignments of vector mesons have also been observed in other high-energy particle collisions such as $e^+e^-$ annihilations at high energies where hadron production is dominated by quark fragmentation mechanism. The results obtained are quite different from those obtained in heavy ion collisions where quark coalescence/combination mechanism dominates suggesting strong dependence on hadronization mechanisms. So comprehensive studies in different hadronization processes are needed. In this article, we present a brief review of theoretical and experimental advances in the study of vector meson's spin alignments in a variety of high-energy particle collisions, with emphasis on hadronization mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Searching Accretion-Enhanced Dark Matter Annihilation Signals in the Galactic Centre</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study reanalyzes the detection prospects of dark matter (DM) annihilation signals in the Galactic Center, focusing on velocity-dependent dynamics within a spike density near the supermassive black hole (Sgr~A$^{\star}$). We investigate three annihilation processes -- $p$-wave, resonance, and forbidden annihilation -- under semi-relativistic velocities, leveraging gamma-ray data from Fermi and DAMPE telescopes. Our analysis integrates a fermionic DM model with an electroweak axion-like particle (ALP) portal, exploring annihilation into two or four photons. Employing a comprehensive six-dimensional integration, we precisely calculate DM-induced gamma-ray fluxes near Sgr~A$^{\star}$, incorporating velocity and positional dependencies in the annihilation cross-section and photon yield spectra. Our findings highlight scenarios of resonance and forbidden annihilation, where the larger ALP-DM-DM coupling constant $C_{a\chi\chi}$ can affect spike density, potentially yielding detectable gamma-ray line spectra within Fermi and DAMPE energy resolution. We set upper limits for $C_{a\chi\chi}$ across these scenarios, offering insights into the detectability and spectral characteristics of DM annihilation signals from the Galactic Center.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14010v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The introduction of electroweak multiplets that transform under any representation of the standard $SU(2)_L$ gauge group suggests the existence of electrically neutral stable particles capable of serving as cold dark matter in the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. This paradigm, known as minimal dark matter, has primarily focused on spin-$0$ and spin-$1/2$ particles. We extend this study to the spin-1 case using the 5-dimensional real representation. We address unitarity concerns arising from the model's interactions with electroweak and Higgs fields of the Standard Model, investigating implications for dark matter relic density, direct and indirect detection, including non-perturbative Sommerfeld enhancement for the latter. Collider signatures of the proposed model are also examined. Our findings suggest that the model remains consistent with experimental constraints, particularly for dark matter masses on the order of dozens of TeV, and could potentially be tested using $\gamma$-ray observatories such as CTA.</description>

Abstract: We address the discovery and characterisation of toponium production at the Large Hadron Collider. In the dilepton decay mode, multivariate analyses of spin and colour observables could provide evidence that an excess of events present near the $t \bar t$ threshold corresponds to a spin-zero colour singlet. The semileptonic decay mode may also exhibit an excess near threshold, but is not expected to play any role in the toponium characterisation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hierarchy problem is associated with the renormalization and decoupling. We can account for the smallness of the scalar mass against loop corrections and its insensitivity to ultraviolet physics by the decoupling of heavy fields. It is essential to correctly identify the observable parameters as the renormalized ones as opposed to the bare ones. The renormalized loop corrections are finite, independent of regularization and perturbatively expandable. They are suppressed as powers of the external momentum to the mass (of the field in the loop) ratio, according to the Appelquist-Carazzone decoupling theorem which we complete for the case of the scalar mass.</description>

Abstract: The need for accurate and precise polarised parton distribution functions (PDFs) is becoming increasingly crucial in view of the Electron-Ion Collider experimental program foreseen in the coming years. Two global PDF determinations at next-to-next-to-leading order accuracy have been recently presented, MAPPDFpol1.0 and BDSSV24. I review the former and I provide a comparative discussion of other PDF sets accurate to next-to-leading order. I show that differences between these PDF sets, due to the choice of experimental and methodological input, exceed differences due to perturbative accuracy.</description>

Abstract: The High-Energy Factorisation (HEF) coefficient function or impact factor for the hadroproduction of the state ${}^1S_0^{[1]}$ of a heavy quark-antiquark pair ($Q\bar{Q}$) at forward rapidities is computed at NLO in $\alpha_s$. This impact factor is an integral part of the resummation procedure for higher-order QCD corrections to the hadroproduction cross sections of $\eta_c$ or $\eta_b$ mesons at forward rapidities in collinear factorisation (CF), enhanced by logarithms of partonic center of mass energy. The NLO computation results of which are presented in this contribution, is an important step towards an extension of aforementioned resummation beyond the Leading Logarithmic Approximation(LLA).</description>

      <title>The next frontiers for magnetic monopole searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic monopoles (MMs) are well-motivated hypothetical particles whose discovery would symmetrize Maxwell equations, explain quantization of electric charge, and probe the gauge structure of the unified theory. Recent models predict MMs with low masses, reinvigorating searches at colliders. However, most theories predict composite MMs, whose production in parton-parton collisions is expected to be suppressed. The Schwinger process, whereby MM pairs tunnel through the vacuum barrier in the presence of a strong magnetic field, is not subject to this limitation. Additionally, the Schwinger cross section can be calculated nonperturbatively. Together, these make it a golden channel for low-mass MM searches. We investigate the Schwinger production of MMs in heavy-ion collisions at future colliders, in collisions of cosmic rays with the atmosphere, and in decay of magnetic fields of cosmic origin. We find that a next-generation collider would provide the best sensitivity. At the same time, exploiting the infrastructure of industrial ore extraction and Antarctic ice drilling could advance the field at a faster timescale and with only a modest investment. We also propose deploying dedicated MM detectors in conjunction with cosmic ray observatories to directly investigate if the unexplained, highest energy cosmic rays are MMs. Together, the proposed efforts would define the field of MM searches in the next decades.</description>

      <title>Baryon stopping and charge deposition in heavy-ion collisions due to gluon saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute baryon and electric charge deposition in high-energy heavy-ion collisions using the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) Effective Field Theory, where at leading order charge is deposited through multiple scatterings of valence quarks with a saturated gluon target. A simplified phenomenological formula is derived to describe charge deposition, from which the parametrical dependence with collisional energy and geometry can be extracted. We present an approximate analytical prediction of the so-called baryon stopping parameter $\alpha_B$, which shows excellent agreement with the state-of-the art extractions of $\alpha_B$ from experimental data. These results are further validated using the McDIPPER framework, by computing charge deposition at midrapidity across a range of collision energies ($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}= 62.4 - 5020$ GeV).</description>

      <title>Gradient corrections to the quantum effective action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.12142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the quantum effective action up to second order in gradients and up to two-loop order for an interacting scalar field theory. This expansion of the effective action is useful to study problems in cosmological settings where spatial or time gradients are important, such as bubble nucleation in first-order phase transitions. Assuming spacetime dependent background fields, we work in Wigner space and perform a midpoint gradient expansion, which is consistent with the equations of motion satisfied by the propagator. In particular, we consider the fact that the propagator is non-trivially constrained by an additional equation of motion, obtained from symmetry requirements. At one-loop order, we show the calculations for the case of a single scalar field and then generalise the result to the multi-field case. While we find a vanishing result in the single field case, the one-loop second-order gradient corrections can be significant when considering multiple fields. As an example, we apply our result to a simple toy model of two scalar fields with canonical kinetic terms and mass mixing at tree-level. Finally, we calculate the two-loop one-particle irreducible (1PI) effective action in the single scalar field case, and obtain a nonrenormalisable result. The theory is rendered renormalisable by adding two-particle irreducible (2PI) counterterms, making the 2PI formalism the right framework for renormalization when resummed 1PI two-point functions are used in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Liouvillian Dynamics of the Open Schwinger Model: String Breaking and Kinetic Dissipation in a Thermal Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03878v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of bound state formation is one of the fundamental questions in confining quantum field theories such as Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). One hadronization mechanism that has garnered significant attention is the breaking of a string initially connecting a fermion and an anti-fermion. Deepening our understanding of real-time string-breaking dynamics with simpler, lower dimensional models like the Schwinger model can improve our understanding of the hadronization process in QCD and other confining systems found in condensed matter and statistical systems. In this paper, we consider the string-breaking dynamics within the Schwinger model and investigate its modification inside a thermal medium, treating the Schwinger model as an open quantum system coupled to a thermal environment. Within the regime of weak coupling between the system and environment, the real-time evolution of the system can be described by a Lindblad evolution equation. We analyze the Liouvillian gaps of this Lindblad equation and the time dependence of the system's von Neumann entropy. We observe that the late-time relaxation rate decreases as the environment correlation length increases. Moreover, when the environment correlation length is infinite, the system exhibits two steady states, one in each of the sectors with definite charge-conjugation-parity (CP) quantum numbers. For parameter regimes where an initial string breaks in vacuum, we observe a delay of the string breaking in the medium, due to kinetic dissipation effects. Conversely, in regimes where an initial string remains intact in vacuum time evolution, we observe string breaking (melting) in the thermal medium. We further discuss how the Liouvillian dynamics of the open Schwinger model can be simulated on quantum computers and provide an estimate of the associated Trotter errors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The redshifted 21cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn is expected to provide unprecedented insights into early Universe astrophysics and cosmology. Here we explore how dark matter can heat the intergalactic medium before the first galaxies, leaving a distinctive imprint in the 21cm power spectrum. We provide the first dedicated Fisher matrix forecasts on the sensitivity of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) telescope to dark matter decays. We show that with 1000 hours of observation, HERA has the potential to improve current cosmological constraints on the dark matter decay lifetime by up to three orders of magnitude. Even in extreme scenarios with strong X-ray emission from early-forming, metal-free galaxies, the bounds on the decay lifetime would be improved by up to two orders of magnitude. Overall, HERA shall improve on existing limits for dark matter masses below $2$ GeV$/c^2$ for decays into $e^+e^-$ and below few MeV$/c^2$ for decays into photons.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-gamma-ray emission at low-luminosity from CCO 1E 1207.4-5209 and its Host SNR G296.5+10.0</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10903v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin and acceleration mechanisms of energetic particles in the universe remain enigmatic in contemporary astrophysics. Recent efforts have focused on identifying Galactic sources capable of accelerating particles to 1 PeV, known as PeVatrons, and also identifying sources contributing to the spectrum at lower energies. The different morphology of galactic supernova remnants is directly related to the type of stellar explosion and the existence of a possible Compact Central Object (CCO), which possess intense radiative-gravitational fields on their surfaces. These CCOs, due to their strong fields and interactions with surrounding magnetic clouds, are potential candidates for gamma ray production. Through observations of the compact X-ray source 1E 1207.4-5209, located near the remnant G296.5+10.0, and using the enhanced GALPROP code, we analyze the emission of gamma-ray and cosmic-ray production through propagation. Additionally, we calculate the contribution of the G296.5+10.0 source to the overall observed Galactic cosmic-ray flux, taking into account cosmic-ray propagation within the Galaxy, which includes energy losses and particle interactions. Our findings suggest that this setup offers a fertile environment for producing a wide range of cosmic-ray energies at low energy within the Galaxy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17217v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) remain a viable dark matter candidate in the asteroid-mass range. We point out that in this scenario, the PBH abundance would be large enough for at least one object to cross through the inner Solar System per decade. Since Solar System ephemerides are modeled and measured to extremely high precision, such close encounters could produce detectable perturbations to orbital trajectories with characteristic features. We evaluate this possibility with a suite of simple Solar System simulations, and we argue that the abundance of asteroid-mass PBHs can plausibly be probed by existing and near-future data.</description>

      <title>Gauge Theory Bootstrap: Pion amplitudes and low energy parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the Gauge Theory Bootstrap method proposed in our previous work [arXiv:2309.12402], we compute pion scattering phase shifts for all partial waves with angular momentum $\ell\le 3$ up to 2 GeV and calculate the low energy $\chi$PT coefficients $\bar{\ell}_{1,2,4,6}$. The method looks for the most general S-matrix that matches at low energy the tree level amplitudes of the non-linear sigma model and at high energy, QCD sum rules and form factors. This is a theoretical/numerical calculation that uses as only data the pion mass $m_\pi$, pion decay constant $f_\pi$ and the QCD parameters $N_c=3$, $N_f=2$, $m_q$ and $\alpha_s$. All results are in reasonable agreement with experiment. In particular, we find the $\rho(770)$, $f_2(1270)$ and $\rho(1450)$ resonances and some initial indication of particle production near the resonances. The interplay between the UV gauge theory and low energy pion physics is an example of a general situation where we know the microscopic theory as well as the effective theory of long wavelength fluctuations but we want to solve the strongly coupled dynamics at intermediate energies. The bootstrap builds a bridge between the low and high energy by determining the consistent S-matrix that matches both and provides, in this case, a new direction to understand the strongly coupled physics of gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Cavity Detection of Gravitational Waves: Where Do We Stand?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs) are predicted in various exotic scenarios involving both cosmological and astrophysical sources. These elusive signals have recently sparked the interest of a diverse community of researchers, due to the possibility of HFGW detection in the laboratory through graviton-photon conversion in strong magnetic fields. Notable examples include the redesign of the resonant cavities currently under development to detect the cosmic axion. In this work, we derive the sensitivities of some existing and planned resonant cavities to detect a HFGW background. As a concrete scenario, we consider the collective signals that originate from the merging of compact objects, such as two primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid mass window. Our findings improve over existing work by explicitly discussing and quantifying the loss in the experimental reach due to the actual coherence of the source. We elucidate on the approach we adopt in relation with recent literature on the topic. Most notably, we give a recipe for the estimate of the stochastic background that focuses on the presence of the signal in the cavity at all times and showing that, in the relevant PBH mass region, the signal is dominated by coherent binary mergers.</description>

      <title>Simple fits for the neutrino luminosities from protoneutron star cooling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00769v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple fit function, $L_{\nu_i}(t) = C\, t^{-\alpha}\, e^{-(t/\tau)^{n}}$, to parametrize the luminosities of neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors during the protoneutron star (PNS) cooling phase at post-bounce times $t \gtrsim 1$ s. This fit is based on results from a set of neutrino-hydrodynamics simulations of core-collapse supernovae in spherical symmetry. The simulations were performed with an energy-dependent transport for six neutrino species and took into account the effects of convection and muons in the dense and hot PNS interior. We provide values of the fit parameters $C$, $\alpha$, $\tau$, and $n$ for different neutron star masses and equations of state as well as correlations between these fit parameters. Our functional description is useful for analytic supernova modeling, for characterizing the neutrino light curves in large underground neutrino detectors, and as a tool to extract information from measured signals on the mass and equation of state of the PNS and on secondary signal components on top of the PNS's neutrino emission.</description>

      <title>Silk Damping in Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves: A Novel Probe for New Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Silk damping is well known in the study of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and accounts for suppression of the angular power spectrum of CMB on large angular multipoles. In this Letter, we study the effect of Silk damping on the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs). Resulting from the dissipation of cosmic fluid, the Silk damping notably suppresses the energy-density spectrum of SIGWs on scales comparable to a diffusion scale at the decoupling time of feebly-interacting particles. The effect offers a novel observable for probing the underlying particle interaction, especially for those mediated by heavy gauge bosons beyond the standard model of particles. We anticipate that pulsar timing arrays are sensitive to gauge bosons with mass $\sim10^{3}-10^{4}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, while space- and ground-based interferometers to those with mass $\sim10^7-10^{12}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, leading to essential complements to on-going and future experiments of high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Nonradial instabilities in anisotropic neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-radial oscillation modes of a neutron star possess valuable information about its internal structure and nuclear physics. Starting from the quadrupolar order, such modes under general relativity are known as quasi-normal modes since they dissipate energy through gravitational radiation and their frequencies are complex. The stability of these modes is governed by the sign of the imaginary part of the frequency, which determines whether the mode would decay or grow over time. In this Letter, we develop a fully consistent framework in general relativity to study quasi-normal modes of neutron stars with anisotropic pressure, whose motivation includes strong internal magnetic fields and non-vanishing shear or viscosity. We employ parametrized models for the anisotropy and solve the perturbed Einstein field equations numerically. We find that, unlike the case for isotropic neutron stars, the imaginary parts of some of the pressure ($p$-)modes flip signs as the degree of anisotropy deviates from zero, depicting a transition from stable modes to unstable modes. This finding indicates that some anisotropic neutron star models are unstable, potentially restricting the form of sustained anisotropy.</description>

      <title>A power spectrum approach to the search for Axion-like Particles from resolved galaxy clusters using CMB as a backlight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axions or ALPs are hypothetical particles predicted by BSM theories, which make one of the dark matter candidates. These particles can convert into photons and vice-versa in the presence of magnetic field, with a probability decided by its coupling strength $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma}}$. One of the ways to detect these particles is using the CMB as a backlight. As the CMB photons pass through a galaxy cluster, they can get converted into ALPs in the mass range $10^{-15}$ eV to $10^{-11}$ eV through resonant conversion in the presence of cluster magnetic fields. This leads to a polarized spectral distortion ($\alpha$-distortion) in the CMB as the photon polarization parallel to the magnetic field in the galaxy cluster is involved in the conversion. The fluctuations in the magnetic field and electron density in a galaxy cluster lead to spatially varying $\alpha$-distortion around the cluster, with a power spectrum that is different from the lensed CMB polarization power spectrum for the standard model of cosmology. By measuring the difference in the polarization power spectrum around a galaxy cluster from the all-sky signal, one can find new $\alpha$-distortion in the sky. For galaxy clusters resolvable in multiple EM bands, one can measure the coupling strength $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma}}$ from the ALP power spectrum. Using multi-frequency techniques like ILC to clean the foregrounds, we show that the new power spectrum-based approach of the resolved galaxy clusters from upcoming CMB experiments such as Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 can detect (or put constraints) on the ALP-photon coupling strength of $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma} &lt; 5.2 \times 10^{-12} \, GeV^{-1}}$ and $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma} &lt; 3.6 \times 10^{-12} \, GeV^{-1}}$ at 95\% C.I. respectively for ALPs of masses $10^{-13}$ eV or for smaller $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma}}$ for lighter ALP masses (Abridged).</description>

      <title>Modular Invariant Starobinsky Inflation and the Species Scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Potentials in cosmological inflation often involve scalars with trans-Planckian ranges. As a result, towers of states become massless and their presence pushes the fundamental scale not to coincide with $M_{\rm P}$ but rather with the $species\, scale$, $\Lambda$. This scale transforms as an automorphic form of the theory's duality symmetries. We propose that the inflaton potential should be 1) an automorphic invariant form, non-singular over all moduli space, 2) depending only on $\Lambda$ and its field derivatives, and 3) approaching constant values in the large moduli to ensure a long period of inflation. These conditions lead to the proposal $V \sim \lambda(\phi, \phi^*)$, with $\lambda = G^{i\bar{j}} (\partial_i \Lambda)(\partial_{\bar{j}} \Lambda) / \Lambda^2$, determining the 'species scale convex hull'. For a single elliptic complex modulus with $SL(2, Z)$ symmetry, this results in an inflaton potential $V \simeq (\text{Im} \tau)^2 |\tilde{G}_2|^2 / N^2$, with $N \simeq -\log(\text{Im} \tau |\eta(\tau)|^4)$, where $\eta$ is the Dedekind function and $\tilde{G}_2$ the Eisenstein modular form of weight 2. Surprisingly, this potential at large modulus resembles that of the Starobinsky model. We compute inflation parameters yielding results similar to Starobinsky's, but extended to modular invariant expressions. Interestingly, the number of e-folds is proportional to the number of species in the tower, $N_e \simeq N$, and $\epsilon \simeq \Lambda^4$ at large moduli, suggesting that the tower of states plays an important role in the inflation process.</description>

      <title>Heavy-flavor mesons in a strong electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Very strong electromagnetic field can be generated in peripheral relativistic heavy ion collisions. This work is devoted to exploring the interplay between the effects of a constant external electric field and confining potential on heavy-flavor mesons. As the corresponding vector potential linearly depends on one spatial coordinate for a constant electric field, it might be able to overcome the linear confining potential of QCD and induce deconfinement. To perform analytic calculations and for comparison, one and two dimensional systems are studied together with the realistic three dimensional systems. The one dimensional Schr$\ddot{\text o}$dinger equation can be solved analytically with the help of Airy functions, and deconfinement is indeed realized when the electric field is larger than the string tension. Focus on the confining case, the two and three dimensional Schr$\ddot{\text o}$dinger equations can be solved analytically in large $r$ limit with the help of elliptic cosine/sine functions, and the wave functions are dominated by the region antiparallel to the electric field. When a more realistic potential is applied, a non-monotonic feature is found for $\Upsilon(2S)$ and $\Upsilon(3S)$-like mesons with increasing electric field.</description>

      <title>S-Matrix Bootstrap and Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the S-matrix bootstrap analysis of theories with non-invertible symmetries in (1+1) dimensions. Our previous work showed that crossing symmetry of S-matrices in such theories is modified, with modification characterized by the fusion category data. By imposing unitarity, symmetry and the modified crossing, we constrain the space of consistent S-matrices, identifying integrable theories with non-invertible symmetries at the cusps of allowed regions. We also extend the modified crossing rules to cases where vacua transform in non-regular representations of fusion category, utilizing a connection to a dual category $\mathscr C^{*}_{\mathscr{M}}$ and Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT). This highlights the utility of SymTFT in the analysis of scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Primordial regular black holes as all the dark matter (I): tr-symmetric metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are usually assumed to be described by the Schwarzschild or Kerr metrics, which however feature unwelcome singularities. We study the possibility that PBHs are non-singular objects, considering four phenomenological, regular tr-symmetric space-times, featuring either de Sitter or Minkowski cores. We characterize the evaporation of these PBHs and constrain their abundance from $\gamma$-ray observations. For three of the metrics, including the well-known Bardeen and Hayward ones, we show that constraints on $f_{\text{pbh}}$, the fraction of dark matter (DM) in the form of PBHs, weaken with respect to the Schwarzschild limits, because of modifications to the PBH temperature and greybody factors. This moves the lower edge of the asteroid mass window down by up to an order of magnitude, leading to a much larger region of parameter space where PBHs can make up all the DM. A companion paper is instead devoted to non-tr-symmetric metrics, including loop quantum gravity-inspired ones. Our work provides a proof-of-principle for the interface between the DM and singularity problems being a promising arena with a rich phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Primordial regular black holes as all the dark matter (II): non-tr-symmetric and loop quantum gravity-inspired metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is a common belief that a theory of quantum gravity should ultimately cure curvature singularities which are inevitable within General Relativity, and plague for instance the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics, usually considered as prototypes for primordial black holes (PBHs) as dark matter (DM) candidates. We continue our study, initiated in a companion paper, of non-singular objects as PBHs, considering three regular non-tr-symmetric metrics, all of which are one-parameter extensions of the Schwarzschild space-time: the Simpson-Visser, Peltola-Kunstatter, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli space-times, with the latter two motivated by loop quantum gravity. We study evaporation constraints on PBHs described by these regular metrics, deriving upper limits on $f_{\text{pbh}}$, the fraction of DM in the form of PBHs. Compared to their Schwarzschild counterparts, these limits are weaker, and result in a larger asteroid mass window where all the DM can be in the form of PBHs. Our work demonstrates as a proof-of-principle that quantum gravity-inspired space-times can simultaneously play an important role in the resolution of singularities and in the DM problem.</description>

      <title>A simple explanation for the absence of the spherical nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the EMC effect, the Cd puzzle and the SU3-IBM, a hypothesis can be given for a nucleus, that only the nucleus itself is a trivial (0,0) representation of the SU(3) group, which leads to a simple conclusion that spherical nucleus does not exist and the spherical mean field is not allowed. The key conclusion is that the color degree of freedom is required even at the low energy excitation of the nucleus.</description>
