      <title>Non naturally reductive Einstein metrics on the orthogonal group via real flag manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain new invariant Einstein metrics on the compact Lie groups
  $\SO(n)$ which are not naturally reductive. This is achieved by using the real flag manifolds $\SO(k_1+\cdots +k_p)/\SO(k_1)\times\cdots\times\SO(k_p)$ and by imposing certain symmetry assumptions in the set of all
  left-invariant metrics on $\SO(n)$.</description>

      <title>Coarse pseudo-differential calculus and index theory on manifolds with a tangent Lie structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a simplified (coarse) version of pseudo-differential calculus for operators of order zero on complete Riemannian manifolds. This calculus works for the usual Hormander (1,0) class of operators, as well as for pseudo-differential operators on filtered manifolds. In fact, we develop the coarse PDO calculus on a more general class of manifolds which we call manifolds with a tangent Lie structure. We prove an index theorem for `hypoelliptic' operators where the index is not just an integer, but an element of the K-homology group of the manifold.</description>

      <title>On the Geometry and Topology of Positively Curved Eschenburg Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present article explores the relationship between positive sectional curvature and the geometric and topological properties of Eschenburg $6$-orbifolds. First, we prove that positive sectional curvature imposes restrictions on the their singular sets, thereby confirming a conjecture posed by Florit and Ziller. Then we compute the orbifold cohomology rings for those with a specific singular locus. This reveals a distinctive behavior in the cohomology groups of positively curved Eschenburg orbifolds compared to their non-negatively curved counterparts. Furthermore, we compute the orbifold cohomology rings of all Eschenburg orbifolds.</description>

      <title>On Computing Elastic Shape Distances between Curves in d-dimensional Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computation of the elastic registration of two simple curves in higher dimensions and therefore of the elastic shape distance between them has been investigated by Srivastava et al. Assuming the first curve has one or more starting points, and the second curve has only one, they accomplish the computation, one starting point of the first curve at a time, by minimizing an L2 type distance between them based on alternating computations of optimal diffeomorphisms of the unit interval and optimal rotation matrices that reparametrize and rotate, respectively, one of the curves. We recreate the work by Srivastava et al., but in contrast to it, again for curves in any dimension, we present a Dynamic Programming algorithm for computing optimal diffeomorphisms that is linear, and justify in a purely algebraic manner the usual algorithm for computing optimal rotation matrices, the Kabsch-Umeyama algorithm, which is based on the computation of the singular value decomposition of a matrix. In addition, we minimize the L2 type distance with a procedure that alternates computations of optimal diffeomorphisms with successive computations of optimal rotation matrices for all starting points of the first curve. Carrying out computations this way is not only more efficient all by itself, but, if both curves are closed, allows applications of the Fast Fourier Transform for computing successively in an even more efficient manner, optimal rotation matrices for all starting points of the first curve.</description>

      <title>Multiple connecting geodesics of a Randers-Kropina metric via homotopy theory for solutions of an affine control system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a geodesic problem in a manifold endowed with a Randers-Kropina metric. This is a type of singular Finsler metric arising both in the description of the lightlike vectors of a spacetime endowed with a causal Killing vector field and in the Zermelo's navigation problem with a wind represented by a vector field having norm not greater than one. By using Lusternik-Schnirelman theory, we prove existence of infinitely many geodesics between two given points when the manifold is not contractible. Due to the type of nonholonomic constraints that the velocity vectors must satisfy, this is achieved thanks to a recent result about the homotopy type of the set of solutions of an affine control system with a controlled drift and related to a corank one, completely nonholonomic distribution of step 2.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Riemannian manifolds associated with locally conformal Riemannian product manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 3-dimensional Riemannian manifold equipped with a tensor structure of type $(1,1)$, whose fourth power is the identity, is considered. This structure acts as an isometry with respect to the metric. A Riemannian almost product manifold associated with such a manifold is also studied. It turns out, that the almost product manifold belongs to the class of locally conformal Riemannian product manifolds of the Naveira classification. Conditions for the additional structures of the manifolds to be parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita connection of the metric were found. Classes of almost Einstein manifolds and Einstein manifolds are determined and some of their curvature properties are obtained. As examples of these manifolds, a hypersurface is considered.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the Ooguri-Vafa symplectic form \`a la Atiyah-Bott</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaiotto, Moore, and Neitzke predicted that the hyperk\"ahler Ooguri-Vafa space $\mathcal{M}^{\rm ov}$ should provide a local model for Hitchin moduli spaces near the discriminant locus. To this end, Tulli identified $\mathcal{M}^{\rm ov}$ with a certain space of framed Higgs bundles with an irregular singularity. We extend this result by identifying the Ooguri-Vafa holomorphic symplectic form with a regularized version of the Atiyah-Bott form on the associated space of framed connections. We also prove the analogous statement for the corresponding semiflat forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note aims to give a better understanding and some remarks about recent preprint ``Spiral Minimal Products". In particular, 1. it should be pointed out that a generalized Delaunay construction among minimal Lagrangians of complex projective spaces has been set up. This is a general structural result working for immersion and current situations. 2. uncountably many new regular (or irregular) special Lagrangian cones with finite density and ``regular" (or irregular) special Lagrangian cones with infinite density in complex Euclidean spaces can be found.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Darboux Integrable Elliptic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize real elliptic differential systems whose solutions can be expressed in terms of holomorphic solutions to an associated holomorphic Pfaffian system $\mathcal H$ on a complex manifold. In particular, these elliptic systems arise as quotients by a group $G$ of the real differential system generated by the real and imaginary parts of $\mathcal H$, such that $G$ is the real form of a complex Lie group $K$ which is a symmetry group of $\mathcal H$. Subject to some mild genericity assumptions, we show that such elliptic systems are characterized by a property known as Darboux integrability. Examples discussed include first- and second-order elliptic PDE and PDE systems in the plane.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We relate the magnitude function to Brylinski's beta function of a closed manifold. For compact homogeneous spaces, we show that the residues of the beta function contain the same geometric information as the asymptotic expansion of the magnitude function. For general closed manifolds, we use the recent pseudodifferential analysis of the magnitude operator to show how the two relate to each other via an interpolating polynomial family. Beyond manifolds, the relation with the Brylinski beta function allows to deduce unexpected properties of the magnitude function for the $p$-adic integers.</description>

Abstract: We extend Smale's singular bridge principle (see \cite{NS2}) for $n$-dimensional strictly stable minimal cones in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ $(n \geq 7$) to arbitrary codimension when $n \geq 4$. We then apply the procedure to copies of the Lawson-Osserman cone to produce a four dimensional minimal graph in $\mathbb{R}^7$ with any finite number of isolated singularities.</description>

      <title>Functional Inequalities for doubly weighted Brownian Motion with Sticky-Reflecting Boundary Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give upper bounds for the Poincar\'e and Logarithmic Sobolev constants for doubly weighted Brownian motion on manifolds with sticky reflecting boundary diffusion under curvature assumptions on the manifold and its boundary. We therefor use an interpolation approach based on energy interactions between the boundary and the interior of the manifold and the weighted Reilly formula. Along the way we also obtain a lower bound on the first nontrivial doubly weighted Steklov eigenvalue and an upper bound on the norm of the doubly weighted boundary trace operator on Sobolev functions. We also consider the case of weighted Brownian motion with pure sticky reflection.</description>

  Integral representations for functions are key to get such inequalities. The proofs of the main results involves certain uniform estimates for the Green functions and their gradients on Riemannian manifolds, which are also established in the present work.</description>

      <title>Higher-dimensional Willmore energy as holographic entanglement entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vacuum entanglement entropy of a general conformal field theory (CFT) in $d=5$ spacetime dimensions contains a universal term, $F(A)$, which has a complicated and non-local dependence on the geometric details of the region $A$ and the theory. Analogously to the previously known $d=3$ case, we prove that for CFTs in $d=5$ which are holographically dual to Einstein gravity, $F(A)$ is equal to a four-dimensional version of the ``Willmore energy'' associated to a doubled and closed version of the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surface of $A$ embedded in $\mathbb{R}^5$. This generalized Willmore energy is shown to arise from a conformal-invariant codimension-two functional obtained by evaluating six-dimensional Conformal Gravity on the conically-singular orbifold of the replica trick. The new functional involves an integral over the doubled RT surface of a linear combination of three quartic terms in extrinsic curvatures and is free from ultraviolet divergences by construction. We verify explicitly the validity of our new formula for various entangling regions and argue that, as opposed to the $d=3$ case, $F(A)$ is not globally minimized by a round ball $A=\mathbb{B}^4$. Rather, $F(A)$ can take arbitrarily positive and negative values as a function of $A$. Hence, we conclude that the round ball is not a global minimizer of $F(A)$ for general five-dimensional CFTs.</description>

      <title>Critical Points of Chi-Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give here a semi-analytic formula for the density of critical values for chi random fields on a general manifold. The result uses Kac-Rice argument and a convenient representation for the Hessian matrix of chi fields, which makes the computation of their expected determinant much more feasible. In the high-threshold limit, the expression for the expected value of critical points becomes very transparent: up to explicit constants, it amounts to Hermite polynomials times a Gaussian density. Our results are also motivated by the analysis of polarization random fields in Cosmology, but they might lead to applications in many different environments.</description>

Abstract: A pseudo $H$-type Lie algebra naturally gives rise to a conformal pseudo-subriemannian fundamental graded Lie algebras. In this paper we investigate the prolongations of the associated fundamental graded Lie algebra and the associated conformal pseudo-subriemannian fundamental graded Lie algebra. In particular, we show that the prolongation of the associated conformal pseudo-subriemannian fundamental graded Lie algebra coincides with that of the associated fundamental graded Lie algebra under some assumptions.</description>

      <title>Proof of the Toponogov Conjecture on Complete Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.12787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Toponogov on complete convex planes, namely that such planes must contain an umbilic point, albeit at infinity. Our proof is indirect. It uses Fredholm regularity of an associated Riemann-Hilbert boundary value problem and an existence result for holomorphic discs with Lagrangian boundary conditions, both of which apply to a putative counterexample.
  Corollaries of the main theorem include a Hawking-Penrose singularity-type theorem, as well as the proof of a conjecture of Milnor's from 1965 in the convex case.</description>

Abstract: We prove that every hyperplane passing through the origin in $\rr^{n+1}$ divides an embedded compact free boundary minimal hypersurface of the euclidean $(n+1)$-ball in exactly two connected hypersurfaces. We also show that if a region in the $(n+1)$-ball has mean convex boundary and contains a nullhomologous $(n-1)$-dimensional equatorial disk, then this region is a closed halfball. Our first result gives evidence to a conjecture by Fraser and Li in any dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.13579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a compact K\"ahler manifold which either admits an extremal K\"ahler metric, or is a small deformation of such a manifold. We show that the blowup of the manifold at a point admits an extremal K\"ahler metric in K\"ahler classes making the exceptional divisor sufficiently small if and only if it is relatively K-stable, as predicted by the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture. We also give a geometric interpretation of what relative K-stability means in this case in terms of finite dimensional geometric invariant theory. This gives a complete solution to a problem introduced and solved by Arezzo, Pacard, Singer and Sz\'ekelyhidi for constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metrics in dimension at least three.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.01865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a closed surface and let $\{g_s \ | \ s \in (-\epsilon, \epsilon)\}$ be a smooth one-parameter family of Riemannian metrics on $M$. Also let $\{\kappa_s : M \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \ | \ s \in (-\epsilon, \epsilon)\}$ be a smooth one-parameter family of functions on $M$. Then the family $\{(g_s, \kappa_s) \ | \ s \in (-\epsilon, \epsilon)\}$ gives rise to a family of magnetic flows on $TM$. We show that if the magnetic curvatures are negative for $s \in (-\epsilon, \epsilon)$ and the lengths of each periodic orbit remains constant as the parameter $s$ varies, then there exists a smooth family of diffeomorphisms $\{f_s : M \rightarrow M \ | \ s \in (-\epsilon, \epsilon)\}$ such that $f_s^*(g_s) = g_0$ and $f_s^*(\kappa_s) = \kappa_0$. This generalizes a result of Guillemin and Kazhdan to the setting of magnetic flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In arXiv:2207.08617 [math.DG] Brendle-Hirsch-Johne proved that $T^m\times S^{n-m}$ does not admit metrics with positive $m$-intermediate curvature when $n\leq 7$. Chu-Kwong-Lee showed in arXiv:2208.12240 [math.DG] a corresponding rigidity statement when $n\leq 5$. In this paper, we show the sharpness of the dimension constraints by giving concrete counterexamples in $n\geq 7$ and extending the rigidity result to $n=6$. Concerning uniformly positive intermediate curvature, we show that simply-connected manifolds with dimension $\leq 5$ and bi-Ricci curvature $\geq 1$ have finite Urysohn 1-width. Counterexamples are constructed in dimension $\geq 6$.</description>

Abstract: We compute the (1,1)-Aeppli cohomology of compact simply-connected Lie groups. From this, we deduce that the Bismut flat metrics on the compact Bismut flat manifolds with finite fundamental group are globally stable for the pluriclosed flow. This prevents the existence of non-flat homogeneous Bismut Hermitian Einstein (hence also pluriclosed Calabi--Yau with torsion) metrics on C-spaces.</description>

Abstract: Given a compact surface with boundary, we introduce a family of functionals on the space of its Riemannian metrics, defined via eigenvalues of a Steklov-type problem. We prove that each such functional is uniformly bounded from above, and we characterize maximizing metrics as induced by free boundary minimal immersions in some geodesic ball of a round sphere. Also, we determine that the maximizer in the case of a disk is a spherical cap of dimension two, and we prove rotational symmetry of free boundary minimal annuli in geodesic balls of round spheres which are immersed by first eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Structure of Higher Algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of a \emph{higher-order algebroid}, as introduced by J\'o\'zwikowski and Rotkiewicz in their work \emph{Higher-order analogs of Lie algebroids via vector bundle comorphisms} (SIGMA, 2018), generalizes the concepts of a higher-order tangent bundle $\tau^k_M: \mathrm{T}^k M \to M$ and a (Lie) algebroid. This idea is based on a (vector bundle) comorphism approach to (Lie) algebroids and the reduction procedure of homotopies from the level of Lie groupoids to that of Lie algebroids. In brief, an alternative description of a Lie algebroid $(A, [\cdot, \cdot], \sharp)$ is a vector bundle comorphism $\kappa$, defined as the dual of the Poisson map $\varepsilon: \mathrm{T}^\ast A \to \mathrm{T} A^\ast$ associated with the Lie algebroid $A$. The framework of comorphisms has proven to be a suitable language for describing higher-order analogues of Lie algebroids from the perspective of the role played by (Lie) algebroids in geometric mechanics. In this work, we uncover the classical algebraic structures underlying the somewhat mysterious description of higher-order algebroids through comorphisms. For the case $k=2$, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between higher-order Lie algebroids and pairs consisting of a two-term representation (up to homotopy) of a Lie algebroid and a morphism to the adjoint representation of this algebroid.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we obtain that logarithmic Sobolev and $\mathcal{W}$- functionals have fantastic power series expansion formulas when we choose suitable test functions. By using these power series expansion formulas, we prove that if for some open subset $V$ in an $n$-dimensional manifold satisfying $$ \frac{ \int_V R d\mu}{\mathrm{Vol}(V)} \ge n(n-1)K$$ and the isoperimetric profile of $V$ satisfying $$ \operatorname{I}(V,\beta)\doteq \inf\limits_{\Omega\subset V,\mathrm{Vol}(\Omega)=\beta}\mathrm{Area}(\partial \Omega) \ge \operatorname{I}(M^n_K,\beta),$$ for all $\beta&lt;\beta_0$ and some $\beta_0&gt;0$, where $R$ is the scalar curvature and $M^n_K$ is the space form of constant sectional curvature $K$,then $\operatorname{Sec}(x)=K$ for all $x\in V$. We also get several other new scalar curvature rigidity theorems regarding isoperimetric profile, logarithmic Sobolev inequality and Perelman's $\boldsymbol{\mu}$-functional.</description>

Abstract: Let $M$ be a globally hyperbolic manifold with complete spacelike Cauchy hypersurface $\Sigma$. We prove well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for the Dirac operator on globally hyperbolic manifolds with complete Cauchy hypersurfaces. This result is needed as preparation in showing a Fredholmness result in the manner, provided by B\"ar and Strohmaier, for certain non-compact Cauchy hypersurfaces in future work. The results already have been published for a simpler setting in arxiv:2107.08532. This version is only focused on the Cauchy problem for a slightly modified setting.</description>

      <title>Non-degenerate Rigid Alignment in a Patch Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11620v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a set of overlapping local views (patches) of a dataset, we consider the problem of finding a rigid alignment of the views that minimizes a $2$-norm based alignment error. In general, the views are noisy and a perfect alignment may not exist. In this work, we characterize the non-degeneracy of an alignment in the noisy setting based on the kernel and positivity of a certain matrix. This leads to a polynomial time algorithm for testing the non-degeneracy of a given alignment. Subsequently, we focus on Riemannian gradient descent for minimizing the alignment error, providing a sufficient condition on an alignment for the algorithm to converge (locally) linearly to it. \revadd{Additionally, we provide an exact recovery and noise stability analysis of the algorithm}. In the case of noiseless views, a perfect alignment exists, resulting in a realization of the points that respects the geometry of the views. Under a mild condition on the views, we show that a non-degenerate perfect alignment \revadd{characterizes the infinitesimally rigidity of a realization, and thus the local rigidity of a generic realization}. By specializing the non-degeneracy conditions to the noiseless case, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the overlapping structure of the views for \revadd{a perfect alignment to be non-degenerate and equivalently, for the resulting realization to be infinitesimally rigid}. Similar results are also derived regarding the uniqueness of a perfect alignment and global rigidity.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Adam to Manifolds for Efficiently Training Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16901v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the primary reasons behind the success of neural networks has been the emergence of an array of new, highly-successful optimizers, perhaps most importantly the Adam optimizer. It is widely used for training neural networks, yet notoriously hard to interpret. Lacking a clear physical intuition, Adam is difficult to generalize to manifolds. Some attempts have been made to directly apply parts of the Adam algorithm to manifolds or to find an underlying structure, but a full generalization has remained elusive. In this work a new approach is presented that leverages the special structure of the manifolds which are relevant for optimization of neural networks, such as the Stiefel manifold, the symplectic Stiefel manifold, the Grassmann manifold and the symplectic Grassmann manifold: all of these are homogeneous spaces and as such admit a global tangent space representation. This global tangent space representation is used to perform all of the steps in the Adam optimizer and we are able to fully generalize the optimizer to manifolds without a projection step. The resulting algorithm is then applied to train a transformer for which orthogonality constraints are enforced up to machine precision and we observe significant speed-ups in the training process.</description>

      <title>Limit of geometric quantizations on K\"ahler manifolds with T-symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A compact K\"ahler manifold $\left( M,\omega ,J\right) $ with $T$-symmetry admits a natural mixed polarization $\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{mix}}$ whose real directions come from the $T$-action. In \cite{LW1}, we constructed a one-parameter family of K\"ahler structures $\left( \omega ,J_{t}\right) $'s with the same underlying K\"a hler form $\omega $ and $J_{0}=J$, such that (i) there is a $T$-equivariant biholomorphism between $\left( M,J_{0}\right) $ and $\left( M,J_{t}\right) $ and (ii) K\"ahler polarizations $\mathcal{P} _{t}$'s corresponding to $J_{t}$'s converge to $\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{mix}}$ as $t$ goes to infinity.
  In this paper, we study the quantum analog of above results. Assume $L$ is a pre-quantum line bundle on $\left( M,\omega \right) $. Let $\mathcal{H}_{t}$ and $ \mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{mix}}$ be quantum spaces defined using polarizations $\mathcal{P}_{t}$ and $\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{mix}}$ respectively. In particular, $\mathcal{H}_{t}=H_{\bar{\partial}_{t}}^{0}\left( M,L\right) $. They are both representations of $T$. We show that (i) there is a $T$-equivariant isomorphism between $\mathcal{H}_{0}$ and $\mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{mix}}$ and (ii) for regular $T$-weight $\lambda $, corresponding $\lambda $-weight spaces $ \mathcal{H}_{t,\lambda }$'s converge to $\mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{mix},\lambda }$ as $t$ goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Riemann curvature to Regge metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a generalization of the Riemann curvature tensor on manifolds (of dimension two or higher) endowed with a Regge metric. Specifically, while all components of the metric tensor are assumed to be smooth within elements of a triangulation of the manifold, they need not be smooth across element interfaces, where only continuity of the tangential components are assumed. While linear derivatives of the metric can be generalized as Schwartz distributions, similarly generalizing the classical Riemann curvature tensor, a nonlinear second-order derivative of the metric, requires more care. We propose a generalization combining the classical angle defect and jumps of the second fundamental form across element interfaces, and rigorously prove correctness of this generalization. Specifically, if a piecewise smooth metric approximates a globally smooth metric, our generalized Riemann curvature tensor approximates the classical Riemann curvature tensor arising from a globally smooth metric. Moreover, we show that if the metric approximation converges at some rate in a piecewise norm that scales like the $L^2$-norm, then the curvature approximation converges in the $H^{-2}$-norm at the same rate, under additional assumptions. By appropriate contractions of the generalized Riemann curvature tensor, this work also provides generalizations of scalar curvature, the Ricci curvature tensor, and the Einstein tensor in any dimension.</description>

      <title>On complex Lie algebroids with constant real rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We associate a real distribution to any complex Lie algebroid that we call distribution of real elements and a new invariant that we call real rank given by the pointwise rank of this distribution. When the real rank is constant we obtain a real Lie algebroid inside the original complex Lie algebroid. Under another regularity condition we associate a complex Lie subalgebroid that we call the minimum complex subalgebroid. We also we provide a local splitting for complex Lie algebroids with constant real rank. In the end, we introduce the complex matched pair of skew-algebroids, these pairs produce complex Lie algebroid structures on the complexification of a vector bundle. We use this operation to characterize all the complex Lie algebroid structures on the complexification of real vector bundles.</description>

      <title>Strong field behavior of Wang-Yau Quasi-local energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We look at the strong field behavior of the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy. In particular, we examine the limit of the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy as the defining spacelike $2$-surface $\Sigma$ approaches an apparent horizon from outside. Assuming that coordinate functions of the isometric embedding are bounded in $W^{2,1}$ and mean curvature vector of the image surface remains spacelike, we find that the limit falls in two exclusive cases: 1) If the horizon cannot be isometrically embedded into $R^3$, the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy blows up as $\Sigma$ approaches the horizon while the optimal embedding equation is not solvable for $\Sigma$ near the horizon; 2) If the horizon can be isometrically embedded into $R^3$, the optimal embedding equation is solvable up to the horizon with the unique solution at the horizon corresponding to isometric embedding into $R^3$ and the Wang-Yau quasi-local mass admits a finite limit at the horizon. We discuss the implications of our results in the conclusion section.</description>

      <title>Residue currents of cohesive modules and the generalized Poincar\'{e}-Lelong formula on complex manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cohesive module provides a tool to study coherent sheaves on complex manifolds by global analytic methods. In this paper we develop the theory of residue currents for cohesive modules on complex manifolds. In particular we prove that they have the duality principle and satisfy the comparison formula. As an application, we prove a generalized version of the Poincar\'{e}-Lelong formula for cohesive modules, which applies to coherent sheaves without globally defined locally free resolutions.</description>

      <title>From Clifford Bundles to Spinor Classification: Algebraic and Geometric Approaches, and New Spinor Fields in Flux Compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By bridging geometric and algebraic concepts, this dissertation lays the groundwork for a comprehensive study of the Clifford structures on bundles and spinor fields. We delve into the K\"ahler-Atiyah bundle, which encapsulates the essence of Clifford algebras and provides profound insights into the algebraic structures underlying geometric frameworks. The algebraic and classical definitions of spinors within Clifford algebras are concerned, as well as their global realisation as sections of the bundle of spinors constructed within a spin structure on a manifold from the K\"ahler-Atiyah bundle background which serves as an effective framework for applications involving spinors such as their classification based on their bilinear covariants and Fierz identities. Homogeneous differential forms playing the role of bilinear covariants can vanish due to algebraic obstructions in a warped flux compactification AdS$_3 \times M_8$ yielding the identification of new spinor field classes.</description>
