      <title>Approximate Birkhoff-James orthogonality preserver on Lebesgue-Bochner spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we examine an approximate version of Koldobsky-Blanco-Turn\v{s}ek theorem (namely, Property P) in the space of vector-valued integrable functions. More precisely, we prove that the Lebesgue-Bochner spaces $L^p(\mu,X),\;(1\leq p&lt;\infty)$, do not have Property P under certain conditions on $\mu$ and the Banach space $X$.</description>

      <title>An introduction of Berezin sectorial operators and its application to Berezin number inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of operators, called Berezin sectorial operators, which generalizes classical sectorial operators. We provide examples on the Hardy-Hilbert space showing that there exist operators that are Berezin sectorial but not sectorial and that the Berezin sectorial index can be strictly smaller than the classical one. We derive Berezin number inequalities for this class, including a weak version of the power inequality, and study geometric properties of the Berezin range for finite-rank and weighted shift operators on the Dirichlet space. We also raise the question of whether similar constructions are possible for composition-differentiation operators on the Dirichlet space.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-differential operators associated with the fractional Hankel-Bessel transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new class of pseudo-differential operators associated with a fractional Hankel--Bessel transform. Motivated by the classical Hankel transform and the pseudo-differential operators associated with Bessel operators studied by Pathak and Pandey \cite{PathakPandey1995}, we define a fractional variant by inserting a fractional Fourier-type phase into the Hankel kernel. We then introduce global Shubin-type symbol classes adapted to this transform, derive kernel estimates and integral representations, and establish boundedness results on weighted L^{p}-spaces and on fractional Hankel--Sobolev spaces. This provides a new framework parallel to the classical Hankel pseudo-differential calculus, but in a fractional and global setting.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz extension and Lipschitz-free spaces over nets in normed spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider subsets $S$ of a metric space $M$ such that Lipschitz mappings defined on $S$ can be extended to Lipschitz mappings on $M$, and we show that the union of such subsets has the same property under appropriate geometric conditions. We then derive several consequences to the isomorphic structure and classification of Lipschitz and Lipschitz-free spaces. Our main result is that the Lipschitz-free space $\mathcal{F}(M)$ is isomorphic to its countable $\ell_1$-sum when $M$ is either a net $N_X$ in any Banach space $X$ or the integer grid $\mathbb{Z}_{\ell_1}$ in $\ell_1$. We also prove that the Lipschitz space $\mathrm{Lip}_0(\mathbb{Z}_{\ell_1})$ is isomorphic to $\mathrm{Lip}_0(\ell_1)$ and that $\mathrm{Lip}_0(N_X)$ contains a complemented copy of $\mathrm{Lip}_0(X)$, among other results. This answers questions raised by Albiac, Ansorena, C\'uth and Doucha and Candido, C\'uth and Doucha, respectively, and extends previous results by the same authors as well as H\'ajek and Novotn\'y.</description>

      <title>The W-Operator: A Volterra Fractional Time Operator with Non-Bernstein Symbol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new two-parameter fractional time operator with Volterra structure, denoted by the W-operator, defined through a generalized Laplace symbol. The operator preserves the Caputo-type high-frequency behavior while allowing a controlled modification of the low-frequency regime through an additional parameter, leading to regularized memory effects. We develop a complete symbolic and Volterra theory, including explicit Prabhakar-type kernels, a left-inverse Volterra integral, and a fractional fundamental theorem of calculus. We show that the natural factorization of the Laplace symbol does not fit the classical Bernstein product mechanism and that the symbol is not a Bernstein function in general. Despite this non-Bernstein character, we establish well-posedness of abstract fractional Cauchy problems with sectorial generators by resolvent estimates and Laplace inversion, yielding a W-resolvent family with temporal regularity and smoothing properties. As an illustration, we apply the theory to a W-fractional diffusion model and discuss the influence of the modulation parameter on the relaxation of spectral modes.</description>

      <title>Rational-Kernel Fractional Evolution Equations with Almost Sectorial Operators: A Resolvent Framework Unifying ABC and W Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fractional evolution equations driven by rational-kernel time operators with non-singular memory, including the Atangana-Baleanu-Caputo operator and a generalized W-operator. These operators are characterized by Laplace symbols that do not necessarily belong to the classical Bernstein class. The analysis is carried out in the framework of almost sectorial operators, which allows resolvent estimates beyond standard analytic semigroup theory. Existence, uniqueness, and temporal regularity of mild solutions are established by Laplace transform techniques and contour integration, leading to the construction of associated resolvent families. A unified resolvent framework is developed, enabling a precise comparison between ABC and W dynamics and clarifying the influence of rational memory kernels on decay and smoothing properties. Several examples, including fractional diffusion-type equations, illustrate the abstract theory and highlight the impact of non-singular memory on long-time behavior.</description>

      <title>Matrix Fej\'er-Riesz type theorem for a union of an interval and a point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The matrix Fej\'er-Riesz theorem characterizes positive semidefinite matrix polynomials on the real line. In the previous work of the second-named author this was extended to the characterization on arbitrary closed semialgebraic sets $K$ in $\mathbb{R}$ by using matrix quadratic modules from real algebraic geometry. In the compact case there is a denominator-free characterization, while in the non-compact case denominators are needed except when $K$ is the whole line, an unbounded interval, a union of two unbounded intervals, and it was conjectured also when $K$ is a union of an unbounded interval and a point or a union of two unbounded intervals and a point. In this paper, we confirm this conjecture by solving the truncated matrix-valued moment problem (TMMP) on a union of a bounded interval and a point. The presented technique for solving the corresponding TMMP can potentially be used to determine degree bounds in the positivity certificates for matrix polynomials on compact sets $K$.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz-free spaces and Bossard's reduction argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We set up a descriptive set-theoretic framework to study Lipschitz-free spaces and use the reduction argument of Bossard to prove several results. We prove two universality results: if a separable Banach space is isomorphically universal for the class of Lipschitz-free spaces over the countable complete discrete metric spaces then it is isomorphically universal for the class of separable Banach spaces, and if a complete separable metric space is Lipschitz universal for the same class of metric spaces then it is Lipschitz universal for all separable metric spaces. We also show that there exist countable complete discrete metric spaces whose Lipschitz-free spaces fail the bounded approximation property and are thus not isomorphic to any dual Banach space. Finally, we calculate the descriptive complexity of the classes of separable Banach spaces and separable Lipschitz-free spaces having the approximation property.</description>

      <title>Study of Composition Operators in Certain Functional Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this thesis we study three problems. The first is the superposition of the operators and their proprities, such as boundedness,continuity,regularity and the inequalities of the norms of the composition of functions in some functional spaces. The second is to generalize some results of the composition of more than two functions, and the third is to give a generalization of Peetre's theorem.</description>
