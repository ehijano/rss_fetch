      <title>MotionLeaf: Fine-grained Multi-Leaf Damped Vibration Monitoring for Plant Water Stress using Low-Cost mmWave Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MotionLeaf , a novel mmWave base multi-point vibration frequency measurement system that can estimate plant stress by analyzing the surface vibrations of multiple leaves. MotionLeaf features a novel signal processing pipeline that accurately estimates fine-grained damped vibration frequencies based on noisy micro-displacement measurements from a mmWave radar. Specifically we explore the Interquartile Mean (IQM) of coherent phase differences from neighboring Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar chirps to calculate micro-displacements. Furthermore, we use the measurements from multiple received antennas in the radar to estimate the vibration signals of different leaves via a Blind Source Separation (BSS) method. Experimental results demonstrate that MotionLeaf can accurately measure the frequency of multiple leaves in a plant with average error of 0.0176 Hz, which is less than 50% of that (0.0416 Hz) of the state-of-the-art approach (mmVib). Additionally, the estimated natural vibration frequencies from MotionLeaf are shown to be an excellent feature to detect the water stress in the plant during 7-day drought experiments.</description>

      <title>Leafeon: Towards Accurate, Robust and Low-cost Leaf Water Content Sensing Using mmWave Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plant sensing plays an important role in modern smart agriculture and the farming industry. Remote radio sensing allows for monitoring essential indicators of plant health, such as leaf water content. While recent studies have shown the potential of using millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar for plant sensing, many overlook crucial factors such as leaf structure and surface roughness, which can impact the accuracy of the measurements. In this paper, we introduce Leafeon, which leverages mmWave radar to measure leaf water content non-invasively. Utilizing electronic beam steering, multiple leaf perspectives are sent to a custom deep neural network, which discerns unique reflection patterns from subtle antenna variations, ensuring accurate and robust leaf water content estimations. We implement a prototype of Leafeon using a Commercial Off-The-Shelf mmWave radar and evaluate its performance with a variety of different leaf types. Leafeon was trained in-lab using high-resolution destructive leaf measurements, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of leaf water content as low as 3.17% for the Avocado leaf, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches with an MAE reduction of up to 55.7%. Furthermore, we conducted experiments on live plants in both indoor and glasshouse experimental farm environments (see Fig. 1). Our results showed a strong correlation between predicted leaf water content levels and drought events.</description>

      <title>Delay Alignment Modulation with Hybrid Analog/Digital Beamforming for Millimeter Wave and Terahertz Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For millimeter wave (mmWave) or Terahertz (THz) communications, by leveraging the high spatial resolution offered by large antenna arrays and the multi-path sparsity of mmWave/THz channels, a novel inter-symbol interference (ISI) mitigation technique called delay alignment modulation (DAM) has been recently proposed. The key ideas of DAM are delay pre-compensation and path-based beamforming. However, existing research on DAM is mainly based on fully digital beamforming, which requires the number of radio frequency (RF) chains to be equal to the number of antennas. This paper proposes the hybrid analog/digital beamforming based DAM, including both fully and partially connected structures. The analog and digital beamforming matrices are designed to achieve performance close to DAM based on fully digital beamforming. While DAM was considered for the path-based channel model with integer delays in the previous work, this paper extends DAM to a more general tap-based model that accounts for fractional path delays. To further reduce the cost of channel estimation and improve the performance for wireless channels with fractional delays, DAM with codebook-based beam alignment and DAM-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DAM-OFDM) with hybrid beamforming are proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques is verified by extensive simulation results.</description>

      <title>TrustEMG-Net: Using Representation-Masking Transformer with U-Net for Surface Electromyography Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a widely employed bio-signal that captures human muscle activity via electrodes placed on the skin. Several studies have proposed methods to remove sEMG contaminants, as non-invasive measurements render sEMG susceptible to various contaminants. However, these approaches often rely on heuristic-based optimization and are sensitive to the contaminant type. A more potent, robust, and generalized sEMG denoising approach should be developed for various healthcare and human-computer interaction applications. This paper proposes a novel neural network (NN)-based sEMG denoising method called TrustEMG-Net. It leverages the potent nonlinear mapping capability and data-driven nature of NNs. TrustEMG-Net adopts a denoising autoencoder structure by combining U-Net with a Transformer encoder using a representation-masking approach. The proposed approach is evaluated using the Ninapro sEMG database with five common contamination types and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Compared with existing sEMG denoising methods, TrustEMG-Net achieves exceptional performance across the five evaluation metrics, exhibiting a minimum improvement of 20%. Its superiority is consistent under various conditions, including SNRs ranging from -14 to 2 dB and five contaminant types. An ablation study further proves that the design of TrustEMG-Net contributes to its optimality, providing high-quality sEMG and serving as an effective, robust, and generalized denoising solution for sEMG applications.</description>

      <title>MIMO Detection with Spatial Sigma-Delta ADCs: A Variational Bayesian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial Sigma-Delta ($\Sigma\Delta$) architecture can be leveraged to reduce the quantization noise and enhance the effective resolution of few-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) at certain spatial frequencies of interest. Utilizing the variational Bayesian (VB) inference framework, this paper develops novel data detection algorithms tailored for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with few-bit $\Sigma\Delta$ ADCs and angular channel models, where uplink signals are confined to a specific angular sector. We start by modeling the corresponding Bayesian networks for the $1^{\mathrm{st}}$- and $2^{\mathrm{nd}}$-order $\Sigma\Delta$ receivers. Next, we propose an iterative algorithm, referred to as Sigma-Delta variational Bayes (SD-VB), for MIMO detection, offering low-complexity updates through closed-form expressions of the variational densities of the latent variables. Simulation results show that the proposed $2^{\mathrm{nd}}$-order SD-VB algorithm delivers the best symbol error rate (SER) performance while maintaining the same computational complexity as in unquantized systems, matched-filtering VB with conventional quantization, and linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) methods. Moreover, the $1^{\mathrm{st}}$- and $2^{\mathrm{nd}}$-order SD-VB algorithms achieve their lowest SER at an antenna separation of one-fourth wavelength for a fixed number of antenna elements. The effects of the steering angle of the $\Sigma\Delta$ architecture, the number of ADC resolution bits, and the number of antennas and users are also extensively analyzed.</description>

      <title>WiDistill: Distilling Large-scale Wi-Fi Datasets with Trajectory Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wi-Fi based human activity recognition is a technology with immense potential in home automation, advanced caregiving, and enhanced security systems. It can distinguish human activity in environments with poor lighting and obstructions. However, most current Wi-Fi based human activity recognition methods are data-driven, leading to a continuous increase in the size of datasets. This results in a significant increase in the resources and time required to store and utilize these datasets. To address this issue, we propose WiDistill, a large-scale Wi-Fi datasets distillation method. WiDistill improves the distilled dataset by aligning the parameter trajectories of the distilled data with the recorded expert trajectories. WiDistill significantly reduces the need for the original large-scale Wi-Fi datasets and allows for faster training of models that approximate the performance of the original network, while also demonstrating robust performance in cross-network environments. Extensive experiments on the Widar3.0, XRF55, and MM-Fi datasets demonstrate that WiDistill outperforms other methods. The code can be found in https://github.com/the-sky001/WiDistill.</description>

      <title>Mutual Coupling-Aware Channel Estimation and Beamforming for RIS-Assisted Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the problems of channel estimation and beamforming for active reconfigurable intelligent surface~(RIS)-assisted communication, incorporating the mutual coupling~(MC) effect through an electromagnetically consistent model based on scattering parameters. We first demonstrate that MC can be incorporated into a compressed sensing~(CS) estimation formulation, albeit with an increase in the dimensionality of the sensing matrix. To overcome this increased complexity, we propose a two-stage strategy. Initially, a low-complexity MC-unaware CS estimation is performed to obtain a coarse channel estimate, which is then used to implement a dictionary reduction (DR) technique, effectively reducing the dimensionality of the sensing matrices. This method achieves low complexity comparable to the conventional MC-unaware approach while providing estimation accuracy close to that of the direct MC-aware CS method. We then consider the joint optimization of RIS configuration and base station (BS) combining in an uplink single-input multiple-output system. We employ an alternating optimization strategy where the BS combiner is derived in closed form for a given RIS configuration. The primary challenge lies in optimizing the RIS configuration, as the MC effect renders the problem non-convex and intractable. To address this, we propose a novel algorithm based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) and the Neumann series. Within the SCA framework, we propose a surrogate function that rigorously satisfies both convexity and equal-gradient conditions to update the iteration direction. Numerical results validate our proposal, demonstrating that the proposed channel estimation and beamforming methods effectively manage the MC in RIS, achieving higher spectral efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning for Gain-Phase Impairment Calibration in ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gain-phase impairments (GPIs) affect both communication and sensing in 6G integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). We study the effect of GPIs in a single-input, multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing ISAC system and develop a model-based unsupervised learning approach to simultaneously (i) estimate the gain-phase errors and (ii) localize sensing targets. The proposed method is based on the optimal maximum a-posteriori ratio test for a single target. Results show that the proposed approach can effectively estimate the gain-phase errors and yield similar position estimation performance as the case when the impairments are fully known.</description>

      <title>RespDiff: An End-to-End Multi-scale RNN Diffusion Model for Respiratory Waveform Estimation from PPG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Respiratory rate (RR) is a critical health indicator often monitored under inconvenient scenarios, limiting its practicality for continuous monitoring. Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, increasingly integrated into wearable devices, offer a chance to continuously estimate RR in a portable manner. In this paper, we propose RespDiff, an end-to-end multi-scale RNN diffusion model for respiratory waveform estimation from PPG signals. RespDiff does not require hand-crafted features or the exclusion of low-quality signal segments, making it suitable for real-world scenarios. The model employs multi-scale encoders, to extract features at different resolutions, and a bidirectional RNN to process PPG signals and extract respiratory waveform. Additionally, a spectral loss term is introduced to optimize the model further. Experiments conducted on the BIDMC dataset demonstrate that RespDiff outperforms notable previous works, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.18 bpm for RR estimation while others range from 1.66 to 2.15 bpm, showing its potential for robust and accurate respiratory monitoring in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale GNSS Spreading Code Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a bit-flip descent method for optimizing binary spreading codes with large family sizes and long lengths, addressing the challenges of large-scale code design in GNSS and emerging PNT applications. The method iteratively flips code bits to improve the codes' auto- and cross-correlation properties. In our proposed method, bits are selected by sampling a small set of candidate bits and choosing the one that offers the best improvement in performance. The method leverages the fact that incremental impact of a bit flip on the auto- and cross-correlation may be efficiently computed without recalculating the entire function. We apply this method to two code design problems modeled after the GPS L1 C/A and Galileo E1 codes, demonstrating rapid convergence to low-correlation codes. The proposed approach offers a powerful tool for developing spreading codes that meet the demanding requirements of modern and future satellite navigation systems.</description>

      <title>Direction Modulation Design for UAV Assisted by IRS with discrete phase shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a physical layer security technology, directional modulation (DM) can be combined with intelligent reflect-ing surface (IRS) to improve the security of drone communications. In this paper, a directional modulation scheme assisted by the IRS is proposed to maximize the transmission rate of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) secure communication. Specifically, with the assistance of the IRS, the UAV transmits legitimate information and main-tains its constellation pattern at the location of legitimate users on the ground, while the constellation pattern is disrupted at the eavesdropper's location. In order to solve the joint optimization problem of digital weight coefficients, UAV position, and IRS discrete phase shift, firstly, the digital weight vector and UAV position are optimized through power minimization. Secondly, three methods are proposed to optimize IRS phase shift, namely vector trajectory (VT) method, cross entropy vector trajectory (CE-VT) algorithm, and block coordinate descent vector trajectory (BCD-VT) algorithm. Compared to traditional cross entropy (CE) methods and block coordinate descent (BCD) methods, the proposed CE-VT and BCD-VT algorithms can improve transmission rate performance. The numerical results validate the effectiveness of the optimization scheme in IRS assisted UAV communication.</description>

      <title>Transmit Beampattern Synthesis for Active RIS-Aided MIMO Radar via Waveform and Beamforming Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conventional colocated multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radars, practical waveform constraints including peak-to-average power ratio, constant or bounded modulus lead to a significant performance reduction of transmit beampattern, especially when the element number is limited. This paper adopts an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS) to assist the transmit array and discusses the corresponding beampattern synthesis. We aim to minimize the integrated sidelobe-to-mainlobe ratio (ISMR) of beampattern by the codesign of waveform and ARIS reflection coefficients. The resultant problem is nonconvex constrained fractional programming whose objective function and plenty of constraints are variable-coupled. We first convert the fractional objective function into an integral form via Dinkelbach transform, and then alternately optimize the waveform and ARIS reflection coefficients. Three types of waveforms are unifiedly optimized by a consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (CADMM)-based algorithm wherein the global optimal solutions of all subproblems are obtained, while the ARIS reflection coefficients are updated by a concave-convex procedure (CCCP)-based algorithm. The convergence is also analyzed based on the properties of CADMM and CCCP. Numerical results show that ARIS-aided MIMO radars have superior performance than conventional ones due to significant reduction of sidelobe energy.</description>

      <title>Active Inference for Closed-loop transmit beamsteering in Fetal Doppler Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doppler ultrasound is widely used to monitor fetal heart rate during labor and pregnancy. Unfortunately, it is highly sensitive to fetal and maternal movements, which can cause the displacement of the fetal heart with respect to the ultrasound beam, in turn reducing the Doppler signal-to-noise ratio and leading to erratic, noisy, or missing heart rate readings. To tackle this issue, we augment the conventional Doppler ultrasound system with a rational agent that autonomously steers the ultrasound beam to track the position of the fetal heart. The proposed cognitive ultrasound system leverages a sequential Monte Carlo method to infer the fetal heart position from the power Doppler signal, and employs a greedy information-seeking criterion to select the steering angle that minimizes the positional uncertainty for future timesteps. The fetal heart rate is then calculated using the Doppler signal at the estimated fetal heart position. Our results show that the system can accurately track the fetal heart position across challenging signal-to-noise ratio scenarios, mainly thanks to its dynamic transmit beam steering capability. Additionally, we find that optimizing the transmit beamsteering to minimize positional uncertainty also optimizes downstream heart rate estimation performance. In conclusion, this work showcases the power of closed-loop cognitive ultrasound in boosting the capabilities of traditional systems.</description>

      <title>Near-Field ISAC in 6G: Addressing Phase Nonlinearity via Lifted Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is a promising component of 6G networks, fusing communication and radar technologies to facilitate new services. Additionally, the use of extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELLA) at the ISAC common receiver not only facilitates terahertz-rate communication links but also significantly enhances the accuracy of target detection in radar applications. In practical scenarios, communication scatterers and radar targets often reside in close proximity to the ISAC receiver. This, combined with the use of ELLA, fundamentally alters the electromagnetic characteristics of wireless and radar channels, shifting from far-field planar-wave propagation to near-field spherical wave propagation. Under the far-field planar-wave model, the phase of the array response vector varies linearly with the antenna index. In contrast, in the near-field spherical wave model, this phase relationship becomes nonlinear. This shift presents a fundamental challenge: the widely-used Fourier analysis can no longer be directly applied for target detection and communication channel estimation at the ISAC common receiver. In this work, we propose a feasible solution to address this fundamental issue. Specifically, we demonstrate that there exists a high-dimensional space in which the phase nonlinearity can be expressed as linear. Leveraging this insight, we develop a lifted super-resolution framework that simultaneously performs communication channel estimation and extracts target parameters with high precision.</description>

      <title>Degrees of Freedom of Holographic MIMO in Multi-user Near-field Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) is an emerging technology for 6G communications, in which numerous antenna units are integrated in a limited space. As the HMIMO array aperture expands, the near-field region of the array is dramatically enlarged, resulting in more users being located in the near-field region. This creates new opportunities for wireless communications. In this context, the evaluation of the spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) of HMIMO multi-user systems in near-field channels is an open problem, as the methods of analysis utilized for evaluating the DoF in far-field channels cannnot be directly applied due to the different propagation characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel method to calculate the DoF of HMIMO in multi-user near-field channels. We first derive the DoF for a single user in the near field, and then extend the analysis to multi-user scenarios. In this latter scenario, we focus on the impact of spatial blocking between HMIMO users. The derived analytical framework reveals that the DoF of HMIMO in multi-user near-field channels is not in general given by the sum of the DoF of the HMIMO single-user setting. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately estimate the DoF in HMIMO multi-user near-field channels in the presence of spatial blocking.</description>

      <title>Bias-VarianceTrade-off in Kalman Filter-Based Disturbance Observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of disturbance observers is strongly influenced by the level of prior knowledge about the disturbance model. The simultaneous input and state estimation (SISE) algorithm is widely recognized for providing unbiased minimum-variance estimates under arbitrary disturbance models. In contrast, the Kalman filter-based disturbance observer (KF-DOB) achieves minimum mean-square error estimation when the disturbance model is fully specified. However, practical scenarios often fall between these extremes, where only partial knowledge of the disturbance model is available. This paper investigates the inherent bias-variance trade-off in KF-DOB when the disturbance model is incomplete. We further show that SISE can be interpreted as a special case of KF-DOB, where the disturbance noise covariance tends to infinity. To address this trade-off, we propose two novel estimators: the multi-kernel correntropy Kalman filter-based disturbance observer (MKCKF-DOB) and the interacting multiple models Kalman filter-based disturbance observer (IMMKF-DOB). Simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>A novel hybrid and publicly available model for spur gear vibrations based on an efficient dynamic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic models hold great potential for research and development in signal processing, machine learning, and digital twin algorithms for diagnosing rotating machinery. Various studies have suggested dynamic models of gears, employing many model approaches. However, there is currently a lack of a computationally efficient and publicly accessible model that accurately represents real-world data. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid model that integrates a realistic and efficiently validated dynamic model of spur gear vibrations with an enhancement process aimed at bridging the gap between simulation and reality. This process minimizes discrepancies between features extracted from simulated and measured data through fine-tuning of the model hyperparameters. The effectiveness of this hybrid model is demonstrated across numerous test apparatuses, encompassing several types of faults, severities, and speeds. The new hybrid model, inclusive of an upgraded dynamic model, generates data swiftly within seconds and is made publicly available with a user-friendly application programming interface and a detailed user manual. The novel suggested hybrid model has great potential to enhance future research in model-based studies, including machine learning, signal processing, and digital twin approaches.</description>

      <title>Low Complexity Joint Channel Estimation and Data Detection for AFDM Receivers With Oversampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel low complexity time domain (TD) oversampling receiver framework under affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) waveforms for joint channel estimation and data detection (JCEDD). Leveraging a generalized doubly-dispersive channel model, we first derive the input-output (I/O) relationship for arbitrary waveforms when oversampled in the TD and present the I/O relationship for AFDM as an example. Subsequently, utilizing the multiple sample streams created via the oversampling procedure, we use the parametric bilinear Gaussian belief propagation (PBiGaBP) technique to conduct JCEDD for decoding the transmitted data and estimating the complex channel coefficients. Simulation results verify significant performance improvements both in terms of data decoding and complex channel coefficient estimation with improved robustness against a varying number of pilots over a conventional Nyquist sampling rate receiver.</description>

      <title>Improving Emotion Recognition Accuracy with Personalized Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emotion recognition through artificial intelligence and smart sensing of physical and physiological signals (Affective Computing) is achieving very interesting results in terms of accuracy, inference times, and user-independent models. In this sense, there are applications related to the safety and well-being of people (sexual aggressions, gender-based violence, children and elderly abuse, mental health, etc.) that require even more improvements. Emotion detection should be done with fast, discrete, and non-luxurious systems working in real-time and real life (wearable devices, wireless communications, battery-powered). Furthermore, emotional reactions to violence are not equal in all people. Then, large general models cannot be applied to a multiuser system for people protection, and customized and simple AI models would be welcomed by health and social workers and law enforcement agents. These customized models will be applicable to clusters of subjects sharing similarities in their emotional reactions to external stimuli. This customization requires several steps: creating clusters of subjects with similar behaviors, creating AI models for every cluster, continually updating these models with new data, and enrolling new subjects in clusters when required. A methodology for clustering data compiled (physical and physiological data, together with emotional labels) is presented in this work, as well as the method for including new subjects once the AI model is generated. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement of 4% in accuracy and 3% in f1-score w.r.t. the general model, along with a 14% reduction in variability.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Analysis of Spatial and Temporal Land Clutter Statistics in SAR Imaging Based on MSTAR Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The statistical analysis of land clutter for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging has become an increasingly important subject for research and investigation. It is also absolutely necessary for designing robust algorithms capable of performing the task of target detection in the background clutter. Any attempt to extract the energy of the desired targets from the land clutter requires complete knowledge of the statistical properties of the background clutter. In this paper, the spatial as well as the temporal characteristics of the land clutter are studied. Since the data for each image has been collected based on a different aspect angle; therefore, the temporal analysis contains variation in the aspect angle. Consequently, the temporal analysis includes the characteristics of the radar cross section with respect to the aspect angle based on which the data has been collected. In order to perform the statistical analysis, several well-known and relevant distributions, namely, Weibull, Log-normal, Gamma, and Rayleigh are considered as prime candidates to model the land clutter. The goodness-of-fit test is based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence metric. The detailed analysis presented in this paper demonstrates that the Weibull distribution is a more accurate fit for the temporal-aspect-angle statistical analysis while the Rayleigh distribution models the spatial characteristics of the background clutter with higher accuracy. Finally, based on the aforementioned statistical analyses and by utilizing the Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) algorithm, we perform target detection in land clutter. The overall verification of the analysis is performed by exploiting the Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) data-set, which has been collected in spotlight mode at X-band, and the results are presented.</description>

      <title>DJ Mix Transcription with Multi-Pass Non-Negative Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DJ mix transcription is a crucial step towards DJ mix reverse engineering, which estimates the set of parameters and audio effects applied to a set of existing tracks to produce a performative DJ mix. We introduce a new approach based on a multi-pass NMF algorithm where the dictionary matrix corresponds to a set of spectrogram slices of the source tracks present in the mix.
  The multi-pass strategy is motivated by the high computational cost resulting from the use of a large NMF dictionary. The proposed method uses inter-pass filtering to favor temporal continuity and sparseness and is evaluated on a publicly available dataset.
  Our comparative results considering a baseline method based on dynamic time warping (DTW) are promising and pave the way of future NMF-based applications.</description>

      <title>Anti-Malicious ISAC Using Proactive Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate proactive monitoring to mitigate malicious activities in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Our focus is on a scenario where a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) architecture is exploited by malicious actors. Malicious actors use multiple access points (APs) to illegally sense a legitimate target while communicating with users (UEs), one of which is suspected of illegal activities. In our approach, a proactive monitor overhears the suspicious UE and simultaneously sends a jamming signal to degrade the communication links between the APs and suspicious UE. Simultaneously, the monitor sends a precoded jamming signal toward the legitimate target to hinder the malicious sensing attempts. We derive closed-form expressions for the sensing signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR), as well as the received SINR at the UEs and overheard SINR at the monitor. The simulation results show that our anti-malicious CF-mMIMO ISAC strategy can significantly reduce the sensing performance while offering excellent monitoring performance.</description>

      <title>Spatial Multiplexing Oriented Channel Reconfiguration in Multi-IRS Aided MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial multiplexing plays a significant role in improving the capacity of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems. To improve the spectral efficiency (SE) of a point-to-point MIMO system, we exploit the channel reconfiguration capabilities provided by multiple intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) to enhance the spatial multiplexing. Unlike most existing works, we address both the issues of the IRSs placement and elements allocation. To this end, we first introduce an orthogonal placement strategy to mitigate channel correlation, thereby enabling interference-free multi-stream transmission. Subsequently, we propose a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based approach to jointly optimize the IRS elements and power allocation. Our theoretical analysis unveils that equal IRS elements/power allocation scheme becomes asymptotically optimal as the number of IRS elements and transmit power tend to be infinite. Numerical results demonstrate that when the total number of IRS elements or the power exceeds a certain threshold, a multi-IRS assisted system outperforms a single IRS configuration.</description>

Abstract: The timely precoding of frequency division duplex (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is a substantial challenge in practice, especially in mobile environments. In order to improve the precoding performance and reduce the precoding complexity, we propose a partial reciprocity-based precoding matrix prediction scheme and further reduce its complexity by exploiting the channel gram matrix. We prove that the precoders can be predicted through a closed-form eigenvector interpolation which was based on the periodic eigenvector samples. Numerical results validate the performance improvements of our schemes over the conventional schemes from 30 km/h to 500 km/h of moving speed.</description>

      <title>Round Trip Time Estimation Utilizing Cyclic Shift of Uplink Reference Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of fifth-generation new radio (5G NR) technology, it is not possible to directly obtain an absolute uplink (UL) channel impulse response (CIR) at the base station (gNB) from a user equipment (UE). The UL CIR obtained through the sounding reference signal (SRS) is always time-shifted by the timing advance (TA) applied at the UE. The TA is crucial for maintaining UL synchronization, and transmitting SRS without applying the TA will result in interference. In this work, we propose a new method to obtain absolute UL CIR from a UE and then use it to estimate the round trip time (RTT) at the gNB. This method requires enhancing the current 5G protocol stack with a new Zadoff-Chu (ZC) based wideband uplink reference signal (URS). Capitalizing on the cyclic shift property of the URS sequence, we can obtain the RTT with a significant reduction in overhead and latency compared to existing schemes. The proposed method is experimentally validated using a real-world testbed based on OpenAirInterface (OAI).</description>

      <title>Power Minimization with Rate Constraints for Multi-User MIMO Systems with Large-Size RISs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on the optimization of a single-cell multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with multiple large-size reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). The overall transmit power is minimized by optimizing the precoding coefficients and the RIS configuration, with constraints on users' signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs). The minimization problem is divided into two sub-problems and solved by means of an iterative alternating optimization (AO) approach. The first sub-problem focuses on finding the best precoder design. The second sub-problem optimizes the configuration of the RISs by partitioning them into smaller tiles. Each tile is then configured as a combination of pre-defined configurations. This allows the efficient optimization of RISs, especially in scenarios where the computational complexity would be prohibitive using traditional approaches. Simulation results show the good performance and limited complexity of the proposed method in comparison to benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Coverage Analysis for 3D Indoor Terahertz Communication System Over Fluctuating Two-Ray Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel analytical framework for a three-dimensional (3D) indoor terahertz (THz) communication system. Our proposed model incorporates more accurate modeling of wall blockages via Manhattan line processes and precise modeling of THz fading channels via a fluctuating two-ray (FTR) channel model. We also account for traditional unique features of THz, such as molecular absorption loss, user blockages, and 3D directional antenna beams. Moreover, we model locations of access points (APs) using a Poisson point process and adopt the nearest line-of-sight AP association strategy. Due to the high penetration loss caused by wall blockages, we consider that a user equipment (UE) and its associated AP and interfering APs are all in the same rectangular area, i.e., a room. Based on the proposed rectangular area model, we evaluate the impact of the UE's location on the distance to its associated AP. We then develop a tractable method to derive a new expression for the coverage probability by examining the interference from interfering APs and considering the FTR fading experienced by THz communications. Aided by simulation results, we validate our analysis and demonstrate that the UE's location has a pronounced impact on its coverage probability. Additionally, we find that the optimal AP density is determined by both the UE's location and the room size, which provides valuable insights for meeting the coverage requirements of future THz communication system deployment.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method to enhance the connectivity of multi-reconfigurable intelligent surface-assisted device-to-device networks, referred to as multi-RIS-assisted D2D networks, through a unique phase shift determination. The proposed method aims to optimize the power-domain array factor (PDAF), targeting specific azimuth angles of reliable user equipments (UEs) and enhancing network connectivity. We formulate an optimization problem that jointly optimizes RIS beamforming design, RIS-aided link selection, and RIS positioning. This problem is a mixed-integer non-binary programming. The optimization problem is divided into two sub-problems, which are solved individually and iteratively. The first sub-problem of RIS-aided link selection is solved using an efficient perturbation method while developing genetic algorithm (GA) to obtain RIS beamforming design. The GA optimizes the RIS phase shift to generate multiple RIS-aided narrowbeams that exhibit significant PDAF towards azimuth angles of interest while minimizing PDAF towards undesired azimuth angles. The second sub-problem of RIS positioning is addressed using the Adam optimizer. Numerical simulations verify the superiority of the proposed scheme in improving network connectivity compared to other schemes, including those utilizing distributed small RISs, each generating one RIS-aided link.</description>

      <title>Resource-Efficient Multiview Perception: Integrating Semantic Masking with Masked Autoencoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiview systems have become a key technology in modern computer vision, offering advanced capabilities in scene understanding and analysis. However, these systems face critical challenges in bandwidth limitations and computational constraints, particularly for resource-limited camera nodes like drones. This paper presents a novel approach for communication-efficient distributed multiview detection and tracking using masked autoencoders (MAEs). We introduce a semantic-guided masking strategy that leverages pre-trained segmentation models and a tunable power function to prioritize informative image regions. This approach, combined with an MAE, reduces communication overhead while preserving essential visual information. We evaluate our method on both virtual and real-world multiview datasets, demonstrating comparable performance in terms of detection and tracking performance metrics compared to state-of-the-art techniques, even at high masking ratios. Our selective masking algorithm outperforms random masking, maintaining higher accuracy and precision as the masking ratio increases. Furthermore, our approach achieves a significant reduction in transmission data volume compared to baseline methods, thereby balancing multiview tracking performance with communication efficiency.</description>

      <title>Distributed Collaborative User Positioning for Cell-Free Massive MIMO with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output system, which exhibits great potential in enhancing the capabilities of next-generation mobile communication networks. We first study the distributed positioning problem to lay the groundwork for solving resource allocation and interference management issues. Instead of relying on computationally and spatially complex fingerprint positioning methods, we propose a novel two-stage distributed collaborative positioning architecture with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) network, consisting of a received signal strength-based preliminary positioning network and an angle of arrival-based auxiliary correction network. Our experimental results demonstrate that the two-stage distributed collaborative user positioning architecture can outperform conventional fingerprint positioning methods in terms of positioning accuracy.</description>

      <title>Noise-Domain Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present noise-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (ND-NOMA), an innovative communication scheme that utilizes the modulation of artificial noise mean and variance to convey information. Distinct from traditional methods such as power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) that heavily relies on successive interference cancellation (SIC), ND-NOMA utilizes the noise domain, considerably reducing power consumption and system complexity. Inspired by noise modulation, ND-NOMA enhances energy efficiency and provides lower bit error probability (BEP), making it highly suitable for next-generation Internet-of-things (IoT) networks. Our theoretical analyses and computer simulations reveal that ND-NOMA can achieve exceptionally low bit error rates in both uplink and downlink scenarios, in the presence of Rician fading channels. The proposed multi-user system is supported by a minimum distance detector for mean detection and a threshold-based detector for variance detection, ensuring robust communication in low-power environments. By leveraging the inherent properties of noise, ND-NOMA offers a promising platform for long-term deployments of low-cost and low-complexity devices.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Based Multi-Objective Optimization for Integrated Sensing and Communications in UAV Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter investigates an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network with integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where multiple UAVs simultaneously sense the locations of ground users and provide communication services with radars. To find the trade-off between communication and sensing (C\&amp;S) in the system, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) to maximize the total network utility and the localization Cram\'er-Rao bounds (CRB) of ground users, which jointly optimizes the deployment and power control of UAVs. Inspired by the huge potential of large language models (LLM) for prediction and inference, we propose an LLM-enabled decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (LEDMA) for solving the highly non-convex MOP. We first adopt a decomposition-based scheme to decompose the MOP into a series of optimization sub-problems. We second integrate LLMs as black-box search operators with MOP-specifically designed prompt engineering into the framework of MOEA to solve optimization sub-problems simultaneously. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed LEDMA can find the clear trade-off between C\&amp;S and outperforms baseline MOEAs in terms of obtained Pareto fronts and convergence.</description>

      <title>Smart Jamming Attack and Mitigation on Deep Transfer Reinforcement Learning Enabled Resource Allocation for Network Slicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network slicing is a pivotal paradigm in wireless networks enabling customized services to users and applications. Yet, intelligent jamming attacks threaten the performance of network slicing. In this paper, we focus on the security aspect of network slicing over a deep transfer reinforcement learning (DTRL) enabled scenario. We first demonstrate how a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-enabled jamming attack exposes potential risks. In particular, the attacker can intelligently jam resource blocks (RBs) reserved for slices by monitoring transmission signals and perturbing the assigned resources. Then, we propose a DRL-driven mitigation model to mitigate the intelligent attacker. Specifically, the defense mechanism generates interference on unallocated RBs where another antenna is used for transmitting powerful signals. This causes the jammer to consider these RBs as allocated RBs and generate interference for those instead of the allocated RBs. The analysis revealed that the intelligent DRL-enabled jamming attack caused a significant 50% degradation in network throughput and 60% increase in latency in comparison with the no-attack scenario. However, with the implemented mitigation measures, we observed 80% improvement in network throughput and 70% reduction in latency in comparison to the under-attack scenario.</description>

      <title>Deep-Learning-Based Adaptive Error-Correction Decoding for Spin-Torque Transfer Magnetic Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-torque transfer magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM) is a promising emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) technology with wide applications. However, the data recovery of STT-MRAM is affected by the diversity of channel raw bit error rate (BER) across different dies caused by process variations, as well as the unknown resistance offset due to temperature change. Therefore, it is critical to develop effective decoding algorithms of error correction codes (ECCs) for STT-MRAM. In this article, we first propose a neural bit-flipping (BF) decoding algorithm, which can share the same trellis representation as the state-of-the-art neural decoding algorithms, such as the neural belief propagation (NBP) and neural offset min-sum (NOMS) algorithm. Hence, a neural network (NN) decoder with a uniform architecture but different NN parameters can realize all these neural decoding algorithms. Based on such a unified NN decoder architecture, we further propose a novel deep-learning (DL)-based adaptive decoding algorithm whose decoding complexity can be adjusted according to the change of the channel conditions of STT-MRAM. Extensive experimental evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed neural decoders can greatly improve the performance over the standard decoders, with similar decoding latency and energy consumption. Moreover, the DL-based adaptive decoder can work well over different channel conditions of STT-MRAM irrespective of the unknown resistance offset, with a 50% reduction of the decoding latency and energy consumption compared to the fixed decoder.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Energy-Harvesting Hybrid VLC/RF Networks with Random Receiver Orientation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates an indoor hybrid visible light communication (VLC) and radio frequency (RF) scenario with two-hop downlink transmission. A light emitting diode (LED) transmits both data and energy via VLC to an energy-harvesting relay node, which then uses the harvested energy to retransmit the decoded information to an RF user in the second phase. The design parameters include the direct current (DC) bias and the time allocation for VLC transmission. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the data rate under decode-and-forward relaying with fixed receiver orientation. The non-convex problem is decomposed into two sub-problems, solved iteratively by fixing one parameter while optimizing the other. Additionally, we analyze the impact of random receiver orientation on the data rate, deriving closed-form expressions for both VLC and RF rates. An exhaustive search approach is employed to solve the optimization, demonstrating that joint optimization of DC bias and time allocation significantly enhances the data rate compared to optimizing DC bias alone.</description>

      <title>Fast Variational Block-Sparse Bayesian Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00442v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a variational Bayesian (VB) implementation of block-sparse Bayesian learning (BSBL), which approximates the posterior probability density function (PDF) of the latent variables a factorzied proxy PDFs. The prior distribution of the BSBL hyperparameters is selected to be the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution. This choice unifies commonly used hyperpriors, e.g. the Gamma distribution, inverse Gamma distribution, and Jeffrey's improper prior. The resulting variational BSBL (VA-BSBL) algorithm updates in an iterative manner the proxi PDFs of the weights and hyperparameters. The proxy PDF of the weights only depends on the proxy PDFs of the hyperparameters through the means of the latter PDFs. We adopt a scheduling of the iterations in which the proxi PDF of a single hyperparameter and the proxi PDF of the weights are cyclically updated ad infinitum. The resulting sequence of means of the hyperparameter proxi PDFs computed in this way can be expressed as a nonlinear first-order recurrence relation. Hence, the fixed points of the recurrence relation can be used for single-step check for convergence of this sequence. Including this check procedure in the VA-BSBL, we obtain a fast version of the algorithm, coined fast-BSBL (F-BSBL), which shows a two-order-of-magnitude faster runtime. Additionally, we analyse a necessary condition for the existence of fixed points and show that only certain improper generalized inverse Gaussian hyperpriors induce a sparse estimate of the weights. Finally, we generalize this equivalence to BSBL. Specifically, we show that the presented VA-BSBL is equivalent to expectation-maximization (EM)-based Type-II-BSBL. As a result, the fast versions of them, i.e. FBSBL for the former and Type-II-BSBL using coordinate ascent for the latter, are equivalent as well. This result allows for reinterpreting previous works on BSBL within our framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05385v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid, reliable, and accurate interpretation of medical time-series signals is crucial for high-stakes clinical decision-making. Deep learning methods offered unprecedented performance in medical signal processing but at a cost: they were compute-intensive and lacked interpretability. We propose Sparse Mixture of Learned Kernels (SMoLK), an interpretable architecture for medical time series processing. SMoLK learns a set of lightweight flexible kernels that form a single-layer sparse neural network, providing not only interpretability, but also efficiency, robustness, and generalization to unseen data distributions. We introduce a parameter reduction techniques to reduce the size of SMoLK's networks while maintaining performance. We test SMoLK on two important tasks common to many consumer wearables: photoplethysmography (PPG) artifact detection and atrial fibrillation detection from single-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). We find that SMoLK matches the performance of models orders of magnitude larger. It is particularly suited for real-time applications using low-power devices, and its interpretability benefits high-stakes situations.</description>

      <title>Eating Speed Measurement Using Wrist-Worn IMU Sensors Towards Free-Living Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eating speed is an important indicator that has been widely investigated in nutritional studies. The relationship between eating speed and several intake-related problems such as obesity, diabetes, and oral health has received increased attention from researchers. However, existing studies mainly use self-reported questionnaires to obtain participants' eating speed, where they choose options from slow, medium, and fast. Such a non-quantitative method is highly subjective and coarse at the individual level. This study integrates two classical tasks in automated food intake monitoring domain: bite detection and eating episode detection, to advance eating speed measurement in near-free-living environments automatically and objectively. Specifically, a temporal convolutional network combined with a multi-head attention module (TCN-MHA) is developed to detect bites (including eating and drinking gestures) from IMU data. The predicted bite sequences are then clustered into eating episodes. Eating speed is calculated by using the time taken to finish the eating episode to divide the number of bites. To validate the proposed approach on eating speed measurement, a 7-fold cross validation is applied to the self-collected fine-annotated full-day-I (FD-I) dataset, and a holdout experiment is conducted on the full-day-II (FD-II) dataset. The two datasets are collected from 61 participants with a total duration of 513 h, which are publicly available. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.110 and 0.146 in the FD-I and FD-II datasets, respectively, showcasing the feasibility of automated eating speed measurement in near-free-living environments.</description>

      <title>Throughput Requirements for RAN Functional Splits in 3D-Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of non-terrestrial communication necessitates its integration with existing terrestrial networks, as highlighted in 3GPP Releases 16 and 17. This paper analyses the concept of functional splits in 3D-Networks. To manage this complex structure effectively, the adoption of a Radio Access Network (RAN) architecture with Functional Split (FS) offers advantages in flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency. RAN achieves this by disaggregating functionalities into three separate units. Analogous to the terrestrial network approach, 3GPP is extending this concept to non-terrestrial platforms as well. This work presents a general analysis of the requested Fronthaul (FH) data rate on feeder link between a non-terrestrial platform and the ground-station. Each split option is a trade-of between FH data rate and the respected complexity. Since flying nodes face more limitations regarding power consumption and complexity on board in comparison to terrestrial ones, we are investigating the split options between lower and higher physical layer.</description>

      <title>EEGMamba: Bidirectional State Space Model with Mixture of Experts for EEG Multi-task Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, with the development of deep learning, electroencephalogram (EEG) classification networks have achieved certain progress. Transformer-based models can perform well in capturing long-term dependencies in EEG signals. However, their quadratic computational complexity poses a substantial computational challenge. Moreover, most EEG classification models are only suitable for single tasks and struggle with generalization across different tasks, particularly when faced with variations in signal length and channel count. In this paper, we introduce EEGMamba, the first universal EEG classification network to truly implement multi-task learning for EEG applications. EEGMamba seamlessly integrates the Spatio-Temporal-Adaptive (ST-Adaptive) module, bidirectional Mamba, and Mixture of Experts (MoE) into a unified framework. The proposed ST-Adaptive module performs unified feature extraction on EEG signals of different lengths and channel counts through spatial-adaptive convolution and incorporates a class token to achieve temporal-adaptability. Moreover, we design a bidirectional Mamba particularly suitable for EEG signals for further feature extraction, balancing high accuracy, fast inference speed, and efficient memory-usage in processing long EEG signals. To enhance the processing of EEG data across multiple tasks, we introduce task-aware MoE with a universal expert, effectively capturing both differences and commonalities among EEG data from different tasks. We evaluate our model on eight publicly available EEG datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate its superior performance in four types of tasks: seizure detection, emotion recognition, sleep stage classification, and motor imagery. The code is set to be released soon.</description>

      <title>On the Optimal Radius and Subcarrier Mapping for Binary Modulation on Conjugate-Reciprocal Zeros</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the radius maximizing reliability for binary modulation on conjugate-reciprocal zeros (BMOCZ) implemented with both maximum likelihood (ML) and direct zero-testing (DiZeT) decoders. We first show that the optimal radius for BMOCZ is a function of the employed decoder and that the radius maximizing the minimum distance between polynomial zeros does not maximize the minimum distance of the final code. While maximizing zero separation offers an almost optimal solution with the DiZeT decoder, simulations show that the ML decoder outperforms the DiZeT decoder in both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and fading channels when the radius is chosen to maximize codeword separation. Finally, we analyze different sequence-to-subcarrier mappings for BMOCZ-based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). We highlight a flexible time-frequency OFDM waveform that avoids distortion introduced by a frequency-selective channel at the expense of a higher peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR).</description>

      <title>Fast Burst-Sparsity Learning Approach for Massive MIMO-OTFS Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate channel estimation in orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) systems with massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) configurations is challenging due to high-dimensional sparse representation (SR). Existing methods often face performance degradation and/or high computational complexity. To address these issues and exploit intricate channel sparsity structure, this letter first leverages a novel hybrid burst-sparsity prior to capture the burst/common sparse structure in the angle/delay domain, and then utilizes an independent variational Bayesian inference (VBI) factorization technique to efficiently solve the high-dimensional SR problem. Additionally, an angle/Doppler refinement approach is incorporated into the proposed method to automatically mitigate off-grid mismatches.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Framework for Forward and Inverse Problems in Guided Waves-Based Structural Health Monitoring Under Varying Environmental and Operating Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, guided waves-based techniques have garnered increased attention from researchers in the field of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) for damage detection and quantification. Extracting features that are sensitive to changes in structural conditions has become a critical step. Guided waves, being one of the most widely used techniques, are highly responsive to structural changes caused by various types of damage. However, due to disturbances from environmental and operational conditions (EOCs) and waveforms reflected from boundaries and damage in complex systems, manually extracting features related to the system state is challenging. To address this, various neural networks, capable of automatically deriving features, have been developed and applied to system identification tasks. Among these, Convolutional Autoencoders (CAEs) have proven effective as damage detectors, projecting data efficiently into a latent space. However, existing CAE-based models for damage diagnosis often overlook the influence of EOCs, which can significantly impact model performance. In this work, a scheme that provides accurate damage level classification while estimating EOCs, such as loading conditions, making the model adaptable to varying external factors is introduced. By restructuring and combining the CAE with feedforward neural networks (FFNNs), the proposed scheme also enables signal reconstruction, a potentially valuable feature when data is limited. The method has been validated on an aluminum plate with various damage levels under different loading conditions, achieving near-perfect state classification and low-error signal reconstruction. The framework has also been tested on incomplete datasets to verify its robustness.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Allocation of Payload Code Rate and Header Copies in LR-FHSS Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate the performance of the LoRaWAN Long-Range Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (LR-FHSS) technique using a device-level probabilistic strategy for code rate and header replica allocation. Specifically, we investigate the effects of different header replica and code rate allocations at each end-device, guided by a probability distribution provided by the network server. As a benchmark, we compare the proposed strategy with the standardized LR-FHSS data rates DR8 and DR9. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed strategy consistently outperforms the DR8 and DR9 standard data rates across all considered scenarios. Notably, our findings reveal that the optimal distribution rarely includes data rate DR9, while data rate DR8 significantly contributes to the goodput and energy efficiency optimizations.</description>

      <title>Reinforcenment Learning-Aided NOMA Random Access: An AoI-Based Timeliness Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the age-of-information (AoI) of a power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network, where multiple internet-of-things (IoT) devices transmit to a common gateway in a grant-free random fashion. More specifically, we consider a framed setup composed of multiple time slots, and resort to the $Q$-learning algorithm to properly define, in a distributed manner, the time slot and the power level each IoT device transmits within a frame. In the proposed AoI-QL-NOMA scheme, the $Q$-learning reward is adapted with the aim of minimizing the average AoI of the network, while only requiring a single feedback bit per time slot, in a frame basis. Our results show that AoI-QL-NOMA significantly improves the AoI performance compared to some recently proposed schemes, without significantly reducing the network throughput.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blood cell detection is a typical small-scale object detection problem in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a CST-YOLO model for blood cell detection based on YOLOv7 architecture and enhance it with the CNN-Swin Transformer (CST), which is a new attempt at CNN-Transformer fusion. We also introduce three other useful modules: Weighted Efficient Layer Aggregation Networks (W-ELAN), Multiscale Channel Split (MCS), and Concatenate Convolutional Layers (CatConv) in our CST-YOLO to improve small-scale object detection precision. Experimental results show that the proposed CST-YOLO achieves 92.7%, 95.6%, and 91.1% mAP@0.5, respectively, on three blood cell datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art object detectors, e.g., RT-DETR, YOLOv5, and YOLOv7. Our code is available at https://github.com/mkang315/CST-YOLO.</description>

      <title>Physical Layer Security Performance of Cooperative Dual RIS-aided V2V NOMA Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of physical layer security (PLS) in a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication system, where a transmitter vehicle exploits a dual reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to send confidential information to legitimate receiver vehicles under the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme in the presence of an eavesdropper vehicle. In particular, it is assumed that an RIS is near the transmitter vehicle and another RIS is close to the receiver vehicles to provide a wider smart radio environment. Besides, we suppose that the channels between two RISs suffer from the Fisher-Snedecor F fading model. Under this scenario, we first provide the marginal distributions of equivalent channels at the legitimate receiver vehicles by exploiting the central limit theorem (CLT). Then, in order to evaluate the PLS performance of the considered secure communication system, we derive analytical expressions of the average secrecy capacity (ASC), secrecy outage probability (SOP), and secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) by using the Gauss-Laguerre quadrature and the Gaussian quadrature techniques. Moreover, to gain more insights into the secrecy performance, the asymptotic expression of the ASC is obtained. The numerical results indicate that incorporating the dual RIS in the secure V2V communication under the NOMA scheme can significantly provide ultra-reliable transmission and guarantee more secure communication for intelligent transportation systems (ITS).</description>

Abstract: Medical image semantic segmentation techniques can help identify tumors automatically from computed tomography (CT) scans. In this paper, we propose a Contextual and Attentional feature Fusions enhanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Transformer hybrid network (CAFCT-Net) for liver tumor segmentation. We incorporate three novel modules in the CAFCT-Net architecture: Attentional Feature Fusion (AFF), Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) of DeepLabv3, and Attention Gates (AGs) to improve contextual information related to tumor boundaries for accurate segmentation. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 76.54% and Dice coefficient of 84.29%, respectively, on the Liver Tumor Segmentation Benchmark (LiTS) dataset, outperforming pure CNN or Transformer methods, e.g., Attention U-Net and PVTFormer.</description>

      <title>The Road to Next-Generation Multiple Access: A 50-Year Tutorial Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of wireless communications has been significantly influenced by remarkable advancements in multiple access (MA) technologies over the past five decades, shaping the landscape of modern connectivity. Within this context, a comprehensive tutorial review is presented, focusing on representative MA techniques developed over the past 50 years. The following areas are explored: i) The foundational principles and information-theoretic capacity limits of power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) are characterized, along with its extension to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-NOMA. ii) Several MA transmission schemes exploiting the spatial domain are investigated, encompassing both conventional space-division multiple access (SDMA)/MIMO-NOMA systems and near-field MA systems utilizing spherical-wave propagation models. iii) The application of NOMA to integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems is studied. This includes an introduction to typical NOMA-based downlink/uplink ISAC frameworks, followed by an evaluation of their performance limits using a mutual information (MI)-based analytical framework. iv) Major issues and research opportunities associated with the integration of MA with other emerging technologies are identified to facilitate MA in next-generation networks, i.e., next-generation multiple access (NGMA). Throughout the paper, promising directions are highlighted to inspire future research endeavors in the realm of MA and NGMA.</description>

      <title>MusicHiFi: Fast High-Fidelity Stereo Vocoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10493v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based audio and music generation models commonly perform generation by constructing an image representation of audio (e.g., a mel-spectrogram) and then convert it to audio using a phase reconstruction model or vocoder. Typical vocoders, however, produce monophonic audio at lower resolutions (e.g., 16-24 kHz), which limits their usefulness. We propose MusicHiFi -- an efficient high-fidelity stereophonic vocoder. Our method employs a cascade of three generative adversarial networks (GANs) that convert low-resolution mel-spectrograms to audio, upsamples to high-resolution audio via bandwidth extension, and upmixes to stereophonic audio. Compared to past work, we propose 1) a unified GAN-based generator and discriminator architecture and training procedure for each stage of our cascade, 2) a new fast, near downsampling-compatible bandwidth extension module, and 3) a new fast downmix-compatible mono-to-stereo upmixer that ensures the preservation of monophonic content in the output. We evaluate our approach using objective and subjective listening tests and find our approach yields comparable or better audio quality, better spatialization control, and significantly faster inference speed compared to past work.

      <title>Semi-Supervised Learning via Cross-Prediction-Powered Inference for Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many wireless application scenarios, acquiring labeled data can be prohibitively costly, requiring complex optimization processes or measurement campaigns. Semi-supervised learning leverages unlabeled samples to augment the available dataset by assigning synthetic labels obtained via machine learning (ML)-based predictions. However, treating the synthetic labels as true labels may yield worse-performing models as compared to models trained using only labeled data. Inspired by the recently developed prediction-powered inference (PPI) framework, this work investigates how to leverage the synthetic labels produced by an ML model, while accounting for the inherent bias concerning true labels. To this end, we first review PPI and its recent extensions, namely tuned PPI and cross-prediction-powered inference (CPPI). Then, we introduce two novel variants of PPI. The first, referred to as tuned CPPI, provides CPPI with an additional degree of freedom in adapting to the quality of the ML-based labels. The second, meta-CPPI (MCPPI), extends tuned CPPI via the joint optimization of the ML labeling models and of the parameters of interest. Finally, we showcase two applications of PPI-based techniques in wireless systems, namely beam alignment based on channel knowledge maps in millimeter-wave systems and received signal strength information-based indoor localization. Simulation results show the advantages of PPI-based techniques over conventional approaches that rely solely on labeled data or that apply standard pseudo-labeling strategies from semi-supervised learning. Furthermore, the proposed tuned CPPI method is observed to guarantee the best performance among all benchmark schemes, especially in the regime of limited labeled data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modelling the propagation of electromagnetic wireless signals is critical for designing modern communication systems. Wireless ray tracing simulators model signal propagation based on the 3D geometry and other scene parameters, but their accuracy is fundamentally limited by underlying modelling assumptions and correctness of parameters. In this work, we introduce Wi-GATr, a fully-learnable neural simulation surrogate designed to predict the channel observations based on scene primitives (e.g., surface mesh, antenna position and orientation). Recognizing the inherently geometric nature of these primitives, Wi-GATr leverages an equivariant Geometric Algebra Transformer that operates on a tokenizer specifically tailored for wireless simulation. We evaluate our approach on a range of tasks (i.e., signal strength and delay spread prediction, receiver localization, and geometry reconstruction) and find that Wi-GATr is accurate, fast, sample-efficient, and robust to symmetry-induced transformations. Remarkably, we find our results also translate well to the real world: Wi-GATr demonstrates more than 35% lower error than hybrid techniques, and 70% lower error than a calibrated wireless tracer.</description>

      <title>Geodesic Optimization for Predictive Shift Adaptation on EEG data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) data is often collected from diverse contexts involving different populations and EEG devices. This variability can induce distribution shifts in the data $X$ and in the biomedical variables of interest $y$, thus limiting the application of supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms. While domain adaptation (DA) methods have been developed to mitigate the impact of these shifts, such methods struggle when distribution shifts occur simultaneously in $X$ and $y$. As state-of-the-art ML models for EEG represent the data by spatial covariance matrices, which lie on the Riemannian manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices, it is appealing to study DA techniques operating on the SPD manifold. This paper proposes a novel method termed Geodesic Optimization for Predictive Shift Adaptation (GOPSA) to address test-time multi-source DA for situations in which source domains have distinct $y$ distributions. GOPSA exploits the geodesic structure of the Riemannian manifold to jointly learn a domain-specific re-centering operator representing site-specific intercepts and the regression model. We performed empirical benchmarks on the cross-site generalization of age-prediction models with resting-state EEG data from a large multi-national dataset (HarMNqEEG), which included $14$ recording sites and more than $1500$ human participants. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our results showed that GOPSA achieved significantly higher performance on three regression metrics ($R^2$, MAE, and Spearman's $\rho$) for several source-target site combinations, highlighting its effectiveness in tackling multi-source DA with predictive shifts in EEG data analysis. Our method has the potential to combine the advantages of mixed-effects modeling with machine learning for biomedical applications of EEG, such as multicenter clinical trials.</description>

      <title>IndicVoices-R: Unlocking a Massive Multilingual Multi-speaker Speech Corpus for Scaling Indian TTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis show that large-scale models trained with extensive web data produce highly natural-sounding output. However, such data is scarce for Indian languages due to the lack of high-quality, manually subtitled data on platforms like LibriVox or YouTube. To address this gap, we enhance existing large-scale ASR datasets containing natural conversations collected in low-quality environments to generate high-quality TTS training data. Our pipeline leverages the cross-lingual generalization of denoising and speech enhancement models trained on English and applied to Indian languages. This results in IndicVoices-R (IV-R), the largest multilingual Indian TTS dataset derived from an ASR dataset, with 1,704 hours of high-quality speech from 10,496 speakers across 22 Indian languages. IV-R matches the quality of gold-standard TTS datasets like LJSpeech, LibriTTS, and IndicTTS. We also introduce the IV-R Benchmark, the first to assess zero-shot, few-shot, and many-shot speaker generalization capabilities of TTS models on Indian voices, ensuring diversity in age, gender, and style. We demonstrate that fine-tuning an English pre-trained model on a combined dataset of high-quality IndicTTS and our IV-R dataset results in better zero-shot speaker generalization compared to fine-tuning on the IndicTTS dataset alone. Further, our evaluation reveals limited zero-shot generalization for Indian voices in TTS models trained on prior datasets, which we improve by fine-tuning the model on our data containing diverse set of speakers across language families. We open-source all data and code, releasing the first TTS model for all 22 official Indian languages.</description>

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) empowers small devices to sense, react, and communicate, with applications ranging from smart ordinary household objects to complex industrial processes. To provide access to an increasing number of IoT devices, particularly in long-distance communication scenarios, a robust low-power wide area network (LPWAN) protocol becomes essential. A widely adopted protocol for this purpose is 6TiSCH, which builds upon the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. It introduces time-slotted channel hopping (TSCH) mode as a new medium access control (MAC) layer operating mode, in conjunction with IEEE 802.15.4g, which also defines both MAC and physical layer (PHY) layers and provides IPv6 connectivity for LPWAN. Notably, 6TiSCH has gained adoption in significant standards such as Wireless Intelligent Ubiquitous Networks (Wi-SUN). This study evaluates the scalability of 6TiSCH, with a focus on key parameters such as queue size, the maximum number of single-hop retries, and the slotframe length. Computational simulations were performed using an open-source simulator and obtained the following results: increasing the transmission queue size, along with adjusting the number of retries and slotframe length, leads to a reduction in the packet error rate (PER). Notably, the impact of the number of retries is particularly pronounced. Furthermore, the effect on latency varies based on the specific combination of these parameters as the network scales.</description>
