      <title>Energy-Efficient Hybrid Beamforming for Integrated Sensing and Communication Enabled mmWave MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper conceives a hybrid beamforming design (HBF) that maximizes the energy efficiency (EE) of an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-enabled millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. In the system under consideration, an ISAC base station (BS) with the hybrid MIMO architecture communicates with multiple users and simultaneously detects multiple targets. The proposed scheme seeks to maximize the EE of the system, considering the signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) as the user's quality of service (QoS) and the sensing beampattern gain of the targets as constraints. To solve this non-convex problem, we initially adopt Dinkelbach's method to convert the fractional objective function to subtractive form and subsequently obtain the sub-optimal fully-digital transmit beamformer by leveraging the principle of semi-definite relaxation. Subsequently, we propose a penalty-based manifold optimization scheme in conjunction with an alternating minimization method to determine the baseband (BB) and analog beamformers based on the designed fully-digital transmit beamformer. Finally, simulation results are given to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithm with respect to the benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Privacy Preserving Semi-Decentralized Mean Estimation over Intermittently-Connected Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of privately estimating the mean of vectors distributed across different nodes of an unreliable wireless network, where communications between nodes can fail intermittently. We adopt a semi-decentralized setup, wherein to mitigate the impact of intermittently connected links, nodes can collaborate with their neighbors to compute a local consensus, which they relay to a central server. In such a setting, the communications between any pair of nodes must ensure that the privacy of the nodes is rigorously maintained to prevent unauthorized information leakage. We study the tradeoff between collaborative relaying and privacy leakage due to the data sharing among nodes and, subsequently, propose PriCER: Private Collaborative Estimation via Relaying -- a differentially private collaborative algorithm for mean estimation to optimize this tradeoff. The privacy guarantees of PriCER arise (i) implicitly, by exploiting the inherent stochasticity of the flaky network connections, and (ii) explicitly, by adding Gaussian perturbations to the estimates exchanged by the nodes. Local and central privacy guarantees are provided against eavesdroppers who can observe different signals, such as the communications amongst nodes during local consensus and (possibly multiple) transmissions from the relays to the central server. We substantiate our theoretical findings with numerical simulations. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/rajarshisaha95/private-collaborative-relaying.</description>

      <title>Iterative Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to extract governing equations from time-series data, various approaches are proposed. Among those, sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) stands out as a successful method capable of modeling governing equations with a minimal number of terms, utilizing the principles of compressive sensing. This feature, which relies on a small number of terms, is crucial for interpretability. The effectiveness of SINDy hinges on the choice of candidate functions within its dictionary to extract governing equations of dynamical systems. A larger dictionary allows for more terms, enhancing the quality of approximations. However, the computational complexity scales with dictionary size, rendering SINDy less suitable for high-dimensional datasets, even though it has been successfully applied to low-dimensional datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce iterative SINDy in this paper, where the dictionary undergoes expansion and compression through iterations. We also conduct an analysis of the convergence properties of iterative SINDy. Simulation results validate that iterative SINDy can achieve nearly identical performance to SINDy, while significantly reducing computational complexity. Notably, iterative SINDy demonstrates effectiveness with high-dimensional time-series data without incurring the prohibitively high computational cost associated with SINDy.</description>

      <title>Informed Graph Learning By Domain Knowledge Injection and Smooth Graph Signal Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph signal processing represents an important advancement in the field of data analysis, extending conventional signal processing methodologies to complex networks and thereby facilitating the exploration of informative patterns and structures across various domains. However, acquiring the underlying graphs for specific applications remains a challenging task. While graph inference based on smooth graph signal representation has become one of the state-of-the-art methods, these approaches usually overlook the unique properties of networks, which are generally derived from domain-specific knowledge. Overlooking this information could make the approaches less interpretable and less effective overall. In this study, we propose a new graph inference method that leverages available domain knowledge. The proposed methodology is evaluated on the task of denoising and imputing missing sensor data, utilizing graph signal reconstruction techniques. The results demonstrate that incorporating domain knowledge into the graph inference process can improve graph signal reconstruction in district heating networks.

      <title>Beyond Diagonal RIS-Aided Networks: Performance Analysis and Sectorization Tradeoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a spectrum- and energy-efficient technology to enhance the coverage of wireless communications within the upcoming 6G networks. Recently, novel extensions of this technology, referred to as multi-sector beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS), have been proposed, where the configurable elements are divided into $L$ sectors $(L \geq 2)$ and arranged as a polygon prism, with each sector covering $1/L$ space. This paper presents a performance analysis of a multi-user communication system assisted by a multi-sector BD-RIS operating in time-switching (TS) mode. Specifically, we derive closed-form expressions for the moment-generating function (MGF), probability density function (PDF), and cumulative density function (CDF) of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per user. Furthermore, closed-form expressions for the outage probability, achievable spectral and energy efficiency, symbol error probability, and diversity order for the proposed system model are derived. Moreover, a comparison is performed with the simultaneously transmitting and reflecting (STAR)-RISs, a special case of multi-sector BD-RIS with two sectors. Our analysis shows that for a fixed number of elements, increasing the sectors improves outage performance at the expense of reduced diversity order compared to STAR-RIS. This trade-off is influenced by the Rician factors of the cascaded channel and the number of configurable elements per sector. However, this superiority in slope is observed at outage probability values below $10^{-5}$, which remains below practical operating ranges of communication systems. Additionally, simulations are provided to validate the accuracy of our theoretical analyses showing a notable $182\%$ increase in spectral efficiency and a $238\%$ increase in energy efficiency when transitioning from a 2-sector to a 6-sector configuration.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Aided RIS Communication: Robust Beamforming and Interference Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are envisioned to play a key role in future wireless communication networks. However, channel estimation in RIS-aided wireless networks is challenging due to their passive nature and the large number of reflective elements, leading to high channel estimation overhead. Additionally, conventional methods like beam sweeping, which do not rely on explicit channel state information, often struggle in managing interference in multi-user networks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages digital twins (DTs) of the physical environments to approximate channels using electromagnetic 3D models and ray tracing, thus relaxing the need for channel estimation and extensive over-the-air computations in RIS-aided wireless networks. To address the digital twins channel approximation errors, we further refine this approach with a DT-specific robust transmission design that reliably meets minimum desired rates. The results show that our method secures these rates over 90% of the time, significantly outperforming beam sweeping, which achieves these rates less than 8% of the time due to its poor management of transmitting power and interference.</description>

      <title>Near-field Beam Training with Sparse DFT Codebook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale array (XL-array) has emerged as one promising technology to improve the spectral efficiency and spatial resolution of future sixth generation (6G) wireless systems.The upsurge in the antenna number antennas renders communication users more likely to be located in the near-field region, which requires a more accurate spherical (instead of planar) wavefront propagation modeling.This inevitably incurs unaffordable beam training overhead when performing a two-dimensional (2D) beam-search in both the angular and range domains.To address this issue, we first introduce a new sparse discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook, which exhibits the angular periodicity in the received beam pattern at the user, which motivates us to propose a three-phase beam training scheme.Specifically, in the first phase, we utilize the sparse DFT codebook for beam sweeping in an angular subspace and estimate candidate user angles according to the received beam pattern.Then, a central sub-array is activated to scan specific candidate angles for resolving the issue of angular ambiguity and identity the user angle.In the third phase, the polar-domain codebook is applied in the estimated angle to search the best effective range of the user.Finally, numerical results show that the proposed beam training scheme enabled by sparse DFT codebook achieves 98.67% reduction as compared with the exhaustive-search scheme, yet without compromising rate performance in the high signal-to-ratio (SNR) regime.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Characterization of Wireless Channels Conditioned on Side Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical prior channel knowledge, such as the wide-sense-stationary-uncorrelated-scattering (WSSUS) property, and additional side information both can be used to enhance physical layer applications in wireless communication. Generally, the wireless channel's strongly fluctuating path phases and WSSUS property characterize the channel by a zero mean and Toeplitz-structured covariance matrices in different domains. In this work, we derive a framework to comprehensively categorize side information based on whether it preserves or abandons these statistical features conditioned on the given side information. To accomplish this, we combine insights from a generic channel model with the representation of wireless channels as probabilistic graphs. Additionally, we exemplify several applications, ranging from channel modeling to estimation and clustering, which demonstrate how the proposed framework can practically enhance physical layer methods utilizing machine learning (ML).</description>

      <title>TSpec-LLM: An Open-source Dataset for LLM Understanding of 3GPP Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding telecom standards involves sorting through numerous technical documents, such as those produced by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. While large language models (LLMs) can assist with the extensive 3GPP knowledge base, an inclusive dataset is crucial for their effective pre-training and fine-tuning. In this paper, we introduce \textit{TSpec-LLM}, an open-source comprehensive dataset covering all 3GPP documents from Release 8 to Release 19 (1999--2023). To evaluate its efficacy, we first select a representative sample of 3GPP documents, create corresponding technical questions, and assess the baseline performance of various LLMs. We then incorporate a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework to enhance LLM capabilities by retrieving relevant context from the \textit{TSpec-LLM} dataset. Our evaluation shows that using a naive-RAG framework on \textit{TSpec-LLM} improves the accuracy of GPT-3.5, Gemini 1.0 Pro, and GPT-4 from 44\%, 46\%, and 51\% to 71\%, 75\%, and 72\%, respectively.</description>

      <title>BiomedBench: A benchmark suite of TinyML biomedical applications for low-power wearables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of low-power wearables for the biomedical domain has received a lot of attention in recent decades, as technological advances in chip manufacturing have allowed real-time monitoring of patients using low-complexity ML within the mW range. Despite advances in application and hardware design research, the domain lacks a systematic approach to hardware evaluation. In this work, we propose BiomedBench, a new benchmark suite composed of complete end-to-end TinyML biomedical applications for real-time monitoring of patients using wearable devices. Each application presents different requirements during typical signal acquisition and processing phases, including varying computational workloads and relations between active and idle times. Furthermore, our evaluation of five state-of-the-art low-power platforms in terms of energy efficiency shows that modern platforms cannot effectively target all types of biomedical applications. BiomedBench will be released as an open-source suite to enable future improvements in the entire domain of bioengineering systems and TinyML application design.</description>

      <title>MSE-Based Training and Transmission Optimization for MIMO ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system under typical block-fading channels. As a non-trivial extension to most existing works on ISAC, both the training and transmission signals sent by the ISAC transmitter are exploited for sensing. Specifically, we develop two training and transmission design schemes to minimize a weighted sum of the mean-squared errors (MSEs) of data transmission and radar target response matrix (TRM) estimation. For the former, we first optimize the training signal for simultaneous communication channel and radar TRM estimation. Then, based on the estimated instantaneous channel state information (CSI), we propose an efficient majorization-minimization (MM)-based robust ISAC transmission design, where a semi-closed form solution is obtained in each iteration. For the second scheme, the ISAC transmitter is assumed to have statistical CSI only for reducing the feedback overhead. With CSI statistics available, we integrate the training and transmission design into one single problem and propose an MM-based alternating algorithm to find a high-quality solution. In addition, we provide alternative structured and low-complexity solutions for both schemes under certain special cases. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the radar performance is significantly improved compared to the existing scheme that integrates sensing into the transmission stage only. Moreover, it is verified that the investigated two schemes have advantages in terms of communication and sensing performances, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-complexity speech enhancement on mobile phones is crucial in the era of 5G. Thus, focusing on handheld mobile phone communication scenario, based on power level difference (PLD) algorithm and lightweight U-Net, we propose PLD-guided lightweight deep network (PLDNet), an extremely lightweight dual-microphone speech enhancement method that integrates the guidance of signal processing algorithm and lightweight attention-augmented U-Net. For the guidance information, we employ PLD algorithm to pre-process dual-microphone spectrum, and feed the output into subsequent deep neural network, which utilizes a lightweight U-Net with our proposed gated convolution augmented frequency attention (GCAFA) module to extract desired clean speech. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive performance with recent top-performing models while reducing computational cost by over 90%, highlighting the potential for low-complexity speech enhancement on mobile phones.</description>

      <title>The {\alpha}-Lomax Distribution: A Compound Channel Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the {\alpha}-Lomax distribution as a new compound fading channel model. This new distribution generalizes the recently introduced Lomax fading channel model. It is worth noting that the Lomax distribution is a decreasing function, while the {\alpha}-Lomax is a unimodal function, offering greater flexibility in modeling wireless fading channels. In particular, we derive closed-form expressions for the probability density function and cumulative distribution function for the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Additionally, we provide closed-form expressions for several fundamental performance metrics, including outage probability, average bit error rate, and channel capacity. Furthermore, we derive closed-form expression for the average block-length error rate in short-packet communications. Moreover, we fit the PDF of the proposed channel model to empirical data obtained from a device-to-device communication system. We also offer simple and accurate approximations for these expressions in the high SNR regime.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Lightweight Transformer via Unrolling of Learned Graph Smoothness Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build interpretable and lightweight transformer-like neural networks by unrolling iterative optimization algorithms that minimize graph smoothness priors -- the quadratic graph Laplacian regularizer (GLR) and the $\ell_1$-norm graph total variation (GTV) -- subject to an interpolation constraint. The crucial insight is that a normalized signal-dependent graph learning module amounts to a variant of the basic self-attention mechanism in conventional transformers. Unlike "black-box" transformers that require learning of large key, query and value matrices to compute scaled dot products as affinities and subsequent output embeddings, resulting in huge parameter sets, our unrolled networks employ shallow CNNs to learn low-dimensional features per node to establish pairwise Mahalanobis distances and construct sparse similarity graphs. At each layer, given a learned graph, the target interpolated signal is simply a low-pass filtered output derived from the minimization of an assumed graph smoothness prior, leading to a dramatic reduction in parameter count. Experiments for two image interpolation applications verify the restoration performance, parameter efficiency and robustness to covariate shift of our graph-based unrolled networks compared to conventional transformers.</description>

      <title>Compressible Dynamics in Deep Overparameterized Low-Rank Learning &amp; Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While overparameterization in machine learning models offers great benefits in terms of optimization and generalization, it also leads to increased computational requirements as model sizes grow. In this work, we show that by leveraging the inherent low-dimensional structures of data and compressible dynamics within the model parameters, we can reap the benefits of overparameterization without the computational burdens. In practice, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for deep low-rank matrix completion as well as fine-tuning language models. Our approach is grounded in theoretical findings for deep overparameterized low-rank matrix recovery, where we show that the learning dynamics of each weight matrix are confined to an invariant low-dimensional subspace. Consequently, we can construct and train compact, highly compressed factorizations possessing the same benefits as their overparameterized counterparts. In the context of deep matrix completion, our technique substantially improves training efficiency while retaining the advantages of overparameterization. For language model fine-tuning, we propose a method called "Deep LoRA", which improves the existing low-rank adaptation (LoRA) technique, leading to reduced overfitting and a simplified hyperparameter setup, while maintaining comparable efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of Deep LoRA on natural language tasks, particularly when fine-tuning with limited data.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Driven Microwave Imaging for Soil Moisture Estimation near Leaky Pipe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing soil moisture (SM) around drip irrigation pipes is crucial for precise and optimized farming. Machine learning (ML) approaches are particularly suitable for this task as they can reduce uncertainties caused by soil conditions and the drip pipe positions, using features extracted from relevant datasets. This letter addresses local moisture detection in the vicinity of dripping pipes using a portable microwave imaging system. The employed ML approach is fed with two dimensional images generated by two different microwave imaging techniques based on spatio-temporal measurements at various frequency bands. The study investigates the performance of K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) algorithms for moisture classification based on these images, both before and after performing soil clutter reduction. We also explore the potentials of CNN and KNN for moisture estimation around the plant roots and in the presence of pebbles. The results demonstrate the more accurate moisture estimation using CNN when it is applied after clutter reduction considering back projection algorithm (BPA) as the imaging technique.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Aided Beamforming for Downlink Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the optimal beamformer design for the downlink of Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA), mainly focusing on a two-user scenario. We derive novel closed-form expressions for the Bit Error Rate (BER) experienced by both users when Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) is employed. Using these expressions, we formulate a fairness-based optimal beamforming problem aiming to minimize the maximum BER encountered by the users. Due to the complexity of this problem and the time-consuming nature of Constraint Optimization (CO) algorithms for real-time telecommunication systems, we propose a deep learning (DL) approach for its solution. The proposed DL architecture possesses specific input and output characteristics that enable the simultaneous training and use of the system by multiple different antenna schemes. By conducting extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms existing beamforming solutions and achieves BER performance close to that given by CO algorithms while significantly reducing the computational time needed. Finally, we conduct simulations to examine the robustness and efficiency of our system in different test scenarios.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Algorithm for Spatial-Spectral Partial Volume Compartment Mapping with Applications to Multicomponent Diffusion and Relaxation MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous work has shown that high-quality partial volume tissue compartment maps can be obtained by applying spatially-regularized spectroscopic image estimation techniques to high-dimensional multicontrast MRI data (e.g., diffusion-relaxation data). However, this generally requires substantial computational complexity. In this work, we propose a more efficient algorithm to estimate spectroscopic images using spatial regularization. Our algorithm is based on the linearized alternating directions method of multipliers (LADMM), and relies on the introduction of novel quadratic penalty terms to substantially simplify the subproblems that appear within each iteration. We evaluate this algorithm in a variety of different scenarios (diffusion-relaxation, relaxation-relaxation, relaxometry, and magnetic resonance fingerprinting), where we consistently observe substantial ($\sim$3$\times$-50$\times$) speed improvements. We expect that this new algorithm will reduce barriers to using spatial regularization and multiparametric contrast-encoded MRI data acquisition methods for partial volume compartment mapping.</description>

      <title>Large-scale Outdoor Cell-free mMIMO Channel Measurement in an Urban Scenario at 3.5 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design of cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) systems requires accurate, measurement-based channel models. This paper provides the first results from the by far most extensive outdoor measurement campaign for CF-mMIMO channels in an urban environment. We measured impulse responses between over 20,000 potential access point (AP) locations and 80 user equipments (UEs) at 3.5 GHz with 350 MHz bandwidth (BW). Measurements use a "virtual array" approach at the AP and a hybrid switched/virtual approach at the UE. This paper describes the sounder design, measurement environment, data processing, and sample results, particularly the evolution of the power-delay profiles (PDPs) as a function of the AP locations, and its relation to the propagation environment.</description>

      <title>Clarifying the effect of mean subtraction on Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.03607v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any autonomous nonlinear dynamical system can be viewed as a superposition of infinitely many linear processes, through the so-called Koopman mode decomposition. Its data-driven approximation- Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)- has been extensively developed and deployed across a plethora of fields. In this work, we study the effect of subtracting the temporal mean on the DMD approximation, for observables possessing only a finite number of Koopman modes.
  Pre-processing time-sequential training data by removing the temporal mean has been a point of contention in the Companion matrix formulation of DMD. This stems from the potential of said pre-processing to render DMD equivalent to a temporal Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). We prove that this equivalence is impossible when the training data is linearly consistent and the order of the DMD approximation exceeds the number of Koopman modes. Since model order and training set size are synonymous in this variant of DMD, the parity of DMD and DFT can, therefore, be indicative of inadequate training data.</description>

      <title>Resilient Distributed Optimization for Multi-Agent Cyberphysical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on the problem of distributed optimization in multi-agent cyberphysical systems, where a legitimate agents' iterates are influenced both by the values it receives from potentially malicious neighboring agents, and by its own self-serving target function. We develop a new algorithmic and analytical framework to achieve resilience for the class of problems where stochastic values of trust between agents exist and can be exploited. In this case we show that convergence to the true global optimal point can be recovered, both in mean and almost surely, even in the presence of malicious agents. Furthermore, we provide expected convergence rate guarantees in the form of upper bounds on the expected squared distance to the optimal value. Finally, numerical results are presented that validate our analytical convergence guarantees even when the malicious agents compose the majority of agents in the network and where existing methods fail to converge to the optimal nominal points.</description>

      <title>Selective Noise Suppression Methods Using Random SVPWM to Shape the Noise Spectrum of PMSMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08053v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random pulse width modulation techniques are used in AC motors powered by two-level three-phase inverters, which cause a broadband spectrum of voltage, current, and electromagnetic force. The voltage distribution across a wide range of frequencies may increase the vibration and acoustic noise of motors. This study proposes two selective noise suppression (SNS) methods to eliminate voltage harmonics for specified frequencies. In the first method, the switching frequency is constant. The pulse position is calculated by the duty cycle of the current switching cycle. Both the pulse position and switching frequency are randomized in the second method. This involves creating a unique relationship among the switching frequency, pulse position, and duty cycle to shape the noise spectrum. Computer simulation and experimental results show that both methods effectively perform selective noise suppression at a specific frequency. The power spectrum density (PSD) using the second SNS method is more uniform near integer multiples of the switching frequency than that using random pulse width modulation techniques or the first SNS method. These methods provide a valuable reference for eliminating electromagnetic and acoustic noises at resonant frequencies in motors.</description>

      <title>UAV-based Maritime Communications: Relaying to Enhance the Link Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Providing a stable connectivity in maritime communications is of utmost importance to unleash the full potential of smart ports. Nonetheless, due to the crowded nature of harbor environments, it is likely that some ships are shadowed by others, resulting in reduced received power that subsequently diminishes their data rates-even threatens basic connectivity requirements. Given that uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been regarded as an integral part of future generations of wireless communication networks, they can be employed in maritime communications as well. In this paper, we investigate the use of UAV-mounted relays in order to help mitigate the reduced data rates of blocked links in maritime communications. Various communication architectures are considered based on the positioning mechanism of the UAV; in this regard, fixed, k-means algorithm-based, and landing spot-based positioning approaches are examined. Additionally, since UAVs are predominantly battery-operated, the energy consumption performances of these approaches are also measured. Results reveal that the landing spot-based UAV relay positioning approach finds the best trade-off between the data rate and energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Learned Finite-Time Consensus for Distributed Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most algorithms for decentralized learning employ a consensus or diffusion mechanism to drive agents to a common solution of a global optimization problem. Generally this takes the form of linear averaging, at a rate of contraction determined by the mixing rate of the underlying network topology. For very sparse graphs this can yield a bottleneck, slowing down the convergence of the learning algorithm. We show that a sequence of matrices achieving finite-time consensus can be learned for unknown graph topologies in a decentralized manner by solving a constrained matrix factorization problem. We demonstrate numerically the benefit of the resulting scheme in both structured and unstructured graphs.</description>
