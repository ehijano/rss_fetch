      <title>On Convexity of Optimal Multi-Commodity Freeway Network Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a multi-commodity Freeway Network Control (FNC) problem aiming at achieving optimal operation of a transportation network through the use of ramp metering and variable speed limits. Straightforward formulations of both single- and multi-commodity FNC problems based on the Cell Transmission Model are known to be non-convex, mainly due to the congestion effects at diverge junctions. However, recent studies have shown that it is possible to formulate a tight convex relaxation of the single-commodity FNC problem. We extend these results to the multi-commodity FNC problem by considering concave commodity-specific demand functions and concave aggregate supply functions, so that different variable speed limits can be applied to different commodities. Hence, it is possible to efficiently compute the optimal control action to reduce congestion phenomena in the network. We also present a case study of a segment of the freeway network in California, using data from the PeMS database, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Finally, we draw a comparison with a setting where the multi-commodity flows are modeled and controlled as a single-commodity flow, to emphasize the relevance of acting separately on different classes of vehicles.</description>

      <title>Efficient Gradient-Based Optimization for Joint Layout Design and Control of Wind Turbines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central challenge in the design of energy-efficient wind farms is the presence of wake effects between turbines. When a wind turbine harvests energy from free wind, it produces a turbulent region with reduced energy for downstream turbines. Strategies for increasing the efficiency of wind farms by mitigating wake effects have been the subject of much computational research. To this end, both the positioning of the turbines and their cooperative control must be taken into account. Since they are mutually dependent, increasing attention has been paid to the joint consideration of layout design and control. However, joint modeling approaches lead to large-scale and difficult optimization problems, which lack efficient solution strategies. This paper describes an efficient optimization framework for the joint design and steady-state control of wind turbines under a continuous wake effect model. Through a multi-level reformulation of the joint optimization problem, it shows how problem sub-structure can be efficiently exploited to yield order-of-magnitude reduction in convergence times over naive approaches and prior proposals.</description>

      <title>A Variational Characterization and A Line Search Newton-Noda Method for the unifying spectral problem of nonnegative tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the general $(\boldsymbol{\sigma},\mathbf{p})$-eigenvalue problem of nonnegative tensors introduced by A. Gautier, F. Tudisco, and M. Hein [SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 40 (2019), pp. 1206--1231], which unifies several well-studied tensor eigenvalue and singular value problems. First, we propose an alternative min-max Collatz--Wielandt formula for the $(\boldsymbol{\sigma},\mathbf{p})$-spectral radius, which bypasses the auxiliary multihomogeneous mapping employed in that work. This variational characterization both recovers several classical results and admits a natural convex reformulation. It arises from an alternative approach that directly connects the $(\boldsymbol{\sigma},\mathbf{p})$-spectral problem to a class of convex programs.
  We then develop and analyze a line search Newton-Noda method (LS-NNM) for computing the positive $(\boldsymbol{\sigma},\mathbf{p})$-eigenpair of nonnegative tensors. The proposed method integrates Newton method with Noda iteration. The Newton equation is derived from an equivalent nonlinear system, while the eigenvalue sequence is updated by the strategy of the Noda iteration and its variants. To ensure global convergence, we introduce a positivity-preserving line search procedure based on an equivalent constrained optimization problem. The global and quadratic convergence of LS-NNM are established for the class of $(\boldsymbol{\sigma},\mathbf{p})$-spectral problem that admits a unique positive $(\boldsymbol{\sigma},\mathbf{p})$-eigenpair, as guaranteed by the Perron-Frobenius theorem. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the performance of LS-NNM.</description>

      <title>Optimality-Informed Neural Networks for Solving Parametric Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many engineering tasks require solving families of nonlinear constrained optimization problems, parametrized in setting-specific variables. This is computationally demanding, particularly, if solutions have to be computed across strongly varying parameter values, e.g., in real-time control or for model-based design. Thus, we propose to learn the mapping from parameters to the primal optimal solutions and to their corresponding duals using neural networks, giving a dense estimation in contrast to gridded approaches. Our approach, Optimality-informed Neural Networks (OptINNs), combines (i) a KKT-residual loss that penalizes violations of the first-order optimality conditions under standard constraint qualifications assumptions, and (ii) problem-specific output activations that enforce simple inequality constraints (e.g., box-type/positivity) by construction. This design reduces data requirements, allows the prediction of dual variables, and improves feasibility and closeness to optimality compared to penalty-only training. Taking quadratic penalties as a baseline, since this approach has been previously proposed for the considered problem class in literature, our method simplifies hyperparameter tuning and attains tighter adherence to optimality conditions. We evaluate OptINNs on different nonlinear optimization problems ranging from low to high dimensions. On small problems, OptINNs match a quadratic-penalty baseline in primal accuracy while additionally predicting dual variables with low error. On larger problems, OptINNs achieve lower constraint violations and lower primal error compared to neural networks based on the quadratic-penalty method. These results suggest that embedding feasibility and optimality into the network architecture and loss can make learning-based surrogates more accurate, feasible, and data-efficient for parametric optimization.</description>

      <title>Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) for Communicationless Cooperative Collision Avoidance in Robot Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative collision avoidance between robots in swarm operations remains an open challenge. Assuming a decentralized architecture, each robot is responsible for making its own control decisions, including motion planning. To this end, most existing approaches mostly rely some form of (wireless) communication between the agents of the swarm. In reality, however, communication is brittle. It may be affected by latency, further delays and packet losses, transmission faults, and is subject to adversarial attacks, such as jamming or spoofing. This paper proposes Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) as a communicationless alternative. It follows the implicit cooperation paradigm, under which the design of the robots is based on consensual (offline) rules, similar to traffic rules. They include the definition of a contingency trajectory for each robot, and a method for construction of mutual collision avoidance constraints. The setup is shown to guarantee the recursive feasibility and collision avoidance between all swarm members in closed-loop operation. Moreover, CMC naturally satisfies the Plug \&amp; Play paradigm, i.e., for new robots entering the swarm. Two numerical examples demonstrate that the collision avoidance guarantee is intact and that the robot swarm operates smoothly under the CMC regime.</description>

      <title>Shadow splitting methods for nonconvex optimisation: epi-approximation, convergence and saddle point avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the shadow Davis-Yin three-operator splitting method to solve nonconvex optimisation problems. Its convergence analysis is based on a merit function resembling the Moreau envelope. We explore variational analysis properties behind the merit function and the iteration operators associated with the shadow method. By capitalising on these results, we establish convergence of a damped version of the shadow method via sufficient descent of the merit function, and obtain (almost surely) guarantees of avoidance of strict saddle points of weakly convex semialgebraic optimisation problems. We perform numerical experiments for a nonconvex variable selection problem to test our findings.</description>

      <title>Exact boundary controllability and stabilizability of a degenerated Timoshenko beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the boundary controllability and stabilizability of a Timoshenko beam subject to degeneracy at one end, while control is applied at the opposite boundary. Degeneracy in this context is measured by the real parameters for $\mu_a\in [0,2)$ for $a\in\{K,EI\}$, where $K(x)$ denotes shear stiffness and $EI(x)$ bending stiffness. We differentiate between weak degeneracy $\mu_a\in [0,1)$ and strong degeneracy $\mu_a\in [1,2)$, which may occur independently in shear and bending. Our study establishes observability inequalities for both weakly and strongly degenerate equations under Dirichlet, Robin, and Neumann boundary conditions. Using energy multiplier techniques and the Hilbert Uniqueness Method (HUM), we derive conditions for exact boundary controllability and show that appropriate boundary state and velocity feedback controls at the non-degenerate end can stabilize the system exponentially. Extending results previously obtained for the 1-dimensional wave equation in \cite{AlabauCannarsaLeugering2017}, this study highlights new control strategies and stabilization effects specific to the degenerate Timoshenko beam system, addressing challenges pertinent to real-world structural damping and control applications.</description>

      <title>Neural Scaling Laws for Learning-based Identification of Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of machine learning models in system identification has increased due to their ability to approximate complex nonlinear dynamics with high accuracy. However, often it is not clear how the performance of trained models scales with given resources such as data, compute, and model size. To allow for a better understanding of the scalability of the performance of machine learning models, we verify neural scaling laws (NSLs) in the context of system identification from input-state-output data using different evaluation metrics for accuracy and different system architectures, including input-affine and physics-informed port-Hamiltonian representations. Our verified NSLs can help to forecast performance improvements and guide model design or data acquisition.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric exact controllability for networks of spatial elastic strings, springs and masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider networks of elastic strings with end masses, where the coupling is modeled via elastic springs. The model is representative of a network of nonlinear strings, where the strings are coupled to elastic bodies. The coupled system converges to the classical string network model with Kirchhoff and continuity transmission conditions as the spring stiffness terms approach infinity and the masses at the nodes vanish. Due to the presence of point masses at the nodes, the boundary conditions become dynamic, and consequently, the corresponding first-order system of quasilinear balance laws exhibits nonlocal boundary conditions. We demonstrate well-posedness in the sense of semi-global classical solutions \cite{li} (i.e., for arbitrarily large time intervals provided that the initial and boundary data are small enough) and observe extra regularity at the masses as in \cite{WangLeugeringLi2017,WangLeugeringLi2019}. We prove local and global-local exact boundary controllability of a star-like network when control is active at the endpoints of the string-spring-mass system, except for one clamped end. In this case, at multiple nodes, a complex smoothing pattern appears, leading to asymmetric control spaces when the springs and masses are present. Furthermore, the rank of the Laplacian matrix at the junction is crucial for the controllability property, particularly in models containing wave equations with degeneration at dynamic boundaries, which can be interpreted as damage in mechanical vibration systems where parts of the springs are missing.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Accelerated Gradient Method for Smooth Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an adaptive accelerated gradient method for solving smooth convex optimization problems. The method incorporates a scheme to determine the step size adaptively, by means of a local estimation of the smoothness constant, which is assumed unknown, without resorting to line search procedures. The sequence generated by this method converges weakly to a minimizer of the objective function, and the function values converge at a fast rate of $\mathcal{O}\left( \frac{1}{k^2} \right)$. Moreover, if the objective function is strongly convex, the function values converge at a linear rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of optimal control problems governed by nonlinear stochastic equations of monotone type under certain coercivity and linear growth conditions. We give first order necessary conditions of optimality. A stochastic Pontryagin principle can be recovered in the case that the diffusion doesn't depend on the control. We give several applications, most notably for stochastic porous media equations in the Lipschitz case.</description>

      <title>Random Gradient-Free Optimization in Infinite Dimensional Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a random gradient-free method for optimization in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, applicable to functional optimization in diverse settings. Though such problems are often solved through finite-dimensional gradient descent over a parametrization of the functions, such as neural networks, an interesting alternative is to instead perform gradient descent directly in the function space by leveraging its Hilbert space structure, thus enabling provable guarantees and fast convergence. However, infinite-dimensional gradients are often hard to compute in practice, hindering the applicability of such methods. To overcome this limitation, our framework requires only the computation of directional derivatives and a pre-basis for the Hilbert space domain, i.e., a linearly-independent set whose span is dense in the Hilbert space. This fully resolves the tractability issue, as pre-bases are much more easily obtained than full orthonormal bases or reproducing kernels -- which may not even exist -- and individual directional derivatives can be easily computed using forward-mode scalar automatic differentiation. We showcase the use of our method to solve partial differential equations \`a la physics informed neural networks (PINNs), where it effectively enables provable convergence.</description>

      <title>A Proximal Method for Composite Optimization with Smooth and Convex Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce prox-convex for minimizing $F(x)=g(x)+h(C(x))+s(R(x))$, where $g$ and $h$ are convex, $C$ and $s$ are smooth, and each component of $R$ is convex (possibly nonsmooth). Here $g$ captures general convex objectives and indicator functions for convex constraints, while the composite template simultaneously models convex penalties on smooth features $(h \circ C)$ and smooth couplings of convex (possibly nonsmooth) features $(s \circ R)$. Each prox-convex step forms a convex subproblem by linearizing only the smooth maps while preserving the existing convex structure. The resulting subproblem is made strongly convex with the proximal metric $Q_k=\mu_k I+H_k^+ \succ 0$ where $\mu_k$ is adapted using an implicit trust-region strategy, and $H_k^+ \succeq 0$ is an optional curvature term for local acceleration. Under mild Lipschitz/smoothness and a per-coordinate monotone-or-smooth condition, we prove subdifferential regularity, derive two-sided quadratic model error bounds with explicit constants, and obtain sufficient decrease with $O(\varepsilon^{-2})$ complexity for driving the norm of the metric prox-gradient below $\varepsilon$. Furthermore, a local error-bound condition for $F$ guarantees a metric step-size error bound and hence local $Q$-linear convergence of the function values. Using the Taylor-like model framework of Drusvyatskiy, Ioffe, and Lewis, we show that every cluster point of the iterates is limiting-stationary; under our regularity conditions, this further implies Fr\'echet stationarity. The same framework also establishes robustness to inexact subproblem solves and justifies a model-decrease termination rule.</description>

      <title>A Branch-and-Price Algorithm for Fast and Equitable Last-Mile Relief Aid Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distribution of relief supplies to shelters is a critical aspect of post-disaster humanitarian logistics. In major disasters, prepositioned supplies often fall short of meeting all demands. We address the problem of planning vehicle routes from a distribution center to shelters while allocating limited relief supplies. To balance efficiency and equity, we formulate a bi-objective problem: minimizing a Gini-index-based measure of inequity in unsatisfied demand for fair distribution and minimizing total travel time for timely delivery. We propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and use the $\epsilon$-constraint method to handle the bi-objective nature. By deriving mathematical properties of the optimal solution, we introduce valid inequalities and design an algorithm for optimal delivery allocations given feasible vehicle routes. A branch-and-price (B&amp;P) algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently. Computational tests on realistic datasets from a past earthquake in Van, Turkey, and predicted data for Istanbul's Kartal region show that the B&amp;P algorithm significantly outperforms commercial MIP solvers. Our bi-objective approach reduces aid distribution inequity by 34% without compromising efficiency. Results indicate that when time constraints are very loose or tight, lexicographic optimization prioritizing demand coverage over fairness is effective. For moderately restrictive time constraints, a balanced approach is essential to avoid inequitable outcomes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we extend and generalize our solving strategy, first introduced in [1], based on a greedy optimization algorithm and the alternating direction method (ADM) for nonlinear systems computed with multiple load steps. In particular, we combine the greedy optimization algorithm with the direct data-driven solver based on ADM which is firstly introduced in [2] and combined with the Newton-Raphson method for nonlinear elasticity in [3]. We numerically illustrate via one- and two-dimensional bar and truss structures exhibiting nonlinear strain measures and different constitutive datasets that our solving strategy generally achieves a better approximation of the globally optimal solution. This, however, comes at the expense of higher computational cost which is scaled by the number of "greedy" searches. Using this solving strategy, we reproduce the first cycle of the cyclic testing for a nylon rope that was performed at industrial testing facilities for mooring lines manufacturers. We also numerically illustrate for a truss structure that our solving strategy generally improves the accuracy and robustness in cases of an unsymmetrical data distribution and noisy data.</description>

      <title>Replacing Gas with Low-cost, Abundant Long-duration Pumped Hydro in Electricity Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fossil gas is sometimes presented as an enabler of variable solar and wind generation beyond 2050, despite being a primary source of greenhouse gas emissions from methane leakage and combustion. We find that balancing solar and wind generation with pumped hydro energy storage eliminates the need for fossil gas without incurring a cost penalty. However, many existing long-term electricity system plans are biased to rely on fossil gas due to using temporal aggregation methods that either heavily constrain storage cycling behaviour or lose track of the state-of-charge, failing to consider the potential of low-cost long-duration off-river pumped hydro, and ignoring the broad suite of near-optimal energy transition pathways. We show that a temporal aggregation method based on 'segmentation' (fitted chronology) closely resembles the full-series optimisation, captures long-duration storage behaviour (48- and 160-hour durations), and finds a near-optimal 100% renewable electricity solution. We develop a new electricity system model to rapidly evaluate millions of other near-optimal solutions, stressing the importance of modelling pumped hydro sites with a low energy volume cost (&lt;US$50 per kilowatt-hour), long economic lifetime (~75 years), and low real discount rate akin to other natural monopolies (&lt;=3%). Almost every region of the world has access to sufficient 50 - 5000 gigawatt-hour off-river pumped hydro options that enable them to entirely decarbonise their future electricity systems.</description>

      <title>Behavioral patterns and mean-field games in epidemiological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of Mean Field Game epidemiological models, in which subpopulations have different behavioral patterns: some are viewed as "highly rational" (choosing Nash-equilibrium long-term strategies) while others follow pre-specified "non-rational" patterns (e.g., either sticking to their usual habits or trying to mimic those around them). Our model also allows for occasional behavioral switches, which rational individuals also take into account when formulating their Nash-equilibrium strategies. While this modeling approach is general, here we develop it for individuals choosing their "contact rates" within a particular Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible-Dead (SIRSD) epidemics model. The latter is based on a frequency-based force of infection and the mortality rate that rapidly increases once the proportion of infected individuals exceeds some prescribed threshold, resulting in a strain on medical resources. Numerical tests illustrate the properties of our model and highlight the ways in which additional/non-rational behavioral patterns and behavioral switching increase the impact of infectious diseases. The paper aims to build a bridge between two distinct communities of epidemiological modelers and to promote the consideration of behavioral patterns in broader Mean Field Games literature.</description>

      <title>Shallow Neural Networks Learn Low-Degree Spherical Polynomials with Learnable Channel Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning a low-degree spherical polynomial of degree $\ell_0 = \Theta(1) \ge 1$ defined on the unit sphere in $\RR^d$ by training an over-parameterized two-layer neural network (NN) with channel attention in this paper. Our main result is the significantly improved sample complexity for learning such low-degree polynomials. We show that, for any regression risk $\eps \in (0,1)$, a carefully designed two-layer NN with channel attention and finite width of $m \ge \Theta({n^4 \log (2n/\delta)}/{d^{2\ell_0}})$ trained by the vanilla gradient descent (GD) requires the lowest sample complexity of $n \asymp \Theta(d^{\ell_0}/\eps)$ with probability $1-\delta$ for every $\delta \in (0,1)$, in contrast with the representative sample complexity $\Theta\pth{d^{\ell_0} \max\set{\eps^{-2},\log d}}$, where $n$ is the training daata size. Moreover, such sample complexity is not improvable since the trained network renders a sharp rate of the nonparametric regression risk of the order $\Theta(d^{\ell_0}/{n})$ with probability at least $1-\delta$. On the other hand, the minimax optimal rate for the regression risk with a kernel of rank $\Theta(d^{\ell_0})$ is $\Theta(d^{\ell_0}/{n})$, so that the rate of the nonparametric regression risk of the network trained by GD is minimax optimal. The training of the two-layer NN with channel attention consists of two stages. In Stage 1, a provable learnable channel selection algorithm identifies the ground-truth channel number $\ell_0$ from the initial $L \ge \ell_0$ channels in the first-layer activation, with high probability. This learnable selection is achieved by an efficient one-step GD update on both layers, enabling feature learning for low-degree polynomial targets. In Stage 2, the second layer is trained by standard GD using the activation function with the selected channels.</description>

      <title>Performative Policy Gradient: Optimality in Performative Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-deployment machine learning algorithms often influence the environments they act in, and thus shift the underlying dynamics that the standard reinforcement learning (RL) methods ignore. While designing optimal algorithms in this performative setting has recently been studied in supervised learning, the RL counterpart remains under-explored. In this paper, we prove the performative counterparts of the performance difference lemma and the policy gradient theorem in RL, and further introduce the Performative Policy Gradient algorithm (PePG). PePG is the first policy gradient algorithm designed to account for performativity in RL. Under softmax parametrisation, and also with and without entropy regularisation, we prove that PePG converges to performatively optimal policies, i.e. policies that remain optimal under the distribution shifts induced by themselves. Thus, PePG significantly extends the prior works in Performative RL that achieves performative stability but not optimality. Furthermore, our empirical analysis on standard performative RL environments validate that PePG outperforms standard policy gradient algorithms and the existing performative RL algorithms aiming for stability.</description>

      <title>Relu and softplus neural nets as zero-sum turn-based games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the output of a ReLU neural network can be interpreted as the value of a zero-sum, turn-based, stopping game, which we call the ReLU net game. The game runs in the direction opposite to that of the network, and the input of the network serves as the terminal reward of the game. In fact, evaluating the network is the same as running the Shapley-Bellman backward recursion for the value of the game. Using the expression of the value of the game as an expected total payoff with respect to the path measure induced by the transition probabilities and a pair of optimal policies, we derive a discrete Feynman-Kac-type path-integral formula for the network output. This game-theoretic representation can be used to derive bounds on the output from bounds on the input, leveraging the monotonicity of Shapley operators, and to verify robustness properties using policies as certificates. Moreover, training the neural network becomes an inverse game problem: given pairs of terminal rewards and corresponding values, one seeks transition probabilities and rewards of a game that reproduces them. Finally, we show that a similar approach applies to neural networks with Softplus activation functions, where the ReLU net game is replaced by its entropic regularization.</description>

      <title>Leveraging High-Fidelity Digital Models and Reinforcement Learning for Mission Engineering: A Case Study of Aerial Firefighting Under Perfect Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As systems engineering (SE) objectives evolve from design and operation of monolithic systems to complex System of Systems (SoS), the discipline of Mission Engineering (ME) has emerged which is increasingly being accepted as a new line of thinking for the SE community. Moreover, mission environments are uncertain, dynamic, and mission outcomes are a direct function of how the mission assets will interact with this environment. This proves static architectures brittle and calls for analytically rigorous approaches for ME. To that end, this paper proposes an intelligent mission coordination methodology that integrates digital mission models with Reinforcement Learning (RL), that specifically addresses the need for adaptive task allocation and reconfiguration. More specifically, we are leveraging a Digital Engineering (DE) based infrastructure that is composed of a high-fidelity digital mission model and agent-based simulation; and then we formulate the mission tactics management problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and employ an RL agent trained via Proximal Policy Optimization. By leveraging the simulation as a sandbox, we map the system states to actions, refining the policy based on realized mission outcomes. The utility of the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator is demonstrated through an aerial firefighting case study. Our findings indicate that the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator not only surpasses baseline performance but also significantly reduces the variability in mission performance. Thus, this study serves as a proof of concept demonstrating that DE-enabled mission simulations combined with advanced analytical tools offer a mission-agnostic framework for improving ME practice; which can be extended to more complicated fleet design and selection problems in the future from a mission-first perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a brief introduction to control theory in finite-dimensional spaces. The material is partly based on my lectures for the Master 1 program in Math\'ematiques et applications at Sorbonne University, delivered over the past few years. The aim is to provide a concise overview of the subject, primarily focusing on the linear setting. Proofs are presented in detail and are selected to allow for extensions to the infinite-dimensional case in many situations. Topics covered include the Kalman rank condition, the Hautus test, observability, stability, detectability and dynamic observers, the Pole Shifting Theorem, the linear test for controllability, linear-quadratic optimal control over finite and infinite horizons, and stabilization via Gramians.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning Optimization for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems via Event-Triggered Robust Adaptive Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15735v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes a unified control architecture that couples a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-driven controller with a disturbance-rejection Extended State Observer (ESO), complemented by an Event-Triggered Mechanism (ETM) to limit unnecessary computations. The ESO is utilized to estimate the system states and the lumped disturbance in real time, forming the foundation for effective disturbance compensation. To obtain near-optimal behavior without an accurate system description, a value-iteration-based Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP) method is adopted for policy approximation. The inclusion of the ETM ensures that parameter updates of the learning module are executed only when the state deviation surpasses a predefined bound, thereby preventing excessive learning activity and substantially reducing computational load. A Lyapunov-oriented analysis is used to characterize the stability properties of the resulting closed-loop system. Numerical experiments further confirm that the developed approach maintains strong control performance and disturbance tolerance, while achieving a significant reduction in sampling and processing effort compared with standard time-triggered ADP schemes.</description>

      <title>Studies on the Rao-Nakra Sandwich Beam: Well-Posedness, Dynamics, and Controllability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the well-posedness, stabilization, and boundary controllability of a linear Rao-Nakra type sandwich beam. The system consists of three coupled equations that represent the longitudinal displacements of the outer layers and the transverse displacement of the composite beam, all of which are coupled with dynamical boundary conditions. In the first problem, time-dependent weights and delays are considered. Then, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions for the Cauchy problem associated with the damped system using semigroup theory and a classical result by Kato. Furthermore, employing a Lyapunov-based approach, we prove that the system's energy decays exponentially, despite the presence of time-varying weights and delays. In the second problem, we consider a boundary linear control system and prove its well-posedness. By deriving an observability inequality for the adjoint system and applying the Hilbert Uniqueness Method (HUM), we show that the system is null controllable. A key contribution of this work lies in handling the full three-equation coupled system, which involves significant difficulty due to the dynamic boundary conditions, resolved via appropriately constructed Lyapunov functionals and intermediate observability inequalities.</description>

      <title>On the nudging approach to continuous data assimilation in the limit of infinite error feedback gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article studies the intimate relationship between two filtering algorithms for continuous data assimilation, the synchronization filter and the nudging filter, in the paradigmatic context of the two-dimensional (2D) Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) for incompressible fluids. In this setting, the nudging filter can formally be viewed as an affine perturbation of the 2D NSE. Thus, in the degenerate limit of zero nudging parameter, the nudging filter converges to the solution of the 2D NSE. However, when the nudging parameter of the nudging filter is large, the perturbation becomes singular. It is shown that in the singular limit of infinite nudging parameter, the nudging filter converges to the synchronization filter. In establishing this result, the article fills a notable gap in the literature surrounding these algorithms. Numerical experiments are then presented that confirm the theoretical results and probes the issue of selecting a nudging strategy in the presence of observational noise. In this direction, an adaptive nudging strategy is proposed that leverages the insight gained from the relationship between the synchronization filter and the nudging filter that produces measurable improvement over the constant nudging strategy.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we polynomially reduce an instance of the partition problem to a dynamic lot sizing problem, and show that solving the latter problem solves the former problem. By solving the dynamic program formulation of the dynamic lot sizing problem, we show that the instance of the partition problem can be solved with pseudo-polynomial time complexity. Numerical results on solving instances of the partition problem are also provided using an implementation of the algorithm that solves the dynamic program. We conclude by discussing polynomial time solvability of the partition problem through further observation on the dynamic program formulation of the dynamic lot sizing problem.</description>

      <title>Efficient Low-Tubal-Rank Tensor Estimation via Alternating Preconditioned Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07490v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of low-tubal-rank tensor estimation is a fundamental task with wide applications across high-dimensional signal processing, machine learning, and image science. Traditional approaches tackle such a problem by performing tensor singular value decomposition, which is computationally expensive and becomes infeasible for large-scale tensors. Recent approaches address this issue by factorizing the tensor into two smaller factor tensors and solving the resulting problem using gradient descent. However, this kind of approach requires an accurate estimate of the tensor rank, and when the rank is overestimated, the convergence of gradient descent and its variants slows down significantly or even diverges. To address this problem, we propose an Alternating Preconditioned Gradient Descent (APGD) algorithm, which accelerates convergence in the over-parameterized setting by adding a preconditioning term to the original gradient and updating these two factors alternately. Based on certain geometric assumptions on the objective function, we establish linear convergence guarantees for more general low-tubal-rank tensor estimation problems. Then we further analyze the specific cases of low-tubal-rank tensor factorization and low-tubal-rank tensor recovery. Our theoretical results show that APGD achieves linear convergence even under over-parameterization, and the convergence rate is independent of the tensor condition number. Extensive simulations on synthetic data are carried out to validate our theoretical assertions.</description>
