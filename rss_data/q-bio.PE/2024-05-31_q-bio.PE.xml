      <title>Bounding the softwired parsimony score of a phylogenetic network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In comparison to phylogenetic trees, phylogenetic networks are more suitable to represent complex evolutionary histories of species whose past includes reticulation such as hybridisation or lateral gene transfer. However, the reconstruction of phylogenetic networks remains challenging and computationally expensive due to their intricate structural properties. For example, the small parsimony problem that is solvable in polynomial time for phylogenetic trees, becomes NP-hard on phylogenetic networks under softwired and parental parsimony, even for a single binary character and structurally constrained networks. To calculate the parsimony score of a phylogenetic network $N$, these two parsimony notions consider different exponential-size sets of phylogenetic trees that can be extracted from $N$ and infer the minimum parsimony score over all trees in the set. In this paper, we ask: What is the maximum difference between the parsimony score of any phylogenetic tree that is contained in the set of considered trees and a phylogenetic tree whose parsimony score equates to the parsimony score of $N$? Given a gap-free sequence alignment of multi-state characters and a rooted binary level-$k$ phylogenetic network, we use the novel concept of an informative blob to show that this difference is bounded by $k+1$ times the softwired parsimony score of $N$. In particular, the difference is independent of the alignment length and the number of character states. We show that an analogous bound can be obtained for the softwired parsimony score of semi-directed networks, while under parental parsimony on the other hand, such a bound does not hold.</description>

      <title>Transmission of multiple pathogens across species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse a model that describes the propagation of many pathogens within and between many species. A branching process approximation is used to compute the probability of disease outbreaks. Special cases of aquatic environments with two host species and one or two pathogens are considered both analytically and computationally.</description>

      <title>New sector morphologies emerge from anisotropic colony growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Competition during range expansions is of great interest from both practical and theoretical view points. Experimentally, range expansions are often studied in homogeneous Petri dishes, which lack spatial anisotropy that might be present in realistic populations. Here, we analyze a model of anisotropic growth, based on coupled Kardar-Parisi-Zhang and Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov equations that describe surface growth and lateral competition. Compared to a previous study of isotropic growth, anisotropy relaxes a constraint between parameters of the model. We completely characterize spatial patterns and invasion velocities in this generalized model. In particular, we find that strong anisotropy results in a distinct morphology of spatial invasion with a kink in the displaced strain ahead of the boundary between the strains. This morphology of the out-competed strain is similar to a shock wave and serves as a signature of anisotropic growth.</description>

      <title>Unbending strategies shepherd cooperation and suppress extortion in spatial populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary game dynamics on networks typically consider the competition among simple strategies such as cooperation and defection in the Prisoner's Dilemma and summarize the effect of population structure as network reciprocity. However, it remains largely unknown regarding the evolutionary dynamics involving multiple powerful strategies typically considered in repeated games, such as the zero-determinant (ZD) strategies that are able to enforce a linear payoff relationship between them and their co-players. Here, we consider the evolutionary dynamics of always cooperate (AllC), extortionate ZD (extortioners), and unbending players in lattice populations based on the commonly used death-birth updating. Out of the class of unbending strategies, we consider a particular candidate, PSO Gambler, a machine-learning-optimized memory-one strategy, which can foster reciprocal cooperation and fairness among extortionate players. We derive analytical results under weak selection and rare mutations, including pairwise fixation probabilities and long-term frequencies of strategies. In the absence of the third unbending type, extortioners can achieve a half-half split in equilibrium with unconditional cooperators for sufficiently large extortion factors. However, the presence of unbending players fundamentally changes the dynamics and tilts the system to favor unbending cooperation. Most surprisingly, extortioners cannot dominate at all regardless of how large their extortion factor is, and the long-term frequency of unbending players is maintained almost as a constant. Our analytical method is applicable to studying the evolutionary dynamics of multiple strategies in structured populations. Our work provides insights into the interplay between network reciprocity and direct reciprocity, revealing the role of unbending strategies in enforcing fairness and suppressing extortion.</description>

      <title>Phylogenetic degrees for Jukes-Cantor model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jukes-Cantor model is one of the most meaningful statistical models from a biological perspective. We are interested in computing the algebraic degrees for phylogenetic varieties, which we call phylogenetic degrees, associated to the Jukes-Cantor model and any tree. As these varieties are toric, their geometry is hidden in the associated polytopes. For this reason, we provide two different combinatorial approaches to compute the volume for these polytopes.</description>

      <title>Eco-evolutionary dynamics of cooperative antimicrobial resistance in a population of fluctuating volume and size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance to drugs (AMR), a global threat to human and animal health, is often regarded as resulting from a cooperative behaviour. Moreover, microbes generally evolve in volatile environments that, together with demographic fluctuations (birth and death events), drastically alter population size and strain survival. Motivated by the need to better understand the evolution of AMR, we study a population of time-varying size consisting of two competing strains, one drug-resistant and one drug-sensitive, subject to demographic and environmental variability. This is modelled by a binary carrying capacity randomly switching between mild and harsh environmental conditions, and driving the fluctuating volume (total amount of nutrients and antimicrobials at fixed concentration), and thus the size of the community (number of resistant and sensitive cells). We assume that AMR is a shared public good when the concentration of resistant cells exceeds a fixed concentration cooperation threshold, above which the sensitive strain has a growth advantage, whereas resistant cells dominate below it. Using computational means, and devising an analytical treatment (built on suitable quenched and annealed averaging procedures), we fully characterise the influence of fluctuations on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of AMR, and notably obtain specific strain fixation and long-lasting coexistence probabilities as a function of the environmental variation rate and cooperation threshold. We find that microbial strains tend to coexistence, but demographic fluctuations eventually lead to the extinction of resistant or sensitive cells for small or large values of the concentration cooperation threshold, respectively. This also holds for dynamic environments, whose specific properties determine the extinction timescale.</description>

      <title>DendroPy 5: a mature Python library for phylogenetic computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14120</link>

Abstract: Contemporary bioinformatics has seen in profound new visibility into the composition, structure, and history of the natural world around us. Arguably, the central pillar of bioinformatics is phylogenetics -- the study of hereditary relatedness among organisms. Insight from phylogenetic analysis has touched nearly every corner of biology. Examples range across natural history, population genetics and phylogeography, conservation biology, public health, medicine, in vivo and in silico experimental evolution, application-oriented evolutionary algorithms, and beyond. High-throughput genetic and phenotypic data has realized groundbreaking results, in large part, through conjunction with open-source software used to process and analyze it. Indeed, the preceding decades have ushered in a flourishing ecosystem of bioinformatics software applications and libraries. Over the course of its nearly fifteen-year history, the DendroPy library for phylogenetic computation in Python has established a generalist niche in serving the bioinformatics community. Here, we report on the recent major release of the library, DendroPy version 5. The software release represents a major milestone in transitioning the library to a sustainable long-term development and maintenance trajectory. As such, this work positions DendroPy to continue fulfilling a key supporting role in phyloinformatics infrastructure.</description>
