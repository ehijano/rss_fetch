      <title>Quantum Buffer Design Using Petri Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a simplified quantum Petri net (QPN) model and uses this model to generalize classical SISO, SIMO, MISO, MIMO and priority buffers to their quantum counterparts. It provides a primitive storage element, namely a quantum S-R flip-flop design using quantum CNOT and SWAP gates that can be replicated to obtain a quantum register for any given number of qubits. The aforementioned quantum buffers are then obtained using the simplified QPN model and quantum registers. $\!\!$The quantum S-R flip-flop and quantum buffer designs have been tested using OpenQASM and Qiskit on IBM quantum computers and simulators and the results validate the presented quantum S-R flip-flop and buffer designs.</description>

      <title>Photonic KAN: a Kolmogorov-Arnold network inspired efficient photonic neuromorphic architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) models were recently proposed and claimed to provide improved parameter scaling and interpretability compared to conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) models. Inspired by the KAN architecture, we propose the Photonic KAN -- an integrated all-optical neuromorphic platform leveraging highly parametric optical nonlinear transfer functions along KAN edges. In this work, we implement such nonlinearities in the form of cascaded ring-assisted Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) devices. This innovative design has the potential to address key limitations of current photonic neural networks. In our test cases, the Photonic KAN showcases enhanced parameter scaling and interpretability compared to existing photonic neural networks. The photonic KAN achieves approximately 65$\times$ reduction in energy consumption and area, alongside a 50$\times$ reduction in latency compared to previous MZI-based photonic accelerators with similar performance for function fitting task. This breakthrough presents a promising new avenue for expanding the scalability and efficiency of neuromorphic hardware platforms.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Effectiveness of Student Organization Activities using Natural Language Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Student extracurricular activities play an important role in enriching the students' educational experiences. With the increasing popularity of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, it becomes a logical step that incorporating ML-NLP in improving extracurricular activities is a potential focus of study in Artificial Intelligence (AI). This research study aims to develop a machine learning workflow that will quantify the effectiveness of student-organized activities based on student emotional responses using sentiment analysis. The study uses the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) Large Language Model (LLM) called via the pysentimiento toolkit, as a Transformer pipeline in Hugging Face. A sample data set from Organization C, a Recognized Student Organization (RSO) of a higher educational institute in the Philippines, College X, was used to develop the workflow. The workflow consisted of data preprocessing, key feature selection, LLM feature processing, and score aggregation, resulting in an Event Score for each data set. The results show that the BERT LLM can also be used effectively in analyzing sentiment beyond product reviews and post comments. For the student affairs offices of educational institutions, this study can provide a practical example of how NLP can be applied to real-world scenarios, showcasing the potential impact of data-driven decision making.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing for Enhanced Feature Selection in Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feature selection is vital for identifying relevant variables in classification and regression models, especially in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis. Traditional methods like LASSO often struggle with the nonlinearities and multicollinearities in scRNA-seq data due to complex gene expression and extensive gene interactions. Quantum annealing, a form of quantum computing, offers a promising solution. In this study, we apply quantum annealing-empowered quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) for feature selection in scRNA-seq data. Using data from a human cell differentiation system, we show that QUBO identifies genes with nonlinear expression patterns related to differentiation time, many of which play roles in the differentiation process. In contrast, LASSO tends to select genes with more linear expression changes. Our findings suggest that the QUBO method, powered by quantum annealing, can reveal complex gene expression patterns that traditional methods might overlook, enhancing scRNA-seq data analysis and interpretation.</description>

      <title>Control-Flow Attestation: Concepts, Solutions, and Open Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06304v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control-flow attestation unifies the worlds of control-flow integrity and platform attestation by measuring and reporting a target's run-time behaviour to a verifier. Trust assurances in the target are provided by testing whether its execution follows an authorised control-flow path. The problem has been explored in various settings, such as assessing the trustworthiness of cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things devices, cloud platforms, and many others. Despite a significant number of proposals being made in recent years, the area remains fragmented, addressing different adversarial behaviours, verification paradigms, and deployment challenges. In this paper, we present the first survey of control-flow attestation, examining the core ideas and solutions in state-of-the-art schemes. In total, we survey over 30 papers published between 2016-2024, consolidate and compare their key features, and pose several challenges and recommendations for future research in the area.</description>
