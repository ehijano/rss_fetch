      <title>Paraxial micro earthquake: a natural effective multi-purpose check shot for downhole earthquake monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Downhole earthquake monitoring, without the effects from the overburden, can record better seismic data than monitoring on surface. However, in order to reasonably use the downhole vector seismic data, a constant challenge is how to accurately orient the downhole radial-component seismometers. A common practice is to use offset check shots on or near the surface. However, in areas with complex geologies, this routine may result in significant orientation errors. A ParAxial Micro Earthquake (PAME) is a micro earthquake at a close distance to the seismometers and near the extended path of the borehole's trajectory. It is rarely recorded during downhole earthquake monitoring unless designed for. If it is recorded, it can be a real treasure not only for P-wave and S-wave velocities' profiling, but for the downhole seismometers' orientation. As an example, during April to May in 2005, Paulsson installed an 80-level 3-component VSP (Vertical Seismic Profiling) array in the SAFOD (San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth) main hole at Parkfield, California, and continuously recorded seismic data for about 13 days. Large charge offset check shots at 13 different locations near the surface were detonated in order to orient the downhole geophones; the orientation results were unsatisfactory but went unnoticed or unsolved. Besides this, a small charge "zero-offset" check shot was detonated near the wellhead in order to get the P-wave and S-wave velocity profiles, but only the P-wave velocity profiling was successful. Fortunately, we recorded a few PAMEs, through which we not only obtained better P-wave and S-wave velocity profiles, but satisfactorily oriented the downhole geophones.</description>

      <title>SeisFusion: Constrained Diffusion Model with Input Guidance for 3D Seismic Data Interpolation and Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geographical, physical, or economic constraints often result in missing traces within seismic data, making the reconstruction of complete seismic data a crucial step in seismic data processing. Traditional methods for seismic data reconstruction require the selection of multiple empirical parameters and struggle to handle large-scale continuous missing data. With the development of deep learning, various neural networks have demonstrated powerful reconstruction capabilities. However, these convolutional neural networks represent a point-to-point reconstruction approach that may not cover the entire distribution of the dataset. Consequently, when dealing with seismic data featuring complex missing patterns, such networks may experience varying degrees of performance degradation. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel diffusion model reconstruction framework tailored for 3D seismic data. To constrain the results generated by the diffusion model, we introduce conditional supervision constraints into the diffusion model, constraining the generated data of the diffusion model based on the input data to be reconstructed. We introduce a 3D neural network architecture into the diffusion model, successfully extending the 2D diffusion model to 3D space. Additionally, we refine the model's generation process by incorporating missing data into the generation process, resulting in reconstructions with higher consistency. Through ablation studies determining optimal parameter values, our method exhibits superior reconstruction accuracy when applied to both field datasets and synthetic datasets, effectively addressing a wide range of complex missing patterns. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/WAL-l/SeisFusion.</description>
