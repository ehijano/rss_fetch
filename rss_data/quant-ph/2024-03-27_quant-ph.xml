      <title>Relativistic exponential-type spinor orbitals and their use in many-electron Dirac equation solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dirac-Coulomb type differential equation and its solution relativistic exponential-type spinor orbitals are introduced. They provide a revised form for operator invariants, namely Dirac invariants, simplifying the treatment of the angular components in calculation of many-electron systems. The relativistic Coulomb energy is determined by employing a spectral solution to Poisson's equation for the one$-$electron potential, which is expressed in terms of radial functions involving incomplete gamma functions. The computation for incomplete gamma functions posses challenges due to slow convergence rate associated with their series representation. Such difficulties are eliminated through use of the bi-directional method along with hyper-radial functions. A new formulation for relativistic auxiliary functions that improve the efficiency in Coulomb energy calculations is presented. These formulations also contribute to inquiring into orthogonal expansions for solutions to Poisson's equation using complete orthonormal sets of exponential orbitals with non-integer principal quantum numbers. They may provide a meaningful alternative series representations.</description>

      <title>Quantum enhanced distributed phase sensing with a truncated SU(1,1) interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, distributed quantum sensing has gained interest for a range of applications requiring networks of sensors, from global-scale clock synchronization to high energy physics. In particular, a network of entangled sensors can improve not only the sensitivity beyond the shot noise limit, but also enable a Heisenberg scaling with the number of sensors. Here, using bright entangled twin beams, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate the detection of a linear combination of two distributed phases beyond the shot noise limit with a truncated SU(1,1) interferometer. We experimentally demonstrate a quantum noise reduction of 1.7 dB and a classical 3 dB signal-to-noise ratio improvement over the separable sensing approach involving two truncated SU(1,1) interferometers. Additionally, we theoretically extend the use of a truncated SU(1,1) interferometer to a multi-phase-distributed sensing scheme that leverages entanglement as a resource to achieve a quantum improvement in the scaling with the number of sensors in the network. Our results pave the way for developing quantum enhanced sensor networks that can achieve an entanglement-enhanced sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Quasiprobabilities in quantum thermodynamics and many-body systems: A tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasiprobabilities are mathematical quantities describing the statistics of measurement outcomes evaluated at two or more times, which incorporate the incompatibility of the measurement observables and the state of the measured quantum system. In this tutorial, we present the definition, interpretation and properties of the main quasiprobabilities known in the literature. We also discuss techniques to experimentally access a quasiprobability distribution, ranging from the weak two-point measurement scheme, to a Ramsey-like interferometric scheme and procedures assisted by an external detector. Once defined the fundamental concepts following the standpoint of joint measurability in quantum mechanics, we illustrate the use of quasiprobabilities in quantum thermodynamics to describe the quantum statistics of work and heat, and to explain anomalies in the energy exchanges entailed by a given thermodynamic transformation. On the one hand, in work protocols, we show how absorbed energy can be converted to extractable work and vice versa due to Hamiltonian incompatibility at distinct times. On the other hand, in exchange processes between two quantum systems initially at different temperatures, we explain how quantum correlations in their initial state may induce cold-to-hot energy exchanges, which are unnatural between any pair of equilibrium non-driven systems. We conclude the tutorial by giving simple examples where quasiprobabilities are applied to many-body systems: scrambling of quantum information, sensitivity to local perturbations, quantum work statistics in the quenched dynamics of models that can be mapped onto systems of free fermions, for instance the Ising model with a transverse field. Throughout the tutorial, we meticulously present derivations of essential concepts alongside straightforward examples, aiming to enhance comprehension and facilitate learning.</description>

      <title>Generation of genuine multipartite entangled states via indistinguishability of identical particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indistinguishability of identical particles is a resource for quantum information processing and has been utilized to generate entanglement from independent particles that spatially overlap only at the detection stage. Here we provide a general controllable scheme capable of generating, from a pure product state of $N$ qubits, a comprehensive class of multipartite entangled states, including W, Dicke, GHZ, and cluster states with both bosonic and fermionic statistics within the framework of spatially localized operations and classical communication (sLOCC). Using graph-based representations of the sLOCC framework, we translate the generation schemes of specific entangled states into colored, complex, and weighted digraphs, each corresponding to a given experimental setup. This graph-theoretical approach allows for precise targeting of particular multipartite states, exploration of diverse generation schemes, and optimization of generation efficiency. Our results demonstrate that the indistinguishability of identical graph nodes in quantum networks offers useful perspectives for photonic technology.</description>

      <title>Energy control in a quantum oscillator using coherent control and engineered environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and analyze a new method for manipulation of energy in a quantum harmonic oscillator using coherent, e.g., electromagnetic, field and incoherent control. Coherent control is typically implemented by shaped laser pulse or tailored electromagnetic field. Incoherent control is implemented by engineered environment, whose mean number of excitations at the frequency of the oscillator is used as a control variable. An approach to coherent and incoherent controls design based on the speed gradient algorithms in general, finite and differential forms is proposed. It is proved that the differential form is able to completely manipulate the energy of the oscillator: an arbitrary energy can be achieved starting from any initial state of the oscillator. The key instrument which allows for complete energy manipulation in this case is the use of the engineered environment. A robustified speed-gradient control algorithm in differential form is also proposed. It is shown that the proposed robustified control algorithm ensures exponential stability of the closed loop system which is preserved for sampled-data control.</description>

      <title>Boson Sampling from Non-Gaussian States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boson sampling has emerged as an important tool to demonstrate the difference between quantum and classical computers and has attracted the interest of experimentalists and theoreticians. In this work we study Boson sampling from general, single-mode states using a scheme that can generate any such state by combining Gaussian states and photon number measurements. We derive a formula that can be used to calculate the output photon number probabilities of these states after they travel through a linear interferometer. This extends the Boson sampling protocol to the widest array of possible single-mode states and from this we show that the complexity scaling of all such states is similar and hence there is no complexity advantage of using complex input states over simpler ones.</description>

      <title>Emergence of multiphoton quantum coherence by light propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modification of the quantum properties of coherence of photons through their interaction with matter lies at the heart of the quantum theory of light. Indeed, the absorption and emission of photons by atoms can lead to different kinds of light with characteristic quantum statistical properties. As such, different types of light are typically associated with distinct sources. Here, we report on the observation of the modification of quantum coherence of multiphoton systems in free space. This surprising effect is produced by the scattering of thermal multiphoton wavepackets upon propagation. The modification of the excitation mode of a photonic system and its associated quantum fluctuations result in the formation of different light fields with distinct quantum coherence properties. Remarkably, we show that these processes of scattering can lead to multiphoton systems with sub-shot-noise quantum properties. Our observations are validated through the nonclassical formulation of the emblematic van Cittert-Zernike theorem. We believe that the possibility of producing quantum systems with modified properties of coherence, through linear propagation, can have dramatic implications for diverse quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Mapping of Quantum Circuits: Entering the Multi-Core Era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in computation, offering the potential to solve complex problems intractable for classical computers. Although current quantum processors already consist of a few hundred of qubits, their scalability remains a significant challenge. Modular quantum computing architectures have emerged as a promising approach to scale up quantum computing systems. This paper delves into the critical aspects of distributed multi-core quantum computing, focusing on quantum circuit mapping, a fundamental task to successfully execute quantum algorithms across cores while minimizing inter-core communications. We derive the theoretical bounds on the number of non-local communications needed for random quantum circuits and introduce the Hungarian Qubit Assignment (HQA) algorithm, a multi-core mapping algorithm designed to optimize qubit assignments to cores with the aim of reducing inter-core communications. Our exhaustive evaluation of HQA against state-of-the-art circuit mapping algorithms for modular architectures reveals a $4.9\times$ and $1.6\times$ improvement in terms of execution time and non-local communications, respectively, compared to the best performing algorithm. HQA emerges as a very promising scalable approach for mapping quantum circuits into multi-core architectures, positioning it as a valuable tool for harnessing the potential of quantum computing at scale.</description>

      <title>The pretty bad measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum state discrimination problem has Alice sending a quantum state to Bob who wins if he correctly identifies the state. The pretty good measurement, also known as the square root measurement, performs pretty well at this task. We study the version of this problem where Bob tries to lose with the greatest probability possible (which is harder than it sounds). We define the pretty bad measurement which performs pretty well at this task, or in other words, pretty poorly for the original task. We show that both the pretty good measurement and the pretty bad measurement are always no worse than blind guessing at their respective tasks. As an application, we apply the pretty bad measurement to the quantum state anomaly detection problem and show how to avoid pretty bad qubits.</description>

      <title>Convert laser light into single photons via interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser light possesses perfect coherence, but cannot be attenuated to single photons via linear optics. An elegant route to convert laser light into single photons is based on photon blockade in a cavity with a single atom in the strong coupling regime. However, the single-photon purity achieved by this method remains relatively low. Here we propose an interference-based approach where laser light can be transformed into single photons by destructively interfering with a weak but super-bunched incoherent field emitted from a cavity coupling to a single quantum emitter. We demonstrate this idea by measuring the reflected light of a laser field which drives a double-sided optical microcavity containing a single artificial atom-quantum dot (QD) in the Purcell regime. The reflected light consists of a superposition of the driving field with the cavity output field. We achieve the second-order autocorrelation g2(0)=0.030+-0.002 and the two-photon interference visibility 94.3%+-0.2. By separating the coherent and incoherent fields in the reflected light, we observe that the incoherent field from the cavity exhibits super-bunching with g2(0)=41+-2 while the coherent field remains Poissonian statistics. By controlling the relative amplitude of coherent and incoherent fields, we verify that photon statistics of reflected light is tuneable from perfect anti-bunching to super-bunching in agreement with our predictions. Our results demonstrate photon statistics of light as a quantum interference phenomenon that a single QD can scatter two photons simultaneously at low driving fields in contrast to the common picture that a single two-level quantum emitter can only scatter (or absorb and emit) single photons. This work opens the door to tailoring photon statistics of laser light via cavity or waveguide quantum electrodynamics and interference.</description>

      <title>Exact block encoding of imaginary time evolution with universal quantum neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a constructive approach to generate quantum neural networks capable of representing the exact thermal states of all many-body qubit Hamiltonians. The Trotter expansion of the imaginary-time propagator is implemented through an exact block encoding by means of a unitary, restricted Boltzmann machine architecture. Marginalization over the hidden-layer neurons (auxiliary qubits) creates the non-unitary action on the visible layer. Then, we introduce a unitary deep Boltzmann machine architecture, in which the hidden-layer qubits are allowed to couple laterally to other hidden qubits. We prove that this wave function ansatz is closed under the action of the imaginary-time propagator and, more generally, can represent the action of a universal set of quantum gate operations. We provide analytic expressions for the coefficients for both architectures, thus enabling exact network representations of thermal states without stochastic optimization of the network parameters. In the limit of large imaginary time, the ansatz yields the ground state of the system. The number of qubits grows linearly with the system size and total imaginary time for a fixed interaction order. Both networks can be readily implemented on quantum hardware via mid-circuit measurements of auxiliary qubits. If only one auxiliary qubit is measured and reset, the circuit depth scales linearly with imaginary time and system size, while the width is constant. Alternatively, one can employ a number of auxiliary qubits linearly proportional to the system size, and circuit depth grows linearly with imaginary time only.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give two upper bounds to the mutual information in arbitrary quantum estimation strategies. The first is based on some simple Fourier properties of the estimation apparatus. The second is derived using the first but, interestingly, depends only on the Fisher information of the parameter, so it is valid even beyond quantum estimation. We illustrate the usefulness of these bounds by characterizing the quantum phase estimation algorithm in the presence of noise. In addition, for the noiseless case, we extend the analysis beyond applying the bound and we discuss the optimal entangled and adaptive strategies, clarifying inaccuracies appearing on this topic in the literature.</description>

      <title>Incoherent GRAPE (inGRAPE) for optimization of quantum systems with environmentally assisted control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we review several results on development and application of incoherent version of GRAPE (Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering) approach, inGRAPE, to optimization for open quantum systems driven by both coherent and incoherent controls. In the incoherent control approach, the environment serves as a control together with coherent field, and decoherence rates become generally time-dependent. For a qubit, explicit analytic expressions for evolution of the density matrix were obtained by solving a cubic equation via Cardano method. We discuss applications of incoherent GRAPE method to high fidelity gate generation for open one- and two-qubit systems and surprising properties of the underlying control landscapes, forming two groups - smooth single peak landscapes for Hadamard, C-NOT and C-Z gates, and more complicated with two peaks for T (or $\pi/8$) gate. For a qutrit, a formulation of the environment-assisted incoherent control with time-dependent decoherence rates is provided.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Simulation-Based Optimization for Newsvendor Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation-based optimization is a widely used method to solve stochastic optimization problems. This method aims to identify an optimal solution by maximizing the expected value of the objective function. However, due to its computational complexity, the function cannot be accurately evaluated directly, hence it is estimated through simulation. Exploiting the enhanced efficiency of Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) compared to classical Monte Carlo simulation, it frequently outpaces classical simulation-based optimization, resulting in notable performance enhancements in various scenarios. In this work, we make use of a quantum-enhanced algorithm for simulation-based optimization and apply it to solve a variant of the classical Newsvendor problem which is known to be NP-hard. Such problems provide the building block for supply chain management, particularly in inventory management and procurement optimization under risks and uncertainty</description>

      <title>Compressed sensing enhanced by quantum approximate optimization algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework to deal with a range of large scale compressive sensing problems using a quantum subroutine. We apply a quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) to support detection in a sparse signal reconstruction algorithm: matching pursuit. The constrained optimization required in this algorithm is difficult to handle when the size of the problem is large and constraints are given by unstructured patterns. Our framework utilizes specially designed structured constraints that are easy to manipulate and reduce the optimization problem to the solution of an Ising model which can be found using Ising solvers. In this research, we test the performance of QAOA for this purpose on a simulator of quantum computer. We observe that our method can outperform reference classical methods. Our results explore a promising path of applying quantum computers in the compressive sensing field.</description>

Abstract: When the interaction Hamiltonian is $\widehat{H}_I = \kappa \left(\hat{x}_3 \hat{p}_1 + \hat{p}_3 \hat{p_2} \right)$ for large $\kappa$ and the initial quantum state is $\Psi_{in} (x_1, x_2, x_3) = \prod_{j=1}^3 \phi_j (x_j)$, the joint measurement of complementary variables $x_3$ and $p_3$ at $t = 1 / \kappa$ induces the uncertainty $\Delta_{\hat{x}_1} (t = 1 / \kappa) \Delta_{ \hat{x}_2} (t = 1 / \kappa) \geq \frac{1}{2} (\Delta_{\hat{x}_1} \Delta_{\hat{p}_1} + \Delta_{\hat{x}_2} \Delta_{\hat{p}_2} ) + \Delta_{\hat{x}_3} \Delta_{\hat{p}_3}$ , where the standard deviations in the right hand are the deviations at $t=0$. This is a generalized version of the well-known Arthurs-Keller inequality $\Delta_{\hat{x}_1} (t = 1 / \kappa) \Delta_{ \hat{x}_2} (t = 1 / \kappa) \geq 1$ arising when all $\phi_j (x_j)$ are the minimal uncertainty Gaussian states. If the initial probe state is entangled, it is shown that the generalized Arthurs-Kelly inequality can be violated. We show the violation explicitly by introducing a special example.</description>

      <title>Quantum accelerated cross regression algorithm for multiview feature extraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-view Feature Extraction (MvFE) has wide applications in machine learning, image processing and other fields. When dealing with massive high-dimensional data, the performance of classical computer faces severe challenges due to MvFE involves expensive matrix calculation. To address this challenge, a quantum-accelerated cross-regression algorithm for MvFE is proposed. The main contributions are as follows:(1) a quantum version algorithm for MvFE is proposed for the first time, filling the gap of quantum computing in the field of MvFE;(2) a quantum algorithm is designed to construct the block-encoding of the target data matrix, so that the optimal Hamiltonian simulation technology based on the block-encoding framework can be used to efficiently realize the quantum simulation of the target data matrix. This approach reduces the dependence of the algorithm's on simulation errors to enhance algorithm performance;(3) compared with the classical counterpart algorithm, the proposed quantum algorithm has a polynomial acceleration in the number of data points, the dimension of data points and the number of view data.</description>

      <title>Quadratic speed-ups in quantum kernelized binary classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classification is at the core of data-driven prediction and decision-making, representing a fundamental task in supervised machine learning. Recently, several quantum machine learning algorithms that use quantum kernels as a measure of similarities between data have emerged to perform binary classification on datasets encoded as quantum states. The potential advantages of quantum kernels arise from the ability of quantum computers to construct kernels that are more effective than their classical counterparts in capturing patterns in data or computing kernels more efficiently. However, existing quantum kernel-based classification algorithms do not harness the capability of having data samples in quantum superposition for additional enhancements. In this work, we demonstrate how such capability can be leveraged in quantum kernelized binary classifiers (QKCs) through Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) for quadratic speed-up. Additionally, we propose new quantum circuits for the QKCs in which the number of qubits is reduced by one, and the circuit depth is reduced linearly with respect to the number of sample data. We verify the quadratic speed-up over previous methods through numerical simulations on the Iris dataset.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optimization for the Future Energy Grid: Summary and Quantum Utility Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this project summary paper, we summarize the key results and use-cases explored in the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) funded project "Q-GRID" which aims to assess potential quantum utility optimization applications in the electrical grid. The project focuses on two layers of optimization problems relevant to decentralized energy generation and transmission as well as novel energy transportation/exchange methods such as Peer-2-Peer energy trading and microgrid formation. For select energy grid optimization problems, we demonstrate exponential classical optimizer runtime scaling even for small problem instances, and present initial findings that variational quantum algorithms such as QAOA and hybrid quantum annealing solvers may provide more favourable runtime scaling to obtain similar solution quality. These initial results suggest that quantum computing may be a key enabling technology in the future energy transition insofar that they may be able to solve business problems which are already challenging at small problem instance sizes.</description>

      <title>Spectral and dynamical validity of the rotating-wave approximation in the quantum and semiclassical Rabi models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrastrong coupling (USC) in the quantum Rabi model, characterized by the breakdown of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) has become a topic of considerable interest and study. This critical reevaluation of the validity of the RWA concludes that the accepted definition of USC in terms of a fixed ratio of coupling to field frequency is inadequate. Connecting an improved spectral validity criterion with the derivation of the semiclassical limit predicts that the dynamical validity of the quantum RWA should be linked to that of the corresponding semiclassical model. This, however, is not supported by numerical calculations of coherent-state dynamics, which unambiguously demonstrate that spectral validity does not imply dynamical validity and reveal surprisingly complicated dependence on coupling and field amplitude.</description>

      <title>Towards a Dutch hybrid quantum/HPC infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Inspire has taken important steps to enable quantum applications by developing a setting that allows the execution of hybrid algorithms. Currently, the setting uses a classical server (HPC node) co-located with the quantum computer for the high frequency coupling needed by hybrid algorithms. A fast task manager (dispatcher) has been developed to orchestrate the interaction between the server and the quantum computer. Although successful, the setting imposes a specific hybrid job-structure. This is most likely always going to be the case and we are currently discussing how to make sure this does not hamper the uptake of the setting. Furthermore, first steps have been taken towards the integration with the Dutch National High-Performance Computing (HPC) Center, hosted by SURF. As a first approach we have setup a setting consisting of two SLURM clusters, one in the HPC (C1) and the second (C2) co-located with Quantum Inspire API. Jobs are submitted from C1 to C2. Quantum Inspire can then schedule with C2 the jobs to the quantum computer. With this setting, we enable control from both SURF and Quantum Inspire on the jobs being executed. By using C1 for the jobs submission we remove the accounting burden from Quantum Inspire. By having C2 co-located with Quantum Inspire API, we make the setting more resilient towards network failures. This setting can be extended for other HPC centers to submit jobs to Quantum Inspire backends.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is currently hindered by hardware noise. We present a freestyle superconducting pulse optimization method, incorporating two-qubit channels, which enhances flexibility, execution speed, and noise resilience. A minimal 0.22 ns pulse is shown to determine the H2 groundstate to within chemical accuracy upon real-hardware, approaching the quantum speed limit. Similarly, a pulse significantly shorter than circuit-based counterparts is found for the LiH molecule, attaining state-of-the-art accuracy. The method is general and can potentially accelerate performance across various quantum computing components and hardware.</description>

      <title>Fermihedral: On the Optimal Compilation for Fermion-to-Qubit Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Fermihedral, a compiler framework focusing on discovering the optimal Fermion-to-qubit encoding for targeted Fermionic Hamiltonians. Fermion-to-qubit encoding is a crucial step in harnessing quantum computing for efficient simulation of Fermionic quantum systems. Utilizing Pauli algebra, Fermihedral redefines complex constraints and objectives of Fermion-to-qubit encoding into a Boolean Satisfiability problem which can then be solved with high-performance solvers. To accommodate larger-scale scenarios, this paper proposed two new strategies that yield approximate optimal solutions mitigating the overhead from the exponentially large number of clauses. Evaluation across diverse Fermionic systems highlights the superiority of Fermihedral, showcasing substantial reductions in implementation costs, gate counts, and circuit depth in the compiled circuits. Real-system experiments on IonQ's device affirm its effectiveness, notably enhancing simulation accuracy.</description>

      <title>A new double-pass type of the optical spring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In detuned optical cavities, the radiation pressure force acting on the mirrors depends on their displacements. This is equivalent to the rigidity (the optical spring), inserted between the mirrors. This effect can be used for optimization of the mechanical susceptibility of probe mirrors in high-precision force sensors. However, in some cases, the use of detuned cavities or even just any high-finesse cavities could be problematic due to technological constraints.
  We consider a new type of the optical spring that does not require the cavity (but can use a resonance tuned one to increase the optomechanical coupling). Instead, it uses the double interaction of the probing light with the mechanical object. We propose two possible implementation of this concept, suitable, respectively, for the atomic spin ensembles and for the laser gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Experimental Realization of Discrete Time Quasi-Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floquet (periodically driven) systems can give rise to unique non-equilibrium phases of matter without equilibrium analogs. The most prominent example is the realization of discrete time crystals. An intriguing question emerges: what other novel phases can manifest when the constraint of time periodicity is relaxed? In this study, we explore quantum systems subjected to a quasi-periodic drive. Leveraging a strongly interacting spin ensemble in diamond, we identify the emergence of long-lived discrete time quasi-crystals. Unlike conventional time crystals, time quasi-crystals exhibit robust sub-harmonic responses at multiple incommensurate frequencies. Furthermore, we show that the multi-frequency nature of the quasi-periodic drive allows for the formation of diverse patterns associated with different discrete time quasi-crystalline phases. Our findings demonstrate the existence of non-equilibrium phases in quasi-Floquet settings, significantly broadening the catalog of novel phenomena in driven many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>A Floquet analysis perspective of driven light-matter interaction models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the harmonically driven Jaynes-Cummings and Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models using both numerical integration of time-dependent Hamiltonians and Floquet theory. For a separation of time-scales between the drive and intrinsic Rabi oscillations in the former model, the driving results in an effective periodic reversal of time. The corresponding Floquet Hamilto- nian is a Wannier-Stark model, which can be analytically solved. Despite the chaotic nature of the driven Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, moderate system sizes can display qualitatively different behaviors under varying system parameters. Ergodicity arises in systems that are neither adiabatic nor diabatic, owing to repeated multi-level Landau-Zener transitions. Chaotic behavior, observed in slow driving, manifests as random jumps in the magnetization, suggesting potential utility as a random number generator. Furthermore, we discuss both models in terms of what we call Floquet Fock state lattices.</description>

      <title>Sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum hypothesis testing has been traditionally studied from the information-theoretic perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error probabilities as a function of the number of samples of an unknown state. In this paper, we study the sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing, wherein the goal is to determine the minimum number of samples needed to reach a desired error probability. By making use of the wealth of knowledge that already exists in the literature on quantum hypothesis testing, we characterize the sample complexity of binary quantum hypothesis testing in the symmetric and asymmetric settings, and we provide bounds on the sample complexity of multiple quantum hypothesis testing. In more detail, we prove that the sample complexity of symmetric binary quantum hypothesis testing depends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the fidelity. As a counterpart of the quantum Stein's lemma, we also find that the sample complexity of asymmetric binary quantum hypothesis testing depends logarithmically on the inverse type~II error probability and inversely on the quantum relative entropy. Finally, we provide lower and upper bounds on the sample complexity of multiple quantum hypothesis testing, with it remaining an intriguing open question to improve these bounds.</description>

      <title>Emergent Anomalous Hydrodynamics at Infinite Temperature in a Long-Range XXZ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional wisdom suggests that transports of conserved quantities in non-integrable quantum many-body systems at high temperatures are diffusive. However, we discover a counterexample of this paradigm by uncovering anomalous hydrodynamics in a spin-1/2 XXZ chain with power-law couplings. This model, classified as non-integrable due to its Wigner-Dyson level-spacing statistics in the random matrix theory, exhibits a surprising superdiffusive-ballistic-superdiffusive transport transition by varying the power-law exponent of couplings for a fixed anisotropy. Our findings are verified by multiple observables, including the spin-spin autocorrelator, mean-square displacement, and spin conductivity. Interestingly, we further quantify the degree of quantum chaos using the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the entanglement entropy distributions of the model's eigenstates and a random state. Remarkably, an observed local maximum in the divergence near the transition boundary suggests a link between anomalous hydrodynamics and a suppression of quantum chaos. This work offers another deep understanding of emergent anomalous transport phenomena in a wider range of non-integrable quantum many-body systems</description>

      <title>Tensor network formulation of symmetry protected topological phases in mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define and classify symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in mixed states based on the tensor network formulation of the density matrix. In one dimension, we introduce strong injective matrix product density operators (MPDO), which describe a broad class of short-range correlated mixed states, including the locally decohered SPT states. We map strong injective MPDO to a pure state in the doubled Hilbert space and define the SPT phases according to the cohomology class of the symmetry group in the doubled state. Although the doubled state exhibits an enlarged symmetry, the possible SPT phases are also constrained by the Hermiticity and the semi-positivity of the density matrix. We here obtain a complete classification of SPT phases with a direct product of strong $G$ and weak $K$ unitary symmetry given by the cohomology group $\mathcal{H}^2(G, \text{U}(1))\oplus\mathcal{H}^1(K, \mathcal{H}^1(G, \text{U}(1)))$. The SPT phases in our definition are preserved under symmetric local circuits consisting of non-degenerate channels. This motivates an alternative definition of SPT phases according to the equivalence class of mixed states under a ``one-way" connection using symmetric non-degenerate channels. In locally purifiable MPDO with strong symmetry, we prove that this alternative definition reproduces the cohomology classification. We further extend our results to two-dimensional mixed states described by strong semi-injective tensor network density operators and classify the possible SPT phases.</description>

      <title>Scaling tunnelling noise in the fractional quantum Hall effect tells about renormalization and breakdown of chiral Luttinger liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect provides a paradigmatic example of a topological phase of matter. FQH edges are theoretically described via models belonging to the class of chiral Luttinger liquid (CLL) theories [1 (Wen, 2007)]. These theories predict exotic properties of the excitations, such as fractional charge and fractional statistics. Despite theoretical confidence in this description and qualitative experimental confirmations, quantitative experimental evidence for CLL behaviour is scarce. In this work, we study tunnelling between edge modes in the quantum Hall regime at the filling factor $\nu=1/3$. We present measurements at different system temperatures and perform a novel scaling analysis of the experimental data, originally proposed in Ref. [2 (Schiller et al., 2022)]. Our analysis shows clear evidence of CLL breakdown - above a certain energy scale. In the low-energy regime, where the scaling behaviour holds, we extract the property called the scaling dimension and find it heavily renormalized compared to na\"ive CLL theory predictions. Our results show that decades-old experiments contain a lot of previously overlooked information that can be used to investigate the physics of quantum Hall edges. In particular, we open a road to quantitative experimental studies of (a) scaling dimension renormalization in quantum point contacts and (b) CLL breakdown mechanisms at an intermediate energy scale, much smaller than the bulk gap.</description>

      <title>Applicability of mean-field theory for time-dependent open quantum systems with infinite-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding quantum many-body systems with long-range or infinite-range interactions is of relevance across a broad set of physical disciplines, including quantum optics, nuclear magnetic resonance and nuclear physics. From a theoretical viewpoint, these systems are appealing since they can be efficiently studied with numerics, and in the thermodynamic limit are expected to be governed by mean-field equations of motion. Over the past years the capabilities to experimentally create long-range interacting systems have dramatically improved permitting their control in space and time. This allows to induce and explore a plethora of nonequilibrium dynamical phases, including time-crystals and even chaotic regimes. However, establishing the emergence of these phases from numerical simulations turns out to be surprisingly challenging. This difficulty led to the assertion that mean-field theory may not be applicable to time-dependent infinite-range interacting systems. Here, we rigorously prove that mean-field theory in fact exactly captures their dynamics, in the thermodynamic limit. We further provide bounds for finite-size effects and their dependence on the evolution time.</description>

Abstract: In cavity magnomechanical systems, magnetic excitations couple simultaneously with mechanical vibrations and microwaves, combining the tunability of the magnetization, the long lifetimes of mechanical modes and the whole measurement toolbox of microwave systems. Such hybrid systems have been proposed for applications ranging from thermometry to entanglement generation. However, backaction noise can hinder the measurement of the mechanical vibrations, potentially rendering such applications infeasible. In this paper, we investigate the noise introduced in a mechanical mode of a cavity magnomechanical system in a one-tone drive scheme and propose a scheme for realizing backaction evasion measurements of the mechanical vibrations. Our proposal consists of driving the microwave cavity with two tones separated by twice the phonon frequency and with amplitudes balanced to generate equal numbers of coherent magnons. We demonstrate that different configurations of such a scheme are possible and show that drives centered around the lower frequency magnon-microwave polariton in a triple resonance scheme add the minimum imprecision noise in the measurement, even though such configuration is not the most robust to imperfections.</description>

Abstract: We conjecture a relation between the local dimension $d$ of a local nearest-neighbor critical Hamiltonian in one spatial dimension and the maximum central charge, $c_{\text{max}}$, that it can yield. Specifically, we propose that $c_{\text{max}} \leq d-1$, establishing a link between the short-distance lattice realization of a model and its emerging long-distance entanglement properties. This inequality can be viewed as a general form of a $c$-theorem establishing the reduction of effective degrees of freedom between the UV lattice and the IR conformal field theory. We support this conjecture with numerous examples.</description>

      <title>From Computing to Quantum Mechanics: Accessible and Hands-On Quantum Computing Education for High School Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper outlines an alternative approach to teaching quantum computing at the high school level, tailored for students with limited prior knowledge in advanced mathematics and physics. This approach diverges from traditional methods by building upon foundational concepts in classical computing before gradually introducing quantum mechanics, thereby simplifying the entry into this complex field. The course was initially implemented in a program for gifted high school students under the Hong Kong Education Bureau and received encouraging feedback, indicating its potential effectiveness for a broader student audience. A key element of this approach is the practical application through portable NMR quantum computers, which provides students with hands-on experience. The paper describes the structure of the course, including the organization of the lectures, the integration of the hardware of the portable nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum computers, the Gemini/Triangulum series, and detailed lecture notes in an appendix. The initial success in the specialized program and ongoing discussions to expand the course to regular high schools in Hong Kong and Shenzhen suggest the viability of this approach for wider educational application. By focusing on accessibility and student engagement, this approach presents a valuable perspective on introducing quantum computing concepts at the high school level, aiming to enhance student understanding and interest in the field.</description>

      <title>Equality of magnetization and edge current for interacting lattice fermions at positive temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the bulk magnetization is equal to the edge current in the thermodynamic limit for a large class of models of lattice fermions with finite-range interactions satisfying local indistinguishability of the Gibbs state, a condition known to hold for sufficiently high temperatures. Our result implies that edge currents in such systems are determined by bulk properties and are therefore stable against large perturbations near the boundaries. Moreover, the equality persists also after taking the derivative with respect to the chemical potential. We show that this form of bulk-edge correspondence is essentially a consequence of homogeneity in the bulk and locality of the Gibbs state. An important intermediate result is a new version of Bloch's theorem for two-dimensional systems, stating that persistent currents vanish in the bulk.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing provides a powerful framework for tackling computational problems that are classically intractable. The goal of this paper is to explore the use of quantum computers for solving relevant problems in systems and control theory. In the recent literature, different quantum algorithms have been developed to tackle binary optimization, which plays an important role in various control-theoretic problems. As a prototypical example, we consider the verification of interval matrix properties such as non-singularity and stability on a quantum computer. We present a quantum algorithm solving these problems and we study its performance in simulation. Our results demonstrate that quantum computers provide a promising tool for control whose applicability to further computationally complex problems remains to be explored.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature benchmarking of qubit control wires by primary electron thermometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-frequency qubit control wires require non-trivial thermal anchoring and low-pass filtering. The resulting electron temperature serves as a quality benchmark for these signal lines. In this technical note, we make use of a primary electron thermometry technique, using a Coulomb blockade thermometer, to establish the electron temperature in the millikelvin regime. The experimental four-probe measurement setup, the data analysis, and the measurement limitations are discussed in detail. We verify the results by also using another electron thermometry technique, based on a superconductor-insulator-normal metal junction. Our comparison of signal lines with QDevil's QFilter to unfiltered signal lines demonstrates that the filter significantly reduces both the rms noise and electron temperature, which is measured to be 22 $\pm$ 1 mK.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1606.02734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a quantum algorithm that emulates the action of an unknown unitary transformation on a given input state, using multiple copies of some unknown sample input states of the unitary and their corresponding output states. The algorithm does not assume any prior information about the unitary to be emulated or the sample input states. To emulate the action of the unknown unitary, the new input state is coupled to the given sample input-output pairs in a coherent fashion. Remarkably, the runtime of the algorithm is logarithmic in D, the dimension of the Hilbert space, and increases polynomially with d, the dimension of the subspace spanned by the sample input states. Furthermore, the sample complexity of the algorithm-i.e., the total number of copies of the sample input-output pairs needed to run the algorithm-is independent of D and polynomial in d. In contrast, the runtime and sample complexity of incoherent methods, i.e., methods that use tomography, are both linear in D. The algorithm is blind, in the sense that, at the end, it does not learn anything about the given samples or the emulated unitary. This algorithm can be used as a subroutine in other algorithms, such as quantum phase estimation.</description>

Abstract: We establish a quantum theory of computational ghost imaging and propose quantum projection imaging where object information can be reconstructed by quantum statistical correlation between a certain photon number of bucket signal and DMD random patterns. The reconstructed image can be negative or positive depending on the chosen photon number. In particular, the vacuum state (zero-number) projection produces a negative image with better visibility and contrast-to-noise ratio. The experimental results of quantum projection imaging agree well with theoretical simulations and show that, under the same measurement condition, vacuum projection imaging is superior to conventional and fast first-photon ghost imaging in low-light illumination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.17147v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The crossover from quantum to semiclassical behavior in the seminal Rabi model of light-matter interaction still, surprisingly, lacks a complete and rigorous understanding. A formalism for deriving the semiclassical model directly from the quantum Hamiltonian is developed here. Working in a displaced Fock-state basis $\lvert \alpha, n \rangle$, the semiclassical limit is obtained by taking $\lvert \alpha \rvert \to \infty$ and the coupling to zero. This resolves the discrepancy between coherent-state dynamics and semiclassical Rabi oscillations in both standard and ultrastrong coupling/driving regimes. Furthermore, it provides a framework for studying the quantum-to-classical transition, with potential applications in quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: Cryptography plays an important role in ensuring data security and authentication within information processing systems. As the prevalence of digital imagery continues to grow, safeguarding this form of data becomes increasingly crucial. However, existing security protocols, reliant on complex mathematical models, exhibit vulnerabilities in effectively protecting information from both internal and external threats. Moreover, the forthcoming advent of quantum computing poses a significant challenge, as it could decrypt data encrypted by classical. In this paper, we propose an efficient implementation scheme for a quantum image encryption algorithm combining the generalized affine transform and logistic map. We evaluated developed quantum circuits using qiskit and quantum devices to validate the encryption technique. Through comprehensive performance analysis, we have demonstrated the efficiency of the chosen encryption algorithm across various criteria. Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid methodology aimed at mitigating circuit complexity and reducing quantum cost. Leveraging the Espresso algorithm and incorporating an ancilla qubit into the circuitry, we achieve a remarkable 50\% reduction in cost while maintaining security and efficiency. Finally, we conducted robustness and security analyses to assess the resilience of our encryption method against diverse noise attacks. The results confirm that our proposed quantum image encryption technique provides a secure solution and offers precise and measurable quantum image processing capabilities.</description>

      <title>Quantum Vulnerability Analysis to Accurate Estimate the Quantum Algorithm Success Rate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.14446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While quantum computers provide exciting opportunities for information processing, they currently suffer from noise during computation that is not fully understood. Incomplete noise models have led to discrepancies between quantum program success rate (SR) estimates and actual machine outcomes. For example, the estimated probability of success (ESP) is the state-of-the-art metric used to gauge quantum program performance. The ESP suffers poor prediction since it fails to account for the unique combination of circuit structure, quantum state, and quantum computer properties specific to each program execution. Thus, an urgent need exists for a systematic approach that can elucidate various noise impacts and accurately and robustly predict quantum computer success rates, emphasizing application and device scaling. In this article, we propose quantum vulnerability analysis (QVA) to systematically quantify the error impact on quantum applications and address the gap between current success rate (SR) estimators and real quantum computer results. The QVA determines the cumulative quantum vulnerability (CQV) of the target quantum computation, which quantifies the quantum error impact based on the entire algorithm applied to the target quantum machine. By evaluating the CQV with well-known benchmarks on three 27-qubit quantum computers, the CQV success estimation outperforms the estimated probability of success state-of-the-art prediction technique by achieving on average six times less relative prediction error, with best cases at 30 times, for benchmarks with a real SR rate above 0.1%. Direct application of QVA has been provided that helps researchers choose a promising compiling strategy at compile time.</description>

Abstract: The quantum realms of nonlocality and contextuality are delineated by Bell's theorem and the Kochen-Specker theorem, respectively, embodying phenomena that surpass the explanatory capacities of classical theories. These realms hold transformative potential for the fields of information and computing technology. In this study, we unveil a ``all-versus-nothing" proof that concurrently illustrates the veracity of these two seminal theorems, fostering a more nuanced comprehension of the intricate relationship intertwining quantum nonlocality and contextuality. Leveraging the capabilities of three singlet pairs and a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state analyzer, our proof not only substantiates the conflict between quantum mechanics and hidden-variable theories from another perspective, but can also be readily verifiable utilizing the existing linear optics technology.</description>

Abstract: The multi-stage Stern$\unicode{x2013}$Gerlach experiment conducted by Frisch and Segr\`e includes two cascaded quantum measurements with a nonadiabatic flipper in between. The Frisch and Segr\`e experiment has been modeled analytically by Majorana without the nuclear effect and subsequently revised by Rabi with the hyperfine interaction. However, the theoretical predictions do not match the experimental observation accurately. Here, we numerically solve the standard quantum mechanical model, via the von Neumann equation, including the hyperfine interaction for the time evolution of the spin. Thus far, the coefficients of determination from the standard quantum mechanical model without using free parameters are still low, indicating a mismatch between the theory and the experiment. Non-standard variants that improve the match are explored for discussion.</description>

Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems and the Lindblad form master equation have always been regarded as reliable tools in dissipative modeling. Intriguingly, existing literature often obtains an equivalent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian by neglecting the quantum jumping terms in the master equation. However, there lacks investigation into the effects of discarded terms as well as the unified connection between these two approaches. In this study, we study the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with collective loss and gain from a topological perspective. When the system undergoes no quantum jump events, the corresponding shape matrix exhibits the same topological properties in contrast to the traditional non-Hermitian theory. Conversely, the occurrence of quantum jumps can result in a shift in the positions of the phase transition. Our study provides a qualitative analysis of the impact of quantum jumping terms and reveals their unique role in quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: Quantum generative modeling is a growing area of interest for industry-relevant applications. With the field still in its infancy, there are many competing techniques. This work is an attempt to systematically compare a broad range of these techniques to guide quantum computing practitioners when deciding which models and techniques to use in their applications. We compare fundamentally different architectural ansatzes of parametric quantum circuits used for quantum generative modeling: 1. A continuous architecture, which produces continuous-valued data samples, and 2. a discrete architecture, which samples on a discrete grid. We compare the performance of different data transformations: normalization by the min-max transform or by the probability integral transform. We learn the underlying probability distribution of the data sets via two popular training methods: 1. quantum circuit Born machines (QCBM), and 2. quantum generative adversarial networks (QGAN). We study their performance and trade-offs as the number of model parameters increases, with the baseline of similarly trained classical neural networks. The study is performed on six low-dimensional synthetic and two real financial data sets. Our two key findings are that: 1. For all data sets, our quantum models require similar or fewer parameters than their classical counterparts. In the extreme case, the quantum models require two of orders of magnitude less parameters. 2. We empirically find that a variant of the discrete architecture, which learns the copula of the probability distribution, outperforms all other methods.</description>

Abstract: Quantum walks have been used to develop quantum algorithms since their inception, and can be seen as an alternative to the usual circuit model; combining single-particle quantum walks on sparse graphs with two-particle scattering on a line lattice is sufficient to perform universal quantum computation. In this work we solve the problem of two- particle scattering on the line lattice for a family of interactions without translation invariance, recovering the Bose-Hubbard interaction as the limiting case. Due to its generality, our systematic approach lays the groundwork to solve the more general problem of multi-particle scattering on general graphs, which in turn can enable design of different or simpler quantum gates and gadgets. As a consequence of this work, we show that a CPHASE gate can be achieved with high fidelity when the interaction acts only on a small portion of the line graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07907v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that weakly entangled states can improve communication over a qubit channel using only separate, interference-free, measurements of individual photons. We introduce a communication task corresponding to the cryptographic primitive known as secret sharing and show that all steerable two-qubit isotropic states provide a quantum advantage in the success rate using only product measurements. Furthermore, we show that such measurements can even reveal communication advantages from noisy partially entangled states that admit no quantum steering. We then go further and consider a stochastic variant of secret sharing based on more sophisticated, yet standard, partial Bell state analysers, and show that this reveals advantages also for a range of unsteerable isotropic states. By preparing polarisation qubits in unsteerable states, we experimentally demonstrate improved success rates of both secret sharing tasks beyond the best entanglement-unassisted qubit protocol. Our results reveal the capability of simple and scalable measurements in entanglement-assisted quantum communication to overcome large amounts of noise.</description>

Abstract: In this theoretical investigation, we study the effectiveness of a protocol that incorporates periodic quantum resetting to prepare ground states of frustration-free parent Hamiltonians. This protocol uses a steering Hamiltonian that enables local coupling between the system and ancillary degrees of freedom. At periodic intervals, the ancillary system is reset to its initial state. For infinitesimally short reset times, the dynamics can be approximated by a Lindbladian whose steady state is the target state. For finite reset times, however, the spin chain and the ancilla become entangled between reset operations. To evaluate the performance of the protocol, we employ Matrix Product State simulations and quantum trajectory techniques, focusing on the preparation of the spin-1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki state. Our analysis considers convergence time, fidelity, and energy evolution under different reset intervals. Our numerical results show that ancilla system entanglement is essential for faster convergence. In particular, there exists an optimal reset time at which the protocol performs best. Using a simple approximation, we provide insights into how to optimally choose the mapping operators applied to the system during the reset procedure. Furthermore, the protocol shows remarkable resilience to small deviations in reset time and dephasing noise. Our study suggests that stroboscopic maps using quantum resetting may offer advantages over alternative methods, such as quantum reservoir engineering and quantum state steering protocols, which rely on Markovian dynamics.</description>

Abstract: A number of exciting recent results have been seen in the field of quantum error correction. These include initial demonstrations of error correction on current quantum hardware, and resource estimates which improve understanding of the requirements to run large-scale quantum algorithms for real-world applications. In this work, we bridge the gap between these two developments by performing careful estimation of the resources required to fault-tolerantly perform quantum phase estimation (QPE) on a minimal chemical example. Specifically, we describe a detailed compilation of the QPE circuit to lattice surgery operations for the rotated surface code, for a hydrogen molecule in a minimal basis set. We describe a number of optimisations at both the algorithmic and error correction levels. We find that implementing even a simple chemistry circuit requires 1,000 qubits and 2,300 quantum error correction rounds, emphasising the need for improved error correction techniques specifically targeting the early fault-tolerant regime.</description>

      <title>Topological photonic band gaps in honeycomb atomic arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13423v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectrum of excitations a two-dimensional, planar honeycomb lattice of two-level atoms coupled by the in-plane electromagnetic field may exhibit band gaps that can be opened either by applying an external magnetic field or by breaking the symmetry between the two triangular sublattices of which the honeycomb one is a superposition. We establish the conditions of band gap opening, compute the width of the gap, and characterize its topological property by a topological index (Chern number). The topological nature of the band gap leads to inversion of the population imbalance between the two triangular sublattices for modes with frequencies near band edges. It also prohibits a transition to the trivial limit of infinitely spaced, noninteracting atoms without closing the spectral gap. Surrounding the lattice by a Fabry-P\'erot cavity with small intermirror spacing $d &lt; {\pi}/k_0$ , where $k_0$ is the free-space wave number at the atomic resonance frequency, renders the system Hermitian by suppressing the leakage of energy out of the atomic plane without modifying its topological properties. In contrast, a larger $d$ allows for propagating optical modes that are built up due to reflections at the cavity mirrors and have frequencies inside the band gap of the free-standing lattice, thus closing the latter.</description>

      <title>Multiparameter quantum sensing and magnetic communications with a hybrid dc and rf optically pumped magnetometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and demonstrate a hybrid optically pumped magnetometer (HOPM) that simultaneously measures one dc field component and one rf field component quadrature with a single atomic spin ensemble. The HOPM achieves sub-pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ sensitivity for both dc and rf fields, and is limited in sensitivity by spin projection noise at low frequencies and by photon shot noise at high frequencies. We demonstrate with the HOPM a new application of multiparameter quantum sensing: background-cancelling spread spectrum magnetic communication. We encode a digital message as rf amplitude, spread among sixteen channels from \SI{29}{\kilo\hertz} to \SI{33}{\kilo\hertz} in a noisy magnetic environment, and observe quantum-noise-limited rf magnetic signal recovery enabled by quantum-noise-limited dc noise cancellation, reaching noise rejection of \SI{15}{\decibel} at \SI{100}{\hertz} and more than \SI{20}{\decibel} at \SI{60}{\hertz} and below. We measure signal fidelity versus signal strength and extrinsic noise in communication of a short text message. The combination of high sensitivity, quantum-noise-limited performance, and real-world application potential makes the HOPM ideally suited for study of high-performance multiparameter quantum sensing.</description>

Abstract: Quantum random access memory (QRAM) is a common architecture resource for algorithms with many proposed applications, including quantum chemistry, windowed quantum arithmetic, unstructured search, machine learning, and quantum cryptography. Here we propose two bucket-brigade QRAM architectures based on high-coherence superconducting resonators, which differ in their realizations of the conditional-routing operations. In the first, we directly construct controlled-$\mathsf{SWAP}$ ($\textsf{CSWAP}$) operations, while in the second we utilize the properties of giant-unidirectional emitters (GUEs). For both architectures we analyze single-rail and dual-rail implementations of a bosonic qubit. In the single-rail encoding we can detect first-order ancilla errors, while the dual-rail encoding additionally allows for the detection of photon losses. For parameter regimes of interest the post-selected infidelity of a QRAM query in a dual-rail architecture is nearly an order of magnitude below that of a corresponding query in a single-rail architecture. These findings suggest that dual-rail encodings are particularly attractive as architectures for QRAM devices in the era before fault tolerance.</description>

Abstract: Explaining the behavior of macroscopic objects from the point of view of the quantum paradigm has challenged the scientific community for a century today. A mechanism of gravitational self-interaction, governed by the so-called Schroedinger-Newton equation, is among the proposals that aim to shed some light on it. Despite all efforts, this mechanism has been proven difficult to probe. Here, we consider a simple Stern-Gerlach-like experiment to try it out. The Schroedinger-Newton equation can be analytically solved under certain proper conditions, and a dephasing effect induced by the gravitational self-interacting potential can be calculated.</description>

      <title>Toward Local Madelung Mechanics in Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that relativistic quantum theory leads to a local interpretation of quantum mechanics wherein the universal wavefunction in configuration space is entirely replaced with an ensemble of local fluid equations in spacetime. For want of a fully relativistic quantum fluid treatment, we develop a model using the nonrelativistic Madelung equations, and obtain conditions for them to be local in spacetime. Every particle in the Madelung fluid is equally real, and has a definite position, momentum, kinetic energy, and potential energy. These are obtained by defining quantum momentum and kinetic energy densities for the fluid and separating the momentum into average and symmetric parts, and kinetic energy into classical kinetic and quantum potential parts. The two types of momentum naturally give rise to a single classical kinetic energy density, which contains the expected kinetic energy, even for stationary states, and we define the reduced quantum potential as the remaining part of the quantum kinetic energy density. We treat the quantum potential as a novel mode of internal energy storage within the fluid particles, which explains most of the nonclassical behavior of the Madelung fluid. For example, we show that in tunneling phenomena the quantum potential negates the barrier so that nothing prevents the fluid from flowing through. We show how energy flows and transforms in this model, and that enabling local conservation of energy requires defining a quantum potential energy current that flows through the fluid rather than only flowing with it. The nonrelativistic treatment generally contains singularities in the velocity field, which undermines the goal of local dynamics, but we expect a proper relativistic treatment will bound the fluid particle velocities at $c$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement on Fractal Landscapes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the interplay of fractal geometry and quantum entanglement by analyzing the von Neumann entropy (known as entanglement entropy) and the entanglement contour in the scaling limit. Focusing on free-fermion quantum models known for their simplicity and effectiveness in studying highly entangled quantum systems, we uncover intriguing findings. For gapless ground states exhibiting a finite density of states at the chemical potential, we reveal a super-area law characterized by the presence of a logarithmic divergence in the entanglement entropy. This extends the well-established super-area law observed on translationally invariant Euclidean lattices where the Gioev-Klich-Widom conjecture regarding the asymptotic behavior of Toeplitz matrices holds significant influence. Furthermore, we observe the emergence of a self-similar and universal pattern termed an ``entanglement fractal'' in the entanglement contour data as we approach the scaling limit. Remarkably, this pattern bears resemblance to intricate Chinese paper-cutting designs. We provide general rules to artificially generate this fractal, offering insights into the universal scaling of entanglement entropy. Building upon the insights gained from the entanglement fractal, we explicitly elucidate the origin of the logarithmic divergence on fractals where translation symmetry is broken and the Widom conjecture is inapplicable. For gapped ground states, we observe that the entanglement entropy adheres to a generalized area law, with its dependence on the Hausdorff dimension of the boundary between complementary subsystems.</description>

      <title>Towards the Intuitive Understanding of Quantum World: Sonification of Rabi Oscillations, Wigner functions, and Quantum Simulators</title>

Abstract: Recently, there has been considerable interest in "sonifying" scientific data; however, sonifying quantum processes using the newest quantum technologies, including Noise Intermediate Scale Quantum devices and quantum random number generators, is still an emerging area of research. Music technologists and composers employ the growing accessibility to diverse data from quantum mechanics as musical tools in the hope of generating new sound expressions. How different is the quantum world from the classical one, and is it possible to express the quantum world using sounds? Quantum phenomena are very different from those that we experience in our everyday lives. Thus, it is challenging to understand them intuitively. In this paper, we propose sonification as a method toward an intuitive understanding of various quantum mechanical phenomena, from Rabi oscillations and resonance fluorescence of a single atom through the generation of Schr\"odinger cat states in strong laser field physics to insulator-superfluid transition in quantum many-body systems. This paper illustrates various methods we experimented with in sonification and score representations of quantum data depending on the source data and performance settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A full-fledged quantum network relies on the formation of entangled links between remote location with the help of quantum repeaters. The famous Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller quantum repeater protocol is based on long distance single-photon interference, which not only requires high phase stability but also cannot generate maximally entangled state. Here, we propose a quantum repeater protocol using the idea of post-matching, which retains the same efficiency as the single-photon interference protocol, reduces the phase-stability requirement and can generate maximally entangled state in principle. Numerical simulations show that our protocol has its superiority by comparing with existing protocols under a generic noise model. Our work uncovers the internal connection between quantum key distribution and quantum repeater, which brings new insight to the development of these two fields. We believe our work represents a crucial step towards the construction of a fully-connected quantum network.</description>

      <title>Dynamical signatures of non-Markovianity in a dissipative-driven qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate signatures of non-Markovianity in the dynamics of a periodically-driven qubit coupled to a dissipative bosonic environment. We propagate the dynamics of the reduced density matrix of the qubit by integrating the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion. Non-Markovian features are quantified by comparing on an equal footing the predictions from diverse and complementary approaches to quantum dissipation. In particular, we analyze the distinguishability of quantum states, the decay of the volume accessible to the qubit on the Hilbert space, the negativity of the canonical rates in the generalized Lindblad equation and the relaxation of the memory kernels in the Nakajima--Zwanzig generalized quantum master equation. We study the effects of controlled driving on the coherent dynamics of the system. We show that a suitable external field can offset the ergodic relaxation of time correlation functions, increase distinguishability over time and strengthen non-Markovian effects witnessed by the canonical dissipation channels. We furthermore observe the phenomenon of eternal non-Markovianity for sufficiently small system-bath coupling and we discuss how this can be enhanced by modulating the frequency of the external drive. The present work provides a broad theoretical analysis of quantum dissipation in the framework of open quantum dynamics and quantum information.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a variational quantum solver for combinatorial optimizations over $m=\mathcal{O}(n^k)$ binary variables using only $n$ qubits, with tunable $k&gt;1$. The number of parameters and circuit depth display mild linear and sublinear scalings in $m$, respectively. Moreover, we analytically prove that the specific qubit-efficient encoding brings in a super-polynomial mitigation of barren plateaus as a built-in feature. This leads to unprecedented quantum-solver performances. For $m=7000$, numerical simulations produce solutions competitive in quality with state-of-the-art classical solvers. In turn, for $m=2000$, an experiment with $n=17$ trapped-ion qubits featured MaxCut approximation ratios estimated to be beyond the hardness threshold $0.941$. To our knowledge, this is the highest quality attained experimentally on such sizes. Our findings offer a novel heuristics for quantum-inspired solvers as well as a promising route towards solving commercially-relevant problems on near term quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the one-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices with linearly varying nonreciprocal hopping, where the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is found to be dissolved gradually as the strength of nonreciprocity increases. The energy spectrum under the open boundary condition is composed of real and imaginary eigenenergies when the nonreciprocal hopping is weak. Interestingly, the real eigenenergies form an equally spaced ladder, and the corresponding eigenstates are localized at the boundary with a Gaussian distribution due to NHSE. By increasing the nonreciprocity, the number of real eigenenergies will decrease while more and more eigenenergies become imaginary. Accompanied by the real-imaginary transition in the spectrum, the eigenstates are shifted from the boundary into the bulk of the lattice. When the nonreciprocity gets strong enough, the whole spectrum will be imaginary and the NHSE disappears completely in the system; i.e., all the eigenstates become Gaussian bound states localized inside the bulk. Our work unveils the exotic properties of non-Hermitian systems with spatially varying nonreciprocal hopping.</description>

      <title>Beyond unital noise in variational quantum algorithms: noise-induced barren plateaus and fixed points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08721v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) hold much promise but face the challenge of exponentially small gradients. Unmitigated, this barren plateau (BP) phenomenon leads to an exponential training overhead for VQAs. Perhaps the most pernicious are noise-induced barren plateaus (NIBPs), a type of unavoidable BP arising from open system effects, which have so far been shown to exist for unital noise maps. Here, we generalize the study of NIBPs to more general completely positive, trace-preserving maps, establishing the existence of NIBPs in the unital case and a class of non-unital maps we call Hilbert-Schmidt (HS)-contractive. The latter includes amplitude damping. We tighten to logarithmic earlier bounds on the circuit depth at which an NIBP appears. We identify the associated phenomenon of noise-induced fixed points (NIFP) of the VQA cost function and prove its existence for both unital and HS-contractive non-unital noise maps. Along the way, we extend the parameter shift rule of VQAs to the noisy setting. We provide rigorous bounds in terms of the relevant parameters that give rise to NIBPs and NIFPs, along with numerical simulations of the depolarizing and amplitude-damping maps that illustrate our analytical results.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a broad lemma, one consequence of which is the higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) of tensors defined by DeLathauwer, DeMoor and Vandewalle (2000). By an analogous application of the lemma, we find a complex orthogonal version of the HOSVD. Kraus' (2010) algorithm used the HOSVD to compute normal forms of almost all $n$-qubit pure states under the action of the local unitary group. Taking advantage of the double cover $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{C}) \times \operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{C}) \to \operatorname{SO}_4({\mathbb{C}})$, we produce similar algorithms (distinguished by the parity of $n$) that compute normal forms for almost all $n$-qubit pure states under the action of the SLOCC group.</description>

Abstract: Finite dimensional entanglement for pure states has been used extensively in quantum information theory. Depending on the tensor product structure, even set of separable states can show non-intuitive characters. Two situations are well studied in the literature, namely the unextendible product basis by Bennett et al [Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 5385, (1999)], and completely entangled subspaces explicitly given by Parthasarathy in [Proc. Indian Acad. Sci. Math. Sci. 114, 4 (2004)]. More recently Boyer, Liss, and Mor [Phys. Rev. A 95, 032308 (2017)]; Boyer and Mor [Preprints 2023080529, (2023)]; and Liss, Mor, and Winter [arXiv: 2309.05144, (2023)] have studied spaces which have only finitely many pure product states. We carry this further and consider the problem of perturbing different spaces, such as the orthogonal complement of an unextendible product basis and also Parthasarathy's completely entangled spaces, by taking linear spans with specified product vectors. To this end, we develop methods and theory of variations and perturbations of the linear spans of certain unextendible product bases, their orthogonal complements, and also Parthasarathy's completely entangled sub-spaces. Finally we give examples of perturbations with infinitely many pure product states.</description>

Abstract: This study combines the quantum Rubik's Cube matrix with the Benalcazar Bernevig Hughes model, defines a matrix algorithm based on the reverse process of convolution, and constructs an expression for the quantum Rubik's Cube matrix and Hamiltonian. Furthermore, in order to make the operation of the quantum Rubik's Cube matrix clearer, we use a Josephus ring to draw a topological graph of the Rubik's Cube expansion. This article uses a quantum Rubik's Cube to calculate energy level transitions of electrons, and shows that its operation corresponds to path integration. The band dispersion is obtained. This work provides new ideas and methods for calculating Hamiltonians and studying energy level structure.</description>

      <title>Strong Thermomechanical Noise Squeezing Stabilized by Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02328v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Squeezing the quadrature noise of a harmonic oscillator used as a sensor can enhance its sensitivity in certain measurment schemes. The canonical approach, based on parametric modulation of the oscillation frequency, is usually limited to a squeezing of at most 3 dB. However, this can be overcome by additional stabilization of the anti-squeezed quadrature. Here, we apply this approach to highly-stressed silicon nitride membrane resonators, with effective masses of the order few nanograms and quality factors routinely exceeding 108, which hold promise for sensing applications in both the classical and quantum regimes. We benchmark their performance using either piezo or capacitive parametric modulation. We observe maximum thermomechanical squeezing by record-high 17 dB and 21 dB, respectively, and we argue that even larger values can be attained with minimal changes to the device design. Finally, we provide a full quantum theory of a combination of this approach with quantum-limited motion measurement and conclude that quantum squeezing is attainable at moderate cryogenic temperatures.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal dynamics and non-Hermitian skin effect of repulsively bound pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a Bose-Hubbard model coupled to an engineered environment which in the non-interacting limit is described by the celebrated Hatano-Nelson model. At strong interactions, two bosons occupying the same site form a so-called repulsively bound pair, or doublon. Using tensor-network simulations, we clearly identify a distinct doublon lightcone and show that the doublon inherits non-reciprocity from that of single particles. Applying the idea of reservoir engineering at the level of doublons, we introduce a new set of dissipators and we analytically show that then the doublon dynamics are governed by the Hatano-Nelson model. This brings about an interaction-induced non-Hermitian skin effect and non-reciprocal doublon motion. Combining features of the two models we study, we show that single particles and doublons can be made to spread with opposite directionality, opening intriguing possibilities for the study of dynamics in interacting non-reciprocal models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.04074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-oscillations are the result of an efficient mechanism generating periodic motion from a constant power source. In quantum devices, these oscillations may arise due to the interaction between single electron dynamics and mechanical motion. We show that, due to the complexity of this mechanism, these self-oscillations may irrupt, vanish, or exhibit a bistable behaviour causing hysteresis cycles. We observe these hysteresis cycles and characterize the stability of different regimes in both single and double quantum dot configurations. In particular cases, we find these oscillations stable for over 20 seconds, many orders of magnitude above electronic and mechanical characteristic timescales, revealing the robustness of the mechanism at play.</description>

      <title>Quantum Control Machine: The Limits of Control Flow in Quantum Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.15000v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms for tasks such as factorization, search, and simulation rely on control flow such as branching and iteration that depends on the value of data in superposition. High-level programming abstractions for control flow, such as switches, loops, and higher-order functions, are ubiquitous in classical languages. By contrast, many quantum languages do not provide high-level abstractions for control flow in superposition, and instead require the use of hardware-level logic gates to implement such control flow.
  The reason for this gap is that whereas a classical computer supports control flow using a program counter that can depend on data, the typical architecture of a quantum computer does not provide a program counter that can depend on data in superposition. As a result, the complete set of control flow abstractions that can be correctly realized on a quantum computer has not yet been established.
  In this work, we provide a complete characterization of the properties of control flow abstractions that are correctly realizable on a quantum computer. First, we prove that even on a quantum computer whose program counter exists in superposition, one cannot correctly realize control flow in quantum algorithms by lifting the classical conditional jump instruction to work in superposition. This theorem denies the ability to directly lift general abstractions for control flow such as the $\lambda$-calculus from classical to quantum programming.
  In response, we present the necessary and sufficient conditions for control flow to be correctly realizable on a quantum computer. We introduce the quantum control machine, an instruction set architecture featuring a conditional jump that is restricted to satisfy these conditions. We show how this design enables a developer to correctly express control flow in quantum algorithms using a program counter in place of logic gates.</description>

      <title>Supervised Training of Neural-Network Quantum States for the Next Nearest Neighbor Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Different neural network architectures can be unsupervisedly or supervisedly trained to represent quantum states. We explore and compare different strategies for the supervised training of feed forward neural network quantum states. We empirically and comparatively evaluate the performance of feed forward neural network quantum states in different phases of matter for variants of the architecture, for different hyper-parameters, and for two different loss functions, to which we refer as \emph{mean-squared error} and \emph{overlap}, respectively. We consider the next-nearest neighbor Ising model for the diversity of its phases and focus on its paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, and pair-antiferromagnetic phases. We observe that the overlap loss function allows better training of the model across all phases, provided a rescaling of the neural network.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Gauge Theory for Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05253v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous gauge theories, because of their bosonic degrees of freedom, have an infinite-dimensional local Hilbert space. Encoding these degrees of freedom on qubit-based hardware demands some sort of ``qubitization'' scheme, where one approximates the behavior of a theory while using only finitely many degrees of freedom. We propose a novel qubitization strategy for gauge theories, called ``fuzzy gauge theory,'' building on the success of the fuzzy $\sigma$-model in earlier work. We provide arguments that the fuzzy gauge theory lies in the same universality class as regular gauge theory, in which case its use would obviate the need of any further limit besides the usual spatial continuum limit. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these models are relatively resource-efficient for quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Aharonov-Bohm Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect, by placing a quantum system in free-fall around a gravitating body {\it e.g.} a satellite orbiting the Earth. Since the system is in free-fall, by the equivalence principle, the quantum system is locally in flat, gravity-free space-time - it is screened from the gravitational field. For a slightly elliptical orbit, the gravitational potential will change with time. This leads to the energy levels of the quantum system developing side bands which is the signature for this version of the Aharonov-Bohm effect. This contrasts with the normal signature of the Aharonov-Bohm effect of shifting of interference fringes.</description>

      <title>Topological defect formation in a phase transition with tunable order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) describes the non-equilibrium dynamics and topological defect formation in systems undergoing second-order phase transitions. KZM has found applications in fields such as cosmology and condensed matter physics. However, it is generally not suitable for describing first-order phase transitions. It has been demonstrated that transitions in systems like superconductors or charged superfluids, typically classified as second-order, can exhibit weakly first-order characteristics when the influence of fluctuations is taken into account. Moreover, the order of the phase transition (i.e., the extent to which it becomes first rather than second order) can be tuned. We explore quench-induced formation of topological defects in such tunable phase transitions and propose that their density can be predicted by combining KZM with nucleation theory.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy in Scalar Quantum Electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10332v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find the entanglement entropy of a subregion of the vacuum state in scalar quantum electrodynamics, working perturbatively to the 2-loops level. Doing so leads us to derive the Maxwell-Proca propagator in conical Euclidean space. The area law of entanglement entropy is recovered in both the massive and massless limits of the theory, as is expected. These results yield the renormalisation group flow of entanglement entropy, and we find that loop contributions suppress entanglement entropy. We highlight these results in the light of the renormalization group flow of couplings and correlators, which are increased in scalar quantum electrodynamics, so that the potential tension between the increase in correlations between two points of spacetime and the decrease in entanglement entropy between two regions of spacetime with energy is discussed. We indeed show that the vacuum of a subregion of spacetime purifies with energy in scalar quantum electrodynamics, which is related to the concept of screening.</description>
