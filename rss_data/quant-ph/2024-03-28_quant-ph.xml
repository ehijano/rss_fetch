      <title>Electromagnetic chirality-induced negative refraction with the same amplitude and anti-phase of the two chirality coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest a scheme of electromagnetic chirality-induced negative refraction utilizing magneto-electric cross coupling in a four-level atomic system. The negative refraction can be achieved with the two chirality coefficients having the same amplitude but the opposite phase,and without requiring the simultaneous presence of an electric-dipole and a magnetic-dipole transition near the same transition frequency. The simultaneously negative electric permittivity and magnetic permeability does not require, either.</description>

      <title>Left-handedness without absorption in the four-level Y-type atomic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper,three external fields interacting with the four-level Y-type atomic system described by the density-matrix approach is investigated .The results show that the left-handedness with zero absorption are achieved.And the zero absorption property displays the possibility of manipulation with varying the phase and the intensity of the coupling field. The zero absorption property may be used to amplify the evanescent waves that have been lost in the imaging by traditional lenses.Our scheme proposes an approach to obtain negative refractive medium with zero absorption and the possibility to enhance the imaging resolution in realizing "superlenses".</description>

      <title>Average R\'enyi Entanglement Entropy in Gaussian Boson Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, many experiments have been conducted with the goal of demonstrating a quantum advantage over classical computation. One popular framework for these experiments is Gaussian Boson Sampling, where quadratic photonic input states are interfered via a linear optical unitary and subsequently measured in the Fock basis. In this work, we study the modal entanglement of the output states in this framework just before the measurement stage. Specifically, we compute Page curves as measured by various R\'enyi-$\alpha$ entropies, where the Page curve describes the entanglement between two partitioned groups of output modes averaged over all linear optical unitaries. We derive these formulas for $\alpha = 1$ (i.e. the von Neumann entropy), and, more generally, for all positive integer $\alpha$, in the asymptotic limit of infinite number of modes and for input states that are composed of single-mode-squeezed-vacuum state with equal squeezing strength. We then analyze the limiting behaviors when the squeezing is small and large. Having determined the averages, we then explicitly calculate the R\'enyi-$\alpha$ variance for integers $\alpha &gt; 1$, and we are able to show that these entropies are weakly typical.</description>

      <title>Properties and Applications of the Kirkwood-Dirac Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most famous quasi-probability distribution, the Wigner function, has played a pivotal role in the development of a continuous-variable quantum theory that has clear analogues of position and momentum. However, the Wigner function is ill-suited for much modern quantum-information research, which is focused on finite-dimensional systems and general observables. Instead, recent years have seen the Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) distribution come to the forefront as a powerful quasi-probability distribution for analysing quantum mechanics. The KD distribution allows tools from statistics and probability theory to be applied to problems in quantum-information processing. A notable difference to the Wigner function is that the KD distribution can represent a quantum state in terms of arbitrary observables. This paper reviews the KD distribution, in three parts. First, we present definitions and basic properties of the KD distribution and its generalisations. Second, we summarise the KD distribution's extensive usage in the study or development of measurement disturbance; quantum metrology; weak values; direct measurements of quantum states; quantum thermodynamics; quantum scrambling and out-of-time-ordered correlators; and the foundations of quantum mechanics, including Leggett-Garg inequalities, the consistent-histories interpretation, and contextuality. We emphasise connections between operational quantum advantages and negative or non-real KD quasi-probabilities. Third, we delve into the KD distribution's mathematical structure. We summarise the current knowledge regarding the geometry of KD-positive states (the states for which the KD distribution is a classical probability distribution), describe how to witness and quantify KD non-positivity, and outline relationships between KD non-positivity and observables' incompatibility.</description>

      <title>Minimal entanglement for injecting diagonal gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Clifford gates are frequently exclusively implemented on fault-tolerant architectures by first distilling magic states in specialised magic-state factories. In the rest of the architecture, the computational space, magic states can then be consumed by a stabilizer circuit to implement non-Clifford operations. We show that the connectivity between the computational space and magic state factories forms a fundamental bottleneck on the rate at which non-Clifford operations can be implemented. We show that the nullity of the magic state, $\nu(|D\rangle)$ for diagonal gate $D$, characterizes the non-local resources required to implement $D$ in the computational space. As part of our proof, we construct local stabilizer circuits that use only $\nu(|D\rangle)$ ebits to implement $D$ in the computational space that may be useful to reduce the non-local resources required to inject non-Clifford gates. Another consequence is that the edge-disjoint path compilation algorithm [arXiv:2110.11493] produces minimum-depth circuits for implementing single-qubit diagonal gates.</description>

      <title>Toward Low-latency Iterative Decoding of QLDPC Codes Under Circuit-Level Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a sliding window decoder based on belief propagation (BP) with guided decimation for the purposes of decoding quantum low-density parity-check codes in the presence of circuit-level noise. Windowed decoding keeps the decoding complexity reasonable when, as is typically the case, repeated rounds of syndrome extraction are required to decode. Within each window, we employ several rounds of BP with decimation of the variable node that we expect to be the most likely to flip in each round, Furthermore, we employ ensemble decoding to keep both decimation options (guesses) open in a small number of chosen rounds. We term the resulting decoder BP with guided decimation guessing (GDG). Applied to bivariate bicycle codes, GDG achieves a similar logical error rate as BP with an additional OSD post-processing stage (BP+OSD) and combination-sweep of order 10. For a window size of three syndrome cycles, a multi-threaded CPU implementation of GDG achieves a worst-case decoding latency of 3ms per window for the [[144,12,12]] code.</description>

      <title>Interval Effect Algebras and Holevo Instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article begins with a study of convex effect-state spaces. We point out that such spaces are equivalent to interval effect algebras that generate an ordered linear space and possess an order-determining set of states. We then discuss operations and instruments on interval effect algebras under the assumption of an unrestrictive condition. Effects measured by operations and sequential products of effects relative to operations are considered. Observables are introduced and coexistence of effects are discussed. We also present properties of sequential products of observables and conditioning of observables related to instruments. The final section is devoted to Holevo instruments. Pure and mixed Holevo operations are defined and extended to instruments. The Holevo sequential product of two observables is defined and the marginals of these products are computed. We define the commutant of two effects and derive its properties. Examples are given that illustrate the properties of previously presented concepts.</description>

      <title>Optimal Coherent Quantum Phase Estimation via Tapering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum phase estimation is one of the fundamental primitives that underpins many quantum algorithms, including quantum amplitude estimation, the HHL algorithm for solving linear systems of equations, and quantum principal component analysis. Due to its significance as a subroutine, in this work, we study the coherent version of the phase estimation problem, where given an arbitrary input state and black-box access to unitaries $U$ and controlled-$U$, the goal is to estimate the phases of $U$ in superposition. Unlike most existing phase estimation algorithms, which employ intermediary measurements steps that inevitably destroy coherence, only a couple of algorithms, including the well-known standard quantum phase estimation algorithm, consider this coherent setting. In this work, we propose an improved version of this standard algorithm that utilizes tapering/window functions. Our algorithm, which we call tapered quantum phase estimation algorithm, achieves the optimal query complexity (total number of calls to $U$ and controlled-$U$) without requiring the use of a computationally expensive quantum sorting network for median computation, which the standard algorithm uses to boost the success probability arbitrarily close to one. We also show that the tapering functions that we use are optimal by formulating optimization problems with different optimization criteria. Beyond the asymptotic regime, we also provide non-asymptotic query complexity of our algorithm, as it is crucial for practical implementation. Finally, we also propose an efficient algorithm that prepares the quantum state corresponding to the optimal tapering function.</description>

      <title>Using Quantum Computing to Infer Dynamic Behaviors of Biological and Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of new problem classes for quantum computation is an active area of research. An essentially completely unexplored topic is the use of quantum algorithms and computing to explore and ask questions \textit{about} the functional dynamics of neural networks. This is a component of the still-nascent topic of applying quantum computing to the modeling and simulations of biological and artificial neural networks. In this work, we show how a carefully constructed set of conditions can use two foundational quantum algorithms, Grover and Deutsch-Josza, in such a way that the output measurements admit an interpretation that guarantees we can infer if a simple representation of a neural network (which applies to both biological and artificial networks) after some period of time has the potential to continue sustaining dynamic activity. Or whether the dynamics are guaranteed to stop either through 'epileptic' dynamics or quiescence.</description>

      <title>Parallel refreshed cryogenic charge-locking array with low power dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To build a large scale quantum circuit comprising millions of cryogenic qubits will require an efficient way to supply large numbers of classic control signals. Given the limited number of direct connections allowed from room temperature, multiple level of signal multiplexing becomes essential. The stacking of hardware to accomplish this task is highly dependent on the lowest level implementation of control electronics, of which an open question is the feasibility of mK integration. Such integration is preferred for signal transmission and wire interconnection, provided it is not limited by the large power dissipation involved. Novel cryogenic electronics that prioritises power efficiency has to be developed to meet the tight thermal budget. In this paper, we present a power efficient approach to implement charge-locking array.</description>

      <title>Quantum to Classical Neural Network Transfer Learning Applied to Drug Toxicity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toxicity is a roadblock that prevents an inordinate number of drugs from being used in potentially life-saving applications. Deep learning provides a promising solution to finding ideal drug candidates; however, the vastness of chemical space coupled with the underlying $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ matrix multiplication means these efforts quickly become computationally demanding. To remedy this, we present a hybrid quantum-classical neural network for predicting drug toxicity, utilizing a quantum circuit design that mimics classical neural behavior by explicitly calculating matrix products with complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$. Leveraging the Hadamard test for efficient inner product estimation rather than the conventionally used swap test, we reduce the number qubits by half and remove the need for quantum phase estimation. Directly computing matrix products quantum mechanically allows for learnable weights to be transferred from a quantum to a classical device for further training. We apply our framework to the Tox21 dataset and show that it achieves commensurate predictive accuracy to the model's fully classical $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ analog. Additionally, we demonstrate the model continues to learn, without disruption, once transferred to a fully classical architecture. We believe combining the quantum advantage of reduced complexity and the classical advantage of noise-free calculation will pave the way to more scalable machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Quantum Random Access Codes Implementation for Resource Allocation and Coexistence with Classical Telecommunication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a world where Quantum Networks are rapidly becoming a reality, the development of the Quantum Internet is gaining increasing interest. Nevertheless, modern quantum networks are still in the early stages of development and have limited capacity to distribute resources among different users -- a constraint that needs to be taken into account. In this work we aim to investigate these constraints, using a novel setup for implementing Quantum Random Access Codes (QRACs), communication protocols known for their quantum advantage over their classical counterparts and semi-device-independent self-testing applications. Our QRAC states, made for the first time using weak coherent pulses instead of entangled single photons, allow us to experimentally test our encoding and decoding strategy from the resource allocation perspective. Moreover, by emulating a coexistent classical communication, we test the resilience of our implementation in presence of noise. The achieved results represent a significant milestone both for theoretical studies of quantum resource allocation and for the implementation of quantum infrastructures capable of coexisting with regular telecommunication networks.</description>

      <title>Classical simulation of non-Gaussian bosonic circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose efficient classical algorithms which (strongly) simulate the action of bosonic linear optics circuits applied to superpositions of Gaussian states. Our approach relies on an augmented covariance matrix formalism to keep track of relative phases between individual terms in a linear combination. This yields an exact simulation algorithm whose runtime is polynomial in the number of modes and the size of the circuit, and quadratic in the number of terms in the superposition. We also present a faster approximate randomized algorithm whose runtime is linear in this number. Our main building blocks are a formula for the triple overlap of three Gaussian states and a fast algorithm for estimating the norm of a superposition of Gaussian states up to a multiplicative error. Our construction borrows from earlier work on simulating quantum circuits in finite-dimensional settings, including, in particular, fermionic linear optics with non-Gaussian initial states and Clifford computations with non-stabilizer initial states. It provides algorithmic access to a practically relevant family of non-Gaussian bosonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Quantum Convolutional Neural Network Architectures for Arbitrary Data Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) represent a promising approach in quantum machine learning, paving new directions for both quantum and classical data analysis. This approach is particularly attractive due to the absence of the barren plateau problem, a fundamental challenge in training quantum neural networks (QNNs), and its feasibility. However, a limitation arises when applying QCNNs to classical data. The network architecture is most natural when the number of input qubits is a power of two, as this number is reduced by a factor of two in each pooling layer. The number of input qubits determines the dimensions (i.e. the number of features) of the input data that can be processed, restricting the applicability of QCNN algorithms to real-world data. To address this issue, we propose a QCNN architecture capable of handling arbitrary input data dimensions while optimizing the allocation of quantum resources such as ancillary qubits and quantum gates. This optimization is not only important for minimizing computational resources, but also essential in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing, as the size of the quantum circuits that can be executed reliably is limited. Through numerical simulations, we benchmarked the classification performance of various QCNN architectures when handling arbitrary input data dimensions on the MNIST and Breast Cancer datasets. The results validate that the proposed QCNN architecture achieves excellent classification performance while utilizing a minimal resource overhead, providing an optimal solution when reliable quantum computation is constrained by noise and imperfections.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian observable-geometric phases and the Riemann zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hilbert-P\'{o}lya conjecture asserts that the imaginary parts of the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function (the Riemann zeros) are the eigenvalues of a self-adjoint operator (a quantum mechanical Hamiltonian, in the physical sense), as a promising approach to prove the Riemann hypothesis (cf.\cite{SH2011}). Instead of the eigenvalues, in this paper we consider observable-geometric phases as the realization of the Riemann zeros in a periodically driven quantum system, which were introduced in \cite{Chen2020} for the study of geometric quantum computation. To this end, we further introduce the notion of non-Abelian observable-geometric phases, involving which we give an approach to finding a physical system to study the Riemann zeros. Since the observable-geometric phases are connected with the geometry of the observable space according to the evolution of the Heisenberg equation, this sheds some light on the investigation of the Riemann hypothesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Making use of the Quantum Network formalism of \textit{Phys. Rev. A,} \textbf{82} (2010) 062305, we present the case for quantum networks with finite outcomes, more specifically one which could distinguish only between specific unitary operators in a given basis for operators. Despite its simplicity, we proceed to build a network derived from the optimal strategy in \textit{Phys. Rev. A,} \textbf{82} (2010) 062305 and show that the information-disturbance tradeoff in distinguishing between two operators acting on qubits, selected from mutually unbiased unitary bases is equal to the case of estimating an operator selected randomly from the set of SU($2$) based on the Haar measure. This suggests that such strategies in distinguishing between mutually unbiased operators is not any easier than estimating an operator derived from an infinite set. We then show how this network can be used as a natural attack strategy against a bidirectional quantum cryptographic protocol.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit design for mixture and preparation of arbitrary pure and mixed quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of preparing arbitrary mixed quantum states, an area that has not been extensively studied compared to pure states. Two circuit design methods are presented: one via a mixture of pure states and the other via purification. A novel strategy utilizing the Cholesky decomposition is proposed to improve both computational efficiency during preprocessing and circuit efficiency in the resulting circuits, offering significant advantages, especially when the targeted density matrix is low-ranked or sparse. By leveraging the incomplete Cholesky decomposition with threshold dropping, we also propose an appealing strategy for generating a high-fidelity approximation of the targeted density matrix, enabling substantial efficiency enhancement at the cost of mild fidelity loss. Additionally, as a closely related issue, we prove the "no-superposing theorem": given a certain number of arbitrary unknown pure states as input, it is impossible to devise an operation that produces an output state as the superposition of the input states with predefined coefficients unless all but one of the coefficients vanish.</description>

      <title>Superfluid Oscillator Circuit with Quantum Current Regulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the properties of atomic current in a superfluid oscillating circuit consisting of a mesoscopic channel that connects two reservoirs of a Bose-Einstein condensate. We investigate the presence of a critical current in the channel and examine how the amplitude of the oscillations in the number imbalance between the two reservoirs varies with system parameters. In addition to highlighting that the dissipative resistance stems from the formation of vortex pairs, we also illustrate the role of these vortex pairs as a quantum current regulator. The dissipation strength is discrete based on the number imbalance, which corresponds to the emergence of vortex pairs in the system. Our findings indicate that the circuit demonstrates characteristics of both voltage-limiting and current-limiting mechanisms. To model the damping behavior of the atomic superfluid circuit, we develop an equivalent LC oscillator circuit with a quantum current regulator.</description>

      <title>Dephasing Noise Simulation for Coherence-Generating Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancing quantum technologies necessitates an in-depth exploration of how operations generate quantum resources and respond to noise. Crucial are gates generating quantum coherence and the challenge of mitigating gate dephasing noise. Precisely, we study the dephasing noise that reduces the coherence-generating power of quantum gates, its simulation, and critical factors. Our primary contribution lies in a theorem characterizing the full set of dephasing noises in gates, adaptable to the simulation by any predefined operation set. In particular, we apply our result to quantify the memory adaptability required for a dephasing noise to arise. Furthermore, we analytically calculate the quantifier for gates acting on qubit systems, thereby fully characterizing this scenario. Next, we show how our results reveal the structure of non-trivial dephasing noise affecting qubit gates and apply them to experimental data, conclusively demonstrating the existence of a gate's dephasing noise, which is irreducible to dephasing of either input or output states. Finally, we show how our study contributes to addressing an open question in the resource theory of coherence generation.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary State Transition of Open Qubit System Based on Switching Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a switching control strategy based on Lyapunov control for arbitrary state transitions in open qubit systems. With coherent vector representation, we propose a switching control strategy, which can prevent the state of the qubit from entering invariant sets and singular value sets, effectively driving the system ultimately to a sufficiently small neighborhood of target states. In comparison to existing works, this control strategy relaxes the strict constraints on system models imposed by special target states. Furthermore, we identify conditions under which the open qubit system achieves finite-time stability (FTS) and finite-time contractive stability (FTCS), respectively. This represents a critical improvement in quantum state transitions, especially considering the asymptotic stability of arbitrary target states is unattainable in open quantum systems. The effectiveness of our proposed method is convincingly demonstrated through its application in a qubit system affected by various types of decoherence, including amplitude, dephasing and polarization decoherence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum coherence has been shown to impact the operational capabilities of quantum systems performing thermodynamic tasks in a significant way, and yet the possibility of genuine coherence-enhanced thermodynamic operation remains unclear. Here we show that only the presence of energetic coherence -- coherence between levels with different energies -- in steady-state quantum thermal machines can lead to genuine thermodynamic advantage. On the other hand, engines showing coherence between degenerate levels, or subjected to noise-induced coherence, are shown to be systematically outperformed by classical stochastic engines using exactly the same set of (incoherent) resources. We illustrate our results with three prototypical models of heat engines and refrigerators and employ multi-objective optimization techniques to characterize quantum-enhanced regimes in connection with the thermodynamic uncertainty relation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distinguishing causation from correlation is crucial and requires careful consideration. In this study, we utilize a recent quantum extension of Liang information to investigate causation in quantum chains across their phase diagram. Our analysis encompasses two distinct scenarios: (i) the Aubry-Andr$\'e$-Harper model, characterized by a spectrum-wide phase transition, and (ii) the Anisotropic Transverse Field Ising (ANNNI) model, which demonstrates a ground state transition. We discern a notable shift in causation behavior across the critical point with each case exhibiting distinct hallmarks, different from correlation measures. Especially, in the latter case, we observe maximum causation in the ordered phase just preceding the critical point.</description>

Abstract: Collision models describe the sequential interactions of a system with independent ancillas. Motivated by recent advances in neutral atom arrays, in this Letter we investigate a model where the ancillas are governed by a classical controller that allows them to queue up while they wait for their turn to interact with the system. The ancillas can undergo individual open dynamics while they wait, which may cause them to decohere. The system, which plays the role of the server in the queue, can also undergo its own open dynamics whenever it is idle. We first show that this framework generalizes existing approaches for quantum collision models, recovering the deterministic and stochastic formulations in the appropriate limits. Next, we show how the classical queueing dynamics introduces non-trivial effects in the quantum collisions, that can lead to different phases in the system-ancilla response. We illustrate the idea with a model of coherence transfer under noisy waiting dynamics.</description>

      <title>Parallel and real-time post-processing for quantum random number generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum systems are particularly suited for generating true randomness due to their inherent unpredictability, which can be justified on physical principles. However, practical implementations of Quantum RNGs (QRNGs) are always subject to noise, or uncontrollable influences, diminishing the quality of raw randomness produced. This necessitates post-processing to convert raw output into genuine randomness. In current QRNG implementations, the critical issue of seed updating is often overlooked, risking security vulnerabilities due to increased security parameters when seeds are reused in post-processing, and frequent seed updates fail to yield net randomness, while reusing seeds relies on the assumption that the original sequence inputs are independent.In this work, we have provided a specific scheme for seed updates that balances practicality and security, exploring the parallel and real-time implementation of multiple seed real-time updating toeplitz hash extractors in an FPGA to achieve parallel QRNGs, focusing on efficient hardware computation resource use. Through logic optimization, we achieved a greater number of parallel channels and a post-processing matrix size three times larger than previous works on the same FPGA platform, utilizing fewer logic resources. This resulted in a higher rate of random number generation and enhanced security. Furthermore, with the use of higher-performance ADCs, we attained a random number production rate exceeding 20Gbps.High-speed random number transfer and seed updating were achieved using the PCIe high-speed interface.This marks a significant step toward chip-based parallel QRNGs, enhancing the practicality of CV QRNGs in trusted, device-independent, and semi-device-independent scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a quantum algorithm for the solution of prototypical second-order linear elliptic partial differential equations discretized by $d$-linear finite elements on Cartesian grids of a bounded $d$-dimensional domain. An essential step in the construction is a BPX preconditioner, which transforms the linear system into a sufficiently well-conditioned one, making it amenable to quantum computation. We provide a constructive proof demonstrating that our quantum algorithm can compute suitable functionals of the solution to a given tolerance $\texttt{tol}$ with a complexity linear in $\texttt{tol}^{-1}$ for a fixed dimension $d$, neglecting logarithmic terms. This complexity is proportional to that of its one-dimensional counterpart and improves previous quantum algorithms by a factor of order $\texttt{tol}^{-2}$. We also detail the design and implementation of a quantum circuit capable of executing our algorithm, and present simulator results that support the quantum feasibility of the finite element method in the near future, paving the way for quantum computing approaches to a wide range of PDE-related challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron spins in silicon quantum dot platform provide great potential for quantum information processing due to excellent physical properties and modern fabrication technologies. Spin-based quantum bit (qubit) operations are intensively studied to realize universal logic gates with a high fidelity, fast gating operations, and basic programmability. Although recent experimental achievements can be considered as remarkable results for utilizing quantum computation, more advanced quantum information protocols should be demonstrated with a large number of qubit system to enable programmability of silicon devices. Here, we computationally explore entanglement-based quantum information protocols in electrically defined five silicon quantum dot system. To this end, device simulations are employed to demonstrate $1$-qubit gate and $2$-qubit gate operations. Additionally, we discuss the implementations of three applications: the generation of magic states, entanglement swapping, and quantum teleportation in our silicon device. All the results will secure the scalability of quantum information processing with electron spin qubits in silicon quantum dot system.</description>

      <title>Magic-induced computational separation in entanglement theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement serves as a foundational pillar in quantum information theory, delineating the boundary between what is classical and what is quantum. The common assumption is that higher entanglement corresponds to a greater degree of 'quantumness'. However, this folk belief is challenged by the fact that classically simulable operations, such as Clifford circuits, can create highly entangled states. The simulability of these states raises a question: what are the differences between 'low-magic' entanglement, and 'high-magic' entanglement? We answer this question in this work with a rigorous investigation into the role of magic in entanglement theory. We take an operational approach to understanding this relationship by studying tasks such as entanglement estimation, distillation and dilution. This approach reveals that magic has surprisingly strong implications for entanglement. Specifically, we find a sharp operational separation that splits Hilbert space into two distinct phases: the entanglement-dominated (ED) phase and magic-dominated (MD) phase. Roughly speaking, ED states have entanglement that significantly surpasses their magic, while MD states have magic that dominates their entanglement. The competition between the two resources in these two phases induces a computational phase separation between them: there are sample- and time-efficient quantum algorithms for almost any entanglement task on ED states, while these tasks are provably computationally intractable in the MD phase. To demonstrate the power of our results beyond entanglement theory, we highlight the relevance of our findings in many-body physics and topological error correction. Additionally, we offer simple theoretical explanations for phenomenological observations made in previous numerical studies using ED-MD phases.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores methods to enhance the reproducibility of Josephson junctions, crucial elements in superconducting quantum technologies, when employing the Dolan technique in 30 kV e-beam processes. The study explores the influence of dose distribution along the bridge area on reproducibility, addressing challenges related to fabrication sensitivity. Experimental methods include E-beam lithography, with electron trajectory simulations shedding light on backscattered electron behavior. We demonstrate the fabrication of different junction geometries, revealing that some geometries significantly improve reproducibility by resulting in a more homogeneous dose distribution over the junction area.</description>

Therefore any element from each of these sets can always be approximated by diagonalizable elements of the same set to arbitrary precision.</description>

      <title>Are Colors Quanta of Light for Human Vision? A Quantum Cognition Study of Visual Perception</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phenomenon of categorical perception within the quantum measurement process. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon consists in dilating stimuli being perceived to belong to different categories and contracting stimuli being perceived to belong to the same category. We show that, due to the naturally different way in determining the distance between pure states compared to the distance between density states, the phenomenon of categorical perception is rooted in the structure of the quantum measurement process itself. We apply our findings to the situation of visual perception of colors and argue that it is possible to consider colors as light quanta for human visual perception in a similar way as photons are light quanta for physical measurements of light frequencies. In our approach we see perception as a complex encounter between the existing physical reality, the stimuli, and the reality expected by the perciever, resulting in the experience of the percepts. We investigate what that means for the situation of two colors, which we call Light and Dark, given our findings on categorical perception within the quantum measurement process.</description>

      <title>(2+1)D topological phases with RT symmetry: many-body invariant, classification, and higher order edge modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is common in condensed matter systems for reflection ($R$) and time-reversal ($T$) symmetry to both be broken while the combination $RT$ is preserved. In this paper we study invariants that arise due to $RT$ symmetry. We consider many-body systems of interacting fermions with fermionic symmetry groups $G_f = \mathbb{Z}_2^f \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{RT}$, $U(1)^f \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2^{RT}$, and $U(1)^f \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{RT}$. We show that (2+1)D invertible fermionic topological phases with these symmetries have a $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_8$, $\mathbb{Z}^2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$, and $\mathbb{Z}^2 \times \mathbb{Z}_4$ classification, respectively, which we compute using the framework of $G$-crossed braided tensor categories. We provide a many-body $RT$ invariant in terms of a tripartite entanglement measure, and which we show can be understood using an edge conformal field theory computation in terms of vertex states. For $G_f = U(1)^f \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2^{RT}$, which applies to charged fermions in a magnetic field, the non-trivial value of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant requires strong interactions. For symmetry-preserving boundaries, the phases are distinguished by zero modes at the intersection of the reflection axis and the boundary. Additional invariants arise in the presence of translation or rotation symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum system that interacts with an environment generally undergoes non-unitary evolution described by a non-Markovian or Markovian master equation. In this paper, we construct the non-Markovian Redfield master equation for a quantum scalar field that interacts with a second field through a bilinear or nonlinear interaction on a Minkowski background. We use the resulting master equation to set up coupled differential equations that can be solved to obtain the equal-time two-point function of the system field. We show how the equations simplify under various approximations including the Markovian limit, and argue that the Redfield equation-based solution provides a perturbative resummation to the standard second order Dyson series result. For the bilinear interaction, we explicitly show that the Redfield solution is closer to the exact solution compared to the perturbation theory-based one. Further, the environment correlation function is oscillatory and non-decaying in this case, making the Markovian master equation a poor approximation. For the nonlinear interaction, on the other hand, the environment correlation function is sharply peaked and the Redfield solution matches that obtained using a Markovian master equation in the late-time limit.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy via Quantum Annealing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple object tracking (MOT), a key task in image recognition, presents a persistent challenge in balancing processing speed and tracking accuracy. This study introduces a novel approach that leverages quantum annealing (QA) to expedite computation speed, while enhancing tracking accuracy through the ensembling of object tracking processes. A method to improve the matching integration process is also proposed. By utilizing the sequential nature of MOT, this study further augments the tracking method via reverse annealing (RA). Experimental validation confirms the maintenance of high accuracy with an annealing time of a mere 3 $\mu$s per tracking process. The proposed method holds significant potential for real-time MOT applications, including traffic flow measurement for urban traffic light control, collision prediction for autonomous robots and vehicles, and management of products mass-produced in factories.</description>

      <title>Analyticity and the Unruh effect: a study of local modular flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Unruh effect can be formulated as the statement that the Minkowski vacuum in a Rindler wedge has a boost as its modular flow. In recent years, other examples of states with geometrically local modular flow have played important roles in understanding energy and entropy in quantum field theory and quantum gravity. Here I initiate a general study of the settings in which geometric modular flow can arise, showing (i) that any geometric modular flow must be a conformal symmetry of the background spacetime, and (ii) that in a well behaved class of "weakly analytic" states, geometric modular flow must be future-directed. I further argue that if a geometric transformation is conformal but not isometric, then it can only be realized as modular flow in a conformal field theory. Finally, I discuss a few settings in which converse results can be shown -- i.e., settings in which a state can be constructed whose modular flow reproduces a given vector field.</description>

      <title>Chirality-Induced Magnet-Free Spin Generation in a Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrical generation and transduction of polarized electron spins in semiconductors are of central interest in spintronics and quantum information science. While spin generation in semiconductors has been frequently realized via electrical injection from a ferromagnet, there are significant advantages in nonmagnetic pathways of creating spin polarization. One such pathway exploits the interplay of electron spin with chirality in electronic structures or real space. Here, utilizing chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), we demonstrate efficient creation of spin accumulation in n-doped GaAs via electric current injection from a normal metal (Au) electrode through a self-assembled monolayer of chiral molecules ({\alpha}-helix L-polyalanine, AHPA-L). The resulting spin polarization is detected as a Hanle effect in the n-GaAs, which is found to obey a distinct universal scaling with temperature and bias current consistent with chirality-induced spin accumulation. The experiment constitutes a definitive observation of CISS in a fully nonmagnetic device structure and demonstration of its ability to generate spin accumulation in a conventional semiconductor. The results thus place key constraints on the physical mechanism of CISS and present a new scheme for magnet-free semiconductor spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The polynomials introduced by Sister Celine cover different usual orthogonal polynomials as special cases. Among them, the Jacobi and discrete Hahn polynomials are of particular interest for the quantum theory of angular momentum. In this note, we show that characters of irreducible representations of the rotation group as well as Wigner rotation "d" matrices, can be expressed as Sister Celine's polynomials. Since many relations were proposed for the latter polynomials, such connections could lead to new identities for quantities important in quantum mechanics and atomic physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the electron interaction within tilted anisotropic Dirac materials when subjected to external electric and magnetic fields possessing translational symmetry. Specifically, we focus on a distinct non-zero electric field magnitude, enabling the separation of the differential equation system inherent in the eigenvalue problem. Subsequently, employing supersymmetric quantum mechanics facilitates the determination of eigenstates and eigenvalues corresponding to the Hamiltonian operator. To delve into a semi-classical analysis of the system, we identify a set of coherent states. Finally, we assess the characteristics of these states using fidelity and the phase-space representation through the Wigner function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite depth quantum circuits provide an equivalence relation between gapped phases. Moreover, there can be nontrivial domain walls either within the same gapped phase or between different gapped phases, whose equivalence relations are given by finite depth quantum circuits in one lower dimension. In this paper, we use such unitary equivalence relations to study the fusion of one-dimensional gapped phases. In particular, we use finite depth circuits to fuse two gapped phases, local unitaries to fuse two domain walls, and a combination of both to fuse gapped phases with domain walls. This provides a concrete illustration of some simple aspects of the `higher-category' structure of gapped defects in a higher-dimensional trivial gapped bulk state.</description>

      <title>Influence of disorder at Insulator-Metal interface on spin transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by experimental work showing enhancement of spin transport between Yttrium Iron Garnet and Platinum by a thin antiferromagnetic insulator between them, we consider spin transport through the interface of a non-magnetic metal and compensated antiferromagnetically ordered insulator and focus on the significance of the interface itself. The spin transport is carried by spin-polarized electrons in the metal and by magnons in the insulator. We compute the spin current in the presence of a spin accumulation in the metal, cause by the spin Hall effect, and a thermal gradient using Fermi's Golden Rule in the presence of interfacial disorder. For a perfectly clean interface, the in-plane momentum is conserved by the electron-magnon scattering events that govern the spin transport through the interface. We calculate how disorder-induced broadening of scattering matrix elements with respect to the in-plane momentum influences the spin current. As a general result, we observe that for many experimental setups, specifically for high temperatures, one should expect a rather small effect of interface disorder on the measured spin current, while for small temperatures there is a significant reduction of a spin current with increasing disorder.</description>

      <title>Quantum asymptotic amplitude for quantum oscillatory systems from the Koopman operator viewpoint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have recently proposed a fully quantum-mechanical definition of the asymptotic phase for quantum nonlinear oscillators, which is also applicable in the strong quantum regime [Kato and Nakao 2022 Chaos 32 063133]. In this study, we propose a definition of the quantum asymptotic amplitude for quantum oscillatory systems, which extends naturally the definition of the asymptotic amplitude for classical nonlinear oscillators on the basis of the Koopman operator theory. We introduce the asymptotic amplitude for quantum oscillatory systems by using the eigenoperator of the backward Liouville operator associated with the largest non-zero real eigenvalue. Using examples of the quantum van der Pol oscillator with the quantum Kerr effect, exhibiting quantum limit-cycle oscillations, and the quantum van der Pol model with the quantum squeezing and degenerate parametric oscillator with nonlinear damping, exhibiting quantum noise-induced oscillations, we illustrate that the proposed quantum asymptotic amplitude appropriately yields isostable amplitude values that decay exponentially with a constant rate.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of non-Hermitian skin effect and extended states in one-dimensional nonreciprocal lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the one-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices with staggered onsite modulations and nonreciprocal hopping up to the next-nearest-neighboring (NNN) sites. Due to the NNN nonreciprocity, the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in the system under open boundary conditions (OBC) can be energy-dependent, and there will be NHSE edges in the eigenenergy spectrum, which separates the eigenstates localized at the opposite ends of the lattice. We find that the interplay between the nonreciprocal hopping and onsite modulations can reverse the direction of the skin effect and modify the position of the NHSE edge. Moreover, by tuning the system parameters, some of the eigenstates under OBC will become fully extended with the corresponding eigenenergies being imaginary under both open and periodic boundary conditions. Thus, the extended states can coexist with the NHSH in the same system. The NHSE can even be completely dissolved with all the eigenstates being extended when the modulation is imaginary. Our work unveils the intricate interplay between onsite modulations and nonreciprocal hopping in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Formalism: Concrete Realization of Joint Measurement for Heisenberg's Uncertainty Relation for Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out that the Gaussian wave-packet formalism can serve as a concrete realization of the joint measurement of position and momentum, which is an essential element in understanding Heisenberg's original philosophy of the uncertainty principle, in line with the universal framework of error, disturbance, and their uncertainty relations developed by Lee and Tsutsui. We show that our joint measurement in the Gaussian phase space, being a Positive Operator-Valued Measure (POVM) measurement, smoothly interpolates between the projective measurements of position and momentum. We, for the first time, have obtained the Lee-Tsutsui (LT) error and the refined Lee error for the position-momentum measurement. We find that the LT uncertainty relation becomes trivial, $0=0$, in the limiting case of projective measurement of either position or momentum. Remarkably, in contrast to the LT relation, the refined Lee uncertainty relation, which assesses errors for local representability, provides a constant lower bound unaffected by these limits and is invariably saturated, for a pure Gaussian initial state. The obtained lower bound is in agreement with Heisenberg's value.</description>

Abstract: Accurate modeling of the temporal evolution of asset prices is crucial for understanding financial markets. We explore the potential of discrete-time quantum walks to model the evolution of asset prices. Return distributions obtained from a model based on the quantum walk algorithm are compared with those obtained from classical methodologies. We focus on specific limitations of the classical models, and illustrate that the quantum walk model possesses great flexibility in overcoming these. This includes the potential to generate asymmetric return distributions with complex market tendencies and higher probabilities for extreme events than in some of the classical models. Furthermore, the temporal evolution in the quantum walk possesses the potential to provide asset price dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High harmonic generation traditionally combines ~100 near-infrared laser photons, to generate bright, phase matched, extreme ultraviolet beams when the emission from many atoms adds constructively. Here we show that by guiding a mid-infrared femtosecond laser in a high pressure gas, ultrahigh harmonics can be generated up to orders &gt; 5000, that emerge as a bright supercontinuum that spans the entire electromagnetic spectrum from the ultraviolet to &gt; 1.6 keV, allowing in-principle the generation of pulses as short as 2.5 attoseconds. The multi-atmosphere gas pressures required for bright, phase matched emission also supports laser beam self-confinement, further enhancing the x-ray yield. Finally, the x-ray beam exhibits high spatial coherence, even though at high gas density, the recolliding electrons responsible for high harmonic generation encounter other atoms during the emission process.</description>

Abstract: Phase-matched harmonic conversion of visible laser light into soft x-rays was demonstrated. The recently developed technique of guided-wave frequency conversion was used to upshift light from 800 nanometers to the range from 17 to 32 nanometers. This process increased the coherent x-ray output by factors of 10^2 to 10^3 compared to the non-phase-matched case. This source uses a small-scale (sub-millijoule) high repetition-rate laser and will enable a wide variety of new experimental investigations in linear and nonlinear x-ray science.</description>

Abstract: Due to low numbers of qubits and their error-proneness, Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers impose constraints on the size of quantum algorithms they can successfully execute. State-of-the-art research introduces various techniques addressing these limitations by utilizing known or inexpensively generated approximations, solutions, or models as a starting point to approach a task instead of starting from scratch. These so-called warm-starting techniques aim to reduce quantum resource consumption, thus facilitating the design of algorithms suiting the capabilities of NISQ computers. In this work, we collect and analyze scientific literature on warm-starting techniques in the quantum computing domain. In particular, we (i) create a systematic map of state-of-the-art research on warm-starting techniques using established guidelines for systematic mapping studies, (ii) identify relevant properties of such techniques, and (iii) based on these properties classify the techniques identified in the literature in an extensible classification scheme. Our results provide insights into the research field and aim to help quantum software engineers to categorize warm-starting techniques and apply them in practice. Moreover, our contributions may serve as a starting point for further research on the warm-starting topic since they provide an overview of existing work and facilitate the identification of research gaps.</description>

Abstract: We consider the quantum version of inferring the causal relation between events. There has been recent progress towards identifying minimal interventions and observations needed. We here give an explicit quantum causal inference scheme using quantum observations alone for the case of a bipartite quantum system with measurements at two times. In this scenario there may be combinations of temporal and spatial correlations. We derive a closed-form expression for the space-time pseudo-density matrix associated with many times and qubits. This matrix can be determined by coarse-grained quantum observations alone and the protocol is in that sense extremely light touch. We prove that if there is no signalling between two subsystems, the associated reduced state of the pseudo-density matrix cannot have negativity, regardless of the possible presence of initial spatial correlations. We further exploit the time asymmetry of the pseudo-density matrix to determine the temporal order of events. The negativity and time asymmetry are used to determine compatibility with 5 causal structures distinguished by the direction of causal influence and whether there are initial correlations or not. The protocol succeeds for a state with coherence undergoing a fully decohering channel, showing that coherence in the channel is not necessary for the quantum advantage of causal inference from observations alone.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Error-Correcting Codes (QECCs) play a crucial role in enhancing the robustness of quantum computing and communication systems against errors. Within the realm of QECCs, stabilizer codes, and specifically graph codes, stand out for their distinct attributes and promising utility in quantum technologies. This study underscores the significance of devising expansive QECCs and adopts the ZX-calculus a graphical language adept at quantum computational reasoning-to depict the encoders of graph codes effectively. Through the integration of ZX-calculus with established encoder frameworks, we present a nuanced approach that leverages this graphical representation to facilitate the construction of large-scale QECCs. Our methodology is rigorously applied to examine the intricacies of concatenated graph codes and the development of holographic codes, thus demonstrating the practicality of our graphical approach in addressing complex quantum error correction challenges. This research contributes to the theoretical understanding of quantum error correction and offers practical tools for its application, providing objective advancements in the field of quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: Image classification, a pivotal task in multiple industries, faces computational challenges due to the burgeoning volume of visual data. This research addresses these challenges by introducing two quantum machine learning models that leverage the principles of quantum mechanics for effective computations. Our first model, a hybrid quantum neural network with parallel quantum circuits, enables the execution of computations even in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, where circuits with a large number of qubits are currently infeasible. This model demonstrated a record-breaking classification accuracy of 99.21% on the full MNIST dataset, surpassing the performance of known quantum-classical models, while having eight times fewer parameters than its classical counterpart. Also, the results of testing this hybrid model on a Medical MNIST (classification accuracy over 99%), and on CIFAR-10 (classification accuracy over 82%), can serve as evidence of the generalizability of the model and highlights the efficiency of quantum layers in distinguishing common features of input data. Our second model introduces a hybrid quantum neural network with a Quanvolutional layer, reducing image resolution via a convolution process. The model matches the performance of its classical counterpart, having four times fewer trainable parameters, and outperforms a classical model with equal weight parameters. These models represent advancements in quantum machine learning research and illuminate the path towards more accurate image classification systems.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of finding the energy minimum of a complex quantum Hamiltonian by employing a non-Markovian bath prepared in a low energy state. The energy minimization problem is thus turned into a thermodynamic cooling protocol in which we repeatedly put the system of interest in contact with a colder auxiliary system. By tuning the internal parameters of the bath, we show that the optimal cooling is obtained in a regime where the bath exhibits a quantum phase transition in the thermodynamic limit. This result highlights the importance of collective effects in thermodynamic devices. We furthermore introduce a two-step protocol that combines the interaction with the bath with a measure of its energy. While this protocol does not destroy coherence in the system of interest, we show that it can further enhance the cooling effect.</description>

Abstract: Closed-loop control algorithms for real-time calibration of quantum processors require efficient filters that can estimate physical error parameters based on streams of measured quantum circuit outcomes. Development of such filters is complicated by the highly nonlinear relationship relationship between observed circuit outcomes and the magnitudes of elementary errors. In this work, we apply the extended Kalman filter to data from quantum gate set tomography to provide a streaming estimator of the both the system error model and its uncertainties. Our numerical examples indicate extended Kalman filtering can achieve similar performance to maximum likelihood estimation, but with dramatically lower computational cost. With our method, a standard laptop can process one- and two-qubit circuit outcomes and update gate set error model at rates comparable with current experimental execution.</description>

      <title>A pragma based C++ framework for hybrid quantum/classical computation</title>

Abstract: Quantum computers promise exponential speed ups over classical computers for various tasks. This emerging technology is expected to have its first huge impact in High Performance Computing (HPC), as it can solve problems beyond the reach of HPC. To that end, HPC will require quantum accelerators, which will enable applications to run on both classical and quantum devices, via hybrid quantum-classical nodes. Hybrid quantum-HPC applications should be scalable, executable on Quantum Error Corrected (QEC) devices, and could use quantum-classical primitives. However, the lack of scalability, poor performances, and inability to insert classical schemes within quantum applications has prevented current quantum frameworks from being adopted by the HPC community.
  This paper specifies the requirements of a hybrid quantum-classical framework compatible with HPC environments, and introduces a novel hardware-agnostic framework called Q-Pragma. This framework extends the classical programming language C++ heavily used in HPC via the addition of pragma directives to manage quantum computations.</description>

Abstract: Enhancing the performance of noisy quantum processors requires improving our understanding of error mechanisms and the ways to overcome them. In this study, we identify optimal ranges for qubit design parameters, grounded in comprehensive noise modeling. To this end, we also analyze a previously unexplored error mechanism that can perturb two-qubit gates due to charge-parity switches caused by quasiparticles. Due to the utilization of the higher levels of a transmon, where the charge dispersion is significantly larger, a charge-parity switch will affect the conditional phase of the two-qubit gate. We derive an analytical expression for the infidelity of a diabatic controlled-Z gate and see effects of similar magnitude in adiabatic controlled phase gates in the tunable coupler architecture. Moreover, we show that the effect of a charge-parity switch can be the dominant quasiparticle-related error source of a two-qubit gate. We also demonstrate that charge-parity switches induce a residual longitudinal interaction between qubits in a tunable-coupler circuit. We present a performance metric for quantum circuit execution, encompassing the fidelity and number of single and two-qubit gates in an algorithm, as well as the state preparation fidelity. This comprehensive metric, coupled with a detailed noise model, empowers us to determine an optimal range for the qubit design parameters Substantiating our findings through exact numerical simulations, we establish that fabricating quantum chips within this optimal parameter range not only augments the performance metric but also ensures its continued improvement with the enhancement of individual qubit coherence properties. Our systematic analysis offers insights and serves as a guiding framework for the development of the next generation of transmon-based quantum processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical quantifiers are generically required to contract under physical evolutions, following the intuition that information should be lost under noisy transformations. This principle is very relevant in statistics, and it even allows to derive uniqueness results based on it: by imposing their contractivity under any physical maps, the Chentsov-Petz theorem singles out a unique family of metrics on the space of probability distributions (or density matrices) called the Fisher information metrics. This result might suggest that statistical quantifiers are a derived concept, as their very definition is based on physical maps. The aim of this work is to disprove this belief. Indeed, we present a result dual to the Chentsov-Petz theorem, proving that among all possible linear maps, the only ones that contract the Fisher information are exactly the physical ones. This result shows that, contrary to the common opinion, there is no fundamental hierarchy between physical maps and canonical statistical quantifiers, as either of them can be defined in terms of the other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16785v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a superconducting circuit device that provides active, on-demand, tunable dissipation on a target mode of the electromagnetic field. Our device is based on a tunable "dissipator" that can be made lossy when tuned into resonance with a broadband filter mode. When driven parametrically, this dissipator induces loss on any mode coupled to it with energy detuning equal to the drive frequency. We demonstrate the use of this device to reset a superconducting qubit's readout cavity after a measurement, removing photons with a characteristic rate above $50\ \mu\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. We also demonstrate that the dissipation can be driven constantly to simultaneously damp and cool the cavity, effectively eliminating thermal photon fluctuations as a relevant decoherence channel. Our results demonstrate the utility of our device as a modular tool for environmental engineering and entropy removal in circuit QED.</description>

Abstract: Repeated measurements can induce entanglement phase transitions in the dynamics of quantum systems. Interacting models, both chaotic and integrable, generically show a stable volume-law entangled phase at low measurement rates which disappears for free, Gaussian fermions. Interactions break the Gaussianity of a dynamical map in its unitary part, but non-Gaussianity can be introduced through measurements as well. By comparing the entanglement and non-Gaussianity structure of different protocols, we propose a new single-particle indicator of the measurement-induced phase transition and we use it to argue in favour of the stability of the transition when non-Gaussianity is purely provided by measurements</description>

      <title>Exotic Symmetry Breaking Properties of Self-Dual Fracton Spin Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fracton codes host unconventional topological states of matter and are promising for fault-tolerant quantum computation due to their large coding space and strong resilience against decoherence and noise. In this work, we investigate the ground-state properties and phase transitions of two prototypical self-dual fracton spin models -- the tetrahedral Ising model and the fractal Ising model -- which correspond to error-correction procedures for the representative fracton codes of type-I and type-II, the checkerboard code and the Haah's code, respectively, in the error-free limit. They are endowed with exotic symmetry-breaking properties that contrast sharply with the spontaneous breaking of global symmetries and deconfinement transition of gauge theories. To show these unconventional behaviors, which are associated with sub-dimensional symmetries, we construct and analyze the order parameters, correlators, and symmetry generators for both models. Notably, the tetrahedral Ising model acquires an extended semi-local ordering moment, while the fractal Ising model fits into a polynomial ring representation and leads to a fractal order parameter. Numerical studies combined with analytical tools show that both models experience a strong first-order phase transition with an anomalous $L^{-(D-1)}$ scaling, despite the fractal symmetry of the latter. Our work provides new understanding of sub-dimensional symmetry breaking and makes an important step for studying quantum-error-correction properties of the checkerboard and Haah's codes.</description>

Abstract: Wave-particle duality is one of the most intriguing counterfactual concepts in quantum theory. In our common sense, the wave and particle properties of a quantum object are inseparable. However, the recent studies based on Quantum Cheshire Cat phenomena showed that separating the physical properties of a quantum object including wave and particle attributes from itself are possible in microscopic system described by two-state vector formalism. In this study, we put forward a feasible scheme to spatially separate the wave and particle attributes of two entangled photons by properly choosing the pre- and post-selection of path states. Our scheme also guarantees that the observation of wave and particle properties of the two entangled photons always obey the Bohr's complementarity principle.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the twisted state of an atom and the possible effect of such a state on the properties of the photons emitted as a result of an electron transition in that atom. We first propose a framework for describing the twisted atomic state, and then explore possible differences in the nuclear recoil effects in the twisted atom compared to those in the plane-wave atom. We conclude that if the initial atomic state is twisted, then the photon distribution is altered. We point out that in a certain observation scheme, one can detect a feature of this twist in the distribution of the emitted photons, even in zero order in $m/M$.</description>

Abstract: Simulating chemical systems is highly sought after and computationally challenging, as the simulation cost exponentially increases with the system size. Quantum computers have been proposed as a computational means to overcome this bottleneck. Most efforts recently have been spent on determining the ground states of chemical systems. Hardness results and the lack of efficient heuristics for initial-state generation sheds doubt on the feasibility. Here we propose an inherently efficient approach for solving chemical simulation problems, meaning it requires quantum circuits of size scaling polynomially in relevant system parameters. If a set of assumptions can be satisfied, our approach finds good initial states by assembling initial states for dynamical simulation in a scattering tree. We discuss a variety of quantities of chemical interest that can be measured based on quantum simulation, e.g. of a reaction, succeeding the initial state preparation.</description>

Abstract: We provide a comprehensive analytical description of the effective coupling associated with an antiresonance within a hybrid system comprised of a quasi-closed photonic cavity and a ferrimagnetic material. Whilst so-called level attraction between a resonant system inside an open cavity is well understood, the physical underpinnings of this phenomena within quasi-closed cavities have remained elusive. Leveraging the input-output theory, we successfully differentiate between the repulsive and attractive aspects of this coupling. Our proposed model demonstrates that by understanding the phase-jump at the resonances and the studied antiresonance, we can predict the nature of the effective coupling of the antiresonance for a given position of the ferrimagnet in the cavity.</description>

      <title>Saturability of the Quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao Bound in Multiparameter Quantum Estimation at the Single-Copy Level</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (QCRB) as the ultimate lower bound for precision in quantum parameter estimation is only known to be saturable in the multiparameter setting in special cases and under conditions such as full or average commutavity of the symmetric logarithmic derivatives (SLDs) associated with the parameters. Moreover, for general mixed states, collective measurements over infinitely many identical copies of the quantum state are generally required to attain the QCRB. In the important and experimentally relevant single-copy scenario, a necessary condition for saturating the QCRB in the multiparameter setting for general mixed states is the so-called partial commutativity condition on the SLDs. However, it is not known if this condition is also sufficient. This paper establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for saturability of the multiparameter QCRB in the single-copy setting in terms of the commutativity of a set of projected SLDs and the existence of a unitary solution to a system of nonlinear partial differential equations. New necessary conditions that imply partial commutativity are also obtained, which together with another condition become sufficient. Moreover, when the sufficient conditions are satisfied an optimal measurement saturating the QCRB can be chosen to be projective and explicitly characterized. An example is developed to illustrate the case of a multiparameter quantum state where the conditions derived herein are satisfied and can be explicitly verified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10564v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bell nonlocality is a fundamental phenomenon of quantum physics as well as an essential resource for various tasks in quantum information processing. It is known that for the observation of nonlocality the measurements on a quantum system have to be incompatible, but the question which incompatible measurements are useful, remained open. Here we prove that any set of incompatible measurements on qubits leads to a violation of a suitable Bell inequality in a multiparticle scenario, where all parties perform the same set of measurements. Since there exists incompatible measurements on qubits which do not lead to Bell nonlocality for two particles, our results demonstrate a fundamental difference between two-particle and multi-particle nonlocality, pointing at the superactivation of measurement incompatibility as a resource. In addition, our results imply that measurement incompatibility for qubits can always be certified in a device-independent manner.</description>

Abstract: A quantum cellular automaton (QCA) or a causal unitary is by definition an automorphism of local operator algebra, by which local operators are mapped to local operators. Quantum circuits of small depth, local Hamiltonian evolutions for short time, and translations (shifts) are examples. A Clifford QCA is one that maps any Pauli operator to a finite tensor product of Pauli operators. Here, we obtain a complete table of groups $\mathfrak C(\mathsf d,p)$ of translation invariant Clifford QCA in any spatial dimension $\mathsf d \ge 0$ modulo Clifford quantum circuits and shifts over prime $p$-dimensional qudits, where the circuits and shifts are allowed to obey only coarser translation invariance. The group $\mathfrak C(\mathsf d,p)$ is nonzero only for $\mathsf d = 2k+3$ if $p=2$ and $\mathsf d = 4k+3$ if $p$ is odd where~$k \ge 0$ is any integer, in which case $\mathfrak C(\mathsf d,p) \cong \widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_p)$, the classical Witt group of nonsingular quadratic forms over the finite field $\mathbb F_p$. It is well known that $\widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_2) \cong \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$, $\widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_p) \cong \mathbb Z/4\mathbb Z$ if $p = 3 \bmod 4$, and $\widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_p)\cong \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z \oplus \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$ if $p = 1 \bmod 4$. The classification is achieved by a dimensional descent, which is a reduction of Laurent extension theorems for algebraic $L$-groups of surgery theory in topology.</description>

Abstract: Fracton order describes novel quantum phases of matter that host quasiparticles with restricted mobility, and thus lies beyond the existing paradigm of topological order. In particular, excitations that cannot move without creating multiple excitations are called fractons. Here we address a fundamental open question -- can the notion of self-exchange statistics be naturally defined for fractons, given their complete immobility as isolated excitations? Surprisingly, we demonstrate how fractons can be exchanged, and show that their self-statistics is a key part of the characterization of fracton orders. We derive general constraints satisfied by the fracton self-statistics in a large class of Abelian fracton orders. Finally, we show the existence of nontrivial fracton self-statistics in some twisted variants of the checkerboard model and Haah's code, establishing that these models are in distinct quantum phases as compared to their untwisted cousins.</description>

      <title>Engineering flat bands in twisted-bilayer graphene away from the magic angle with chiral optical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) is a recently discovered two-dimensional superlattice structure which exhibits strongly-correlated quantum many-body physics, including strange metallic behavior and unconventional superconductivity. Most of TBG exotic properties are connected to the emergence of a pair of isolated and topological flat electronic bands at the so-called magic angle, $\theta \approx 1.05^{\circ}$, which are nevertheless very fragile. In this work, we show that, by employing chiral optical cavities, the topological flat bands can be stabilized away from the magic angle in an interval of approximately $0.8^{\circ}&lt;\theta&lt;1.3^{\circ}$. As highlighted by a simplified theoretical model, time reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB), induced by the chiral nature of the cavity, plays a fundamental role in flattening the isolated bands and gapping out the rest of the spectrum. Additionally, TRSB suppresses the Berry curvature and induces a topological phase transition, with a gap closing at the $\Gamma$ point, towards a band structure with two isolated flat bands with Chern number equal to $0$. The efficiency of the cavity is discussed as a function of the twisting angle, the light-matter coupling and the optical cavity characteristic frequency. Our results demonstrate the possibility of engineering flat bands in TBG using optical devices, extending the onset of strongly-correlated topological electronic phases in moir\'e superlattices to a wider range in the twisting angle.</description>

      <title>Non-standard Hubbard model and two-electron pairing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a non-standard Hubbard model applicable to arbitrary single-particle potential profiles and inter-particle interactions. Our approach involves a novel treatment of Wannier functions, free from the ambiguities of conventional methods and applicable to finite systems without periodicity constraints. To ensure the consistent evaluation of Wannier functions, we develop a perturbative approach, utilizing the barrier penetration coefficient as a perturbation parameter. With the newly defined Wannier functions as a basis, we derive the Hubbard Hamiltonian, revealing the emergence of density-induced and pair tunneling terms alongside standard contributions. Our investigation demonstrates that long-range inter-particle interactions can induce a novel mechanism for repulsive particle pairing. This mechanism relies on the effective suppression of single-particle tunneling due to density-induced tunneling. Contrary to expectations based on the standard Hubbard model, an increase in inter-particle interaction does not lead to an insulating state. Instead, our proposed mechanism implies the coherent motion of correlated electron pairs, similar to bound states within a multi-well system, resistant to decay from single-electron tunneling transitions. These findings carry significant implications for various phenomena, including the formation of flat bands, the emergence of superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene, and the possibility of a novel metal-insulator transition.</description>

      <title>Phase Crossover induced by Dynamical Many Body Localization in Periodically Driven Long-Range Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical many-body freezing occurs in periodic transverse field-driven integrable quantum spin systems. Under freezing conditions, quantum dynamics causes practically infinite hysteresis in the drive response, maintaining its starting value. We find similar resonant freezing in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model. In the LMG, the freezing conditions in the driving field suppresses the heating postulated by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) by inducing dynamical many-body localization, or DMBL. This is in contrast to Many Body Localization (MBL), which requires disorder to suppress ETH. DMBL has been validated by the inverse participation ratio (IPR) of the quasistationary Floquet modes. Similarly to the TFIM, the LMG exhibits high-frequency localization only at freezing points. IPR localization in the LMG deteriorates with an inverse system size law at lower frequencies, which indicates heating to infinite temperature. Furthermore, adiabatically increasing frequency and amplitude from low values raises the Floquet state IPR in the LMG from nearly zero to unity, indicating a phase crossover. This occurrence enables a future technique to construct an MBL engine in clean systems that can be cycled by adjusting drive parameters only.</description>

      <title>Topology of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ nanosheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02792v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the quantum spin-Hall edge channels of two-dimensional colloidal nanocrystals of the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ were observed directly. Motivated by this development, we reconsider the four-band effective model which has been traditionally employed in the past to describe thin nanosheets of this material. Derived from a three-dimensional $\boldsymbol{k} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{p}$ model, it physically describes the top and bottom electronic surface states at the $\Gamma$ point that become gapped due to the material's small thickness. However, we find that the four-band model for the surface states alone, as derived directly from the three-dimensional theory, is inadequate for the description of thin films of a few quintuple layers and even yields an incorrect topological invariant within a significant range of thicknesses. To address this limitation we propose an eight-band model which, in addition to the surface states, also incorporates the set of bulk states closest to the Fermi level. We find that the eight-band model not only captures most of the experimental observations, but also agrees with previous first-principles calculations of the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ invariant in thin films of varying thickness. The band inversion around the $\Gamma$ point, which endows the surface-like bands with topology, is shown to be enabled by the presence of the additional bulk-like states without requiring any reparametrization of the resulting effective Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of inter-condensate dipole-dipole interactions in a setup consisting of physically disconnected single-species dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates. In particular, making use of the long-range and anisotropic nature of dipole-dipole interactions, we show that the density of a {\em target} dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate can be axially confined and engineered using a trapped {\em control} dipolar condensate. Increasing the number of control condensates leads to exotic ground state structures, including periodic patterns. The latter consists of single and double-peaked structures with coherence between the peaks controlled via the separation between the control condensates, thereby accessing both supersolid-like structures and incoherent arrays of density peaks.</description>

      <title>Ultra-low-power, microwave-multiplexed qubit controller using adiabatic superconductor logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cryogenic qubit controllers (QCs) are the key to build large-scale superconducting quantum processors. However, developing scalable QCs is challenging because the cooling power of a dilution refrigerator is too small (~10 $\mu$W at ~10 mK) to operate conventional logic families, such as complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor logic and superconducting single-flux-quantum logic, near qubits. Here we report on a scalable QC using an ultra-low-power superconductor logic family, namely adiabatic quantum-flux-parametron (AQFP) logic. The AQFP-based QC, referred to as the AQFP-multiplexed QC (AQFP-mux QC), produces multi-tone microwave signals for qubit control with an extremely small power dissipation of 81.8 pW per qubit. Furthermore, the AQFP-mux QC adopts microwave multiplexing to reduce the number of coaxial cables for operating the entire system. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate an AQFP-mux QC chip that produces microwave signals at two output ports through microwave multiplexing and demultiplexing. Experimental results show an output power of approximately $-$80 dBm and on/off ratio of ~40 dB at each output port. Basic mixing operation is also demonstrated by observing sideband signals.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Hysteresis Across a Dissipative Multi-Mode Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dissipative phase transitions are characteristic features in open quantum systems. Key signatures are the dynamical switching between different states in the vicinity of the phase transition and the appearance of hysteresis. Here, we experimentally study dynamic sweeps across a first order dissipative phase transition in a multi-mode driven-dissipative system. In contrast to previous studies, we perform sweeps of the dissipation strength instead of the driving strength. We extract exponents for the scaling of the hysteresis area in dependence of the sweep time and study the $g^{(2)}(0)$ correlations, which show non-trivial behavior. By changing the temperature of the system we investigate the importance of coherently pumping the system. We compare our results to numerical calculations done for a single mode variant of the system, and find surprisingly good agreement. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the differences between a scan of the dissipation strength and a scan of the driving strength.</description>

      <title>Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer interaction as an infinite-range Penson-Kolb pairing mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the well-known $(k\uparrow, -k\downarrow)$ Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer interaction, when considered in real space, is equivalent to an infinite-range Penson-Kolb pairing mechanism coexisting with an attractive Hubbard term. Driven by this discovery and aiming at exploring the conduction properties, we investigate the dynamics of fermionic particles confined in a ring-shaped lattice. We assume that fermions are simultaneously influenced by the pairing interaction and by an Aharonov-Bohm electromagnetic phase, which is incorporated into the model in a highly non-trivial manner. Remarkably, the aforementioned model shows Richardson integrability for both integer and half-integer values of the applied magnetic flux $\Phi/\Phi_0$, thus permitting the exact solution of a genuine many-body problem. We discuss the ground state properties of both two-particle and many-particle systems, drawing comparisons with results from the attractive Hubbard model. Our approach combines exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group techniques, and numerical solution of the Richardson equations. This comprehensive analysis allows us to study various key metrics, including the system's conductivity as a function of the interaction strength. In this way, the BCS-BEC transition is investigated in a continuous manner, thus permitting to shed light on fundamental aspects of superconducting pairing. Our findings can be experimentally tested in a condensed matter context or, with greater level of control, using atomtronics platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impacts of an imaginary transverse field on the dynamics of magnetic domain walls in a quantum Ising chain. We show that an imaginary field plays a similar role as a real transverse field in forming a low-lying Wannier-Stark ladder. However, analytical and numerical calculations of the time evolutions in both systems show that the corresponding Bloch oscillations exhibit totally different patterns for the same initial states. These findings reveal the nontrivial effect of non-Hermiticity on quantum spin dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Stokes-Mueller method to calculate the cross sections associated with multiple Compton scattering of an arbitrary two-photon system. This method is used to calculate the cross section in the scenario in which one of the maximally entangled annihilation photons undergoes intermediate Compton scattering followed by the detection of both photons using a pair of Compton polarimeters. The method accounts for potential quantum-decoherence effects caused by Compton scattering. Despite being grounded in quantum field theory, the method does not require an in-depth understanding of its typically intricate prerequisites. As a result, this method is anticipated to be accessible to a broader community of physicists and is readily applicable in Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scarring in $2+1$D Gauge Theories with Dynamical Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) has emerged as an intriguing paradigm of weak ergodicity breaking in nonintegrable quantum many-body models, particularly lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in $1+1$ spacetime dimensions. However, an open question is whether QMBS exists in higher-dimensional LGTs with dynamical matter. Given that nonergodic dynamics in $d{=}1$ spatial dimension tend to vanish in $d{&gt;}1$, it is important to probe this question. Using matrix product state techniques for both finite and infinite systems, we show that QMBS occurs in the $2{+}1$D $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link model (QLM), as evidenced in persistent coherent oscillations in local observables, a marked slowdown in the growth of the bipartite entanglement entropy, and revivals in the fidelity. Interestingly, we see that QMBS is more robust when the matter degrees of freedom are bosonic rather than fermionic. Our results further shed light on the intimate connection between gauge invariance and QMBS, and highlight the persistence of scarring in higher spatial dimensions. Our findings can be tested in near-term analog and digital quantum simulators, and we demonstrate their accessibility on a recently proposed cold-atom analog quantum simulator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of Quantum Many-Body Scars has been established across different quantum many-body systems, including spin-1/2 Quantum Link Models. We systematically identify scars for pure gauge theories with arbitrarily large integer spin $S$ in $2+1$D, concretely for Truncated Link Models, where the electric field is truncated rather than replaced by spins. Through an explicit analytic construction, we show that the presence of scars is widespread. We confirm these findings numerically for small truncated spin and $S=1$ Quantum Link Models. The proposed analytic construction establishes the presence of scars far beyond volumes and spins that can be probed with existing numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Vison condensation and spinon confinement in a kagome lattice $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid: A numerical study of a quantum dimer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids are exotic many-body states featured with long-range entanglement and fractional anyon quasiparticles. Quantum phase transitions of spin liquids are particularly interesting problems related with novel phenomena of anyon condensation and anyon confinement. Here we study a quantum dimer model which implements a transition between a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid ($\mathbb{Z}_2$SL) and a valence bond solid (VBS) on the kagome lattice. The transition is driven by the condensation of vison excitation of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid, which impacts on other anyon excitations especially leading to the confinement of spinon excitations. By numerical exact diagonalization of the dimer model, we directly measure the vison condensation using vison string operators, and explicitly check a confining potential acting on spinon excitations in the VBS state. It is observed that topological degeneracy of the spin liquid state is lifted concomitantly with the vison condensation. The dimer ordering pattern of the VBS state is identified by investigating dimer structure factor. Furthermore, we find an interesting state that exhibits features of spin liquid and VBS simultaneously. We discuss the origin of the mixed behaviors and possible scenarios expected in thermodynamic limit. This work complements the previous analytical studies on the dimer model, Phys. Rev. B 87, 104408 (2013) and Phys. Rev. B 92, 205131 (2015), by providing numerical evidences on the vison condensation and the spinon confinement in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$SL-to-VBS transition.</description>
