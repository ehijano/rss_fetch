      <title>Quantized dynamical pumping via dissipation in a mechanical Thouless pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thouless pumps are time-periodic one-dimensional systems that capture the physics of the two-dimensional quantum Hall effect via the quantized pumping of particles under adiabatic modulation. Recent work in photonics has shown that nonlinearity can act to quantize the displacement of light in the form of soliton motion. Here we use a mechanical system -- namely coupled pendulums described by the Frenkel-Kontorova model -- to propose and observe quantized non-adiabatic Thouless pumping using topological kink solitons. The pumping proceeds by a qualitatively different mechanism compared to Thouless' original proposal as the pump is non-adiabatic and dissipation is necessary. In the presence of an additional potential gradient along the pump, we predict and observe the emergence of quantized transport against the pumping direction as a function of the period and show the emergence of a rich plateau structure; this quantization is unique to dissipative systems and cannot be described by the Chern number. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the robustness of the process by pumping the soliton through a tunable nonlinear defect.</description>

      <title>Quasiclassical quantization of the Boussinesq breather emerging from the kink localized mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The breather solution found by M. Tajiri and Y. Murakami for the Boussinesq equation is studied analytically. The new parameterization of the solution is proposed, allowing us to find exactly the existence boundary of the Boussinesq breather and to show that such a nonlinear excitation emerges from the linear localized mode of the kink solution corresponding to a shock wave analog in a crystal. We explicitly find the first integrals, namely the energy and the field momentum, and faithfully construct the adiabatic invariant for the Boussinesq breather. As a result, we carry out the quasiclassical quantization of the nonlinear oscillating solution, obtaining its energy spectrum, i.e., the energy dependence on the momentum and the number of states, and reveal the Hamiltonian equations for this particle-like excitation.</description>

      <title>The diffusive dynamics and electrochemical regulation of weak polyelectrolytes across liquid interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework to study the spatio-temporal evolution of liquid-liquid phase separation of weak polyelectrolytes in ionic solutions. Unlike strong polyelectrolytes, which carry a fixed charge, the charge state of weak polyelectrolytes is modulated by the electrochemical environment through protonation and deprotonation processes. Leveraging numerical simulations and analysis, our work reveals how solution acidity (pH) influences the formation, interactions, and structural properties of phase-separated coacervates. We find that pH gradients can be maintained across coacervate interfaces resulting in a clear distinction in the electro-chemical properties within and outside the coacervate. By regulating the charge state of weak polyelectrolytes, pH gradients interact and modulate the electric double layer forming at coacervate interfaces eventually determining how they interact. Further linear and nonlinear analyses of stationary localised solutions reveal a rich spectrum of behaviours that significantly distinguish weak from strong polyelectrolytes. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of charge regulation on phase-separating solutions of charge-bearing molecules and the possibility of harnessing charge-regulated mechanisms to control coacervates and shape their stability and spatial organisation.</description>

      <title>The formation of a soliton gas condensate for the focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we carry out a rigorous analysis of a multi-soliton solution of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation as the number, $N$, of solitons grows to infinity. We discover configurations of $N$-soliton solutions which exhibit the formation (as $N \to \infty$) of a soliton gas condensate. Specifically, we show that when the eigenvalues of the Zakharov - Shabat operator for the NLS equation accumulate on two bounded horizontal segments in the complex plane with norming constants bounded away from $0$, then, asymptotically, the solution is described by a rapidly oscillatory elliptic-wave with constant velocity, on compact subsets of $(x,t)$. This is to be distinguished from previous analyses of soliton gasses where the norming constants were tending to zero with $N$, and the asymptotic description only included elliptic waves in the long-time asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Experimentally Tractable Generation of High-Order Rogue Waves in Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06869v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study a prototypical, experimentally accessible scenario that enables the systematic generation of so-called high-order rogue waves in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. These waveforms lead to significantly and controllably more extreme focusing events than the famous Peregrine soliton. In one spatial dimension, we showcase conclusive numerical evidence that our scheme generates the focusing behavior associated with the first four rogue waves from the relevant hierarchy. We then extend considerations to anisotropic two-dimensional and even three-dimensional settings, establishing that the scheme can generate second order rogue waves despite the well-known limitation of finite-time blow up of focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations.</description>
