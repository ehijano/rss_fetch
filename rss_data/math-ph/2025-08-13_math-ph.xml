      <title>Self-adjoint realizations of higher-order squeezing operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09044v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order squeezing captures non-Gaussian features of quantum light by probing moments of the field beyond the variance, and is associated with operators involving nonlinear combinations of creation and annihilation operators. Here we study a class of operators of the form $\xi (a^\dag)^ka^l+\xi^\ast (a^\dag)^la^k+f(a^\dag a)$, which arise naturally in the analysis of higher-order quantum fluctuations. The operators are defined on the linear span of Fock states. We show that the essential self-adjointness of these operators depends on the asymptotics of the real-valued function $f(n)$ at infinity. In particular, pure higher-order squeezing operators ($k\geq3$, $l=0$, and $f(n)=0$) are not essentially self-adjoint, but adding a properly chosen term $f(a^\dag a)$, like a Kerr term, can have a regularizing effect and restore essential self-adjointness. In the non-self-adjoint regime, we compute the deficiency indices and classify all self-adjoint extensions. Our results provide a rigorous operator-theoretic foundation for modeling and interpreting higher-order squeezing in quantum optics, and reveal interesting connections with the Birkhoff-Trjitzinsky theory of asymptotic expansions for recurrence relations.</description>

      <title>Two-moment characterization of spectral measures on the real line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.09964v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kiukas, Lahti and Ylinen asked the following general question. When is a positive operator measure projection valued? A version of this question formulated in terms of operator moments was posed in a recent paper of the present authors. Let $T$ be a selfadjoint operator and $F$ be a Borel semispectral measure on the real line with compact support. For which positive integers $p&lt; q$ do the equalities $T^k =\int_{\mathbb{R}} x^k F(dx)$, $k=p, q$, imply that $F$ is a spectral measure? In the present paper, we completely solve the second problem. The answer is affirmative if $p$ is odd and $q$ is even, and negative otherwise. The case $(p,q)=(1,2)$ closely related to intrinsic noise operator was solved by several authors including Kruszy\'{n}ski and de Muynck as well as Kiukas, Lahti and Ylinen. The counterpart of the second problem concerning the multiplicativity of unital positive linear maps on $C^*$-algebras is also solved.</description>

      <title>Dubrovin-Natanzon divisors on MM-curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ${\mathtt{MM}}$-curves are rational degenerations of ${\mathtt{M}}$-curves, i.e. they are maximal Mumford in the sense that they posses $g$ tropical cycles and exactly $g+1$ real ovals, where $g$ is the arithmetic genus. For rational curves the ``naive'' definition of divisors as formal sums of points requires a refinement. In the finite-gap theory of KP II equation the real regular solutions correspond to the Dubrovin-Natanzon (DN) divisors on ${\mathtt{M}}$-curves. In the case of real regular multiline KP II solitons, it was shown by the authors that for any given solution there exists a normalization time such that the spectral data are smooth DN divisor on ${\mathtt{MM}}$-curve.
  However, to show that DN divisors parameterize the; full positroid cell, it is necessary to fix the normalization time and consider both smooth and non-smooth divisors. In this paper we start such an investigation, and show that on ${\mathtt{MM}}$-curves whose dual graphs are trivalent Le-graphs of totally positive Schubert cells, the construction of non-smooth DN divisors requires combinations of just two basic types of blow-ups.</description>

      <title>Sharp phase transition in the grand canonical $\Phi^3$ measure at critical chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phase transition and critical phenomenon for the grand canonical $\Phi^3$ measure in two-dimensional Euclidean quantum field theory. The study of this measure was initiated by Jaffe, Bourgain, and Carlen--Fr\"ohlich--Lebowitz, primarily in regimes far from criticality. We identify a critical chemical potential and show that the measure exhibits a sharp phase transition at this critical threshold. At the critical threshold, the analysis is based on establishing the correlation decay of the Gaussian fluctuations in the partition function, combined with a coarse-graining argument to show divergence of the maximum of an approximating Gaussian process.</description>

      <title>Control-affine Schr\"odinger Bridge and Generalized Bohm Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The control-affine Schr\"odinger bridge concerns with a stochastic optimal control problem. Its solution is a controlled evolution of joint state probability density subject to a control-affine It\^o diffusion with a given deadline connecting a given pair of initial and terminal densities. In this work, we recast the necessary conditions of optimality for the control-affine Schr\"odinger bridge problem as a two point boundary value problem for a quantum mechanical Schr\"odinger PDE with complex potential. This complex-valued potential is a generalization of the real-valued Bohm potential in quantum mechanics. Our derived potential is akin to the optical potential in nuclear physics where the real part of the potential encodes elastic scattering (transmission of wave function), and the imaginary part encodes inelastic scattering (absorption of wave function). The key takeaway is that the process noise that drives the evolution of probability densities induces an absorbing medium in the evolution of wave function. These results make new connections between control theory and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics through the lens of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Ballistic aggregation displays self-organized criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the convex hull of a collection of disjoint open discs with radii $1/2$. The boundary of the convex hull consists of a finite number of line segments and arcs. Randomly choose a point in one of the arcs in the boundary so that the density of its distribution is proportional to the arc measure. Attach a new disc at the chosen point so that it is outside of the convex hull and tangential to its boundary. Replace the original convex hull with the convex hull of all preexisting discs and the new disc. Continue in the same manner. Simulations show that disc clusters form long, straight, or slightly curved filaments with small side branches and occasional macroscopic side branches. The shape of the convex hull is either an equilateral triangle or a quadrangle. Side branches play the role analogous to avalanches in sandpile models, one of the best-known examples of self-organized criticality (SOC). Our results indicate that the size of a branch obeys a power law, as expected of avalanches in sandpile models and similar ``catastrophies'' in other SOC models.</description>

      <title>Extending fusion rules with finite subgroups: For a general understanding of quotient or gauging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general method for realizing simple current extensions of the conformal field theories. We systematically obtain the $Z_{N}$ symmetry extended fusion ring of bulk and chiral theories and the corresponding modular partition functions with nonanomalous subgroup $Z_{n}(\subset Z_{N})$. The bulk (or nonchiral) fusion ring provides fundamental algebraic data for conformal bootstrap, and the chiral fusion ring provides fundamental data for the graded symmetry topological field theories. The latter also provides algebraic data of smeared boundary conformal field theories describing zero modes of the extended models. For more general multicomponent or coupled systems, we also obtain a new series of extended theories. By applying the folding trick to the resultant coupled theories, their partition functions correspond to charged or gapped domain walls or massless renormalization group flows preserving quotient group structures. This work opens new research directions in studying the classification of conformal field theories and the corresponding topological quantum field theories (or topological orders) by establishing the traditional methods in abstract algebra and modular form.</description>

      <title>Embedding Signature-Changing Manifolds: A Braneworld and Kaluza-Klein Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08662v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a class of semi-Riemannian manifolds characterized by smooth metric signature changes with a transverse radical, This class includes spacetimes relevant to cosmological models such as the Hartle-Hawking "no boundary" proposal, where a Riemannian manifold transitions smoothly into a Lorentzian spacetime without boundaries or singularities. For this class, we prove the existence of global isometric embeddings into higher-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean spaces. We then strengthen this result by demonstrating that a specific type of global isometric embedding, which we term an $\mathcal{H}$-global embedding, also exists into both Minkowski space and Misner space. For the canonical $n$-dimensional signature-changing model, we explicitly construct a full global isometric embedding into $(n+1)$-dimensional Minkowski and Misner spaces, a significantly stronger result than an $\mathcal{H}$-global embedding for this specific case. This embedding framework provides new geometric tools for studying signature change and braneworlds through the geometry of submanifolds embedded in a bulk, thus presenting a mathematically well-defined approach to these phenomena.</description>

      <title>Correlators in phase-ordering from Schr\"odinger-invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems undergoing phase-ordering kinetics after a quench into the ordered phase with $0&lt;T&lt;T_c$ from a fully disordered initial state and with a non-conserved order-parameter have the dynamical exponent ${z}=2$. The long-time behaviour of their single-time and two-time correlators, determined by the noisy initial conditions, is derived from Schr\"odinger-invariance and we show that the generic ageing scaling forms of the correlators follow from the Schr\"odinger covariance of the four-point response functions. The autocorrelation exponent $\lambda$ is related to the passage exponent $\zeta_p$ which describes the time-scale for the cross-over into the ageing regime. Both Porod's law and the bounds $d/2 \leq \lambda \leq d$ are reproduced in a simple way. The dynamical scaling in fully finite systems and of global correlators is found and the low-temperature generalisation $\lambda= d-2\Theta$ of the Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation is derived.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the spectra of general non-minimal second-order operators. To do this, we derive the local part of the trace of the second Seeley-DeWitt heat kernel coefficient for such operators in a completely model-independent way. Afterwards, we provide three examples to show how our result can be applied in practical scenarios. In particular, we emphasize this discussion when dealing with a toy-model of dynamical torsion, which is viewed as a simple instance of higher-spin fields. All our results are compatible with the literature, and we provide a Mathematica notebook with the model-independent results that are written in the paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present an implementation of a computer algorithm that automatically determines the topological structure of spacetime, using a branched covering space representation. This algorithm is applied to a few simple examples in dimension 3, and a complete set of the topological spaces branched over several graphs are found. We also include some new visualizations of the branched covering construction, in order to aid and clarify the understanding of how these structures can be used in quantum gravity to realize the topological nature of the spacetime foam.</description>

      <title>Stability of spinorial Sobolev inequalities on $\mathbb{S}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spinorial Sobolev inequality on the unit sphere states \begin{equation*}
  \Big(\int| D\psi|^{\frac{2n}{n+1}}\Big)^{\frac{n+1}{n}}-\frac{n}{2}\omega_{n}^{1/n}\int\langle D\psi,\psi\rangle
  \geq 0, \end{equation*} with equality if and only if $\psi \in {\mathcal M}$, the set of all $-\frac 12$-Killing spinors and their conformal transformations.
  Our main result in this paper is to refine this inequality by establishing a stability inequality
  \begin{equation*} \Big(\int| D\psi|^{\frac{2n}{n+1}}\Big)^{\frac{n+1}{n}}-\frac{n}{2}\omega_{n}^{1/n}\int\langle D\psi,\psi\rangle
  \geq {\bf c}_S\inf_{\phi\in\mathcal{M}}\Big(\int| D(\psi-\phi)|^{\frac{2n}{n+1}}\Big)^{\frac{n+1}{n}}.
  \end{equation*}
  As a by-product of our argument, we show that elements in set $\mathcal M$ are not optimizers of another spinorial Sobolev inequality
  \begin{equation*}
  \Big(\int| D\psi|^{\frac{2n}{n+1}}\Big)^{\frac{n+1}{n}} \geq C_S \Big(\int|\psi|^{\frac{2n}{n-1}}\Big)^{\frac{n-1}{n}},
  \end{equation*}
  unlike expected by experts. They have in fact index $n+1$ and nullity $2^{[\frac n2]+2}$.</description>

      <title>Numerical Analysis of the Causal Action Principle in Low Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.06382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The numerical analysis of causal fermion systems is advanced by employing differentiable programming methods. The causal action principle for weighted counting measures is introduced for general values of the integer parameters $f$ (the particle number), $n$ (the spin dimension) and $m$ (the number of spacetime points). In the case $n=1$, the causal relations are clarified geometrically in terms of causal cones. Discrete Dirac spheres are introduced as candidates for minimizers for large $m$ in the cases $n=1, f=2$ and $n=2, f=4$. We provide a thorough numerical analysis of the causal action principle for weighted counting measures for large $m$ in the cases $n=1,2$ and $f=2,3,4$. Our numerical findings corroborate that all minimizers for large $m$ are good approximations of the discrete Dirac spheres. In the example $n=1, f=3$ it is explained how numerical minimizers can be visualized by projected spacetime plots. Methods and prospects are discussed to numerically investigate settings in which hitherto no analytic candidates for minimizers are known.</description>

      <title>Adjoint-based optimization of the Rayleigh-B\'enard instability with melting boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an adjoint-based optimization procedure to control the onset of the Rayleigh-B\'enard instability with a melting front. A novel cut cell method is used to solve the Navier-Stokes equations in the Boussinesq approximation and the convection-diffusion equation in the fluid layer, as well as the heat equation in the solid phase. To track the interface we use the level set method where its evolution is simply governed by an advection equation. An incomplete continuous adjoint problem is then derived by considering that the velocity field is a check-pointing variable. The results of the minimization problem with a tracking-type cost-functional show that our adjoint method is well suited to optimize the shapes of the fronts in this configuration.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer Testing and Magic Entropy via Quantum Fourier Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Fourier analysis is an important topic in mathematical physics. We introduce a systematic protocol for testing and measuring ``magic'' in quantum states and gates, using a quantum Fourier approach. Magic, as a quantum resource, is necessary to achieve a quantum advantage in computation. Our protocols are based on quantum convolutions and swap tests, implemented via quantum circuits. We describe this for both qubit and qudit systems. Our quantum Fourier approach offers a unified method to quantify magic, in stabilizer circuits, as well as in matchgate and bosonic Gaussian circuits.</description>

      <title>Classically estimating observables of noiseless quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a classical algorithm based on Pauli propagation for estimating expectation values of arbitrary observables on random unstructured quantum circuits across all circuit architectures and depths, including those with all-to-all connectivity. We prove that for any architecture where each circuit layer is randomly sampled from a distribution invariant under single-qubit rotations, our algorithm achieves a small error $\varepsilon$ on all circuits except for a small fraction $\delta$. The computational time is polynomial in qubit count and circuit depth for any small constant $\varepsilon, \delta$, and quasi-polynomial for inverse-polynomially small $\varepsilon, \delta$. Our results show that estimating observables of quantum circuits exhibiting chaotic and locally scrambling behavior is classically tractable across all geometries. We further conduct numerical experiments beyond our average-case assumptions, demonstrating the potential utility of Pauli propagation methods for simulating real-time dynamics and finding low-energy states of physical Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>A DNN Biophysics Model with Topological and Electrostatic Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this project, we provide a deep-learning neural network (DNN) based biophysics model to predict protein properties. The model uses multi-scale and uniform topological and electrostatic features generated with protein structural information and force field, which governs the molecular mechanics. The topological features are generated using the element specified persistent homology (ESPH) while the electrostatic features are fast computed using a Cartesian treecode. These features are uniform in number for proteins with various sizes thus the broadly available protein structure database can be used in training the network. These features are also multi-scale thus the resolution and computational cost can be balanced by the users. The machine learning simulation on over 4000 protein structures shows the efficiency and fidelity of these features in representing the protein structure and force field for the predication of their biophysical properties such as electrostatic solvation energy. Tests on topological or electrostatic features alone and the combination of both showed the optimal performance when both features are used. This model shows its potential as a general tool in assisting biophysical properties and function prediction for the broad biomolecules using data from both theoretical computing and experiments.</description>

      <title>A consistent treatment of dynamic contact angles in the sharp-interface framework with the generalized Navier boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the Generalized Navier Boundary condition (GNBC) introduced by Qian et al.\ in the sharp interface Volume-of-Fluid context. We replace the singular uncompensated Young stress by a smooth function with a characteristic width $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ that is understood as a physical parameter of the model. Therefore, we call the model the ``Contact Region GNBC'' (CR-GNBC). We show that the model is consistent with the fundamental kinematics of the contact angle transport described by Fricke, K\"ohne and Bothe. We implement the model in the geometrical Volume-of-Fluid solver Basilisk using a ``free angle'' approach. This means that the dynamic contact angle is not prescribed but reconstructed from the interface geometry and subsequently applied as an input parameter to compute the uncompensated Young stress. We couple this approach to the two-phase Navier Stokes solver and study the withdrawing tape problem with a receding contact line. It is shown that the model allows for grid-independent solutions and leads to a full regularization of the singularity at the moving contact line, which is in accordance with the thin-film equation subject to this boundary condition. In particular, it is shown that the curvature at the moving contact line is finite and mesh converging. As predicted by the fundamental kinematics, the parallel shear stress component vanishes at the moving contact line for quasi-stationary states (i.e. for $\dot{\theta}_d=0$) and the dynamic contact angle is determined by a balance between the uncompensated Young stress and an effective contact line friction. Furthermore, a non-linear generalization of the model is proposed, which aims at reproducing the Molecular Kinetic Theory of Blake and Haynes for quasi-stationary states.</description>

      <title>Universal theory for geometry-dependent non-Hermitian bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), characterized by the boundary-localized eigenstates under open boundary conditions, has revealed the breakdown of Bloch band theory in non-Hermitian lattices. While one-dimensional non-Hermitian bands are well-described by the non-Bloch band theory, its extension to higher dimensions is challenged by the geometry-dependent skin effect (GDSE), where the energy spectra and the boundary localization of the eigenstates depend on the system's geometry. This work addresses this challenge by introducing a universal theoretical framework based on the strip generalized Brillouin zone (SGBZ). Our framework provides a systematic description of the GDSE, explains its origin through the competition between incompatible SGBZs, and provides for the first time a clear criterion for its emergence. We also unify our SGBZ framework with the Amoeba formulation by showing that the Amoeba spectrum is the superset of all possible SGBZ spectra, thereby clarifying its domain of validity. This work establishes a foundation for studying higher-dimensional non-Hermitian systems, paving the way for the future investigation of novel higher-dimensional non-Hermitian physics, such as hybrid skin-topological effects and non-Hermitian Chern bands.</description>

      <title>Breather-to-soliton transitions and nonlinear wave interactions for the higher-order generalized Gerdjikov-Ivanov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically investigate the intricate dynamics of the breather-to-soliton transitions and nonlinear wave interactions for the higher-order generalized Gerdjikov-Ivanov equation. The transition conditions of the breather-to-soliton are established and the novel nonlinear converted waves, including the W-shaped soliton, M-shaped soliton, multi-peak soliton, anti-dark soliton and periodic wave solution are discussed. Meanwhile, the interactions among the above nonlinear converted waves are explored by choosing appropriate parameters. Furthermore, we derive the double-pole solutions exhibiting breather-to-soliton transitions and employ the asymptotic analysis method to analyze the dynamics of the asymptotic solitons for the double-pole anti-dark soliton. This work deepens the fundamental understanding of nonlinear wave metamorphosis induced by higher-order terms in integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic bootstrap for RCFT: signs and bounds for quasi-characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi-characters are solutions of simple modular differential equations that form an explicit basis for the space of all admissible characters that can potentially describe rational CFT. They were classified for rank-$2$ in arXiv:1810.09472 [hep-th], where it was conjectured that their $q$-series has coefficients of alternating sign that stabilise to a fixed sign at order $\frac{c}{12}$ and sometimes undergo more exotic behaviour -- where $c$ is the central charge. Here we prove some of these conjectures and estimate the growth of coefficients near the stabilisation point. We also explain what role the signs play in the construction of admissible characters from quasi-characters.</description>

      <title>Dynamical systems on torus related to general Heun equations: phase-lock areas and constriction breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07282v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The overdamped Josephson junction in superconductivity theory can be modeled by the family of dynamical systems on the torus, which is known as the RSJ model. This family admits an equivalent description by a family of second-order differential equations: special double confluent Heun equations. In the present paper, we construct two new families of dynamical systems on torus that can be equivalently described by a family of general Heun equations (GHE), with four singular points, and confluent Heun equations, with three singular points. The first family, related to GHE, is a deformation of the RSJ model, which will be denoted by dRSJ. The phase-lock areas of a family of dynamical systems on the torus are those level subsets of the rotation number function that have nonempty interiors. It is known that for the RSJ model, the rotation number quantization effect occurs: phase-lock areas exist only for integer rotation number values. Moreover, each phase-lock area is a chain of domains separated by points. Those separation points that do not lie on the abscissa axis are called constrictions. In the present paper, we study phase-lock areas in the new family dRSJ. The quantization effect remains valid in this family. On the other hand, we show that in the new family dRSJ the constrictions break down.</description>
