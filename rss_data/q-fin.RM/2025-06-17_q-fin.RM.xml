      <title>Credit risk for large portfolios of green and brown loans: extending the ASRF model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a credit risk model for portfolios composed of green and brown loans, extending the ASRF framework via a two-factor copula structure. Systematic risk is modeled using potentially skewed distributions, allowing for asymmetric creditworthiness effects, while idiosyncratic risk remains Gaussian. Under a non-uniform exposure setting, we establish convergence in quadratic mean of the portfolio loss to a limit reflecting the distinct characteristics of the two loan segments. Numerical results confirm the theoretical findings and illustrate how value-at-risk is affected by portfolio granularity, default probabilities, factor loadings, and skewness. Our model accommodates differential sensitivity to systematic shocks and offers a tractable basis for further developments in credit risk modeling, including granularity adjustments, CDO pricing, and empirical analysis of green loan portfolios.</description>

      <title>Implied Probabilities and Volatility in Credit Risk: A Merton-Based Approach with Binomial Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore credit risk pricing by modeling equity as a call option and debt as the difference between the firm's asset value and a put option, following the structural framework of the Merton model. Our approach proceeds in two stages: first, we calibrate the asset volatility using the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) formula; second, we recover implied mean return and probability surfaces under the physical measure. To achieve this, we construct a recombining binomial tree under the real-world (natural) measure, assuming a fixed initial asset value. The volatility input is taken from a specific region of the implied volatility surface - based on moneyness and maturity - which then informs the calibration of drift and probability. A novel mapping is established between risk-neutral and physical parameters, enabling construction of implied surfaces that reflect the market's credit expectations and offer practical tools for stress testing and credit risk analysis.</description>

      <title>Automated Risk Management Mechanisms in DeFi Lending Protocols: A Crosschain Comparative Analysis of Aave and Compound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain-based decentralised lending is a rapidly growing and evolving alternative to traditional lending, but it poses new risks. To mitigate these risks, lending protocols have integrated automated risk management tools into their smart contracts. However, the effectiveness of the latest risk management features introduced in the most recent versions of these lending protocols is understudied. To close this gap, we use a panel regression fixed effects model to empirically analyse the cross-version (v2 and v3) and cross-chain (L1 and L2) performance of the liquidation mechanisms of the two most popular lending protocols, Aave and Compound, during the period Jan 2021 to Dec 2024. Our analysis reveals that liquidation events in v3 of both protocols lead to an increase in total value locked and total revenue, with stronger impact on the L2 blockchain compared to L1. In contrast, liquidations in v2 have an insignificant impact, which indicates that the most recent v3 protocols have better risk management than the earlier v2 protocols. We also show that L1 blockchains are the preferred choice among large investors for their robust liquidity and ecosystem depth, while L2 blockchains are more popular among retail investors for their lower fees and faster execution.</description>

      <title>Choquet rating criteria, risk measures, and risk consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Credit ratings are widely used by investors as a screening device. We introduce and study several natural notions of risk consistency that promote prudent investment decisions in the framework of Choquet rating criteria. Three closely related notions of risk consistency are considered: with respect to risk aversion, the asset pooling effect, and the benefit of portfolio diversification. These notions are formulated either under a single probability measure or multiple probability measures. We show how these properties translate between rating criteria and the corresponding risk measures, and establish a hierarchical structure among them. These findings lead to a full characterization of Choquet risk measures and Choquet rating criteria satisfying risk consistency properties. Illustrated by case studies on collateralized loan obligations and catastrophe bonds, some classes of Choquet rating criteria serve as useful alternatives to the probability of default and expected loss criteria used in practice for rating financial products.</description>

      <title>Circular Directional Flow Decomposition of Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Circular Directional Flow Decomposition (CDFD), a new framework for analyzing circularity in weighted directed networks. CDFD separates flow into two components: a circular (divergence-free) component and an acyclic component that carries all nett directional flow. This yields a normalized circularity index between 0 (fully acyclic) and 1 (for networks formed solely by the superposition of cycles), with the complement measuring directionality. This index captures the proportion of flow involved in cycles, and admits a range of interpretations - such as system closure, feedback, weighted strong connectivity, structural redundancy, or inefficiency. Although the decomposition is generally non-unique, we show that the set of all decompositions forms a well-structured geometric space with favourable topological properties. Within this space, we highlight two benchmark decompositions aligned with distinct analytical goals: the maximum circularity solution, which minimizes nett flow, and the Balanced Flow Forwarding (BFF) solution, a unique, locally computable decomposition that distributes circular flow across all feasible cycles in proportion to the original network structure. We demonstrate the interpretive value and computational tractability of both decompositions on synthetic and empirical networks. They outperform existing circularity metrics in detecting meaningful structural variation. The decomposition also enables structural analysis - such as mapping the distribution of cyclic flow - and supports practical applications that require explicit flow allocation or routing, including multilateral netting and efficient transport.</description>
