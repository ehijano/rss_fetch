      <title>A Nonequilibrium Equation of State for a Turbulent 2D Bose Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium equations of state can provide an effective thermodynamic-like description of far-from-equilibrium systems. We experimentally construct such an equation for a direct energy cascade in a turbulent two-dimensional Bose gas. Our homogeneous gas is continuously driven on a large length scale and, with matching dissipation on a small length scale, exhibits a nonthermal but stationary power-law momentum distribution. Our equation of state links the cascade amplitude with the underlying scale-invariant energy flux, and can, for different drive strengths, gas densities, and interaction strengths, be recast into a universal power-law form using scalings consistent with the Gross-Pitaevskii model.</description>

      <title>Mobile impurity interacting with a Hubbard chain and the role of Friedel oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work examines a mobile impurity interacting with a bath of a few spin-$\uparrow$ and spin-$\downarrow$ fermions in a small one-dimensional open lattice system. We study ground-state properties using the exact diagonalization method, where the system is modeled by a three-component Fermi Hubbard Hamiltonian. We find that in addition to the standard phase separation between a strongly repulsive impurity and the bath, a strongly-attractive impurity also phase separates with the fermionic holes. Furthermore, we find that the impurity can show an oscillatory pattern in its density for intermediate bath-impurity interactions, which are induced by Friedel oscillations in the fermionic bath. This rich behavior of the impurity could be probed with fermionic ultracold mixtures in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Emulation of the dynamics of bound electron exposed to strong oscillatory laser field with Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper employs a Bose-Einstein condensates to simulate the dynamical response of bound electrons in a strongly oscillating pulsed laser field. We investigate the excitation dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates with repulsive interaction confined in a potential well with finite depth and width driven by a strong oscillatory pulse field. By numerically solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with Crank-Nicolson method and split operator method, we obtain the time-dependent wavefunction and therefore the evolution of density distribution in real space and that in momentum space, and the occupation distribution in energy space. It is shown that cold atoms with weak interaction oscillate as a whole body in a finite space when the amplitude of pulse drive is not strong enough. During the evolution atoms occupy the bound states with larger probability. Increasing the driving strength or atomic interactions promotes the excitation of atoms into continuum states and their diffusion out of the potential well, leading to complex structures or even interference-like patterns in the momentum distribution. The number of cycles in the pulse envelope plays a crucial role in the dynamical behavior: High-frequency driving can suppress diffusion and maintain localization. Furthermore, repulsive atomic interactions can enhance high-harmonic generation yields by several orders of magnitude. This study offers a new perspective for quantum simulations of ultrafast dynamics in strong fields and reveals the regulatory role of interactions in condensates on non-equilibrium dynamical processes.</description>

Abstract: Analog quantum simulators and digital quantum computers are two distinct paradigms driving near-term applications in modern quantum science, from probing many-body phenomena to identifying computational advantage over classical systems. A transformative opportunity on the horizon is merging the high-fidelity many-body evolution in analog simulators with the robust control and measurement of digital machines. Such a hybrid platform would unlock new capabilities in state preparation, characterization and dynamical control. Here, we embed digital quantum control in the analog evolution of a synthetic quantum material by entangling the lattice potential landscape of a Bose-Hubbard circuit with an ancilla qubit. This Hamiltonian-level control induces dynamics under a superposition of different lattice configurations and guides the many-body system to novel strongly-correlated states where different phases of matter coexist -- ordering photons into superpositions of solid and fluid eigenstates. Leveraging hybrid control modalities, we adiabatically introduce disorder to localize the photons into an entangled cat state and enhance its coherence using a many-body echo technique. This work illustrates the potential for entangling quantum computers with quantum matter -- synthetic and solid-state -- for advantage in sensing and materials characterization.</description>

      <title>U(1) lattice gauge theory and string roughening on a triangular Rydberg array</title>

Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) describe fundamental interactions in particle physics. A central phenomenon in these theories is confinement, which binds quarks and antiquarks into hadrons through the formation of string-like flux tubes of gauge fields. Simulating confinement dynamics is a challenging task, but recent advances in quantum simulation are enabling the exploration of LGTs in regimes beyond the reach of classical computation. For analog devices, a major difficulty is the realization of strong plaquette interactions, which generate string fluctuations that can drive a roughening transition. Understanding string roughening -- where strong transversal functions lead to an effective restoration of translational symmetry at long distances -- is of central importance in the study of confinement. In this work, we show that string roughening emerges naturally in an analog Rydberg quantum simulator. We first map a triangular Rydberg array onto a (2+1)D U(1) LGT where plaquette terms appear as first-order processes. We study flux strings connecting static charges and demonstrate that, near a deconfined quantum critical point, the string exhibits logarithmic growth of its transverse width as the separation between charges increases, along with the universal L\"uscher correction to the confining potential -- both signatures of string roughening. Finally, we investigate the real-time dynamics of an initially rigid string, observing large fluctuations after quenching into the roughening regime, as well as string breaking via particle-pair creation. Our results indicate that rough strings can be realized in experimentally accessible quantum simulators, opening the door to detailed studies of how strong fluctuations influence string-breaking dynamics.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear quadrupole topological insulators</title>

Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) represent a family of topological phases that go beyond the conventional bulkboundary correspondence. d-dimensional n-th order HOTIs maintain (d - n)-dimensional gapless boundary states (in particular, zero-dimensional corner states in the case of d = n = 2). HOTIs of the Wannier type cam be extended into the nonlinear regime. Another prominent class of HOTIs, in the form of multipole insulators, was investigated only in the linear regime, due to the challenge of simultaneously achieving both negative hopping and strong nonlinearity. Here we propose the concept of nonlinear quadrupole topological insulators (NLQTIs) and report their experimental realization in an electric circuit lattice. Quench-initiated dynamics gives rise to nonlinear topological corner states and topologically trivial corner solitons, in weakly and strongly nonlinear regimes, respectively. Furthermore, we reveal the formation of two distinct types of bulk solitons, one existing in the middle finite gap under the action of weak nonlinearity, and another one found in the semi-infinite gap under strong nonlinearity. This work realizes another member of the nonlinear HOTI family, suggesting directions for exploring novel solitons across a broad range of topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Tachyonic and parametric instabilities in an extended bosonic Josephson junction</title>

Abstract: We study the dynamics and decay of quantum phase coherence for Bose-Einstein condensates in tunnel-coupled quantum wires. The two elongated Bose-Einstein condensates exhibit a wide variety of dynamic phenomena where quantum fluctuations can lead to a rapid loss of phase coherence. We investigate the phenomenon of self-trapping in the relative population imbalance of the two condensates, particularly $\pi$-trapped oscillations that occur when also the relative phase is trapped. Though this state appears stable in mean-field descriptions, the $\pi$-trapped state becomes dynamically unstable due to quantum fluctuations. Nonequilibrium instabilities result in the generation of pairs excited from the condensate to higher momentum modes. We identify tachyonic instabilities, which are associated with imaginary parts of the dispersion relation, and parametric resonance instabilities that are triggered by oscillations of the relative phase and populations. At early times, we compute the instability chart of the characteristic modes through a linearized analysis and identify the underlying physical process. At later times, the primary instabilities trigger secondary instabilities due to the build-up of non-linearities. We perform numerical simulations in the Truncated Wigner approximation in order to observe the dynamics also in this non-linear regime. Furthermore, we discuss realistic parameters for experimental realizations of the $\pi$-trapped state in ultracold atom setups.</description>

      <title>Impurity Self-Trapping in Lattice Bose systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We map out the global phase diagram of a single mobile impurity in the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, spanning the bath evolution from a compressible superfluid (SF) to an incompressible Mott insulator (MI) and the full range of impurity-bath coupling. Using sign-problem-free worm-algorithm quantum Monte Carlo, we identify two distinct self-trapping mechanisms that organize the entire diagram. In the compressible SF, increasing impurity-bath coupling $|U_{\mathrm{ib}}|$ drives an interaction-driven self-trapping crossover signaled by a collapse of the \emph{impurity} winding number: a light, extended polaron evolves continuously into a heavy polaron and ultimately into a self-trapped state -- a repulsive \emph{saturated bubble} or an attractive \emph{bound cluster} -- even while the bath remains globally superfluid, demonstrating self-trapping without any bath phase transition. By contrast, at fixed $U_{\mathrm{ib}}$ and upon tuning the bath across the SF-MI transition, self-trapping becomes compressibility controlled: the vanishing bath compressibility quenches polaronic dressing and collapses the impurity-centered density response, yielding a nearly free defect near criticality and, deep in the MI, a self-trapped vacancy- or particle-type defect bound to the impurity. In the incompressible regime, this proceeds via \emph{quantized defect formation}, manifested by discrete changes in the total bath occupation. Together, our results provide a unified microscopic picture of impurity self-trapping in correlated lattice bosons, governed by winding collapse in the SF and by compressibility loss and defect quantization across the SF-MI boundary.</description>

      <title>Mobile impurity coupled to correlated lattice bosons</title>

Abstract: We investigate how the coherence and spatial dressing of a single impurity evolve in the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model when the impurity couples attractively to the bath. Using large-scale, sign-problem-free worm-algorithm quantum Monte Carlo, we measure the impurity winding, bath superfluid response and compressibility, and impurity-bath density correlations. In a compressible superfluid bath ($U_{\mathrm{b}}/t=13.3$), strengthening attraction drives an interaction-controlled \emph{winding-collapse self-trapping crossover}: a mobile light polaron evolves continuously into a heavy polaron and ultimately into a bound cluster with vanishing winding, while the bath remains globally superfluid. In incompressible Mott-insulating baths, by contrast, extended density rearrangements are suppressed and the dressing cloud collapses; we compare the resulting short-range deformation patterns for both attractive and repulsive couplings. Across the SF-MI transition at fixed moderate attraction ($U_{\mathrm{ib}}/t=-8.0$), the impurity crosses over from a mobile polaron with an extended deformation cloud to a nearly free defect with minimal dressing in the Mott background; for this coupling it does not lock into a fully self-trapped defect even deep in the insulator. Together with our companion Letter [Impurity Self-Trapping in Lattice Bose systems] on repulsive couplings, these results provide a unified microscopic picture of impurity self-trapping in correlated lattice bosons, connecting interaction-driven winding collapse in the superfluid to compressibility-controlled undressing across the SF-MI transition.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Bound State Geometry in High-Dimensional Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is generally believed that the non-Hermitian effect (NHSE), due to its non-reciprocal nature, creates barriers for the appearance of impurity bound states. In this paper, we find that in two and higher dimensions, the presence of geometry-dependent skin effect eliminates this barrier such that even an infinitesimal impurity potential can confine bound states in this type of non-Hermitian systems. By examining bound states around Bloch saddle points, we find that non-Hermiticity can disrupt the isotropy of bound states, resulting in concave dumbbell-shaped bound states. Our work reveals a geometry transition of bound state between concavity and convexity in high-dimensional non-Hermitian systems, offering theoretical insights for the experimental manipulation of bound states.</description>

      <title>Hyperfine-resolved optical spectroscopy of ultracold $^{87}$Rb$^{133}$Cs molecules: the $\mathrm{b}\,^3\Pi_0$ metastable state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an ultracold gas of $^{87}$Rb$^{133}$Cs molecules, we perform hyperfine-resolved spectroscopy of transitions from the vibronic ground state to the lowest rovibrational states of the electronic state $\mathrm{b}\,^3\Pi_0$, as a function of magnetic field. These transitions are spin forbidden, resulting in narrow linewidths, and feature near-diagonal Franck-Condon factors. We develop a model of the hyperfine and Zeeman structure that includes coupling between the $0^+$ and $0^-$ components of $\mathrm{b}\,^3\Pi_0$. We fit the spectra to obtain rotational and hyperfine coupling constants. We measure transition dipole moments associated with specific transitions by directly observing Rabi oscillations as a function of a resonant laser pulse duration. Using resonant $\pi$ pulses, we prepare molecules in the electronically excited state and directly measure the spontaneous emission rate.</description>
