      <title>Absolute zeta functions for zeta functions of quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a connection between the quantum walk and the absolute mathematics. The quantum walk is a quantum counterpart of the classical random walk. We especially deal with the Grover walk on a graph. The Grover walk is a typical model of quantum walks. The time evolution of the Grover walk is obtained by a unitary matrix that is called the Grover matrix. We define the zeta function determined by the Grover matrix. First we prove that the zeta function of the Grover walk is the absolute automorphic form that constructs the absolute zeta function. Next we calculate the absolute zeta function defined by Grover walks on some graphs. The absolute zeta functions of the Grover walks are expressed by the multiple gamma function. Other types of absolute zeta functions are obtained as an analogue of the multiple gamma function.</description>

      <title>Weak ergodicity breaking from supersymmetry in a fermionic kinetically constrained model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersymmetry provides a natural playground for the construction of kinetically constrained lattice fermion models showing weak ergodicity breaking. The supersymmetric algebra naturally induces non-ergodic dynamics, as we illustrate here by introducing a fermionic equivalent of the PXP model with an adjustable chemical potential. This model is closely related to the $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supersymmetric $M_1$ model. Supersymmetry directly implies that the dynamics exhibit periodic revivals for specific initial states, including the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-ordered (every second site occupied) product state. These dynamics are reminiscent to those of the PXP model, a paradigmatic toy model in the field of quantum many-body scars. We draw a further parallel by uncovering quantum many-body scar-like eigenstates obeying sub-thermal entanglement scaling at energies given by (plus or minus) square roots of integers and relate these to special eigenstates of the $M_1$ model.</description>

      <title>Causality in relativistic quantum interactions without mediators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the interaction between two quantum systems in spacetime and we compare two possible models to describe it: 1) a fully quantum field theoretical (QFT) description of the coupling of two quantum systems mediated by a quantum field and 2) a quantum-controlled model (qc-model), which is an effectively relativistic direct-coupling in which the interaction of two quantum systems is not mediated by a field with local quantum degrees of freedom. We show that while there are regimes where the qc-model can approximate QFT arbitrarily well, it can suffer from retrocausal effects. We discuss in what regimes those retrocausal predictions of the qc-model are non-negligible and whether they can be used to argue that gravity induced entanglement experiments can reveal genuinely quantum aspects of the gravitational interaction or not.</description>

      <title>Easy better quantum process tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum process tomography (QPT), used to estimate the linear map that best describes a quantum operation, is usually performed using a priori assumptions about state preparation and measurement (SPAM), which yield a biased and inconsistent estimator. This estimate can be made more accurate and less biased by incorporating SPAM-calibration data. Unobservable properties of the SPAM operations introduce a small gauge freedom that can be regularized using the a priori SPAM. We give an explicit correction procedure for standard linear-inversion QPT and overcomplete linear-inversion QPT, and describe how to extend it to statistically principled estimators like maximum likelihood estimation.</description>

      <title>Estimation of the frequency-shift between two photons by time-sampling measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a sensing scheme for estimating the frequency difference of two non-entangled photons. The technique consists of time-resolving sampling measurements at the output of a beam splitter. With this protocol, the frequency shift between two photons can be estimated with the ultimate precision achievable in nature, overcoming the limits in precision and the range of detection of frequency-resolving detectors employed in standard direct measurements of the frequencies. The sensitivity can be increased by increasing the coherence time of the photons. We show that, already with $\sim 1000$ sampling measurements, the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound is saturated independently of the value of the difference in frequency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces the Schmidt quantum compressor, an innovative approach to quantum data compression that leverages the principles of Schmidt decomposition to encode quantum information efficiently. In contrast to traditional variational quantum autoencoders, which depend on stochastic optimization and face challenges such as shot noise, barren plateaus, and non-convex optimization landscapes, our deterministic method substantially reduces the complexity and computational overhead of quantum data compression. We evaluate the performance of the compressor through numerical experiments, demonstrating its ability to achieve high fidelity in quantum state reconstruction compared to variational quantum algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical utility of the Schmidt quantum compressor in one-class classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Polynomials and Perfect State Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this review paper is to discuss some applications of orthogonal polynomials in quantum information processing. The hope is to keep the paper self contained so that someone wanting a brief introduction to the theory of orthogonal polynomials and continuous time quantum walks on graphs may find it in one place. In particular, we focus on the associated Jacobi operators and discuss how these can be used to detect perfect state transfer. We also discuss how orthogonal polynomials have been used to give results which are analogous to those given by Karlin and McGregor when studying classical birth and death processes. Finally, we show how these ideas have been extended to quantum walks with more than nearest neighbor interactions using exceptional orthogonal polynomials. We also provide a (non-exhaustive) list of related open questions.</description>

      <title>A Versatile Chip-Scale Platform for High-Rate Entanglement Generation using an AlGaAs Microresonator Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated photonic microresonators have become an essential resource for generating photonic qubits for quantum information processing, entanglement distribution and networking, and quantum communications. The pair generation rate is enhanced by reducing the microresonator radius, but this comes at the cost of increasing the frequency mode spacing and reducing the quantum information spectral density. Here, we circumvent this rate-density trade-off in an AlGaAs-on-insulator photonic device by multiplexing an array of 20 small-radius microresonators each producing a 650-GHz-spaced comb of time-energy entangled-photon pairs. The resonators can be independently tuned via integrated thermo-optic heaters, enabling control of the mode spacing from degeneracy up to a full free spectral range. We demonstrate simultaneous pumping of five resonators with up to $50$ GHz relative comb offsets, where each resonator produces pairs exhibiting time-energy entanglement visibilities up to 95$\%$, coincidence-to-accidental ratios exceeding 5,000, and an on-chip pair rate up to 2.6 GHz/mW$^2$ per comb line -- more than 40 times improvement over prior work. As a demonstration, we generate frequency-bin qubits in a maximally entangled two-qubit Bell state with fidelity exceeding 87$\%$ (90$\%$ with background correction) and detected frequency-bin entanglement rates up to 7 kHz ($\sim 70$ MHz on-chip pair rate) using $\sim 250$ $\mu$W pump power. Multiplexing small-radius microresonators combines the key capabilities required for programmable and dense photonic qubit encoding while retaining high pair-generation rates, heralded single-photon purity, and entanglement fidelity.</description>

      <title>High-Rate Amplitude-Damping Shor Codes with Immunity to Collective Coherent Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a family of high-rate amplitude-damping (AD) Shor Codes, designed to effectively correct AD errors while maintaining immunity to collective coherent (CC) errors. The proposed $[[(w+1)(w+K), K]]$ AD codes can approximately correct up to $w$ AD errors, with flexible parameters $(w, K)$, and we provide a rigorous proof that these codes satisfy the approximate quantum error correction conditions. These AD Shor codes employ structured stabilizer measurement schemes, allowing efficient detection of AD errors using local operations and ancillary qubits. By concatenating these codes with the dual-rail code, we construct a class of CC-AD Shor codes that inherit the advantageous properties of the AD Shor codes.</description>

      <title>Spin-Symmetry Projected constrained Unrestricted Hartree-Fock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an electronic structure approach for spin symmetry breaking and restoration from the mean-field level. The spin-projected constrained-unrestricted Hartree-Fock (SPcUHF) method restores the broken spin symmetry inherent in spin-constrained-UHF determinants by employing a non-orthogonal Configuration Interaction (NOCI) projection method. This method includes all possible configurations in spin space compatible with a Clebsch-Gordon recoupling scheme in a NOCI calculation. The tunable one-pair-at-a-time characteristics of the symmetry-breaking process in c-UHF allow us to reduce the computational costs of full projection. SPcUHF is tested on 4-, 6-, and 8-electron systems that exhibit dominant static and/or dynamic correlations.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic field-cycling instrument for optical NMR hyperpolarization studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) offers an attractive approach to enhancing the sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Efficient, optically-generated electron polarization can be leveraged to operate across a broad range of temperatures and magnetic fields, making it particularly appealing for applications requiring high DNP efficiency or spatial resolution. While a large class of systems hold promise for optical DNP, many candidates display both variable electron polarizability and electron and nuclear T1 relaxation times as functions of magnetic field and temperature. This necessitates tools capable of studying DNP under diverse experimental conditions. To address this, we introduce a cryogenic field cycling instrument that facilitates optical DNP studies across a wide range of magnetic fields (10mT to 9.4T) and temperatures (10K to 300K). Continuous cryogen replenishment enables sustained, long-term operation. Additionally, the system supports the ability to manipulate and probe hyperpolarized nuclear spins via pulse sequences involving millions of RF pulses. We describe innovations in the device design and demonstrate its operation on a model system of 13C nuclear spins in diamond polarized through optically pumped nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers. We anticipate the use of the instrument for a broad range of optical DNP systems and studies.</description>

      <title>Hybrid of Gradient Descent And Semidefinite Programming for Certifying Multipartite Entanglement Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement is a crucial resource for a wide range of quantum information processing tasks, including quantum metrology, quantum computing, and quantum communication. The verification of multipartite entanglement, along with an understanding of its intrinsic structure, is of fundamental importance, both for the foundations of quantum mechanics and for the practical applications of quantum information technologies. Nonetheless, detecting entanglement structures remains a significant challenge, particularly for general states and large-scale quantum systems. To address this issue, we develop an efficient algorithm that combines semidefinite programming with a gradient descent method. This algorithm is designed to explore the entanglement structure by examining the inner polytope of the convex set that encompasses all states sharing the same entanglement properties. Through detailed examples, we demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to many of the best-known methods available today. Our method not only improves entanglement detection but also provides deeper insights into the complex structures of many-body quantum systems, which is essential for advancing quantum technologies</description>

      <title>An alternative non-unitary implementation for the quantum search algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe an alternative circuit implementation for the Grover search algorithm by replacing the amplitude amplification part with a non-unitary gate which can be implemented by using an additional ancilla register. We show that the final quantum state in the Grover search algorithm is the normalized marked quantum state in the Gram-Schmidt process. Therefore, one can try to generate this vector by using a non-unitary gate or an approximation of this non-unitary gate. Since we still use the marking part of the original algorithm, $U_{mark}$, the complexity of the algorithm is bounded by the complexity of this operator. We discuss how the implementation of the non-unitary may not be easy task and show the approximations to this operator e.g. through linear combination of unitary matrices or similar methods. Finally we discuss, how these approximations may change the complexity.</description>

      <title>Resource-efficient high-threshold fault-tolerant quantum computation with weak nonlinear optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computation with light, compared with other platforms, offers the unique benefit of natural high-speed operations at room temperature and large clock rate, but a big obstacle of photonics is the lack of strong nonlinearities which also makes loss-tolerant or generally fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) complicated in an all-optical setup. Typical current approaches to optical FTQC that aim at building suitable large multi-qubit cluster states by linearly fusing small elementary resource states would still demand either fairly expensive initial resources or rather low loss and error rates. Here we propose reintroducing weakly nonlinear operations, such as a weak cross-Kerr interaction, to achieve small initial resource cost and high error thresholds at the same time. More specifically, we propose an approach to generate a large-scale cluster state by hybridizing Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) and single-photon qubits. Our approach enables us to implement FTQC based on GKP squeezing of 7.4 and 8.4 dB and a photon loss rate of 1.0 and 5.0 %, respectively. In addition, our scheme has a reduced resource cost, i.e., number of physical qubits/photons per logical qubit or initial entanglement, compared to high-threshold FTQC with optical GKP qubits or fusion-based quantum computation with encoded single-photon-qubit states, respectively. Furthermore, our approach, when assuming very low photon loss, allows to employ GKP squeezing as little as 3.8 dB, which cannot be achieved by using GKP qubits alone.</description>

      <title>Large baseline quantum telescopes assisted by partially distinguishable photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement can be used to extend the baseline of telescope arrays in order to increase the spatial resolution. In one proposal by Marchese and Kok [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 160801 (2023)], identical single photons are shared between receivers, and interfere with a star photon. In this paper we consider two outstanding questions: i) what is the precise effect of the low photon occupancy of the mode associated with the starlight, and ii) what is the effect on the achievable resolution of imperfect indistinguishability (or partial distinguishability) between the ground and star photons. We find that the effect of distinguishability is relatively mild, but low photon occupancy of the optical mode of the starlight quickly deteriorates the sensitivity of the telescope for higher auxiliary photon numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous papers we have explained how a sequence of theorems by John von Neumann on infinite tensor products (ITP) can be understood as providing elements to support both sectorisation of the Hilbert space of large quantum systems, and a mechanism of self decoherence thereof. These two effects may help understanding the articulation of the classical and quantum realms. However, as they involve considering an infinite number of quantum degrees of freedom, legitimate concerns can be raised on their applicability. In this paper, we address explicitly the interface between both realms through the example of a simplified model of a photon polarisation measurement device. Guided by the fact that there is von Neumann sectorisation at infinity, and by the necessity of classical contexts to perform measurements, we show that this limit can be under control, and that although the full force of the sectorisation theorems requires taking the infinite limit, early signs of the macroscopic behaviour appear before infinity. In our example, this shows up in photodiodes through diverging electron avalanches that simultaneously make the system classical, localise it randomly in a macroscopic sector and provide a macroscopic signal. This lays the grounds for justifying the inclusion in quantum physics of the ITP formalism, which involves non-separable Hilbert spaces and potentially type-III von Neumann algebras. Such an approach could make sense of the quantum-classical transition as a primarily algebraic one.</description>

      <title>Quantum Approximate $k$-Minimum Finding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum $k$-minimum finding is a fundamental subroutine with numerous applications in combinatorial problems and machine learning. Previous approaches typically assume oracle access to exact function values, making it challenging to integrate this subroutine with other quantum algorithms. In this paper, we propose an (almost) optimal quantum $k$-minimum finding algorithm that works with approximate values for all $k \geq 1$, extending a result of van Apeldoorn, Gily\'{e}n, Gribling, and de Wolf (FOCS 2017) for $k=1$. As practical applications of this algorithm, we present efficient quantum algorithms for identifying the $k$ smallest expectation values among multiple observables and for determining the $k$ lowest ground state energies of a Hamiltonian with a known eigenbasis.</description>

      <title>Enhancement in temperature sensing of a reservoir by Kerr-nonlinear resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenge of developing high-precision temperature sensors is an important issue that has recently received a lot of attention. In this work, we introduce an estimation technique to precisely measure the temperature of a quantum reservoir using a Kerr-nonlinear resonator with drive. Thermalization in our suggested protocol is assessed using Uhlmann-Jozsa fidelity, and then we utilize quantum Fisher information to evaluate the metrological potential of our thermometry scheme. We observe that increasing the Kerr nonlinearity coefficient and driving amplitude significantly enhances precision in the temperature estimation. Furthermore, we also explore the underlying physical mechanisms by analyzing probe purity in the steady state and evaluating the performance of homodyne versus heterodyne detection methods. Our results demonstrate that neither of these Gaussian measurements is optimal; instead, optimal homodyne detection always surpasses heterodyne detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research targets near-term noisy quantum computer systems with few qubits. We present a method for verifying $n$-qubit stabilizer states generated by quantum computers under noise, leveraging~$n$ observables (i.e., circuit modifications) with multiple measurement shots per observable. The approach aims at ensuring reliable fidelity assessment by distinguishing correct states ($1-\delta$) from incorrect ones ($1-\epsilon$, where $\delta &lt; \epsilon$). This method balances practicality and accuracy, making it well-suited for near-term quantum computer systems.</description>

      <title>A Sharp Geometric Measure of Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their elegance and widespread use, the current Geometric Measures (GMs) of entanglement exhibit a significant limitation: they fail to effectively distinguish Local Unitary (LU) inequivalent states due to the inherent nature of their definition. We illustrate the impact of this limitation using the fidelity of the teleportation protocol as an example. To address this issue, we introduce the Sharp Geometric Measure (SGM) by modifying the standard definition of the Geometric Measure. We show that the closed-form expression of the SGM can be equivalently derived using the Riemannian structure of both the composite state space and the reduced density operator space. Furthermore, we define a measure of Genuine Multipartite Entanglement (GME) derived from the SGM, which we term GMS. We demonstrate that GMS resolves two key limitations of some existing GME measures, thereby establishing its utility and effectiveness in quantifying GME.</description>

      <title>Fundamental thresholds for computational and erasure errors via the coherent information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correcting (QEC) codes protect quantum information against environmental noise. Computational errors caused by the environment change the quantum state within the qubit subspace, whereas quantum erasures correspond to the loss of qubits at known positions. Correcting either type of error involves different correction mechanisms, which makes studying the interplay between erasure and computational errors particularly challenging. In this work, we propose a framework based on the coherent information (CI) of the mixed-state density operator associated to noisy QEC codes, for treating both types of errors together. We show how to rigorously derive different families of statistical mechanics mappings for generic stabilizer QEC codes in the presence of both types of errors. We observe that the erasure errors enter as a classical average over fully depolarizing channels. Further, we show that computing the CI for erasure errors only can be done efficiently upon sampling over erasure configurations. We then test our approach on the 2D toric and color codes and compute optimal thresholds for erasure errors only, finding a $50\%$ threshold for both codes. This strengthens the notion that both codes share the same optimal thresholds. When considering both computational and erasure errors, the CI of small-size codes yields thresholds in very accurate agreement with established results that have been obtained in the thermodynamic limit. We thereby further establish the CI as a practical tool for studying optimal thresholds under realistic noise and as a means for uncovering new relations between QEC codes and statistical physics models.</description>

      <title>Interface-sensitive microwave loss in superconducting tantalum films sputtered on c-plane sapphire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum coherence in superconducting circuits has increased steadily over the last decades as a result of a growing understanding of the various loss mechanisms. Recently, tantalum (Ta) emerged as a promising material to address microscopic sources of loss found on niobium (Nb) or aluminum (Al) surfaces. However, the effects of film and interface microstructure on low-temperature microwave loss are still not well understood. Here we present a systematic study of the structural and electrical properties of Ta and Nb films sputtered on c-plane sapphire at varying growth temperatures. As growth temperature is increased, our results show that the onset of epitaxial growth of $\alpha$-phase Ta correlates with lower Ta surface roughness, higher critical temperature, and higher residual resistivity ratio, but surprisingly also correlates with a significant increase in loss at microwave frequency. We determine that the source of loss is located at the Ta/sapphire interface and show that it can be fully mitigated by either growing a thin, epitaxial Nb inter-layer between the Ta film and the substrate or by intentionally treating the sapphire surface with \textit{in-situ} argon plasma before Ta growth. In addition to elucidating this interfacial microwave loss, this work provides adequate process details that should allow for the reproducible growth of low-loss Ta film across fabrication facilities.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Rabi Splitting and Quantum Fisher Information of a Non-Hermitian Qubit in a Single-Mode Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A natural extension of the non-Hermitian qubit is to place it in a single-mode cavity. This setup corresponds to the quantum Rabi model (QRM) with a purely imaginary bias on the qubit, exhibiting the parity-time ($\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$) symmetry. In this work, we first solve the $\mathcal{P} \mathcal{T}$ symmetric QRM using the Bogoliubov operator approach. We derive the transcendental function responsible for the exact solution, which can also be used to precisely identify exceptional points. The adiabatic approximation previously used can be easily formulated within this approach by considering transitions between the same manifolds in the space of Bogoliubov operators. By further considering transitions between the nearest-neighboring manifolds, we can analytically obtain more accurate eigen-solutions. Moreover, these simple corrections can capture the main features of the dynamics, where the adiabatic approximation fails. Furthermore, the rich characteristics of the vacuum Rabi splitting in the emission spectrum is predicted. The width of the peaks increases with the coupling strength and the imaginary biases, reflecting the nature of open quantum systems. Additionally, we identify a quantum criticality-enhanced effect by calculating the quantum Fisher information. Near the exceptional points, the quantum Fisher information in the $\mathcal{P} \mathcal{T}$ symmetric QRM is significantly higher than that of the non-Hermitian qubit component. This may open a new avenue for enhancing quantum sensitivity in non-Hermitian systems by incorporating coupling with an additional degree of freedom, enabling more precise parameter estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional encoding for quantum key distribution (QKD) enables increased achievable key rates and robustness as compared to the standard qubit-based systems. However, experimental implementations of such systems are more complicated, expensive, and require complex security analysis. In this work we present a proof of principle high-dimensional time-phase BB84 QKD experiment using only one single-photon detector per measurement basis. We employ the temporal Talbot effect to detect QKD symbols in the control basis, and show experimentally-obtained values for the two-dimensional and four-dimensional case. We present a comparison of the secret key rates obtained from two different security proofs to display security issues stemming from asymmetric detection efficiencies in the two bases. Our results contribute to the discussion of the benefits of high-dimensional encoding and highlight the impact of security analysis on the achievable QKD performance.</description>

      <title>Better product formulas for quantum phase estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum phase estimation requires simulating the evolution of the Hamiltonian, for which product formulas are attractive due to their smaller qubit cost and ease of implementation. However, the estimation of the error incurred by product formulas is usually pessimistic and task-agnostic, which poses problems for assessing their performance in practice for problems of interest. In this work, we study the error of product formulas for the specific task of quantum energy estimation. To this end, we employ the theory of Trotter error with a Magnus-based expansion of the effectively simulated Hamiltonian. The result is a generalization of previous energy estimation error analysis of gapped eigenstates to arbitrary order product formulas. As an application, we discover a 9-term second-order product formula with an energy estimation error that is quadratically better than Trotter-Suzuki. Furthermore, by leveraging recent work on low-energy dynamics of product formulas, we provide tighter bounds for energy estimation error in the low-energy subspace. We show that for Hamiltonians with some locality and positivity properties, the cost can achieve up to a quadratic asymptotic speedup in terms of the target error.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Dipolar Interactions in Dense Spin Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense spin ensembles in solids present a natural platform for studying quantum many-body dynamics. Multiple-pulse coherent control can be used to manipulate the magnetic dipolar interaction between the spins to engineer their dynamics. Here, we investigate the performance of a series of well-known pulse sequences that aim to suppress inter-spin dipolar couplings. We use a combination of numerical simulations and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments on adamantane to evaluate and compare sequence performance. We study the role of sequence parameters like inter-pulse delays and resonance offsets. Disagreements between experiments and theory are typically explained by the presence of control errors and experimental non-idealities. The simulations allow us to explore the influence of factors such as finite pulse widths, rotation errors, and phase transient errors. We also investigate the role of local disorder and establish that it is, perhaps unsurprisingly, a distinguishing factor in the decoupling efficiency of spectroscopic sequences (that preserve Hamiltonian terms proportional to $S_z$) and time-suspension sequences (which refocus all terms in the internal Hamiltonian). We discuss our findings in the context of previously known analytical results from Average Hamiltonian Theory. Finally, we explore the ability of time-suspension sequences to protect multi-spin correlations in the system.</description>

      <title>A Parameter-Efficient Quantum Anomaly Detection Method on a Superconducting Quantum Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning has gained attention for its potential to address computational challenges. However, whether those algorithms can effectively solve practical problems and outperform their classical counterparts, especially on current quantum hardware, remains a critical question. In this work, we propose a novel quantum machine learning method, called Quantum Support Vector Data Description (QSVDD), for practical anomaly detection, which aims to achieve both parameter efficiency and superior accuracy compared to classical models. Emulation results indicate that QSVDD demonstrates favourable recognition capabilities compared to classical baselines, achieving an average accuracy of over 90% on benchmarks with significantly fewer trainable parameters. Theoretical analysis confirms that QSVDD has a comparable expressivity to classical counterparts while requiring only a fraction of the parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate the first implementation of a quantum machine learning method for anomaly detection on a superconducting quantum processor. Specifically, we achieve an accuracy of over 80% with only 16 parameters on the device, providing initial evidence of QSVDD's practical viability in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era and highlighting its significant reduction in parameter requirements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intra-system entanglement occurs between non-separable modes within the same system. For optical systems, the various degrees of freedom of light represent different modes, and the potential use of light to create higher dimensional classical entangle states offers a promising potential to drive new technological developments. In this work, we present experimental results demonstrating the orthogonality between transverse orbital angular momentum (t-OAM) of different spatiotemporal topological charges, a previously unverified property of t-OAM. Based on those results, we developed methods to create and characterize a novel family of t-OAM and polarization entangled spatiotemporal structured light. We further provide theoretical analysis to support our study of the entanglement between those modes. By demonstrating the feasibility of leveraging t-OAM as a new family of modes for classical entanglement, our work represents a new advancement towards higher dimensional classical entanglement strategies.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations and optimal control in a Floquet Quantum Thermal Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Full Counting Statistics to study fluctuations and optimal control in a three-terminal Floquet quantum thermal transistor. We model the setup using three qubits (termed as the emitter, collector and base) coupled to three thermal baths. As shown in Phys. Rev. E 106, 024110 (2022), one can achieve significant change in the emitter and collector currents through a small change in the base current, thereby achieving a thermal transistor operation. Using sinusoidal and pi-flip modulations of the base qubit frequency, we show that the variance of the base current is much less compared to those of the emitter and collector currents, while the opposite is true in case of the Fano factor. We then apply optimal control through the Chopped Random Basis optimization protocol, in order to significantly enhance the amplification obtained in the transistor. In contrast, a reduction in the Fano factor of the setup through optimal control is associated with a large base current, thereby suggesting a trade-off between precision and base current. We expect our results will be relevant for developing heat modulation devices in near-term quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Hermitian Kirkwood-Dirac real operators for discrete Fourier transformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) distribution is a quantum state representation that relies on two chosen fixed orthonormal bases, or alternatively, on the transition matrix of these two bases. In recent years, it has been discovered that the KD distribution has numerous applications in quantum information science. The presence of negative or nonreal KD distributions may indicate certain quantum features or advantages. If the KD distribution of a quantum state consists solely of positive or zero elements, the state is called a KD positive state. Consequently, a crucial inquiry arises regarding the determination of whether a quantum state is KD positive when subjected to various physically relevant transition matrices. When the transition matrix is discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix of dimension $p$ [\href{https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0164672} {J. Math. Phys. 65, 072201 (2024)}] or $p^{2}$ [\href{https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1751-8121/ad819a} {J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57 435303 (2024)}] with $p$ being prime, it is proved that any KD positive state can be expressed as a convex combination of pure KD positive states. In this work, we prove that when the transition matrix is the DFT matrix of any finite dimension, any KD positive state can be expressed as a real linear combination of pure KD positive states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The certification of randomness is essential for both fundamental science and information technologies. Unlike traditional random number generators, randomness obtained from nonlocal correlations is fundamentally guaranteed to be unpredictable. However, it is also highly susceptible to noise. Here, we show that extending the conventional bipartite Bell scenario to hybrid quantum networks -- which incorporate both quantum channels and entanglement sources -- enhances the robustness of certifiable randomness. Our protocol even enables randomness to be certified from Bell-local states, broadening the range of quantum states useful for this task. Through both theoretical analysis and experimental validation in a photonic network, we demonstrate enhanced performance and improved noise resilience.</description>

      <title>Relaxation of A Thermally Bathed Harmonic Oscillator: A Study Based on the Group-theoretical Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum dynamics of a damped harmonic oscillator has been extensively studied since the sixties of the last century. Here, with a distinct tool termed the ``group-theoretical characteristic function" (GCF), we investigate analytically how a harmonic oscillator immersed in a thermal environment would relax to its equilibrium state. We assume that the oscillator is at a pure state initially and its evolution is governed by a well-known quantum-optical master equation. By taking advantage of the GCF, the master equation can be transformed into a first-order linear partial differential equation that allows us to write down its solution explicitly. Based on the solution, it is found that, in clear contrast with the monotonic relaxation process of its classical counterpart, the quantum oscillator may demonstrate some intriguing nonmonotonic relaxation characteristics. In particular, when the initial state is a Gaussian state (i.e., a squeezed coherent state), it is found that there is a critical value of the environmental temperature, below which the entropy will first increase to reach its maximum value, then turn down and converge to its equilibrium value from above. For the temperature higher than the critical value, the entropy will converge to its equilibrium value from below monotonically. However, when the initial state is a Fock state, it is found that there is a new phase additional to the previous case, where the time curve of entropy features two extreme points. Namely, the entropy will increase to reach its maximum first, then turn down to reach its minimum, from where it begins to increase and converges to the equilibrium value eventually. Other related issues are discussed as well.</description>

      <title>Generalized Teleportation Fidelity and Singlet Fraction and their Relation for (In)-distinguishable Particles and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum teleportation efficiently transfers quantum information between distant locations by utilizing a pre-established composite system. Assessing the effectiveness of teleportation hinges on its fidelity, representing the similarity between input and output states. This fidelity, in turn, relies on a singlet fraction, quantifying the resemblance of the composite system to maximally entangled states. The relation between teleportation fidelity and singlet fraction given by [Horodecki \textit{et al}., Phy. Rev. A \textbf{60}, 1888 (1999)] does not hold for distinguishable particles with multiple degrees of freedom or indistinguishable particles with single or multiple degrees of freedom. In this paper, we propose generalized expressions for teleportation fidelity and singlet fraction and derive their relations, applicable for both distinguishable and indistinguishable particles with single or multiple degrees of freedom. We derive an upper bound for the generalized singlet fraction for distinguishable particles using the monogamy of singlet fraction by [Kay \textit{et al.} Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{103}, 050501 (2009)]. We also show how our relation helps to characterize different types of composite states in terms of their distinguishability, separability, presence of maximally entangled structure, and the number of degrees of freedom. We complement our theory with two practical illustrations. First, we demonstrate two counter-intuitive values of generalized singlet fraction using our optical circuit and the circuit of [Li \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{120}, 050404 (2018)]. Finally, we show that using an additional degree of freedom as an ancilla instead of a particle can be advantageous in quantum cryptographic protocols.</description>

      <title>Reduction-induced the Variation of Partial Von Neumann Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether from theoretical research or from practical research and applications, bipartite mixed-state quantum entanglement (QE) and its measures hold significant theoretical and practical importance. Widely recognized measures such as Entanglement of Formation and Relative Entropy of Entanglement, involve quantifying the minimum QE and reflect the inherently complex nature of their computation. In contrast, Concurrence is applicable only to 2*2 quantum systems, while Negativity is limited to 2*2 and 2*3 quantum systems. In this context, we propose a novel method termed Reduction-induced the Variation of Partial Von Neumann Entropy (RIVPVNE) to quantify QE in bipartite mixed states. The computational complexity associated with this method is minimal. Moreover, it has a wide range of applicability. The intuitive and clear physical representation, combined with straightforward computation, facilitates the exploration of its specific potential applications. Subsequently, we employ this method to investigate the organization and structure of some well-known QEs, analyzing its characteristics through both its physical implication and mathematical structure in comparison to the existing measures for bipartite QE measures, such as Partial Von Neumann Entropy, Concurrence, Negativity, Entanglement of Formation and Relative Entropy of Entanglement.</description>

      <title>Shadow-Frugal Expectation-Value-Sampling Variational Quantum Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expectation Value Samplers (EVSs) are quantum-computer-based generative models that can learn high-dimensional continuous distributions by measuring the expectation values of parameterized quantum circuits regarding selected observables. However, such models may require unaffordable quantum resources for good performance. This work explores the impact of observable choices on the EVS. We introduce an Observable-Tunable Expectation Value Sampler (OT-EVS). The resulting model provides enhanced expressivity as compared to standard EVS. By restricting our selectable observables, it is possible to use the classical shadow measurement scheme to reduce the sample complexity of our algorithm. We further propose an adversarial training method adapted to the needs of OT-EVS. This training prioritizes classical updates of observables, minimizing the more costly updates of quantum circuit parameters. Numerical experiments confirm our model's expressivity and sample efficiency advantages compared to previous designs, using an original simulation technique for correlated shot noise. We envision our proposal to encourage the exploration of continuous generative models running with few quantum resources.</description>

      <title>The Sound of Decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore an unconventional bridge between quantum mechanical density matrices and sound by mapping elements of the density matrix and their phases to auditory signals, thus introducing a framework for Open Quantum Sonification. Employing the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian operator as a basis, each quantum state contributes a frequency proportional to its energy level. The off-diagonal terms, which encode coherence and phase relationships between energy levels, are rendered as binaural signals presented separately to the left and right ears. We illustrate this method within the context of open quantum system dynamics governed by Lindblad equations, presenting first an example of quantum Brownian motion of a particle in a thermal bath, and second, a recoherence process induced by boundary driving that results in spin-helix states. This document serves as a companion to the corresponding audio visual simulations of these models available on the YouTube channel Open Quantum Sonification with the Python Codes on GitHub. The auditory analogy presented here provides an intuitive and experiential means of describing quantum phenomena such as tunnelling, thermalisation, decoherence, and recoherence.</description>

      <title>Fast charging of an Ising spin pair quantum battery using optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing the stored energy for a given charging duration in a quantum battery composed of a pair of spins-$1/2$ with Ising coupling starting from the spin-down state, using bounded transverse field control. We map this problem to an optimal control problem on a single qubit and using optimal control theory we show that, although a single bang pulse can quickly achieve considerable charging levels for relatively large upper control bounds, higher levels of stored energy including complete charging are accomplished by a bang-singular-bang pulse-sequence, where the intermediate singular pulse is an Off pulse. If the control is restricted between zero and a maximum value, the initial and final bang pulses attain the maximum bound but have different durations, while if it is restricted between symmetric negative and positive boundaries, the bang pulses have the same duration but opposite boundary values. For both cases we provide transcendental equations from which the durations of the individual pulses in the optimal pulse-sequence can be calculated. For the case of full charging we surprisingly find that the three ``switching" functions for the equivalent qubit problem become zero while the adjoint ket does not, in consistency with optimal control theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum Logic Locking (QLL): Safeguarding Intellectual Property for Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, quantum computing has demonstrated superior efficiency to classical computing. In quantum computing, quantum circuits that implement specific quantum functions are crucial for generating correct solutions. Therefore, quantum circuit compilers, which decompose high-level gates into the hardware's native gates and optimize the circuit serve as the bridge from the quantum software stack to the hardware machines. However, untrusted quantum compilers risk stealing original quantum designs (quantum circuits), leading to the theft of sensitive intellectual property (IP). In classical computing, logic locking is a pivotal technique for securing integrated circuits (ICs) against reverse engineering and IP piracy. This technique involves inserting a keyed value into the circuit, ensuring the correct output is achieved only with the correct key. To address similar issues in quantum circuit protection, we propose a method called quantum logic locking, which involves inserting controlled gates to control the function of the quantum circuit. We have expanded on previous work by extending the 1-bit logic key method to a multi-bit key approach, allowing for the use of diverse quantum gates. We have demonstrated the practicality of our method through experiments on a set of benchmark quantum circuits. The effectiveness of quantum logic locking was measured by assessing the divergence distance from the original circuit. Our results demonstrate that quantum logic locking effectively conceals the function of the original quantum circuit, with an average fidelity degradation of less than 1%.</description>

      <title>Empirical Coordination of Separable Quantum Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of empirical coordination for quantum correlations. Quantum mechanics enables the calculation of probabilities for experimental outcomes, emphasizing statistical averages rather than detailed descriptions of individual events. Empirical coordination is thus a natural framework for quantum systems. Focusing on the cascade network, the optimal coordination rates are established, indicating the minimal resources required to simulate on average a quantum state. As we consider a network with classical communication links, superposition cannot be maintained, hence the quantum correlations are separable (i.e., a convex combination of product states). This precludes entanglement. Providing the users with shared randomness, before communication begins, does not affect the optimal rates for empirical coordination. We begin with a rate characterization for a basic two-node network, and then generalize to a cascade network. The special case of a network with an isolated node is considered as well. The results can be further generalized to other networks as our analysis includes a generic achievability scheme. The optimal rate formula involves optimization over a collection of state extensions. This is a unique feature of the quantum setting, as the classical parallel does not include optimization. As demonstrated through examples, the performance depends heavily on the choice of decomposition. We further discuss the consequences of our results for quantum cooperative games.</description>

      <title>Dynamic T-decomposition for classical simulation of quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that a quantum circuit may be simulated with classical hardware via stabilizer state (T-)decomposition in $O(2^{\alpha t})$ time, given $t$ non-Clifford gates and a decomposition efficiency $\alpha$. The past years have seen a number of papers presenting new decompositions of lower $\alpha$ to reduce this runtime and enable simulation of ever larger circuits. More recently, it has been demonstrated that well placed applications of apparently weaker (higher $\alpha$) decompositions can in fact result in better overall efficiency when paired with the circuit simplification strategies of ZX-calculus.
  In this work, we take the most generalized T-decomposition (namely vertex cutting), which achieves a poor efficiency of $\alpha=1$, and identify common structures to which applying this can, after simplification via ZX-calculus rewriting, yield very strong effective efficiencies $\alpha_{\text{eff}}\ll1$. By taking into account this broader scope of the ZX-diagram and incorporating the simplification facilitated by the well-motivated cuts, we derive a handful of efficient T-decompositions whose applicabilities are relatively frequent. In benchmarking these new 'dynamic' decompositions against the existing alternatives, we observe a significant reduction in overall $\alpha$ and hence overall runtime for classical simulation, particularly for certain common circuit classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computing is a promising technology to solve linear partial differential equations that are classically demanding to integrate. It is still challenging to solve non-linear equations in fluid dynamics, such as the Burgers equation, using quantum computers. We propose a novel quantum algorithm to solve the Burgers equation. With the Cole-Hopf transformation that maps the fluid velocity field $u$ to a new field $\psi$, we apply a sequence of quantum gates to solve the resulting linear equation and obtain the quantum state $\vert\psi\rangle$ that encodes the solution $\psi$. We also propose an efficient way to extract stochastic properties of $u$, namely the multi-point functions of $u$, from the quantum state of $\vert\psi\rangle$. Our algorithm offers an exponential advantage over the classical finite difference method in terms of the number of spatial grids when a perturbativity condition in the information-extracting step is met.</description>

      <title>Classical simulability of Clifford+T circuits with Clifford-augmented matrix product states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generic quantum circuits typically require exponential resources for classical simulation, yet understanding the limits of classical simulability remains a fundamental question. In this work, we investigate the classical simulability of $N$-qubit Clifford circuits doped with $t$ number of $T$-gates by converting the circuits into Clifford-augmented matrix product states (CAMPS). We develop a simple disentangling algorithm to reduce the entanglement of the MPS component in CAMPS using control-Pauli gates, which replaces the standard algorithm relying on heuristic optimization when $t\lesssim N$, ensuring that the entanglement of the MPS component of CAMPS does not increase for $N$ specific $T$-gates. Using a simplified model, we explore in what cases these $N$ $T$-gates happen sufficiently early in the circuit to make classical simulatability of $t$-doped circuits out to $t=N$ possible. We give evidence that in one-dimension where the $T$-gates are uniformly distributed over the qubits and in higher spatial dimensions where the $T$-gates are deep enough we generically expect polynomial or quasi-polynomial simulations when $t \leq N$. We further explore the representability of CAMPS in the regime of $t&gt;N$, uncovering a non-trivial dependence of the MPS entanglement on the distribution of $T$-gates. While it is polynomially efficient to evaluate the expectation of Pauli observable or the quantum magic in CAMPS, we propose algorithms for sampling, probability and amplitude estimation of bitstrings, and evaluation of entanglement R\'enyi entropy from CAMPS, which, though still having exponential complexity, improve efficiency over the standard MPS simulations. This work establishes a versatile framework based on CAMPS for understanding classical simulatability of $t$-doped circuits and exploring the interplay between quantum entanglement and quantum magic on quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: Previous work [Physical Review Letters 114, 213601 (2015)] has shown that thermal light with a blackbody spectrum cannot be decomposed as a mixture of independent localized pulses. We find that thermal light with a flat spectrum, which can occur when spectral filtering is applied, can be decomposed into a direct product of independent localized pulses. Furthermore, we show in the weak-source limit that the first non-vacuum term of thermal light with a flat spectrum is a mixture of independent localized pulses. We quantify the deviation from independent pulses when the spectrum is not flat.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation for Dynamical Transition Rates in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating transition rates in open quantum systems is a significant challenge in physics and chemistry due to the exponential increase in computational resources required with the system sizes. Addressing this issue, we introduce a novel and efficient quantum simulation method to compute dynamical transition rates in Markovian open quantum systems. This method reformulates the transition rate expression, represented as the time derivatives of correlation functions, into directly measurable quantities in parametrised mixed-state quantum circuits. This approach allows us to estimate the transition rate more accurately without requiring the computation of the correlation function in a dynamical open quantum system. To validate our approach, we perform quantum simulations experimentally on IBMQ quantum processors for a decohering spin-1/2 model, compared with analytic solutions and quantum numerical simulation. Motivated by quantum chemistry-related applications, we examine our method in one-dimensional Caldeira-Leggett quantum Brownian motion model. Through theoretical and numerical analyses, we address the scalability of our scheme and the promise of significant computational advantages over its classical counterpart. Thus, our new approach holds the potential to surpass the bottlenecks of current quantum chemical research, particularly in accurately predicting molecular reaction rates and designing novel materials on the current and the near-term realisable quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Local unitarty equivalence and entanglement by Bargmann invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of quantum states frequently examines the connection between non-local effects in quantum mechanics and quantities that remain unchanged under local unitary transformations. Among these concepts, local unitary equivalence, defined through local unitary transformations, holds significant importance in quantum state classification and resource theory. This paper focuses on the fundamental issue of local unitary equivalence for multipartite quantum states within quantum information theory, with the aim of identifying the comprehensive set of invariants that define their local unitary orbits. These invariants are crucial for deriving polynomial invariants and describing physical properties that remain invariant under local unitary transformations. Specifically, the research delves into the characterization of local unitary equivalence and the detection of entanglement using local unitary Bargmann invariants, utilizing the generalized Schur-Weyl duality to analyze tensor product symmetries. Taking the two-qubit system as an example, our study demonstrates the measurability of the invariants that determine local unitary equivalence and establishes a relationship between Makhlin's fundamental invariants (a complete set of 18 local unitary invariants for two-qubit states) and local unitary Bargmann invariants. These Bargmann invariants are related to the trace of density operator products with marginal states and can be measured through a cycle test, an extension of the SWAP test.These findings offer a practical criterion for entanglement detection based on local unitary Bargmann invariants, contributing to the advancement of quantum information theory and its applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for Discrete Log Require Precise Rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Cai showed that Shor's quantum factoring algorithm fails to factor large integers when the algorithm's quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is corrupted by a vanishing level of random noise on the QFT's precise controlled rotation gates. We show that under the same error model, Shor's quantum discrete log algorithm, and its various modifications, fail to compute discrete logs modulo P for a positive density of primes P and a similarly vanishing level of noise. We also show that the same noise level causes Shor's algorithm to fail with probability 1-o(1) to compute discrete logs modulo P for randomly selected primes P.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Super-Krylov Method for Ground State Energy Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Krylov quantum diagonalization methods for ground state energy estimation have emerged as a compelling use case for quantum computers. However, many existing methods rely on subroutines, in particular the Hadamard test, that are challenging on near-term quantum hardware. Motivated by this problem, we present a quantum Krylov method that uses only time evolutions and recovery probabilities, making it well adapted for current quantum computers. This is supplemented with a classical post-processing derivative estimation algorithm. The method ultimately estimates the eigenvalues of the commutator super-operator $X\to[H,X]$, so we declare it a super-Krylov method. We propose applying this method to estimate the ground-state energy of two classes of Hamiltonians: where either the highest energy is easily computable, or where the lowest and highest energies have the same absolute value. We prove that the resulting ground energy estimate converges in the noise-free regime and provide a classical numerical demonstration of the method in the presence of noise.</description>

      <title>Quantum Approximate Optimisation Applied to Graph Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises solutions to classically difficult and new-found problems through controlling the subtleties of quantum computing. The Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) is a recently proposed quantum algorithm designed to tackle difficult combinatorial optimisation problems utilising both quantum and classical computation. The hybrid nature, generality and typically low gate-depth make it a strong candidate for near-term implementation in quantum computing. Finding the practical limits of the algorithm is currently an open problem. Until now, no tools to facilitate the design and validation of probabilistic quantum optimisation algorithms such as the QAOA on a non-trivial scale exist. Graph similarity is a long standing classically difficult problem withstanding decades of research from academia and industry. Determining the maximal edge overlap between all possible node label permutations is an NP-Complete task and provides an apt measure of graph similarity. We introduce a novel quantum optimisation simulation package facilitating investigation of all constituent components of the QAOA from desktop to cluster scale using graph similarity as an example. Our simulation provides flexibility and performance. We investigate eight classical optimisation methods each at six levels of decomposition. Moreover an encoding for permutation based problems such as graph similarity through edge overlap to the QAOA allows for significant quantum memory savings at the cost of additional operations. This compromise extends into the classical portion of the algorithm as the inclusion of infeasible solutions creates a challenging cost-function landscape. We present performance analysis of our simulation and of the QAOA setting a precedent for investigating and validating numerous other difficult problems to the QAOA as we move towards realising practical quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Postmeasurement information and nonlocality of quantum state discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum state discrimination, nonlocality arises when the optimal state discrimination cannot be realized by local operations and classical communication. Recently, it has been found that the postmeasurement information about the subensemble containing the prepared state can annihilate or create nonlocality in quantum state discrimination. Here, we show that annihilation or creation of nonlocality in quantum state discrimination can depend on the choice of subensembles provided by postmeasurement information. We establish sufficient conditions that annihilating or creating nonlocality depends on the choice of subensembles provided by postmeasurement information. We further provide bipartite quantum state ensembles satisfying these conditions to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity-Adapted Closed-Loop Optimization for High-Fidelity Controlled-Z Gates in Superconducting Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving fast and high-fidelity qubit operations is crucial for unlocking the potential of quantum computers. In particular, reaching low gate errors in two-qubit gates has been a long-standing challenge in the field of superconducting qubits due to their typically long duration relative to coherence times. To realize fast gates, we utilize the hybridization between fixed-frequency superconducting qubits with a strongly interacting coupler mode that is tunable in frequency. To reduce population leakage during required adiabatic passages through avoided level crossings, we employ a sensitivity-adaptive closed-loop optimization method to design complex pulse shapes. We compare the performance of Gaussian-square, Fourier-series, and piecewise-constant-slope (PiCoS) pulse parametrizations and are able to reach 99.9 % controlled-Z gate fidelity using a 64 ns long Fourier-series pulse defined by only seven parameters. These high-fidelity values are achieved by analyzing the optimized pulse shapes to identify and systematically mitigate signal-line distortions in the experiment. To improve the convergence speed of the optimization we implement an adaptive cost function, which continuously maximizes the sensitivity. The demonstrated method can be used for tune-up and recalibration of superconducting quantum processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proposed experiments for obtaining empirical evidence for a quantum description of gravity in a table-top setting focus on detecting quantum information signatures, such as entanglement or non-Gaussianity production, in gravitationally interacting quantum systems. Here, we explore an alternative approach where the quantization of gravity could be inferred through measurements of macroscopic, thermodynamical quantities, without the need for addressability of individual quantum systems. To demonstrate the idea, we take as a case study a gravitationally self-interacting Bose gas, and consider its heat capacity. We find a clear-cut distinction between the predictions of a classical gravitational interaction and a quantum gravitational interaction in the heat capacity of the Bose gas.</description>

      <title>Distribution-Adaptive Dynamic Shot Optimization for Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have attracted remarkable interest over the past few years because of their potential computational advantages on near-term quantum devices. They leverage a hybrid approach that integrates classical and quantum computing resources to solve high-dimensional problems that are challenging for classical approaches alone. In the training process of variational circuits, constructing an accurate probability distribution for each epoch is not always necessary, creating opportunities to reduce computational costs through shot reduction. However, existing shot-allocation methods that capitalize on this potential often lack adaptive feedback or are tied to specific classical optimizers, which limits their applicability to common VQAs and broader optimization techniques. Our observations indicate that the information entropy of a quantum circuit's output distribution exhibits an approximately exponential relationship with the number of shots needed to achieve a target Hellinger distance. In this work, we propose a distribution-adaptive dynamic shot (DDS) framework that efficiently adjusts the number of shots per iteration in VQAs using the entropy distribution from the prior training epoch. Our results demonstrate that the DDS framework sustains inference accuracy while achieving a ~50% reduction in average shot count compared to fixed-shot training, and ~60% higher accuracy than recently proposed tiered shot allocation methods. Furthermore, in noisy simulations that reflect the error rates of actual IBM quantum systems, DDS achieves approximately a ~30% reduction in the total number of shots compared to the fixed-shot method with minimal degradation in accuracy, and offers about ~70% higher computational accuracy than tiered shot allocation methods.</description>

      <title>Fast generation of entanglement between coupled spins using optimization and deep learning methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled spins form composite quantum systems which play an important role in many quantum technology applications, with an essential task often being the efficient generation of entanglement between two constituent qubits. The simplest such system is a pair of spins-$1/2$ coupled with Ising interaction, and in previous works various quantum control methods such as adiabatic processes, shortcuts to adiabaticity and optimal control have been employed to quickly generate there one of the maximally entangled Bell states. In this study, we use machine learning and optimization methods to produce maximally entangled states in minimum time, with the Rabi frequency and the detuning used as bounded control functions. We do not target a specific maximally entangled state, like the preceding studies, but rather find the controls which maximize the concurrence, leading thus automatically the system to the closest such state in shorter time. By increasing the bounds of the control functions we observe that the corresponding optimally selected maximally entangled state also changes and the necessary time to reach it is reduced. The present work demonstrates also that machine learning and optimization offer efficient and flexible techniques for the fast generation of entanglement in coupled spin systems, and we plan to extent it to systems involving more spins, for example spin chains.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the work statistics of an open quantum system using a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the experimental measurement of the work statistics of a genuinely open quantum system using a quantum computer. Such measurement has remained elusive thus far due to the inherent difficulty in measuring the total energy change of a system-bath compound (which is the work) in the open quantum system scenario. We overcome this difficulty by extending the interferometric scheme, originally conceived for closed systems, to the open system case and implement it on a superconducting quantum computer, taking advantage of the relatively high levels of noise on current quantum hardware to realize an open quantum system. We demonstrate that the method can be used as a diagnostic tool to probe physical properties of the system-bath compound, such as its temperature and specific transitions frequencies in its spectrum. Our experiments corroborate that the interferometric scheme is a promising tool to achieve the long-sought experimental validation of the Jarzynski equality for arbitrary open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Advantages of density in tensor network geometries for gradient based training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor networks are a very powerful data structure tool originating from quantum system simulations. In recent years, they have seen increased use in machine learning, mostly in trainings with gradient-based techniques, due to their flexibility and performance exploiting hardware acceleration. As ans\"atze, tensor networks can be used with flexible geometries, and it is known that for highly regular ones their dimensionality has a large impact in performance and representation power. For heterogeneous structures, however, these effects are not completely characterized. In this article, we train tensor networks with different geometries to encode a random quantum state, and see that densely connected structures achieve better infidelities than more sparse structures, with higher success rates and less time. Additionally, we give some general insight on how to improve memory requirements on these sparse structures and its impact on the trainings. Finally, as we use HPC resources for the calculations, we discuss the requirements for this approach and showcase performance improvements with GPU acceleration on a last-generation supercomputer.</description>

      <title>Disorder-averaged Qudit Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how physical systems are influenced by disorder is a fundamental challenge in quantum science. Addressing its effects often involves numerical averaging over a large number of samples, and it is not always easy to gain an analytical handle on exploring the effect of disorder. In this work, we derive exact solutions for disorder-averaged dynamics generated by any Hamiltonian that is a periodic matrix (potentially with non-trivial base, a property also called ($p,q$)-potency). Notably, this approach is independent of the initial state, exact for arbitrary evolution times, and it holds for Hermitian as well as non-Hermitian systems. The ensemble behavior resembles that of an open quantum system, whose decoherence function or rates are determined by the disorder distribution and the periodicity of the Hamiltonian. Depending on the underlying distribution, the dynamics can display non-Markovian characteristics detectable through non-Markovian witnesses. We illustrate the scheme for qubit and qudit systems described by (products of) spin $1/2$, spin $1$, and clock operators. Our methodology offers a framework to leverage disorder-averaged exact dynamics for a range of applications in quantum-information processing and beyond.</description>

      <title>A 3-dimensional scanning trapped-ion probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-atom quantum sensors offer high spatial resolution and high sensitivity to electric and magnetic fields. Among them, trapped ions offer exceptional performance in sensing electric fields, which has been used in particular to probe these in the proximity of metallic surfaces. However, the flexibility of previous work was limited by the use of radio-frequency trapping fields, which has restricted spatial scanning to linear translations, and calls into question whether observed phenomena are connected to the presence of the radio-frequency fields. Here, using a Penning trap instead, we demonstrate a single ion probe which offers three-dimensional position scanning at distances between $50$ $\mu\mathrm{m}$ and $450$ $\mu\mathrm{m}$ from a metallic surface and above a $200\times200$ $\mu\mathrm{m}^{2}$ area, allowing us to reconstruct static and time-varying electric as well as magnetic fields. We use this to map charge distributions on the metallic surface and noise stemming from it. The methods demonstrated here allow similar probing to be carried out on samples with a variety of materials, surface constitutions and geometries, providing a new tool for surface science.</description>

      <title>Two-Photon Interference of Photons from Remote Tin-Vacancy Centers in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalable quantum networks rely on optical connections between long-lived qubits to distribute entanglement. Tin vacancies in diamond have emerged as promising long-lived qubits, offering extended spin coherence times at liquid helium temperatures and spin-dependent, highly coherent optical transitions for effective photon-based communication. Connecting remote nodes requires quantum interference of indistinguishable photons, which is challenging in an inhomogeneous solid-state environment. Here, we demonstrate a two-node experiment with tin vacancies in diamond, which exhibit a resonant frequency distribution spanning approximately 8 GHz. To overcome the frequency mismatch, we tune the resonant frequencies of one node using the Stark effect. We achieve tunability up to 4 GHz while maintaining optical coherence. As a demonstration, we achieve detuning-dependent remote two-photon interference between separate nodes, obtaining 80(6)% interference visibility without postprocessing when the defects' optical transitions are tuned into resonance, and 63(8)% with detuning up to 20 times their natural linewidths. These results highlight the potential of tin-vacancy centres in diamond for establishing robust optical links between remote quantum registers.</description>

      <title>No quantum advantage for violating fixed-order inequalities?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In standard quantum theory, the causal relations between operations are fixed and determined by the spacetime structure. Relaxing this notion of fixed causal order has been studied extensively over the past years. A first departure allows for dynamical arrangements, where operations can influence the causal relations of future operations, as certified by violation of fixed-order inequalities. A second non-causal departure relaxes even these limitations, and is certified by violations of causal inequalities. The quantum switch, which allows a party to coherently control the order in which operations are applied, is known to be incapable of violating causal inequalities. It was therefore believed that a device-independent certification of the causal indefiniteness in the quantum switch requires extended setups incorporating spacelike separation. Here, we show that the quantum switch violates fixed-order inequalities without exploiting its indefinite nature. Concretely, we study the $k$-cycle inequalities and introduce multi-party generalizations of the quantum switch tailored to these fixed-order inequalities. We further show that, when removing the dynamical aspect, $k$-cycle inequalities become novel, facet-defining, causal inequalities. On the one hand, this means that violating $k$-cycle inequalities under this restriction requires non-causal setups. On the other hand, since $k$-cycle inequalities are just one example of fixed-order inequalities, this reopens the possibility for a device-independent certification of the quantum switch in isolation.</description>

      <title>Modal division multiplexing of quantum and classical signals in few-mode fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mode-division multiplexing using multimode optical fibers has been intensively studied in recent years, in order to alleviate the transmission capacity crunch. Moreover, the need for secure information transmission based on quantum encryption protocols leads to investigating the possibility of multiplexing both quantum and classical signals in the same fiber. In this work, we experimentally study the modal multiplexing of both quantum and classical signals at telecom wavelengths, by using a few-mode fiber of 8 km and modal multiplexers/demultiplexers. We observe the existence of random-mode coupling at the quantum level, leading to cross-talk among both degenerate and non-degenerate channels. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using few-mode fibers for simultaneously transmitting classical and quantum information, leading to an efficient implementation of physical information encryption protocols in spatial-division multiplexed systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum circuits have arisen as an important method in quantum computing. A crucial step of it is parameter optimization, which is typically tackled through gradient-descent techniques. We advantageously explore instead the use of evolutionary algorithms for such optimization, specifically for time-series forecasting. We perform a comparison, for diverse instances of real-world data, between gradient-descent parameter optimization and covariant-matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy. We observe that gradient descent becomes permanently trapped in local minima that have been avoided by evolutionary algorithms in all tested datasets, reaching up to a six-fold decrease in prediction error. Finally, the combined use of evolutionary and gradient-based techniques is explored, aiming at retaining advantages of both. The results are particularly applicable in scenarios sensitive to gains in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Interplay between dressed and strong-axial-field states in Nitrogen-Vacancy centers for quantum sensing and computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center in diamond is an intriguing electronic spin system with applications in quantum radiometry, sensing and computation. In those experiments, a bias magnetic field is commonly applied along the NV symmetry axis to eliminate the triplet ground state manifold's degeneracy (S=1). In this configuration, the eigenvectors of the NV spin's projection along its axis are called strong-axial field states. Conversely, in some experiments a weak magnetic field is applied orthogonal to the NV symmetry axis, leading to eigenstates that are balanced linear superpositions of strong-axial field states, referred to as dressed states. The latter are sensitive to environmental magnetic noise at the second order, allowing to perform magnetic field protected measurements while providing increased coherence times. However, if a small axial magnetic field is added in this regime, the linear superposition of strong-axial field states becomes unbalanced. This paper presents a comprehensive study of Free Induction Decay (FID) measurements performed on a NV center ensemble in the presence of strain and weak orthogonal magnetic field, as a function of a small magnetic field applied along the NV symmetry axis. The simultaneous detection of dressed states and unbalanced superpositions of strong-axial field states in a single FID measurement is shown, gaining insight about coherence time, nuclear spin and the interplay between temperature and magnetic field sensitivity. The discussion concludes by describing how the simultaneous presence of magnetically-sensitive and -insensitive states opens up appealing possibilities for both sensing and quantum computation applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency-bin encoding furnishes a compelling pathway for quantum information processing systems compatible with established lightwave infrastructures based on fiber-optic transmission and wavelength-division multiplexing. Yet although significant progress has been realized in proof-of-principle tabletop demonstrations, ranging from arbitrary single-qubit gates to controllable multiphoton interference, challenges in scaling frequency-bin processors to larger systems remain. In this Perspective, we highlight recent advances at the intersection of frequency-bin encoding and integrated photonics that are fundamentally transforming the outlook for scalable frequency-based quantum information. Focusing specifically on results on sources, state manipulation, and hyperentanglement, we envision a possible future in which on-chip frequency-bin circuits fulfill critical roles in quantum information processing, particularly in communications and networking.</description>

      <title>ShotQC: Reducing Sampling Overhead in Quantum Circuit Cutting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent \emph{quantum circuit cutting} technique enables simulating large quantum circuits on distributed smaller devices, significantly extending the capabilities of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. However, this method incurs substantial classical postprocessing and additional quantum resource demands, as both postprocessing complexity and sampling overhead scale exponentially with the number of cuts introduced. In this work, we propose an enhanced circuit cutting framework \emph{ShotQC} with effective sampling overhead reduction. It effectively reduces sampling overhead through two key optimizations: \emph{shot distribution} and \emph{cut parameterization}. The former employs an adaptive Monte Carlo method to dynamically allocate more quantum resources to subcircuit configurations that contribute more to variance in the final outcome. The latter leverages additional degrees of freedom in postprocessing to further suppress variance. By integrating these optimization methods, ShotQC achieves significant reductions in sampling overhead without increasing classical postprocessing complexity, as demonstrated on a range of benchmark circuits.</description>

      <title>Lindblad engineering for quantum Gibbs state preparation under the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon recent progress in Lindblad engineering for quantum Gibbs state preparation algorithms, we propose a simplified protocol that is shown to be efficient under the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). The ETH reduces circuit overhead of the Lindblad simulation algorithm and ensures a fast convergence toward the target Gibbs state. Moreover, we show that the realized Lindblad dynamics exhibits resilience against depolarizing noise, opening up the path to a first demonstration on quantum computers. We complement our claims with numerical studies of the algorithm's convergence in various regimes of the mixed-field Ising model. In line with our predictions, we observe a mixing time scaling polynomially with system size when the ETH is satisfied. In addition, we assess the impact of algorithmic and hardware-induced errors on the algorithm's performance by carrying out quantum circuit simulations of our Lindblad simulation protocol with realistic noise models. This work bridges the gap between recent theoretical advances in Gibbs state preparation algorithms and their eventual quantum hardware implementation.</description>

      <title>QKD protected fiber-based infrastructure for time dissemination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate the possibility to protect, with Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), a critical infrastructure as the fiber-based one used for time and frequency (TF) dissemination service. The proposed technique allows to disseminate secure and precise TF signals between two fiber-opticconnected locations, on a critical infrastructure, using both QKD and White Rabbit technique. This secure exchange allows the secret sharing of time information between two parties for the synchronization of distant clocks with the highest stability and traceable to the Italian time scale. When encrypted, time signals would reveal to a third party no useful information about the synchronization status, providing a time stability two orders of magnitude worsened.</description>

      <title>Simulating lossy and partially distinguishable quantum optical circuits: theory, algorithms and applications to experiment validation and state preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To understand quantum optics experiments, we must perform calculations that consider the principal sources of noise, such as losses, spectral impurity and partial distinguishability. In both discrete and continuous variable systems, these can be modeled as mixed Gaussian states over multiple modes. The modes are not all resolved by photon-number measurements and so require calculations on coarse-grained photon-number distribution. Existing methods can lead to a combinatorial explosion in the time complexity, making this task unfeasible for even moderate sized experiments of interest. In this work, we prove that the computation of this type of distributions can be done in exponential time, providing a combinatorial speedup. We develop numerical techniques that allow us to determine coarse-grained photon number distributions of Gaussian states, as well as density matrix elements of heralded non-Gaussian states prepared in the presence of spectral impurity and partial distinguishability. These results offer significant speed-up and accuracy improvements to validation tests of both Fock and Gaussian boson samplers that rely on binned probability distributions. Moreover, they pave the way to a more efficient simulation of realistic photonic circuits, unlocking the ability to perform exact calculations at scales which were previously out of reach. In addition to this, our results, including loop Hafnian master theorems, may be of interest to the fields of combinatorics and graph theory.</description>

      <title>Towards structure-preserving quantum encodings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harnessing the potential computational advantage of quantum computers for machine learning tasks relies on the uploading of classical data onto quantum computers through what are commonly referred to as quantum encodings. The choice of such encodings may vary substantially from one task to another, and there exist only a few cases where structure has provided insight into their design and implementation, such as symmetry in geometric quantum learning. Here, we propose the perspective that category theory offers a natural mathematical framework for analyzing encodings that respect structure inherent in datasets and learning tasks. We illustrate this with pedagogical examples, which include geometric quantum machine learning, quantum metric learning, topological data analysis, and more. Moreover, our perspective provides a language in which to ask meaningful and mathematically precise questions for the design of quantum encodings and circuits for quantum machine learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Simulation of Anyonic Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anyonic chains provide lattice realizations of a rich set of quantum field theories in two space-time dimensions. The latter play a central role in the investigation of generalized symmetries, renormalization group flows and numerous exotic phases of strongly-correlated systems. Here, a variational quantum simulation scheme is presented for the analysis of those anyonic chains which can be mapped to the restricted solid-on-solid~(RSOS) models of Andrews, Baxter and Forrester. An~$L_R$ site RSOS model associated with a Dynkin diagram containing~$p$ nodes is realized with~$L_R\lceil\ln_2 p\rceil$ qubits, where~$\lceil x\rceil$ is the smallest integer~$\geq x$. The scheme is benchmarked by realizing the ground states of RSOS Hamiltonians in the~$A_p$ family for~$4\leq p\leq8$ using a variational quantum-classical algorithm. The latter is based on the Euler-Cartan circuit ansatz. Topological symmetry operators are analyzed for the RSOS models at the quantum-critical points. Measurement of observables acting on~$\lceil\ln_2 p\rceil$ qubits is shown to capture the anyonic nature of the Hilbert space. The described quantum simulation scheme provides a systematic approach to give rise to a large family of quantum field theories which have largely eluded physical realizations.</description>

      <title>Hiding, Shuffling, and Triangle Finding: Quantum Algorithms on Edge Lists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The edge list model is arguably the simplest input model for graphs, where the graph is specified by a list of its edges. In this model, we study the quantum query complexity of three variants of the triangle finding problem. The first asks whether there exists a triangle containing a target edge and raises general questions about the hiding of a problem's input among irrelevant data. The second asks whether there exists a triangle containing a target vertex and raises general questions about the shuffling of a problem's input. The third asks for finding a triangle in the input edge list; this problem bridges the $3$-distinctness and $3$-sum problems, which have been extensively studied by both cryptographers and complexity theorists. We provide tight or nearly tight results for all of our problems as well as some first answers to the general questions they raise. In particular, given a graph with low maximum degree, such as a random sparse graph, we prove that the quantum query complexity of triangle finding in its length-$m$ edge list is $m^{5/7 \pm o(1)}$. We prove the lower bound in Zhandry's recording query framework [CRYPTO '19] and the upper bound by adapting Belovs's learning graph algorithm for $3$-distinctness [FOCS '12].</description>

      <title>Power-optimized amplitude modulation for robust trapped-ion entangling gates: a study of gate-timing errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trapped-ion systems are a promising route toward the realization of both near-term and universal quantum computers. However, one of the pressing challenges is improving the fidelity of two-qubit entangling gates. These operations are often implemented by addressing individual ions with laser pulses using the Molmer-Sorensen (MS) protocol. Amplitude modulation (AM) is a well-studied extension of this protocol, where the amplitude of the laser pulses is controlled as a function of time. We present an analytical study of AM, using a Fourier series expansion to maintain the generality of the laser amplitude's functional form. We then apply this general AM method to gate-timing errors by imposing conditions on these Fourier coefficients, producing trade-offs between the laser power and fidelity at a fixed gate time. The conditions derived here are linear and can be used, in principle, to achieve arbitrarily high orders of insensitivity to gate-timing errors. Numerical optimization is then employed to identify the minimum-power pulse satisfying these constraints. Our central result is that the leading order dependence on gate timing errors is improved from $\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^6)$ with the addition of one linear constraint on the Fourier coefficients and to $\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^{10})$ with two linear constraints without a significant increase in the average laser power. The increase approaches zero as more Fourier coefficients are included. In further studies, this protocol can be applied to other error sources and used in conjunction with other error-mitigation techniques to improve two-qubit gates.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a non-Hermitian phase transition in a bulk condensed-matter system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase transitions are fundamental in nature. A small parameter change near a critical point leads to a qualitative change in system properties. Across a regular phase transition, the system remains in thermal equilibrium and, therefore, experiences a change of static properties, like the emergence of a magnetisation upon cooling a ferromagnet below the Curie temperature. When driving a system far from equilibrium, novel, otherwise inaccessible quantum states of matter may arise. Such states are typically non-Hermitian, that is, their dynamics break time-reversal symmetry, a basic law of equilibrium physics. Phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems are of fundamentally new nature in that the dynamical behaviour rather than static properties may undergo a qualitative change at a critical, here called exceptional point. Here we experimentally realize a non-Hermitian phase transition in a bulk condensed-matter system. Optical excitation creates charge carriers in the ferromagnetic semiconductor EuO. In a temperature-dependent interplay with the Hermitian transition to ferromagnetic order, a non-Hermitian change of the relaxation dynamics occurs, manifesting in our time-resolved reflection data as a transition from bi-exponential real to single-exponential complex decay. Our theory models this behavior and predicts non-Hermitian phase transitions for a large class of condensed-matter systems, where they may be exploited to sensitively control bulk-dynamic properties.</description>

      <title>Josephson Field Effect Transistors with InAs on Insulator and High Permittivity Gate Dielectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: InAs on Insulator (InAsOI) has recently been demonstrated as a promising platform to develop hybrid semiconducting-superconducting electronics, which features an InAs epilayer grown onto a cryogenic insulating InAlAs metamorphic buffer. The miniaturization of Si microchips has progressed significantly due to the integration of high permittivity (high-k) gate insulators, compared to the conventional thermally-growth SiO2. Here, we investigate the gate-tunable electrical properties of InAsOI-based Josephson Field Effect Transistors (JoFETs) featuring different high-k gate insulators, namely, HfO2 and Al2O3. With both dielectrics, the JoFETs can entirely suppress the switching current and increase the normal state resistance by 10-20 times using negative gate voltages. The HfO2-JoFETs exhibit improved gate-tunable electrical performance compared to those achieved with Al2O3-JoFETs, which is related to the higher permittivity of the insulator. Gate-dependent electrical properties of InAsOI-based JoFETs were evaluated in the temperature range from 50 mK to 1 K. Moreover, under the influence of an out-of-plane magnetic field, JoFETs exhibited an unconventional Fraunhofer diffraction pattern.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first results from the Quantum Resolution-Optimized Cryogenic Observatory for Dark matter Incident at Low Energy (QROCODILE). The QROCODILE experiment uses a microwire-based superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) as a target and sensor for dark matter scattering and absorption, and is sensitive to energy deposits as low as 0.11 eV. We introduce the experimental configuration and report new world-leading constraints on the interactions of sub-MeV dark matter particles with masses as low as 30 keV. The thin-layer geometry of the system provides anisotropy in the interaction rate, enabling directional sensitivity. In addition, we leverage the coupling between phonons and quasiparticles in the detector to simultaneously constrain interactions with both electrons and nucleons. We discuss the potential for improvements to both the energy threshold and effective volume of the experiment in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Sulfur in diamond and its effect on the creation of nitrogen-vacancy defect from \textit{ab initio} simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is one of the most significant and widely studied defects in diamond that plays a prominent role in quantum technologies. The precise engineering of the location and concentration of NV centers is of great importance in quantum technology applications. To this end, irradiation techniques such as nitrogen-molecule ion implantation are applied. Recent studies have reported enhanced NV center creation and activation efficiencies introduced by nitrogen molecule ion implantation in doped diamond layers, where the maximum creation efficiency at $\sim75$\% has been achieved in sulfur-doped layers. However, the microscopic mechanisms behind these observations and the limits of the efficiencies are far from understood. In this study, we employ hybrid density functional theory calculations to compute the formation energies, charge transition levels, and the magneto-optical properties of various sulfur defects in diamond where we also consider the interaction of sulfur and hydrogen in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers. Our results imply that the competition between the donor substitutional sulfur and the hyper-deep acceptor sulfur-vacancy complex is an important limiting factor on the creation efficiency of the NV center in diamond. However, both species are able to trap interstitial hydrogen from diamond, which favorably mediates the creation of NV centers in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers.</description>

      <title>Non-Linearities In Atomic Quantum Receivers: Harmonic And Intermodulation Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg sensors offer a unique approach to radio frequency (RF) detection, leveraging the high sensitivity and quantum properties of highly-excited atomic states to achieve performance levels beyond classical technologies. Non-linear responses and distortion behavior in Rydberg atom receivers are critical to evaluating and establishing performance metrics and capabilities such as spur-free dynamic range and tolerance to unwanted interfering signals. We report here on the measurement and characterization of non-linear behavior and spurious response of a Rydberg atomic heterodyne receiver. Single-tone and two-tone testing procedures are developed and implemented for measurement of harmonic and inter-modulation distortion in Rydberg atomic receivers based on multi-photon Rydberg spectroscopy and radio-frequency heterodyne signal detection and demodulation in an atomic vapor. For a predetermined set of atomic receiver parameters and RF carrier wave in the SHF band near-resonant to a cesium Rydberg transition, we measure and characterize atomic receiver selectivity, bandwidth, roll-off, compression point (P1dB), second-order (IP2) and third-order (IP3) intercepts, and spur-free dynamic range. Receiver intermodulation distortion is characterized for the case of an interfering signal wave applied at two frequency offsets relative to the near-resonant reference local oscillator, $\Delta F/F= 10^{-4}$ at 6dB and $10^{-6}$ at 22dB single-tone bandwidths, respectively. We observe that under suitable operating conditions the atomic receiver can exhibit a suppression of harmonic and inter-modulation distortion relative to that of classical receiver mixer amplifiers. Finally, we describe how the non-linear behaviors of atomic receivers can provide unique, controllable RF signatures inaccessible by classical counterparts and propose their use to realize secure communication modalities and applications.</description>

      <title>Systematic discrepancies between reference methods for non-covalent interactions within the S66 dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate treatment of non-covalent interactions is necessary to model a wide range of applications, from molecular crystals to surface catalysts to aqueous solutions and many more. Quantum diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and coupled cluster theory with single, double and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)] are considered two widely-trusted methods for treating non-covalent interactions. However, while they have been well-validated for small molecules, recent work has indicated that these two methods can disagree by more than $7.5\,$kcal/mol for larger systems. The origin of this discrepancy remains unknown. Moreover, the lack of systematic comparisons, particularly for medium-sized complexes, has made it difficult to identify which systems may be prone to such disagreements and the potential scale of these differences. In this work, we leverage the latest developments in DMC to compute interaction energies for the entire S66 dataset, containing 66 medium-sized complexes with a balanced representation of dispersion and electrostatic interactions. Comparison to previous CCSD(T) references reveals systematic trends, with DMC predicting stronger binding than CCSD(T) for electrostatic-dominated systems, while the binding becomes weaker for dispersion-dominated systems. We show that the relative strength of this discrepancy is correlated to the ratio of electrostatic and dispersion interactions, as obtained from energy decomposition analysis methods. Finally, we pinpoint systems in the S66 dataset where these discrepancies are particularly prominent, offering cost-effective benchmarks to guide future developments in DMC, CCSD(T) as well as the wider electronic structure theory community.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Krylov State Complexity in Random Matrix Quenches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum many-body systems, time-evolved states typically remain confined to a smaller region of the Hilbert space known as the $\textit{Krylov subspace}$. The time evolution can be mapped onto a one-dimensional problem of a particle moving on a chain, where the average position $\langle n \rangle$ defines Krylov state complexity or spread complexity. Generalized spread complexities, associated with higher-order moments $\langle n^p \rangle$ for $p&gt;1$, provide finer insights into the dynamics. We investigate the time evolution of generalized spread complexities following a quantum quench in random matrix theory. The quench is implemented by transitioning from an initial random Hamiltonian to a post-quench Hamiltonian obtained by dividing it into four blocks and flipping the sign of the off-diagonal blocks. This setup captures universal features of chaotic quantum quenches. When the initial state is the thermofield double state of the post-quench Hamiltonian, a peak in spread complexity preceding equilibration signals level repulsion, a hallmark of quantum chaos. We examine the robustness of this peak for other initial states, such as the ground state or the thermofield double state of the pre-quench Hamiltonian. To quantify this behavior, we introduce a measure based on the peak height relative to the late-time saturation value. In the continuous limit, higher-order complexities show increased sensitivity to the peak, supported by numerical simulations for finite-size random matrices.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement, coherence and Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the effect of quantum entanglement and coherence on the radiated intensity from a gas and its absorption capacity at thermal equilibrium or, more generally, under conditions where no population inversion exists. As was shown by Dicke (1954), although entangled states and coherence can lead to superradiance for specific modes of radiation, they can also bring subradiance through significant energy trapping in slow and dark states. While a finite separation between the atoms composing the gas will cause leaking of the trapped energy, we show how the combination of thermal equilibrium and quantum coherence mitigates this effect and leads to significantly reduced radiation intensity from the gas, rendering it dark and collision-less. Furthermore, we show how under the same conditions absorption of a radiation field incident on the gas can lead to higher attenuation levels than those predicted with Beer's law. Beer's law is recovered in the limit of complete decoherence. We apply our analysis to the atomic hydrogen 21 cm line and, considering the gas densities expected in Dark Matter halos, we find that quantum entanglement and coherence can potentially account for some of the Dark Matter known exist in these environments.</description>

      <title>Long-Time Behavior of Typical Pure States from Thermal Equilibrium Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an isolated macroscopic quantum system in a pure state $\psi_t\in\mathcal{H}$ evolving unitarily in a separable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. Following von Neumann [46], we assume that different macro states $\nu$ correspond to mutually orthogonal subspaces $\mathcal{H}_\nu\subset\mathcal{H}$. Let $P_\nu$ be the projection to $\mathcal{H}_\nu$. ''Normal typicality'' is the statement (true for some Hamiltonians) that for all initial states $\psi_0\in\mathcal{H}$ and most $t\geq 0$, $\|P_\nu\psi_t\|^2$ is close to $d_\nu/D$, where $d_\nu=\dim\mathcal{H}_\nu$ and $D=\dim\mathcal{H}&lt;\infty$. It can be shown [42] that the statement becomes valid for all Hamiltonians if ''all $\psi_0\in\mathcal{H}$'' is replaced by ''most $\psi_0\in\mathcal{H}_\mu$'' (most w.r.t. the uniform distribution on the sphere of $\mathcal{H}_\mu$) with an arbitrary macro state $\mu$ and $d_\nu/D$ by a $t$- and $\psi_0$-independent quantity $M_{\mu\nu}$. In the present work, we generalize this result from the uniform distribution to a much more general class of measures, so-called GAP measures. Let $\rho$ be a density matrix on $\mathcal{H}$. Then GAP$(\rho)$ is the most spread out distribution on the sphere of $\mathcal{H}$ with density matrix $\rho$. If $\rho$ is a canonical density matrix, GAP$(\rho)$ arises as the thermal equilibrium distribution of wave functions and can be viewed as a quantum analog of the canonical ensemble. We show that also for GAP$(\rho)$-most $\psi_0\in\mathcal{H}$, the superposition weight $\|P_\nu\psi_t\|^2$ is close to a fixed value $M_{\rho P_\nu}$ for most $t\geq0$. Moreover, we prove a similar result for arbitrary bounded operators $B$ instead of $P_\nu$ and for finite times. The main ingredient of the proof is an improvement of bounds on the variance of $\langle\psi|B|\psi\rangle$ w.r.t. GAP$(\rho)$ which were first obtained by Reimann [29] and slightly generalized in [44].</description>

      <title>Quantum-Like Contextuality in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contextuality is a distinguishing feature of quantum mechanics and there is growing evidence that it is a necessary condition for quantum advantage. In order to make use of it, researchers have been asking whether similar phenomena arise in other domains. The answer has been yes, e.g. in behavioural sciences. However, one has to move to frameworks that take some degree of signalling into account. Two such frameworks exist: (1) a signalling-corrected sheaf theoretic model, and (2) the Contextuality-by-Default (CbD) framework. This paper provides the first large scale experimental evidence for a yes answer in natural language. We construct a linguistic schema modelled over a contextual quantum scenario, instantiate it in the Simple English Wikipedia and extract probability distributions for the instances using the large language model BERT. This led to the discovery of 77,118 sheaf-contextual and 36,938,948 CbD contextual instances. We proved that the contextual instances came from semantically similar words, by deriving an equation between degrees of contextuality and Euclidean distances of BERT's embedding vectors. A regression model further reveals that Euclidean distance is indeed the best statistical predictor of contextuality. Our linguistic schema is a variant of the co-reference resolution challenge. These results are an indication that quantum methods may be advantageous in language tasks.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired super-resolution of fluorescent point-like sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the experimental super-resolution of pairs of simultaneously emitting point-like fluorescent sources using a modified image inversion interferometer microscope. The technique is inspired by recent developments in the application of quantum parameter estimation theory to semiclassical imaging problems. We find that the image inversion technique requires special polarization filtering to account for the dipolar nature of the emission. Using an azimuthal polarizer, we obtain improvements in the Fisher information of point-source separation by over an order of magnitude relative to direct imaging. Unlike established super-resolution fluorescence techniques, the method does not require sequential photoswitching/blinking of the fluorophores, and thus could facilitate significant speed-ups for certain biological imaging/tracking tasks.</description>

      <title>Instanton-Induced Supersymmetry Breaking in Topological Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supersymmetry (SUSY) proposed as an elementary symmetry for physics beyond the Standard Model has found important applications in various areas outside high-energy physics. Here, we systematically implement supersymmetric quantum mechanics -- exhibiting fundamental SUSY properties in the simple setting of quantum mechanics -- into a wide range of topological semimetals, where the broken translational symmetry, e.g., by a magnetic field, is effectively captured by a SUSY potential. We show that the dynamical SUSY breaking via the instanton effect over the SUSY potential valleys works as the underlying mechanism for the gap opening of the topological semimetallic phases, and the magnitude of the instanton effect is proportional to the energy gap. This instanton mechanism provides a simple criterion for determining whether the energy gap has been opened, without resorting to detailed calculations, i.e., a finite energy gap is opened if and only if the SUSY potential has an even number of zeros. Our theory leads to previously unexpected results: even an infinitesimal magnetic field can open a gap in topologically robust Dirac, Weyl, and nodal-line semimetallic phases due to the dynamical SUSY breaking. Overall, the revealed connection between SUSY quantum mechanics and non-uniform topological semimetals can elucidate previously ambiguous phenomena, provide guidance for future investigations, and open a new avenue for exploring topological semimetals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theory is an important framework for studying gauge theories that arise in the Standard Model and condensed matter physics. Yet many systems (or regimes of those systems) are difficult to study using conventional techniques, such as action-based Monte Carlo sampling. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of gauged Gaussian projected entangled pair states as an ansatz for a lattice gauge theory involving dynamical physical matter. We study a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory on a two dimensional lattice with a single flavor of fermionic matter on each lattice site. Our results show agreement with results computed by exactly diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, and demonstrate that the approach is computationally feasible for larger system sizes where exact results are unavailable. This is a further step on the road to studying higher dimensions and other gauge groups with manageable computational costs while avoiding the sign problem.</description>

      <title>A tensor network formulation of Lattice Gauge Theories based only on symmetric tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lattice Gauge Theory Hilbert space is divided into gauge-invariant sectors selected by the background charges. Such a projector can be directly embedded in a tensor network ansatz for gauge-invariant states as originally discussed in [Phys. Rev. B 83, 115127 (2011)] and in [Phys. Rev. X 4, 041024 (2014)] in the context of PEPS. The original ansatz is based on sparse tensors, though parts of them are not explicitly symmetric, and thus their actual implementation in numerical simulations has been hindered by the complexity of developing ad hoc libraries. Here we provide a new PEPS tensor network formulation of gauge-invariant theories purely based on symmetric elementary tensors. The new formulation can be implemented in numerical simulation using available state-of-the-art tensor network libraries but also holds interest from a purely theoretical perspective since it requires embedding the original gauge theory with gauge symmetry G into an enlarged globally symmetric theory with symmetry GxG. By revisiting the original ansatz in the modern landscape of i) duality transformations between gauge and spin systems, ii) finite depth quantum circuits followed by measurements that allow generating topologically ordered states, and iii) Clifford enhanced tensor networks, we show that such a new formulation provides a novel duality transformation between lattice gauge theories and specific sectors of globally invariant systems.</description>

      <title>Time-reversed Young's experiment: Deterministic, diffractionless second-order interference effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classic Young's double-slit experiment exhibits first-order interference, producing alternating bright and dark fringes modulated by the diffraction effect of the slits. In contrast, here we demonstrate that its time-reversed configuration produces an ideal, deterministic second-order 'ghost' interference pattern devoid of diffraction and first-order effect, with the size dependent on the dimensions of the `effectively extended light source.' Furthermore, the new system enables a range of effects and phenomena not available in traditional double-slit interference studies, including the formation of programmed and digitized interference fringes and the coincidence of the pattern plane and the source plane. Despite the absence of first-order interference, our proposed experiment does not rely on nonclassical correlations or quantum entanglement. The elimination of diffraction through time-reversal symmetry holds promise for advancing superresolution optical imaging and sensing techniques beyond existing capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To find a suitable incubator for nonlinear crystal optics(NCO), we have revisited linear crystal optics(LCO). At the methodological level, three widely used plane wave bases are compared in terms of eigenanalysis in reciprocal space and light field propagation in real space. Inspired by complex ray tracing, we expand M.V. Berry's 2003 uniform plane wave model to non-uniform Fourier crystal optics(FCO) and ultimately derive the explicit form of its 3$\times$2 transition matrix, bridging the two major branches of crystal optics(CO) in reciprocal space, where either ray direction $\hat{k}$ or spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ serves as the input variable. Using this model, we create the material-matrix tetrahedral compass(M-M TC) to conduct a detailed analysis of how the four fundamental characteristics of materials (linear/circular birefringence/dichroism) influence the eigensystems of the vector electric field in two-dimensional(2D) spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ domain and its distribution in three-dimensional(3D) $\bar{r}$ space with a crystal-2f system. Along this journey, we have uncovered new territories in LCO in both real and reciprocal space, such as infinite singularities arranged in disk-, ring-, and heart-like shapes, generalized haunting theorem, double conical refraction, and optical knots it induces. We also present our model's early applications in focal engineering and NCO.</description>

      <title>Scattering halos in strongly interacting Feshbach molecular Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the scattering halos resulting from collisions between discrete momentum components in the time-of-flight expansion of interaction-tunable $^6\rm Li_2$ molecular Bose-Einstein condensates. A key highlight of this study is the observation of the influence of interactions on the collisional scattering process. We measure the production of scattering halos at different interaction levels by varying the number of particles and the scattering length, and quantitatively assess the applicability of perturbation theory. To delve into a general theory of scattering halos, we introduce a scattering factor and obtain a universal relation between it and the halo ratio. Furthermore, we simulate the formation of scattering halos under non-perturbative conditions and analyze the discrepancies between simulation results and experiments through a return pulse experiment. This study enhances our understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying scattering processes in many-body systems and provides new perspectives for further theoretical research.</description>

      <title>Abrupt changes in the spectra of the Laplacian with constant complex magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the spectrum of the Laplace operator, subject to homogeneous complex magnetic fields in the plane. For real magnetic fields, it is well-known that the spectrum consists of isolated eigenvalues of infinite multiplicities (Landau levels). We demonstrate that when the magnetic field has a nonzero imaginary component, the spectrum expands to cover the entire complex plane. Additionally, we show that the Landau levels (appropriately rotated and now embedded in the complex plane) persists, unless the magnetic field is purely imaginary in which case they disappear and the spectrum becomes purely continuous.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the exact nonequilibrium spectral function of a gas of strongly correlated Tonks-Girardeau bosons subjected to a strong periodic drive. Utilizing the theory of Floquet spectral function in conjunction with the Bose-Fermi mapping theorem, we show that nonequilibrium Lieb modes emerge if the underlying mapped fermions form a Floquet-Fermi sea. In the low-frequency regime, the exact analysis reveals the emergence of characteristic linear Lieb excitations for the bosonic system, while the underlying mapped fermions displays the wide Dirac-like linear dispersion.</description>

      <title>Complex energy structures of exceptional point pairs in two level systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of multiple exceptional points in non-Hermitian two-level systems, emphasizing vorticity as a topological invariant arising from complex energy structures. We categorize EP pairs as fundamental building blocks of larger EP assemblies, distinguishing two types: type-I pairs with opposite vorticities and type-II pairs with identical vorticities. By analyzing the branch cut formation in a two-dimensional parameter space, we reveal the distinct topological features of each EP pair type. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to configurations with multiple EPs, demonstrating the cumulative vorticity and topological implications. To illustrate these theoretical structures, we model complex energy bands within a two-dimensional photonic crystal composed of lossy materials, identifying various EP pairs and their branch cuts. These findings contribute to the understanding of topological characteristics in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Carbon-based light emitting defects in different layers of hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Substitutional carbon defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have garnered significant interest as single photon emitters (SPEs) due to their remarkable optical and quantum properties. An intriguing property of these defects is that they can be spin-active ($S\geq 1$), even if weakly interacting. Employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that two monomers of C-based defects of the same species can exhibit a stable triplet spin state at room temperature, even when they are separated $\lesssim 1$ nm, if they reside in different layers. The zero-phonon line (ZPL) energy of C defects in different layers lies within $1.6-2.2$ eV range. Also, we found defects that deviate from the typical phonon replica patterns, potentially explaining the observed phonon replicas in yellow emitters in hBN.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Diagram of the Bilayer Kitaev-Heisenberg Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ground-state phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ Kitaev-Heisenberg model on the bilayer honeycomb lattice with large-scale tensor network calculations based on the infinite projected entangled pair state technique as well as high-order series expansions. We find that beyond various magnetically ordered phases, including ferromagnetic, zigzag, antiferromagnetic (AFM) and stripy states, two extended quantum spin liquid phases arise in the proximity of the Kitaev limit. While these ordered phases also appear in the monolayer Kitaev-Heisenberg model, our results further show that a valence bond solid state emerges in a relatively narrow range of parameter space between the AFM and stripy phases, which can be adiabatically connected to isolated Heisenberg dimers. Our results highlight the importance of considering interlayer interactions on the emergence of novel quantum phases in the bilayer Kitaev materials.</description>

Abstract: We report room temperature heterodyne detection of a quantum cascade laser beaten with a local oscillator on a unipolar quantum photodetector in two different atmospheric windows, at 4.8 $\mu$m and 9 $\mu$m. A noise equivalent power of few pW is measured by employing an active stabilization technique in which the local oscillator and the signal are locked in phase. The measured heterodyne noise equivalent power is six orders of magnitude lower than that obtained with direct detection.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an anomalous non-evaporating sub-nanometre water layer in open environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water exhibits complex behaviors as a result of hydrogen bonding, and low-dimensional confined water plays a key role in material science, geology, and biology science. Conventional techniques like STM, TEM, and AFM enable atomic-scale observations but face limitations under ambient conditions and surface topographies. NV center magnetic resonance technology provides an opportunity to overcome these limitations, offering non-contact atomic-scale measurements with chemical resolution capability. In this study, a nanoscale layer dissection method was developed utilizing NV center technology to analyze water layers with diverse physicochemical properties. It unveiled the presence of a non-evaporating sub-nanometer water layer on a diamond surface under ambient conditions. This layer demonstrated impervious to atmospheric water vapor and exhibited unique electronic transport mediated via hydrogen bonding. These findings provide new perspectives and a platform for studying the structure and behavior of low-dimensional water, as well as the surface properties influenced by adsorbed water under native conditions.</description>

      <title>Third-Order Exceptional Point in Non-Hermitian Spin-Orbit-Coupled cold atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) has seen substantial advances in both experiment and theory. However, in quantum systems, higher-order exceptional points remain of great interest and possess numerous intriguing properties yet to be fully explored. Here, we describe a \emph{PT} symmetry-protected three-level non-Hermitian system with the dissipative spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) fermions in which a third-order exceptional point (EP3) emerges when both the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the system collapse into one. The band structure and its spin dynamics are explored for $^{173}$Yb fermions. We highlight the enhanced sensitivity to the external perturbation of EP3 with cubic-root energy dispersion. Additionally, we investigate the second-order exceptional point (EP2) with square-root energy dispersion in a three-level quantum system with the absence of parity symmetry, which proves that the enhanced sensitivity closely relates to the symmetries of the NH system. Furthermore, we analyze the encircling behavior of EP3 in terms of the adiabatic limit and the nonadiabatic dynamics and discover some different results from that of EP2.</description>

      <title>Krylov spread complexity as holographic complexity beyond JT gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the important open problems in quantum black hole physics is a dual interpretation of holographic complexity proposals. To date the only quantitative match is the equality between the Krylov spread complexity in triple-scaled SYK at infinite temperature and the complexity = volume proposal in classical JT gravity. Our work utilizes the recent connection between double-scaled SYK and sine-dilaton gravity to show that the quantitative relation between Krylov spread complexity and complexity = volume extends to finite temperatures and to full quantum regime on the gravity side at disk level. From the latter we isolate the first quantum correction to the complexity = volume proposal and propose to view it as a complexity of quantum fields in the bulk. Finally, we comment on the switchback effect, whose presence would make the Krylov spread complexity a fully fledged holographic complexity at least in sine-dilaton gravity.</description>

      <title>Probing the magnetic origin of the pseudogap using a Fermi-Hubbard quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In strongly correlated materials, interacting electrons are entangled and form collective quantum states, resulting in rich low-temperature phase diagrams. Notable examples include cuprate superconductors, in which superconductivity emerges at low doping out of an unusual ``pseudogap'' metallic state above the critical temperature. The Fermi-Hubbard model, describing a wide range of phenomena associated with strong electron correlations, still offers major computational challenges despite its simple formulation. In this context, ultracold atoms quantum simulators have provided invaluable insights into the microscopic nature of correlated quantum states. Here, we use a quantum gas microscope Fermi-Hubbard simulator to explore a wide range of doping levels and temperatures in a regime where a pseudogap is known to develop. By measuring multi-point correlation functions up to fifth order, we uncover a novel universal behaviour in magnetic and higher-order spin-charge correlations. This behaviour is characterized by a doping-dependent energy scale that governs the exponential growth of the magnetic correlation length upon cooling. Accurate comparisons with determinant Quantum Monte Carlo and Minimally Entangled Typical Thermal States simulations confirm that this energy scale agrees well with the pseudogap temperature $T^{*}$. Our findings establish a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the magnetic origin and physical nature of the pseudogap and pave the way towards the exploration of pairing and collective phenomena among charge carriers expected to emerge at lower temperatures.</description>

Abstract: While several measures exist for entanglement of multipartite pure states, a true entanglement measure for mixed states still eludes us. A deeper study of the geometry of quantum states may be the way to address this issue, on which context we come up with a measure for pure states based on a geodesic distance on the space of quantum states. Our measure satisfies all the desirable properties of a ``Genuine Measure of Entanglement" (GME), and in comparison with some of the other existing measures, shows better smoothness and discriminance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current superconducting quantum devices impose strict connectivity constraints on quantum circuit execution, necessitating circuit transformation before executing quantum circuits on physical hardware. Numerous quantum circuit transformation (QCT) algorithms have been proposed. To enable faithful evaluation of state-of-the-art QCT algorithms, this paper introduces QKNOB (Qubit mapping Benchmark with Known Near-Optimality), a novel benchmark construction method for QCT. QKNOB circuits have built-in transformations with near-optimal (close to the theoretical optimum) SWAP count and depth overhead. QKNOB provides general and unbiased evaluation of QCT algorithms. Using QKNOB, we demonstrate that SABRE, the default Qiskit compiler, consistently achieves the best performance on the 53-qubit IBM Q Rochester and Google Sycamore devices for both SWAP count and depth objectives. Our results also reveal significant performance gaps relative to the near-optimal transformation costs of QKNOB. Our construction algorithm and benchmarks are open-source.</description>

      <title>Theory of Quantum Circuits with Abelian Symmetries</title>

Abstract: Quantum circuits with gates (local unitaries) respecting a global symmetry have broad applications in quantum information science and related fields, such as condensed matter theory and quantum thermodynamics. However, despite their widespread use, fundamental properties of such circuits are not well-understood. Recently, it was found that generic unitaries respecting a global symmetry cannot be realized, even approximately, using gates that respect the same symmetry. This observation raises important open questions: What unitary transformations can be realized with k-local gates that respect a global symmetry? In other words, in the presence of a global symmetry, how does the locality of interactions constrain the possible time evolution of a composite system? In this work, we address these questions for the case of Abelian (commutative) symmetries and develop constructive methods for synthesizing circuits with such symmetries. Remarkably, as a corollary, we find that, while the locality of interactions still imposes additional constraints on realizable unitaries, certain restrictions observed in the case of non-Abelian symmetries do not apply to circuits with Abelian symmetries. For instance, in circuits with a general non-Abelian symmetry such as SU($d$), the unitary realized in a subspace with one irreducible representation (charge) of the symmetry dictates the realized unitaries in multiple other sectors with inequivalent representations of the symmetry. Furthermore, in certain sectors, rather than all unitaries respecting the symmetry, the realizable unitaries are the symplectic or orthogonal subgroups of this group. We prove that none of these restrictions appears in the case of Abelian symmetries. This result suggests that global non-Abelian symmetries may affect the thermalization of quantum systems in ways not possible under Abelian symmetries.</description>

Many tasks rely on highly entangled pure states, but obtaining such states is often challenging due to the presence of noise. Typically, entanglement manipulation procedures involving asymptotically many copies of a state are considered to overcome this problem. These procedures allow for distilling highly entangled pure states from noisy states, which enables a wide range of applications, such as quantum teleportation and quantum cryptography. When it comes to manipulating entangled quantum systems on a single copy level, using entangled states as catalysts can significantly broaden the range of achievable transformations. Similar to the concept of catalysis in chemistry, the entangled catalyst is returned unchanged at the end of the state manipulation procedure. Our results demonstrate that despite the apparent conceptual differences between the asymptotic and catalytic settings, they are actually strongly connected and fully equivalent for all distillable states. Our methods rely on the analysis of many-copy entanglement manipulation procedures which may establish correlations between different copies. As an important consequence, we demonstrate that using an entangled catalyst cannot enhance the asymptotic singlet distillation rate of a distillable quantum state. Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the capabilities and limitations of both catalytic and asymptotic state transformations of entangled states, and highlight the importance of correlations in these processes.</description>

      <title>High-speed Source-Device-Independent Quantum Random Number Generator on a Chip</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A wide range of applications require, by hypothesis, to have access to a high-speed, private, and genuine random source. Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs) are currently the sole technology capable of producing true randomness. However, the bulkiness of current implementations significantly limits their adoption. In this work, we present a high-performance source-device independent QRNG leveraging a custom made integrated photonic chip. The proposed scheme exploits the properties of a heterodyne receiver to enhance security and integration to promote spatial footprint reduction while simplifying its implementation. This characteristics could represents a significant advancement toward the development of generators better suited to meet the demands of portable and space applications. The system can deliver secure random numbers at a rate greater than 20 Gbps with a reduced spatial and power footprint.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Estimation by Compressed Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07008v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a signal recovery algorithm, compressed sensing is particularly useful when the data has low-complexity and samples are rare, which matches perfectly with the task of quantum phase estimation (QPE). In this work we present a new Heisenberg-limited QPE algorithm for early quantum computers based on compressed sensing. More specifically, given many copies of a proper initial state and queries to some unitary operators, our algorithm is able to recover the frequency with a total runtime $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1}\text{poly}\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$, where $\epsilon$ is the accuracy. Moreover, the maximal runtime satisfies $T_{\max}\epsilon \ll \pi$, which is comparable to the state of art algorithms, and our algorithm is also robust against certain amount of noise from sampling. We also consider the more general quantum eigenvalue estimation problem (QEEP) and show numerically that the off-grid compressed sensing can be a strong candidate for solving the QEEP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12492v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given $x, y$ on an unweighted undirected graph $G$, the goal of the pathfinding problem is to find an $x$-$y$ path. In this work, we first construct a graph $G$ based on welded trees and define a pathfinding problem in the adjacency list oracle $O$. Then we provide an efficient quantum algorithm to find an $x$-$y$ path in the graph $G$. Finally, we prove that no classical algorithm can find an $x$-$y$ path in subexponential time with high probability. The pathfinding problem is one of the fundamental graph-related problems. Our findings suggest that quantum algorithms could potentially offer advantages in more types of graphs to solve the pathfinding problem.</description>

      <title>The unphysicality of Hilbert spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06669v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that Hilbert spaces are not suitable to represent quantum states mathematically, in the sense that they require properties that are untenable by physical entities. We first demonstrate that the requirements posited by complex inner product spaces are physically justified. We then show that completeness in the infinite-dimensional case requires the inclusion of states with infinite expectations, coordinate transformations that take finite expectations to infinite ones and vice versa, and time evolutions that transform finite expectations to infinite ones in finite time. This means we should be wary of using Hilbert spaces to represent quantum states as they turn a potential infinity into an actual infinity. The main point of the paper, then, is to raise awareness that results that rely on the completeness of Hilbert spaces may not be physically significant. While we do not claim to know what a physically more appropriate closure should be, we note that Schwartz spaces, among other things, guarantee that the expectations of all polynomials of position and momentum are finite, their elements are uniquely identified by these expectations, and they are closed under Fourier transform.</description>

      <title>Universal Quantum Computation via Superposed Orders of Single-Qubit Gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superposed orders of quantum channels have already been proved - both theoretically and experimentally - to enable unparalleled opportunities in the quantum communication domain. As a matter of fact, superposition of orders can be exploited within the quantum computing domain as well, by relaxing the (traditional) assumption underlying quantum computation about applying gates in a well-defined causal order. In this context, we address a fundamental question arising with quantum computing: whether superposed orders of single-qubit gates can enable universal quantum computation. As shown in this paper, the answer to this key question is a definitive "yes". Indeed, we prove that any two-qubit controlled quantum gate can be deterministically realized, including the so-called Barenco gate that alone enables universal quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Hexagons govern three-qubit contextuality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Split Cayley hexagons of order two are distinguished finite geometries living in the three-qubit symplectic polar space in two different forms, called classical and skew. Although neither of the two yields observable-based contextual configurations of their own, {\it classically}-embedded copies are found to fully encode contextuality properties of the most prominent three-qubit contextual configurations in the following sense: for each set of unsatisfiable contexts of such a contextual configuration there exists some classically-embedded hexagon sharing with the configuration exactly this set of contexts and nothing else. We demonstrate this fascinating property first on the configuration comprising all 315 contexts of the space and then on doilies, both types of quadrics as well as on complements of skew-embedded hexagons. In connection with the last-mentioned case and elliptic quadrics we also conducted some experimental tests on a Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computer to substantiate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Knapsack-based Financial Portfolio Optimization Using Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Portfolio optimization is a primary component of the decision-making process in finance, aiming to tactfully allocate assets to achieve optimal returns while considering various constraints. Herein, we proposed a method that uses the knapsack-based portfolio optimization problem and incorporates the quantum computing capabilities of the quantum walk mixer with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) to address the challenges presented by the NP-hard problem. Additionally, we present the sequential procedure of our suggested approach and demonstrate empirical proof to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in finding the optimal asset allocations across various constraints and asset choices. Moreover, we discuss the effectiveness of the QAOA components in relation to our proposed method. Consequently, our study successfully achieves the approximate ratio of the portfolio optimization technique using a circuit layer of p&gt;=3, compared to the classical best-known solution of the knapsack problem. Our proposed methods potentially contribute to the growing field of quantum finance by offering insights into the potential benefits of employing quantum algorithms for complex optimization tasks in financial portfolio management.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary Polynomial Separations in Trainable Quantum Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08606v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent theoretical results in quantum machine learning have demonstrated a general trade-off between the expressive power of quantum neural networks (QNNs) and their trainability; as a corollary of these results, practical exponential separations in expressive power over classical machine learning models are believed to be infeasible as such QNNs take a time to train that is exponential in the model size. We here circumvent these negative results by constructing a hierarchy of efficiently trainable QNNs that exhibit unconditionally provable, polynomial memory separations of arbitrary constant degree over classical neural networks -- including state-of-the-art models, such as Transformers -- in performing a classical sequence modeling task. This construction is also computationally efficient, as each unit cell of the introduced class of QNNs only has constant gate complexity. We show that contextuality -- informally, a quantitative notion of semantic ambiguity -- is the source of the expressivity separation, suggesting that other learning tasks with this property may be a natural setting for the use of quantum learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature quantum sensing with photoexcited triplet electrons in organic crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum sensors have notably advanced high-sensitivity magnetic field detection. Here, we report quantum sensors constructed from polarized spin-triplet electrons in photoexcited organic chromophores, specifically focusing on pentacene-doped para-terphenyl (${\approx}$0.1%). We demonstrate essential quantum sensing properties at room temperature: electronic optical polarization and state-dependent fluorescence contrast, by leveraging differential pumping and relaxation rates between triplet and ground states. We measure high optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast ${\approx}16.8\%$ of the triplet states at room temperature, along with long coherence times under spin echo and CPMG sequences, $T_2{=}2.7\mu$s and $T_2^{DD}{=}18.4\mu$s respectively, limited only by the triplet lifetimes. The material offers several advantages for quantum sensing, including the ability to grow large ($cm$-scale) crystals at low cost, the absence of paramagnetic impurities, and the diamagnetism of electronic states used for sensing when not optically illuminated. Utilizing pentacene as a representative of a broader class of spin triplet-polarizable organic molecules, this study highlights new potential for quantum sensing in chemical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18499v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For almost 75 years, the general solution for the Schr\"odinger equation was assumed to be generated by an exponential or a time-ordered exponential known as the Dyson series. We study the unitarity of a solution in the case of a singular Hamiltonian and provide a new methodology that is not based on the assumption that the underlying space is $L^{2}(\mathbb{R})$. Then, an alternative operator for generating the time evolution that is manifestly unitary is suggested, regardless of the choice of Hamiltonian. The new construction involves an additional positive operator that normalizes the wave function locally and allows us to preserve unitarity, even when dealing with infinite dimensional or non-normed spaces. Our considerations show that Schr\"odinger and Liouville equations are, in fact, two sides of the same coin and together they provide a unified description for unbounded quantum systems.</description>

      <title>On the choice of non-linear terms in blocking cat states by energy conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] I considered the problem of wavefunction ensembles for spin models. To observe magnetization at finite temperature, I had to add macroscopic nonlinear terms blocking macroscopic superpositions by energy conservation. The nonlinear terms were of the kind introduced in [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017)] to block spatial cats by energy conservation as solution to the Measurement Problem. Reviewing the theory from [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017), arXiv:1908.02352 (2019)], I derive a commutation relation that these nonlinear terms have to satisfy to be admitted and show that the terms of [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017), arXiv:2008.08663 (2020)] restricting the wavefunctions in space satisfies such relations. I generalize the terms of [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] for non-pure spin models and check if they also satisfy the constraints, concluding with a negative answer. An experimental estimate to test the proposal of [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017)] is described at the end.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum coherence has been shown to impact the operational capabilities of quantum systems performing thermodynamic tasks in a significant way, and yet the possibility and conditions for genuine coherence-enhanced thermodynamic operation remain unclear. We show that for steady-state quantum thermal machines -- both autonomous and externally driven -- that interact weakly with thermal reservoirs and work sources, the presence of coherence induced by perturbations in the machine Hamiltonian guarantees a genuine thermodynamic advantage. Such advantage applies both for the cases in which the induced coherence is between levels with different energies or between degenerate levels. On the other hand, we show that engines subjected to noise-induced coherence, can be outperformed by classical stochastic engines using exactly the same set of (incoherent) resources. We illustrate our results with three prototypical models of heat engines and refrigerators and employ multi-objective optimization techniques to characterize quantum-enhanced regimes in connection with the thermodynamic uncertainty relation and beyond it.</description>

Abstract: We explore the potential for hybrid development of quantum hardware where currently available quantum computers simulate open Cavity Quantum Electrodynamical (CQED) systems for applications in optical quantum communication, simulation and computing. Our simulations make use of a recent quantum algorithm that maps the dynamics of a singly excited open Tavis-Cummings model containing N atoms coupled to a lossy cavity. We report the results of executing this algorithm on two noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers: a superconducting processor and a trapped ion processor, to simulate the population dynamics of an open CQED system featuring N = 3 atoms. By applying technology-specific transpilation and error mitigation techniques, we minimize the impact of gate errors, noise, and decoherence in each hardware platform, obtaining results which agree closely with the exact solution of the system. These results can be used as a recipe for efficient and platform-specific quantum simulation of cavity-emitter systems on contemporary and future quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the fundamental limit of quantum transduction via intraband entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum transducer converts an input signal to an output probe at a distant frequency band while maintaining the quantum information with high fidelity, which is crucial for quantum networking and distributed quantum sensing and computing. In terms of microwave-optical quantum transduction, the state-of-the-art quantum transducers suffer low transduction efficiency from weak nonlinear coupling, wherein increasing pump power to enhance efficiency inevitably leads to thermal noise from heating. Moreover, we reveal that the efficiency-bandwidth product of a cavity electro-optical or electro-optomechanical transducer is fundamentally limited by pump power and nonlinear coupling coefficient, irrespective of cavity engineering efforts. To overcome this fundamental limit, we propose to noiselessly boost the transduction efficiency by consuming intraband entanglement (e.g., microwave-microwave or optical-optical entanglement in the case of microwave-optical transduction). Via a squeezer-coupler-antisqueezer sandwich structure, the protocol enhances the transduction efficiency to unity in the ideal lossless case, given an arbitrarily weak pump and nonlinear coupling. In practical cavity systems, our entanglement-assisted protocol surpasses the non-assisted fundamental limit of the efficiency-bandwidth product and reduces the threshold cooperativity for positive quantum capacity by a factor proportional to two-mode squeezing gain. Given a fixed cooperativity, our approach increases the broadband quantum capacity by orders of magnitude. The entanglement-assisted advantage is robust to ancilla loss and cavity detuning.</description>

To check such compatibility, we consider the expectation values of states in $S$ with respect to a chosen observable, with focus on their statistical moments. Our first result is a connection between Haar-randomness and the Dirichlet distribution, providing a closed-form expression for the expectation values, as well as and their statistical moments, including simple bounds for the latter. The average randomness metric compares the measured statistical properties of $S$ with those arising from Dirichlet distribution. When it vanishes, $S$ is compatible with being a $t$-design, as seen through the observable $\Obs$, defined as $\Obs$-shadowed $t$-designs. By permutation- and unitary-equivalent randomization of observable, we are able to extend the analysis of average randomness to statistically verify the compatibility of $S$ with $t$-designs. We envision the use of average randomness verification as a practical test for the randomness sets of states with no prior information available.</description>

      <title>Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study thermalization slowing down of a quantum many-body spin system upon approach to two distinct integrability limits. Motivated by previous studies of classical systems, we identify two thermalization time scales: one quantum Lyapunov time scale is extracted by quantifying operator growth in time on an appropriately defined basis, while another ergodization time scale is related to the statistics of fluctuations of the time-evolved operator around its mean value based on the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis.Using a paradigmatic Quantum Ising chain we find that both timescales diverge upon approach to integrability.We investigate the relative strength of the divergence in the two limits and find that despite significant qualitative differences in the mechanism of integrability breaking, the timescales diverge in a similar fashion.This allows us to establish a universality of integrability breaking in quantum spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Saturation of the Multiparameter Quantum Cram\'er-Rao Bound at the Single-Copy Level with Projective Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum parameter estimation theory is an important component of quantum information theory and provides the statistical foundation that underpins important topics such as quantum system identification and quantum waveform estimation. When there is more than one parameter the ultimate precision in the mean square error given by the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound is not necessarily achievable. For non-full rank quantum states, it was not known when this bound can be saturated (achieved) when only a single copy of the quantum state encoding the unknown parameters is available. This single-copy scenario is important because of its experimental/practical tractability. Recently, necessary and sufficient conditions for saturability of the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound in the multiparameter single-copy scenario have been established in terms of i) the commutativity of a set of projected symmetric logarithmic derivatives and ii) the existence of a unitary solution to a system of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. New sufficient conditions were also obtained that only depend on properties of the symmetric logarithmic derivatives. In this paper, key structural properties of optimal measurements that saturate the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound are illuminated. These properties are exploited to i) show that the sufficient conditions are in fact necessary and sufficient for an optimal measurement to be projective, ii) give an alternative proof of previously established necessary conditions, and iii) describe general POVMs, not necessarily projective, that saturate the multiparameter QCRB. Examples are given where a unitary solution to the system of nonlinear partial differential equations can be explicitly calculated when the required conditions are fulfilled.</description>

      <title>On computing quantum waves and spin from classical action</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06328v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Schr\"odinger equation of quantum physics can be solved analytically using a generalized form of the classical Hamilton-Jacobi least action equation, extending a key result of Feynman. This suggests a smooth transition between physics across scales, and builds on two developments.
  The first is incorporating geometric constraints directly in the classical local least action problem. This leads to multi-valued least action solutions, where each local action is its own set element. For instance, in the double slit experiment or for a particle in a box, spatial inequality constraints create impulsive constraint forces, which lead to multiple paths and create multiple least action branches. Multi-valued least actions may also stem from singularities in the Hamiltonian, as for a particle in a Coulomb potential, or from a closed configuration manifold, as for a spinning particle.
  Second, approximate mappings from action $\Phi$ to wave function $\Psi$ have been suggested since Dirac and even Schr\"odinger. We show that an exact mapping can be constructed by combining the multi-valued least actions with the fluid density $\rho$ of the classical position dynamics, computed from $\Phi$ along each least action branch. Quantum wave collapse corresponds to transitions between multi-valued least action branches at the branch point (position measurement), or to a measurement of the branch index (momentum measurement).
  These coordinate-invariant results provide a simpler computing alternative to Feynman path integrals, as they use only a discrete set of classical paths and avoid zig-zag paths and time-slicing altogether. They extend to the relativistic Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations.</description>

Abstract: How to quickly solve the problem of high-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO)? This problem has attracted much attention because of its importance and wide-range applications. Here we present a quantum algorithm and its corresponding quantum-inspired classical algorithm for this problem, and achieve algorithmic speedup by using gauge symmetry. Specifically we map the HUBO problem to quantum Z2 lattice gauge theory defined on the dual graph, and propose the so-called gauged local quantum annealing (gLQA), which is the local quantum annealing (LQA) protected by the gauge symmetry. By running the quantum-inspired classical algorithm, we demonstrate that gLQA reduces the computational time by one order of magnitude from that of LQA.</description>

      <title>Approximate Contraction of Arbitrary Tensor Networks with a Flexible and Efficient Density Matrix Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09769v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor network contractions are widely used in statistical physics, quantum computing, and computer science. We introduce a method to efficiently approximate tensor network contractions using low-rank approximations, where each intermediate tensor generated during the contractions is approximated as a low-rank binary tree tensor network. The proposed algorithm has the flexibility to incorporate a large portion of the environment when performing low-rank approximations, which can lead to high accuracy for a given rank. Here, the environment refers to the remaining set of tensors in the network, and low-rank approximations with larger environments can generally provide higher accuracy. For contracting tensor networks defined on lattices, the proposed algorithm can be viewed as a generalization of the standard boundary-based algorithms. In addition, the algorithm includes a cost-efficient density matrix algorithm for approximating a tensor network with a general graph structure into a tree structure, whose computational cost is asymptotically upper-bounded by that of the standard algorithm that uses canonicalization. Experimental results indicate that the proposed technique outperforms previously proposed approximate tensor network contraction algorithms for multiple problems in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Quantum Detection of Recurrent Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum dynamics that explore an unexpectedly small fraction of Hilbert space is inherently interesting. Integrable systems, quantum scars, MBL, hidden tensor structures, and systems with gauge symmetries are examples. Beyond dimension and volume, spectral features such as an $O(1)$-density of periodic eigenvalues, or other spectral features, can also imply observable recurrence. Low volume dynamics will recur near its initial state $| \psi_0\rangle$ more rapidly, i.e. $\lVert\mathrm{U}^k | \psi_0\rangle - | \psi_0\rangle \rVert &lt; \epsilon$, is more likely to occur for modest values of $k$, when the (forward) orbit $\operatorname{closure}(\{\mathrm{U}^k\}_{k=1,2,\dots})$ is of relatively low dimension $d$ and relatively small $d$-volume. We describe simple quantum algorithms to detect such approximate recurrence. Applications include detection of certain cases of hidden tensor factorizations $\mathrm{U} \cong V^\dagger(\mathrm{U}_1\otimes \cdots \otimes \mathrm{U}_n)V$. "Hidden" refers to an unknown conjugation, e.g. $\mathrm{U}_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathrm{U}_v \rightarrow V^\dagger(\mathrm{U}_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathrm{U}_n)V$, which will obscure the low-volume nature of the dynamics. Hidden tensor structures have been observed to emerge both in a high energy context of operator-level spontaneous symmetry breaking [FSZ21a, FSZ21b, FSZ21c, SZBF23], and at the opposite end of the intellectual world in linguistics [Smo09, MLDS19]. We collect some observations on the computational difficulty of locating these structures and detecting related spectral information. A technical result, Appendix A, is that the language describing unitary circuits with no spectral gap (NUSG) around 1 is QMA-complete. Appendix B connects the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem to hidden tensor structures.</description>

      <title>Optimizing entanglement in two-qubit systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate entanglement in two-qubit systems using a geometric representation based on the minimum of essential parameters. The latter is achieved by requiring subsystems with the same entropy, regardless of whether the state of the entire system is pure or mixed. The geometric framework is provided by a convex set S that forms a right-triangle, whose points are linked to just two of the coherences of the system under study. As a result, we find that optimized states of two qubits are X-shaped and host pairs of identical populations while reducing the number of coherences involved. A geometric L-measure of entanglement is introduced as the distance between the points in S that represent entangled states and the closest point that defines separable states. It is shown that L reproduces the results of the Hill-Wootters concurrence C, so that C can be interpreted as a distance-like entanglement measure. However, unlike C, the measure L also distinguishes the rank of states. The universality of the two-qubit X-states ensures the utility of our geometric model for studying entanglement of two-qubit states in any configuration. To show the applicability of our approach far beyond time-independent cases, we construct a time-dependent two-qubit state, traced out over the complementary components of a pure tetra-partite system, and find that its one-qubit states share the same entropy. The entanglement measure results bounded from above by the envelope of the minima of such entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum interconnects facilitate entanglement distribution between non-local computational nodes. For superconducting processors, microwave photons are a natural means to mediate this distribution. However, many existing architectures limit node connectivity and directionality. In this work, we construct a chiral quantum interconnect between two nominally identical modules in separate microwave packages. We leverage quantum interference to emit and absorb microwave photons on demand and in a chosen direction between these modules. We optimize the protocol using model-free reinforcement learning to maximize absorption efficiency. By halting the emission process halfway through its duration, we generate remote entanglement between modules in the form of a four-qubit W state with 62.4 +/- 1.6% (leftward photon propagation) and 62.1 +/- 1.2% (rightward) fidelity, limited mainly by propagation loss. A chiral quantum network comprising many modules provides a platform for the exploration of novel many-body physics and quantum simulation. This quantum network architecture enables all-to-all connectivity between non-local processors for modular and extensible quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Effects of Quadratic Optomechanical Coupling on Bipartite Entanglements, Mechanical Ground-State Cooling and Squeezing in an Electro-Optomechanical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the steady-state bipartite entanglements, mechanical ground-state cooling, and mechanical quadrature squeezing in a hybrid electro-optomechanical system where a moving membrane is linearly coupled to the microwave field mode of an LC circuit, while it simultaneously interacts both linearly and quadratically with the radiation pressure of a single-mode optical cavity. We show that by choosing a suitable sign and amplitude for the quadratic optomechanical coupling (QOC), one can achieve enhanced and thermally robust stationary bipartite entanglement between the subsystems, improved mechanical ground-state cooling, and Q-quadrature squeezing of the mechanical mode beyond the 3-dB limit of squeezing. In particular, we find that in the presence of QOC with negative sign and in the resolved sideband regime the bipartite optical-mechanical entanglement can be increased by about 2 order of magnitude around the temperature of 1mK, and it can be preserved against thermal noise up to the ambient temperature of 0.1K. Furthermore, the QOC with positive sign can give rise to the enhancement of the mechanical ground-state cooling by about 1 order of magnitude in the optical and microwave red-detuned regime. We also find that for the positive sign of QOC and near the microwave resonance frequency the squeezing degree of the Q-quadrature of the mechanical mode can be amplified up to 15 dB. Such a hybrid electro-optomechanical system can serve as a promising platform to engineer an improved entangled source for quantum sensing as well as quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamical behavior of the non-Hermitian Wannier-Stark ladder system, which is a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain with a position-dependent real potential. In the presence of a linear external field, we employ the non-Hermitian Floquet method and find that the energy levels are sensitive to the field. The system exhibits two distinct dynamic behaviors separated by an exceptional point: one in the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetrical region associated with two real Wannier-Stark ladders, and another in the $\mathcal{PT}$\ symmetry-breaking region associated with complex conjugate ladders. As the boundary between the two regions, two ladders coalesce into a single ladder. In the case of a non-linear field, these two distinct regions appear alternately along the chain, exhibiting dynamic Moir\'{e}-like patterns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dimension of a quantum state is traditionally seen as the number of superposed distinguishable states in a given basis. We propose an absolute, i.e.~basis-independent, notion of dimensionality for ensembles of quantum states. It is based on whether a quantum ensemble can be simulated with states confined to arbitrary lower-dimensional subspaces and classical postprocessing. In order to determine the absolute dimension of quantum ensembles, we develop both analytical witness criteria and a semidefinite programming criterion based on the ensemble's information capacity. Furthermore, we construct explicit simulation models for arbitrary ensembles of pure quantum states subject to white noise, and in natural cases we prove their optimality. Also, efficient numerical methods are provided for simulating generic ensembles. Finally, we discuss the role of absolute dimensionality in high-dimensional quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transporting and connecting quantum states are key capabilities for larger-scale quantum information processing. Concrete challenges are the coherent shuttling and the manipulation of distant quantum states in an optical lattice. Here, we create spin singlet pairs of two magnetic states of fermionic potassium-40 atoms in an optical lattice and use a bi-directional topological Thouless pump to transport, coherently split, and separate the pairs, as well as to demonstrate interaction between them via tuneable $($swap$)^\alpha$-gate operations. We achieve pair pumping with a single-shift fidelity of 99.78(3)% over 50 lattice sites and split the pairs within a decoherence-free subspace. Gates are implemented by superexchange interaction, allowing us to produce interwoven spin singlets. For read-out, we apply a magnetic field gradient, resulting in single- and multi-frequency singlet-triplet oscillations. Our work shows avenues to create complex patterns of entanglement and new approaches to quantum processing, sensing, and atom interferometry.</description>

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) can secure cryptographic communication between two distant users, as guaranteed by the laws of quantum mechanics rather than computational assumptions. The twin-field scheme, which employs counter-propagated weak coherent light pulses, doubles the secure distance of standard QKD without using quantum repeaters. Here, we study a method to extend the twin-field key distribution protocol to a scheme for multi-party quantum key agreement. We study our protocol's security using a minimum error discrimination analysis and derive the asymptotic key rate based on the entanglement-based source-replacement scheme. We also simulate it on the ANSYS Interconnect platform with optical components to study the protocol's performance in certain practical situations.</description>

      <title>A Simple Scheme for Preparation of the Approximate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill States with Random Walk Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) coding is proven to be a good candidate for encoding a qubit on continuous variables (CV) since it is robust under random-shift disturbance. Its preparation in optical systems, however, is challenging to realize in nowadays state-of-the-art experiments. In this article, we propose a simple optical setup for preparing the approximate GKP states by employing a random walk mechanism. We demonstrate this idea by considering the encoding on the transverse position of a single-mode pulse laser. We also discuss generalization and translation to other types of physical CV systems.</description>

      <title>Enaction for QBists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper began as a set of notes introducing quantum physicists of the QBist persuasion to enactive theory. Unlike mainstream cognitive science, which views cognition as computations on internal representations of the external world (and thus the mind as in the head), the enactive approach sees cognition as adaptive, embodied action. Enaction can ground concepts of experience, agency, knowledge, and normativity - which play key roles in QBist quantum mechanics - in terms consistent with QBism's participatory approach. That's because QBism and enaction both reject an absolute, pregiven subject-object split: for QBism, quantum measurement is the enactment of the subject-object divide; for enaction, cognition is the enactment of that divide. Indeed, each appears to be half of the same story. QBism is a theory of how the world is created and recreated through interactions with an agent, while enaction is a theory of how agents are created and recreated through interactions with the world. Through conversations with QBists and enactivists, these notes evolved into a larger project aimed at unifying QBist physics with enactive cognitive science. Taken together, they offer the possibility of a unified metaphysics - one that brings subject and object, mind and world, back together again.</description>

      <title>Processing and Decoding Rydberg Leakage Error with MBQC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutral atom array has emerged as a promising platform for quantum computation due to its high-fidelity two-qubit gate, arbitrary connectivity and remarkable scalability. However, achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing with neutral atom necessitates careful consideration of the errors inherent to these systems. One typical error is the leakage from Rydberg states during the implementation of multi-qubit gates, which induces two-qubit error chain and degrades the error distance. To address this, researchers have proposed an erasure conversion protocol that employs fast leakage detection and continuous atomic replacement to convert leakage errors into benign erasure errors. While this method achieves a favorable error distance de = d, its applicability is restricted to certain atom species. In this work, we present a novel approach to manage Rydberg leakage errors in measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). From a hardware perspective, we utilize practical experimental techniques along with an adaptation of the Pauli twirling approximation (PTA) to mitigate the impacts of leakage errors, which propagate similarly to Pauli errors without degrading the error distance. From a decoding perspective, we leverage the inherent structure of topological cluster states and final leakage detection information to locate propagated errors from Rydberg leakage. This approach eliminates the need for mid-circuit leakage detection, while maintaining an error distance de = d and achieving a high threshold of 3.4% per CZ gate for pure leakage errors under perfect final leakage detection. Furthermore, in the presence of additional Pauli errors, our protocol demonstrates comparable logical error rates to the erasure conversion method within a reasonable range of physical errors.</description>

      <title>Can Schroedingerist Wavefunction Physics Explain Brownian Motion? III: A One-Dimensional Heavy and Light Particles Model Exhibiting Brownian-Motion-Like Trajectories and Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two prior papers of this series, it was proposed that a wavefunction model of a heavy particle and a collection of light particles might generate ``Brownian-Motion-Like" trajectories as well as diffusive motion (displacement proportional to the square-root of time) of the heavy particle, but did not exhibit a concrete instance. Here we introduce a one-space-dimensional model which, granted a finite perturbation series, fulfills the criteria for BML trajectories and diffusion. We note that Planck's constant makes an appearance in the diffusion coefficient, which further differentiates the present theory from the work of Poincare and Einstein in the previous century.</description>

Abstract: Designs, structures connected to averaging with respect to a given measure using finite sets of points, have proven themselves as invaluable tools across the field of quantum information, finding their uses in state and process tomography, key distribution and others. In this work, we introduce a new concept of pushforward designs, which allows us to obtain new structures from already existing ones by mapping them between the spaces, with specific examples including simplex designs and mixed state designs from complex projective designs. Based on the general concept, we put forward a structure called channel $[t,k]$-design, allowing for averaging over space of quantum channels for systems in contact with an environment of dimension $k$. Based on this notion, we introduce the concept of effective environment dimensionality $k^*$, which we estimate for the IBM Kyoto quantum computer to be below $2.2$ for times up to $350\mu\text{s}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11097v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Competition among repetitive measurements of noncommuting observables and unitary dynamics can give rise to a rich variety of entanglement phases. We here characterize topological phases in monitored quantum systems by their spectrum and many-body topological invariants. We analyze (1+1)-dimensional monitored circuits for Majorana fermions, which have topological and trivial area-law entangled phases and a critical phase with sub-volume-law entanglement, through the Lyapunov spectrum. We uncover the presence (absence) of edge-localized zero modes inside the bulk gap in the topological (trivial) area-law phase and a bulk gapless spectrum in the critical phase. Furthermore, by suitably exploiting the fermion parity with twisted measurement outcomes at the boundary, we construct a topological invariant that sharply distinguishes the two area-law phases and dynamically characterizes the critical phase. Our work thus paves the way to extend the bulk-edge correspondence for topological phases from equilibrium to monitored quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Assessing fault-tolerant quantum advantage for $k$-SAT with structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For many problems, quantum algorithms promise speedups over their classical counterparts. However, these results predominantly rely on asymptotic worst-case analysis, which overlooks significant overheads due to error correction and the fact that real-world instances often contain exploitable structure. In this work, we employ the hybrid benchmarking method to evaluate the potential of quantum Backtracking and Grover's algorithm against the 2023 SAT competition main track winner in solving random $k$-SAT instances with tunable structure, designed to represent industry-like scenarios, using both $T$-depth and $T$-count as cost metrics to estimate quantum run times. Our findings reproduce the results of Campbell, Khurana, and Montanaro (Quantum '19) in the unstructured case using hybrid benchmarking. However, we offer a more sobering perspective in practically relevant regimes: almost all quantum speedups vanish, even asymptotically, when minimal structure is introduced or when $T$-count is considered instead of $T$-depth. Moreover, when the requirement is for the algorithm to find a solution within a single day, we find that only Grover's algorithm has the potential to outperform classical algorithms, but only in a very limited regime and only when using $T$-depth. We also discuss how more sophisticated heuristics could restore the asymptotic scaling advantage for quantum backtracking, but our findings suggest that the potential for practical quantum speedups in more structured $k$-SAT solving will remain limited.</description>

      <title>Topological phases of unitary dynamics: Classification in Clifford category</title>

Abstract: A quantum cellular automaton (QCA) or a causal unitary is by definition an automorphism of local operator algebra, by which local operators are mapped to local operators. Quantum circuits of small depth, local Hamiltonian evolutions for short time, and translations (shifts) are examples. A Clifford QCA is one that maps any Pauli operator to a finite tensor product of Pauli operators. Here, we obtain a complete table of groups $\mathfrak C(\mathsf d,p)$ of translation invariant Clifford QCA in any spatial dimension $\mathsf d \ge 0$ modulo Clifford quantum circuits and shifts over prime $p$-dimensional qudits, where the circuits and shifts are allowed to obey only coarser translation invariance. The group $\mathfrak C(\mathsf d,p)$ is nonzero only for $\mathsf d = 2k+3$ if $p=2$ and $\mathsf d = 4k+3$ if $p$ is odd where~$k \ge 0$ is any integer, in which case $\mathfrak C(\mathsf d,p) \cong \widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_p)$, the classical Witt group of nonsingular quadratic forms over the finite field $\mathbb F_p$. It is well known that $\widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_2) \cong \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$, $\widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_p) \cong \mathbb Z/4\mathbb Z$ if $p = 3 \bmod 4$, and $\widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_p)\cong \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z \oplus \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$ if $p = 1 \bmod 4$. The classification is achieved by a dimensional descent, which is a reduction of Laurent extension theorems for algebraic $L$-groups of surgery theory in topology.</description>

      <title>Many-body effects in a composite bosonic Josephson junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In standard bosonic Josephson junctions (BJJs), particles tunnel between two single-well potentials linked by a finite barrier. The dynamics of standard BJJs have been extensively studied, both at the many-body and mean-field levels of theory. In the present work, we introduce the concept of a composite BJJ. In a composite BJJ, particles tunnel between two double-well potentials linked by a finite potential barrier between them. We focus on many-body facets of quantum dynamics and investigate how the complex structure of the junction influences tunneling. Employing the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree for bosons method, highly-accurate many-boson wave-functions are obtained from which properties are computed. We analyze the dynamics using the survival probability, the degree of fragmentation of the junction, and the fluctuations of observables, and discuss how many-boson tunneling behaves, and how it may be controlled, using the composite nature of the junction. A central result of this work relates to the degree of fragmentation of composite BJJs with different numbers of bosons. We provide strong evidence that a universal degree of fragmentation into multiple time-dependent modes takes place. Further applications are briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate coherent Doppler-free three-photon excitation of the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{0}$ optical clock transition and the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{1}$ intercombination transition in free-space thermal clouds of $^{88}$Sr atoms. By appropriate orientation of the wavevectors of three lasers incident on the atoms, the first-order Doppler shift can be eliminated for all velocity classes. Three-photon excitation of the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{1}$ transition enables high-contrast Ramsey spectroscopy with interrogation times comparable to the 21$\mu$s natural lifetime using a single near-resonant laser source. Three-photon spectroscopy on the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{0}$ clock transition, using only laser frequencies nearly resonant with the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{0}$ and $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{1}$ transitions, enables a reduction in Doppler broadening by two orders of magnitude and a corresponding $\sim470$Hz linewidth without a confining potential.</description>

Abstract: Quantum machine learning is a new research field combining quantum information science and machine learning. Quantum computing technologies appear to be particularly well-suited for addressing problems in the health sector efficiently. They have the potential to handle large datasets more effectively than classical models and offer greater transparency and interpretability for clinicians. Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative brain disorder that mostly affects elderly people, causing important cognitive impairments. It is the most common cause of dementia and it has an effect on memory, thought, learning abilities and movement control. This type of disease has no cure, consequently an early diagnosis is fundamental for reducing its impact. The analysis of handwriting can be effective for diagnosing, as many researches have conjectured. The DARWIN (Diagnosis AlzheimeR WIth haNdwriting) dataset contains handwriting samples from people affected by Alzheimer's disease and a group of healthy people. Here we apply quantum AI to this use-case. In particular, we use this dataset to test classical methods for classification and compare their performances with the ones obtained via quantum machine learning methods. We find that quantum methods generally perform better than classical methods. Our results pave the way for future new quantum machine learning applications in early-screening diagnostics in the healthcare domain.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that rotation symmetry is not a necessary requirement for the existence of fractional corner charges in Cn-symmetric higher-order topological crystalline insulators. Instead, it is sufficient to have a latent rotation symmetry, which may be revealed upon performing an isospectral reduction on the system. We introduce the concept of a filling anomaly for latent crystalline symmetric systems, and propose modified topological invariants. The notion of higher-order topology in two dimensions protected by Cn symmetry is thus generalized to a protection by latent symmetry. Our claims are corroborated by concrete examples of models that show non-trivial corner charge in the absence of Cn-symmetry. This work extends the classification of topological crystalline insulators to include latent symmetries.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Emergent Spacetime Supersymmetry with Rydberg Atom Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08194v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the zoo of emergent symmetries in quantum many-body physics, the previously unrealized emergent spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) is particularly intriguing. Although it was known that spacetime SUSY could emerge at the (1+1)d tricritical Ising transition, an experimental realization is still absent. In this work, we propose to realize emergent spacetime SUSY using reconfigurable Rydberg atom arrays featuring two distinct sets of Rydberg excitations, tailored for implementation on dual-species platforms. In such systems, the spacetime SUSY manifests itself in the respective correlation functions of a bosonic mode and its fermionic partner. However, the correlation function of the fermionic mode inevitably involves a string operator, making direct measurement challenging in the conventional setting. Here, we leverage the hybrid analog-digital nature of the Rydberg atom arrays, which allows for the simulation of a physical Hamiltonian and the execution of a digital quantum circuit on the same platform. This hybrid protocol offers a new perspective for uncovering the hidden structure of emergent spacetime SUSY.</description>

Abstract: Symmetry imposes constraints on open quantum systems, affecting the dissipative properties in nonequilibrium processes. Superradiance is a typical example in which the decay rate of the system is enhanced via a collective system-bath coupling that respects permutation symmetry. Such model has also been applied to heat engines. However, a generic framework that addresses the impact of symmetry in finite-time thermodynamics is not well established. Here, we show a symmetry-based framework that describes the fundamental limit of collective enhancement in finite-time thermodynamics. Specifically, we derive a general upper bound on the average jump rate, which quantifies the fundamental speed set by thermodynamic speed limits and trade-off relations. We identify the symmetry condition which achieves the obtained bound, and explicitly construct an open quantum system model that goes beyond the enhancement realized by the conventional superradiance model.</description>

      <title>Efficient cryogenic nonlinear conversion processes in periodically-poled thin-film lithium niobate waveguides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodically poled thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) waveguides, which enable efficient quadratic nonlinear processes, serve as crucial foundation for classical and quantum signal processing. To expand their application scope, we provide the first investigation of nonlinear conversion processes in periodically poled TFLN waveguides at cryogenic condition (7 K). Through systematic experimental characterization, we find that the periodically poled TFLN waveguide retains its high conversion efficiency at both cryogenic and room temperatures for both classical second-harmonic generation and quantum photon-pair generation processes. Particularly, the photon-pair source at cryogenic condition shows high brightness and broad bandwidth. These results demonstrate the significant potential of TFLN wavelength conversion devices for cryogenic applications and foster future scalable quantum photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Tunneling in a Lorenz-like model for an active wave-particle entity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active wave-particle entities (WPEs) emerge as self-propelled oil droplets on the free surface of a vibrating oil bath. The particle (droplet) periodically imprints decaying waves on the liquid surface which in turn guide the particle motion, resulting in a two-way coupling between the particle and its self-generated waves. Such WPEs have been shown to exhibit hydrodynamic analogs of various quantum features. In this work, we theoretically and numerically explore a dynamical analog of tunneling by considering a simple setup of a one-dimensional WPE incident on an isolated Gaussian potential barrier. Our idealized model takes the form of a perturbed Lorenz system which we use to explore the dynamics and statistics of barrier crossing as a function of initial conditions and system parameters. Our work highlights that velocity fluctuations of the WPE at high memories that are rooted in non-equilibrium features of the Lorenz system, such as spiraling motion towards equilibrium points and transient chaos, give rise to - (i) sensitivity and unpredictability in barrier crossing, (ii) smooth variations in transmission probability as a function of system parameters, and (iii) wave-like features in the transmitted and reflected probability density profiles.</description>

      <title>$SU(\infty)$ Quantum Gravity and Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We highlight the structure and properties of an abstract approach to quantum cosmology and gravity, dubbed $SU(\infty)$-QGR. Beginning from the concept of the Universe as an isolated quantum system, the main axiom of is the existence of an infinite number of mutually commuting observables. Consequently, the Hilbert space of the Universe represents $SU(\infty)$ symmetry. This Universe as a whole is static and topological. Nonetheless, quantum fluctuations induce local clustering in its quantum state and divide it into approximately isolated subsystems representing $G \times SU(\infty)$, where $G$ is a generic finite-rank internal symmetry. Due to the global $SU(\infty)$ subsystems are entangled to the rest of the Universe. In addition to parameters characterizing the representation of $G$, their quantum states depend on four continuous parameters: two of them characterize the representation of $SU(\infty)$, a dimensionful parameter arises from the possibility of comparing representations of $SU(\infty)$ by different subsystems; the fourth parameter is a measurable used as time registered by an arbitrary subsystem chosen as a clock. It introduces a relative dynamics for subsystems, formulated by a symmetry-invariant effective Lagrangian defined on the (3+1)D space of the continuous parameters. At lowest quantum order, the Lagrangian is a Yang--Mills field theory for both $SU(\infty)$ and internal symmetries. We identify the common $SU(\infty)$ symmetry and its interaction with gravity. Consequently, $SU(\infty)$-QGR predicts a spin-1 mediator for quantum gravity (QGR). Apparently, this is in contradiction with classical gravity. Nonetheless, we show that an observer who is unable to detect the quantumness of gravity perceives its effect as curvature of the space of average values of the continuous parameters. We demonstrate Lorentzian geometry of this emergent classical spacetime.</description>

      <title>The molecular nature of superfluidity: Viscosity of helium from quantum stochastic molecular dynamics simulations over real trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19036v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using quantum equations of motion for interacting bosons, stochastic molecular dynamics simulations with quantized momenta are performed for Lennard-Jones helium-4. The viscosity of the quantum liquid is significantly less than that of the classical liquid, being almost 5 times smaller at the lowest temperature studied. The classical and quantum liquids are identical except for Bose-Einstein condensation, which pinpoints the molecular mechanism for superfluidity. The results rely on the existence of stochastic but real particle trajectories, which has implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Topological edge states at Floquet quantum criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15395v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topologically protected edge states exactly at topological phase boundaries challenge the conventional belief that topological states must be associated with a bulk energy gap. Because periodically driven (Floquet) systems host unusually intricate topological phase boundaries, topological edge states can be prolific at such Floquet quantum criticality. Working on a class of chiral-symmetric, Floquet-driven Majorana fermion chains, we analytically and computationally show that the precise boundaries between different Floquet topological gapped phases can accommodate topological edge modes, including the so-called Majorana $\pi$ modes. We also identify a general bulk-edge correspondence formula to predict and understand the emergence of topological edge modes at Floquet quantum criticality. Of direct interest to quantum simulation experiments, our results break new grounds for studies of nonequilibrium topological phases of matter undergoing topological phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intels efforts to build a practical quantum computer are focused on developing a scalable spin-qubit platform leveraging industrial high-volume semiconductor manufacturing expertise and 300 mm fabrication infrastructure. Here, we provide an overview of the design, fabrication, and demonstration of a new customized quantum test chip, which contains 12-quantum-dot spin-qubit linear arrays, code named Tunnel Falls. These devices are fabricated using immersion and extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV), along with other standard high-volume manufacturing (HVM) processes, as well as production-level process control. We present key device features and fabrication details, as well as qubit characterization results confirming device functionality. These results corroborate our fabrication methods and are a crucial step towards scaling of extensible 2D qubit array schemes.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing electronic phases of matter using photonic correlation functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past couple of decades, there have been significant advances in measuring quantum properties of light, such as quadratures of squeezed light and single-photon counting. Here, we explore whether such tools can be leveraged to probe electronic correlations in the many-body quantum regime. Specifically, we show that it is possible to probe certain spin, charge, and topological orders in an electronic system by measuring the correlation functions of scattered photons. We construct a mapping from the correlators of the scattered photons to those of a correlated insulator, particularly for Mott insulators described by a single-band Fermi-Hubbard model at half-filling. We show that frequency filtering before photodetection plays a crucial role in determining this mapping. We find that if the ground state of the insulator is a gapped spin liquid, a photon-pair correlation function, i.e., $G^{(2)}$, can detect the presence of anyonic excitations with fractional mutual statistics. Moreover, we show that correlations between electromagnetic quadratures can be used to detect expectation values of static spin chirality operators on both the kagome and triangular lattices, thus being useful in detecting chiral spin liquids. More generally, we show that a series of hitherto unmeasured spin-spin and spin-charge correlation functions of the material can be extracted from photonic correlations. This work opens up access to probe correlated materials, beyond the linear response paradigm, by detecting quantum properties of scattered light.</description>

      <title>Chaos in hyperscaling violating Lifshitz theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We holographically study quantum chaos in hyperscaling-violating Lifshitz (HVL) theories (with charge). Specifically, we present a detailed computation of the out-of-time ordered correlator (OTOC) via shockwave analysis in the bulk HVL geometry with a planar horizon topology. We also compute the butterfly velocity ($v_{B}$) using the entanglement wedge reconstruction and find that it matches the result obtained from the shockwave analysis. Using a recently developed thermodynamic dictionary for HVL theories, we express $v_B$ purely in terms of boundary thermodynamic variables. Furthermore, we analyze in detail the behavior of $v_{B}$ with respect to the dynamical critical exponent ($z$), hyperscaling-violating parameter ($\theta$), entropy (more precisely, the ratio of entropy to the central charge, $\tilde{S}$), and charge (more precisely, the ratio of charge to the central charge, $\tilde{Q}$). Interestingly, $v_B$ varies non-monotonically with $z$ for $\tilde{S} &lt; 1$, whereas it increases monotonically with $z$ for $\tilde{S} \geq 1$. Additionally, $v_B$ varies non-monotonically with $\theta$ for non-zero charge. Moreover, $v_B$ monotonically increases with $\tilde{S}$ and decreases with $\tilde{Q}$ for all allowed values of $z$ and $\theta$. All these features are reported for combinations /{$z$, $\theta$, $\tilde{S}$, $\tilde{Q}$/} for which the temperature is positive, the null energy condition is satisfied, and $v_B$ is not superluminal. Unpacking the non-monotonicities in $v_B$ can offer interesting insights into these theories.</description>

      <title>Cryptographic tests of the python's lunch conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the AdS/CFT correspondence, a subregion of the CFT allows for the recovery of a corresponding subregion of the bulk known as its entanglement wedge. In some cases, an entanglement wedge contains a locally but not globally minimal surface homologous to the CFT subregion, in which case it is said to contain a python's lunch. It has been proposed that python's lunch geometries should be modelled by tensor networks that feature projective operations where the wedge narrows. This model leads to the python's lunch (PL) conjecture, which asserts that reconstructing information from past the locally minimal surface is computationally difficult. In this work, we invoke cryptographic tools pertaining to a primitive known as the Conditional Disclosure of Secrets (CDS) to develop consequences of the projective tensor network model that can be checked directly in AdS/CFT. We argue from the tensor network picture that the mutual information between appropriate CFT subregions is lower bounded linearly by an area difference associated with the geometry of the lunch. Recalling that the mutual information is also computed by bulk extremal surfaces, this gives a checkable geometrical consequence of the tensor network model. We prove weakened versions of this geometrical statement in asymptotically AdS$_{2+1}$ spacetimes satisfying the null energy condition, and confirm it in some example geometries, supporting the tensor network model and by proxy the PL conjecture. On the other hand, we point out a tension between the PL conjecture and a plausible cryptographically inspired lower bound on the mutual information involving the complexity of reconstructing operators inside the lunch; this suggests the existence of protocols for computationally secure CDS requiring unexpectedly small entanglement.</description>

      <title>Generalised second law beyond the semiclassical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the generalised second law (GSL), with an appropriate modification, holds in perturbative gravity to all orders beyond the semiclassical limit and without a UV cutoff imposed on the fields. Our proof uses algebraic techniques and builds on the recent work of Faulkner and Speranza, which combined Wall's proof of the GSL with the identification of generalised entropy as the von Neumann entropy of a boost-invariant crossed product algebra. The key additional step in our approach is to further impose invariance under null translations. Doing so requires one to describe horizon exterior regions in a relational manner, so we introduce `dynamical cuts': quantum reference frames which give the location of a cut of the horizon. We use idealised dynamical cuts, but expect that our methods can be generalised to more realistic models. The modified GSL that we prove says that the difference in generalised entropies of the regions outside two dynamical cuts is bounded below by the free energy of the degrees of freedom giving the location of the later cut. If one takes a semiclassical limit, imposes a UV cutoff, and requires the cuts to obey certain energy conditions, then our result reduces to the standard GSL.</description>

      <title>Random Circuits in the Black Hole Interior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a quantitative holographic relation between a microscopic measure of randomness and the geometric length of the wormhole in the black hole interior. To this end, we perturb an AdS black hole with Brownian semiclassical sources, implementing the continuous version of a random quantum circuit for the black hole. We use the random circuit to prepare ensembles of states of the black hole whose semiclassical duals contain Einstein-Rosen (ER) caterpillars: long cylindrical wormholes with large numbers of matter inhomogeneities, of linearly growing length with the circuit time. In this setup, we show semiclassically that the ensemble of ER caterpillars of average length $k\ell_{\Delta}$ and matter correlation scale $\ell_{\Delta}$ forms an approximate quantum state $k$-design of the black hole. At exponentially long circuit times, the ensemble of ER caterpillars becomes polynomial-copy indistinguishable from a collection of random states of the black hole. We comment on the implications of these results for holographic circuit complexity and for the holographic description of the black hole interior.</description>

      <title>The Wehrl-type entropy conjecture for symmetric $SU(N)$ coherent states: cases of equality and stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lieb and Solovej proved that, for the symmetric $SU(N)$ representations, the corresponding Wehrl-type entropy is minimized by symmetric coherent states. However, the uniqueness of the minimizers remained an open problem when $N\geq 3$. In this note we complete the proof of the Wehrl entropy conjecture for such representations, by showing that symmetric coherent states are, in fact, the only minimizers. We also provide an application to the maximum concentration of holomorphic polynomials and deduce a corresponding Faber-Krahn inequality. A sharp quantitative form of the bound by Lieb and Solovej is also proved.</description>
