      <title>The JWST/MIRI view of the planetary nebula NGC 6302 I.: a UV irradiated torus and a hot bubble triggering PAH formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NGC 6302 is a spectacular bipolar planetary nebula (PN) whose spectrum exhibits fast outflows and highly ionized emission lines, indicating the presence of a very hot central star (~220,000 K). Its infrared spectrum reveals a mixed oxygen and carbon dust chemistry, displaying both silicate and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features. Using the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) and Medium Resolution Spectrometer, a mosaic map was obtained over the core of NGC 6302, covering the wavelength range of 5--28 micron and spanning an area of ~18.5 arcsec x15 arcsec. The spatially resolved spectrum reveals ~200 molecular and ionized lines from species requiring ionisation potentials of up to 205 eV. The spatial distributions highlight a complex structure at the nebula's centre. Highly ionized species such as Mg VII and Si VII show compact structures, while lower-ionization species such as H^+ extend much farther outwards, forming filament-defined rims that delineate a bubble. Within the bubble, the H^+ and H_2 emission coincide, while the PAH emission appears farther out, indicating an ionization structure distinct from typical photodissociation regions, such as the Orion Bar. This may be the first identification of a PAH formation site in a PN. This PN appears to be shaped not by a steady, continuous outflow, but by a series of dynamic, impulsive bubble ejections, creating local conditions conducive to PAH formation. A dusty torus surrounds the core, primarily composed of large (micron-sized) silicate grains with crystalline components. The long-lived torus contains a substantial mass of material, which could support an equilibrium chemistry and a slow dust-formation process.</description>

      <title>Bifrost Models of the Quiet Sun. I. Comparison with Solar Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the emergence of magnetic fields is essential for understanding the physical mechanisms behind various phenomena in the solar atmosphere. Most importantly, the emerging fields offer valuable insights into how energy and mass are transferred to the upper solar atmosphere. As a result, they have garnered significant attention from both observational and theoretical perspectives. In this article, we present two models of quiet-Sun-like magnetic fields generated by the Bifrost code. We compare these models with observations from the Swedish 1-meter Solar Telescope (SST) and the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). By tracking the magnetic features in both the SST and Bifrost data, we determine the similarities and differences between the fields identified in the models and those observed. We conduct a quantitative comparison of various properties, such as flux content, flux densities, horizontal and line-of-sight velocities, lifetimes, sizes, and surface interactions. Additionally, we identify and analyze the properties of the largest emerging bipoles in the SST and Bifrost data. Our findings indicate that the magnetic bipoles in the Bifrost simulations are generally stronger than those observed with the SST. However, a qualitative comparison of the chromospheric and transition region responses to the emerging fields in the Bifrost models, SST, and IRIS observations shows similar heating processes occurring above and around the emerging fields. Finally, we outline our plans for future work aimed at studying the emergence of magnetic fields in the quiet Sun, with a particular focus on the chromosphere and upper atmospheric layers.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of oscillations for axisymmetric solar backgrounds with differential rotation and gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local helioseismology comprises of imaging and inversion techniques employed to reconstruct the dynamic and interior of the Sun from correlations of oscillations observed on the surface, all of which require modeling solar oscillations and computing Green's kernels. In this context, we implement and investigate the robustness of the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method in solving the equation modeling stellar oscillations for realistic solar backgrounds containing gravity and differential rotation. While a common choice for modeling stellar oscillations is the Galbrun's equation, our working equations are derived from an equivalent variant, involving less regularity in its coefficients, working with Lagrangian displacement and pressure perturbation as unknowns. Under differential rotation and axisymmetric assumption, the system is solved in azimuthal decomposition with the HDG method. Compared to no-gravity approximations, the mathematical nature of the wave operator is now linked to the profile of the solar buoyancy frequency N which encodes gravity, and leads to distinction into regions of elliptic or hyperbolic behavior of the wave operator at zero attenuation. While small attenuation is systematically included to guarantee theoretical well-posedness, the above phenomenon affects the numerical solutions in terms of amplitude and oscillation pattern, and requires a judicious choice of stabilization. We investigate the stabilization of the HDG discretization scheme, and demonstrate its importance to ensure the accuracy of numerical results, which is shown to depend on frequencies relative to N, and on the position of the Dirac source. As validations, the numerical power spectra reproduce accurately the observed effects of the solar rotation on acoustic waves.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismology of Carbon-Deficient Red Giants: Merger Products of Hierarchical Triple Systems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon-deficient giants (CDGs) are a rare and chemically peculiar class of stars whose origins remain under active investigation. We present an asteroseismic analysis of the entire known CDG population, selecting 129 stars observed by $Kepler$, K2, and TESS to obtain seismic constraints. We detect solar-like oscillations in 43 CDGs. By measuring $\nu_{\rm max}$ and applying seismic scaling relations, we determine precise masses for these stars, finding that 79\% are low-mass ($M \lesssim 2~M_\odot$). The luminosity distribution is bimodal, and the CDGs separate into three chemically and evolutionarily distinct groups, characterized by clear trends in sodium and CNO abundances, $\alpha$-element enhancement, and kinematics. We find that two of these groups are only distinguished by their initial $\alpha$-element abundances, thus effectively reducing the number of groups to two. Lithium enrichment is common across all groups, linking CDGs to lithium-rich giants and suggesting a shared evolutionary origin. We find that spectroscopic $\log g$ is systematically offset from seismic values. Group~1 CDG patterns are most consistent with formation through core He-flash mixing, while the more massive and more chemically processed Groups~2 and 2$\alpha$ likely formed through mergers involving helium white dwarfs, possibly in hierarchical triples. Pollution from AGB stars appears very unlikely, given the unchanged [C+N+O] abundance across all groups.</description>

      <title>Cocoon-to-Butterfly Transformation in Protoplanetary Nebula: Detection of a Spherical Halo and a Barrel-shaped Torus in IRAS 06530$-$0213</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoplanetary nebulae (PPNs) represent a critical evolutionary bridging stage between the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and planetary nebula (PN) stages. Their dynamical structures provide key insights into late stellar evolution. Here, we report CO and $^{13}$CO imaging observations of the carbon-rich PPN IRAS 06530$-$0213, a source exhibiting the unidentified 21 micron emission band, conducted with the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA). The CO maps reveal a spherical halo (diameter $\sim10''$) surrounding a central barrel-shaped torus, where the torus displays an inner diameter of $\sim1.5''$ and an outer diameter of $\sim2''$. Through three-dimensional morpho-kinematic modeling with the SHAPE software, we determine that IRAS 06530$-$0213 experienced its final thermal pulse during the AGB phase $\sim6500$ years ago, transitioning into the PPN phase $\sim4500$ years ago. Our analysis indicates that the blue-shifted CO emission, a feature also detected in several other PPNs and PNs previously misattributed to the interstellar clouds, actually originates from the obscuration of the central nebula by the remnant AGB halo. These findings are expected to deepen our understanding of the dynamical structures of PPNs, as well as their pivotal transitional role in the late-stage evolution of low-to-intermediate mass stars.</description>

      <title>The evolutionary and asteroseismic imprints of mass accretion. The 10 M$_\odot$ $\beta$ Cep case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structural and asteroseismic consequences of mass accretion in massive stars within close binary systems. Using MESA, we model the evolution of the 10 M$_{\odot}$ accretor through and after a Roche lobe overflow phase. In addition to changing the surface composition of the star, mass accretion also significantly modifies the internal structure by expanding the convective core and altering chemical stratification near the core-envelope boundary. This partial core rejuvenation creates a distinct mean molecular weight gradient and leaves a persistent local density modulation. In the late stages of mass transfer, changes in density and sound-speed profiles become apparent and influence stellar oscillations. We analyse the asteroseismic properties of the post-mass transfer models compared to single stars of the same mass and central hydrogen abundance. In the gravity mode regime, the altered Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency leads to period spacing patterns with larger amplitudes and phase shifts. For low and intermediate-order pressure modes, we find systematic frequency deviations linked to changes in the sound-speed profile. Weight function analyses confirm that these differences arise primarily from structural modifications near the convective core boundary. Furthermore, small frequency separations, sensitive to localised sound-speed gradients, reveal periodic variations attributable to the density discontinuity at the convective core edge. The accretor exhibits a larger sound-speed gradient integral and a longer acoustic radius ratio compared to the single star, consistent with its expanded core. Our results demonstrate that mass accretion imprints measurable asteroseismic signatures on both gravity and pressure modes. These signatures provide powerful diagnostics for identifying post-interaction stars, for refining stellar age and structure estimates in binary systems.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved protoplanetary disk physics in DQ Tau with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion variability is ubiquitous in YSOs. While large outbursts may strongly affect the disk, the effects of moderate bursts are less understood. We aim to study the physical response of the disk around the eccentric binary system DQ Tau to its periodic accretion changes. We organized a multi-wavelength campaign centered on four JWST/MIRI spectra. We targeted three periastrons (high accretion state) and one apastron (quiescence). We used optical and near-infrared spectroscopy and photometry to measure how the accretion luminosity varies. We decomposed the multi-epoch SEDs into stellar, accretion, and rim components. We fitted the solid-state features using various opacity curves and the molecular features using slab models. We find the inner disk of DQ Tau to be highly dynamic. The temperature, luminosity, and location of the inner dust rim vary in response to the movement of stars and the L_acc variations. This causes variable shadowing of the outer disk, leading to an anti-correlation between the rim temperature and the strength of the silicate feature. The dust mineralogy remains constant, dominated by large amorphous olivine and pyroxene grains, with smaller fractions of crystalline forsterite. The excitation of CO (1550-2260 K), HCN (880-980 K), and hot H2O (740-860 K) molecules as well as the luminosity of the [NeII] line correlate with the accretion rate, while the warm (650 K) and cold (170-200 K) H2O components are mostly constant. CO emission, originating from a hot (&gt;1500 K) region likely within the dust sublimation radius, is most sensitive to L_acc changes. In comparison with other T Tauri disks, DQ Tau is highly C-poor and displays moderately inefficient pebble drift. We conclude that even moderate accretion rate changes affect the thermal structure in the planet-forming disk regions on short timescales, providing a crucial benchmark for understanding disk evolution.</description>

      <title>Meridional Circulation II: A Unified Mechanism for Lithium Depletion in Solar Analogs and the Lithium Dip in Mid-F Cluster Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of lithium (Li) in Population I main sequence stars challenges standard stellar theory. Two phenomena stand out: the solar Li problem which extends to Li depletion in solar analogs and the Li dip observed in mid-F stars within open clusters. Building on the meridional circulation-driven radial mixing framework previously developed to explain Li-enriched red clump stars, we explore its relevance to Li depletion on the main sequence. First, our models reproduce the observed $A(\text{Li})$-Age correlation in solar analogs. Through detailed isochrone analysis, we find good agreement between the simulated and observed $A(\text{Li})$-$T_{\text{eff}}$ relationships within the solar analog parameter space. However, the predicted solar Li abundance ($\sim 1.5\,\text{dex}$) is still higher than current solar measurements. Second, our models partially explain the Li dip phenomenon in mid-F cluster stars. The models accurately reproduce Li distributions on the cool side of the Li dip in most clusters and capture the Li behaviors on the hot side observed in systems like the Hyades. However, we identify limitations in the models' ability to fully reproduce the dip morphology, particularly due to the rotation velocity distribution of sample stars in this temperature zone.</description>

      <title>The Corona-Australis star-forming region: New insights on its formation history from detailed stellar and disk analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The star-forming complex of Corona Australis (CrA) is one of the closest and most isolated molecular clouds. It belongs to a chain of clusters that show age gradients with distance from the galactic plane. We aim to provide suggestions regarding its formation history by examining the stellar and disk populations, stellar multiplicity, and interstellar absorption. We made a census of stars and disks using Gaia DR3 and infrared data. Interstellar absorption in the direction of each star was derived by comparing SpTy from the literature and Gaia colors. Stellar multiplicity analysis accounts for both direct observation of visual companions (Gaia data and high-contrast imaging) and indirect detection of the presence of companions (eclipsing and spectroscopic binaries, and astrometry). The properties of the disks were obtained from the slopes of the spectral energy distributions. As found in previous studies, the CrA complex can be divided into two regions: a younger region (CrA-Main: 3+/-1Myr) and an older one (CrA-North: 6.7+/-0.3Myr), slightly younger than previously thought. While CrA-Main still appears bound to the gas, CrA-North is unbound and expanding. The stars that belong to CrA-North were in the most compact configuration 3.72Myr ago. At that time, CrA-Main and CrA-North were much closer to each other than they appear now. The fraction of disk-bearing stars is higher in Main than in North, as also expected due to the younger age of CrA-Main. We propose a formation history scenario for the CrA-complex. It started between 15 and 18 Myr ago with SNe explosions in the Upper Centaurus-Lupus complex, followed by a quiescent phase with little star formation. A star formation episode about 7Myr ago formed CrA-North stars. About 3.7Myr ago, a second SN explosion south of CrA-North triggered star formation in CrA-Main. This last SN might have been the origin of the pulsar RX J1856.5-3754.</description>

      <title>Attempting an accurate age estimate of the open cluster NGC 6633 using CoRoT and Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroseismology of solar-like oscillations in giant stars allow the derivation of their masses and radii. For members of open clusters, this provides an age of the cluster that should be identical to the one derived from the colour-magnitude diagram, but independent of the uncertainties that are present for that type of analysis. We aim to identify and measure the properties of giant members of the open cluster NGC6633, and combine these with asteroseismic measurements to derive a precise and self-consistent cluster age. Importantly, we wish to constrain the effects of rotational mixing on stellar evolution, since assumptions about internal mixing can have a significant impact on stellar age estimates. We identify five giant members of NGC6633 using photometry and Gaia data, supplemented by spectroscopic literature measurements. These are combined with asteroseismic measurements from CoRoT data and compared to stellar-model isochrones. This constrains the interior mixing to a low level and enables the most precise, accurate and self-consistent age estimate so far for this cluster. Asteroseismology of the giants and the cluster colour-magnitude diagram provide self-consistent masses of the giant members and their radii constrain the stellar interior mixing to a low level. The [C/N] ratios and Li abundances also suggest that rotation has had very little influence on the evolution of the stars in NGC 6633. This results in an age estimate of 0.55+0.05-0.10 Gyr for NGC6633. Four giant members appear to be in the helium-core burning evolutionary phase as also expected from evolutionary timescales. For the largest giant, the evidence remains inconclusive. A comparison to other age and mass estimates for the same stars in the literature uncovers biases for automated age estimates of helium-core burning stars.</description>

      <title>Structure and dynamics of the internetwork solar chromosphere: results of a small-scale dynamo simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heating and structure of the solar chromosphere depends on the underlying magnetic field, among other parameters. The lowest magnetic flux of the solar atmosphere is found in the quiet Sun internetwork and is thought to be provided by the small-scale dynamo (SSD) process. We aim to understand the chromospheric structure and dynamics in a simulation with purely SSD generated magnetic fields. We perform a 3D radiation-magnetohydrodynamic (rMHD) simulation of the solar atmosphere, including the necessary physics to simulate the solar chromosphere. No magnetic field is imposed beyond that generated by an SSD process. We analyse the magnetic field in the chromosphere, and the resulting energy balance. Plasma at chromospheric temperatures reaches high into the atmosphere, with small, transient regions reaching coronal temperatures. An average Poynting flux of $5\times10^6~\mathrm{erg\;cm}^{-3}$\;s$^{-1}$ is found at the base of the chromosphere. The magnetic field in the chromosphere falls off more slowly with height than predicted by a potential field extrapolation from the radial component of the photospheric field. Starting in the middle chromosphere, the magnetic energy density is an order of magnitude larger than the kinetic energy density and, in the upper chromosphere, also larger than the thermal energy density. Nonetheless, even in the high chromosphere, the plasma beta in shock fronts and low-field regions can locally reach values above unity. The interactions between shocks and the magnetic field are essential to understanding the dynamics of the internetwork chromosphere. The SSD generated magnetic fields are strong enough to dominate the energy balance in the mid-to-upper chromosphere. The energy flux into the chromosphere is $8.16\times 10^{6}~\mathrm{erg\;cm^{-2}\;s^{-1}}$, larger than the canonical values required to heat the quiet sun chromosphere and corona.</description>

      <title>Where are the binaries? -- Searching for blue horizontal-branch stars in binary systems in the inner Galactic Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blue horizontal-branch (BHB) stars are evolved low-mass objects that have completed their core hydrogen burning main-sequence (MS) stage and have lost significant mass during the red giant phase culminating in the helium flash. We determine the fraction of BHBs in binary systems over a wide range of separations in the inner Galactic Halo to constrain mass-loss mechanisms and evolutionary pathways. Using a catalog of 22,336 BHB candidates from Gaia DR3, we analysed radial velocity variations found in spectra (263 spectra of 89 targets) acquired using the Ondrejov Echelle spectrograph at the Astronomical Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences together with archival spectra from the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) and Fiber-fed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph (FEROS). We searched for wide common proper motion pairs, binary candidates with enhanced astrometric noise, and binaries with astrometric orbital solutions in Gaia DR3. Archival light curves from Gaia DR3 and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) were checked for binary induced variations. Synthetic SEDs and binary detection probabilities were modelled to account for selection effects. We find a binary fraction of &lt;2.2%, far lower than the rates for their main-sequence (MS) and red-giant branch (RGB) progenitors (30-50%). This suggests that BHBs are either not descendants of binary systems, or that existing companions do not survive the BHB formation process. The negligible binary fraction implies single-star evolution could dominate BHB formation, contrasting with EHB stars where binarity is critical. Our results challenge models of mass loss on the RGB and highlight the need for alternative mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The Rosetta Stone Project. II. The correlation between star formation efficiency and L/M indicator for the evolutionary stages of star-forming clumps in post-processed radiative magnetohydrodynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09936v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The evolution of massive star-forming clumps that are progenitors of high-mass young stellar objects are often classified based on a variety of observational indicators ranging from near-infrared to radio wavelengths. Among them, the ratio of the bolometric luminosity to the mass of their envelope, $L/M$, has been observationally diagnosed as a good indicator for the evolutionary classification of parsec-scale star-forming clumps in the Galaxy.
  Aims. We developed the Rosetta Stone project$\unicode{x2013}$an end-to-end framework designed to enable an accurate comparison between simulations and observations for investigating the formation and evolution of massive clumps. In this study, we calibrate the $L/M$ indicator in relation to the star formation efficiency (SFE) and the clump age, as derived from our suite of simulations.
  Methods. We performed multi-wavelength radiative transfer post-processing of radiative magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulations of the collapse of star-forming clumps fragmenting into protostars. We generated synthetic observations to obtain far-infrared emission from $70$ to $500\,\mu$m, as was done in the Hi-GAL survey, and at $24\,\mu$m in the MIPSGAL survey, which were then used to build the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and estimate the $L/M$ parameter. An additional $1.3\,$mm wavelength in ALMA Band 6 was also produced for the comparison with observational data. We applied observational techniques$\unicode{x2013}$commonly employed by observers$\unicode{x2013}$to the synthetic data in order to derive the corresponding physical parameters.
  Results. We find a correlation between $L/M$ and the SFE, with a power-law form $L/M\propto {\rm SFE}^{1.20^{+0.02}_{-0.02}}$. This correlation is independent of the mass of the clumps and the choice of initial conditions of the simulations in which they formed.

      <title>STCTM: a forward modeling and retrieval framework for stellar contamination and stellar spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transmission spectroscopy is a key avenue for the near-term study of small-planet atmospheres and the most promising method when it comes to searching for atmospheres on temperate rocky worlds, which are often too cold for planetary emission to be detectable. At the same time, the small planets that are most amenable for such atmospheric probes orbit small and cool M dwarf stars. As the field becomes increasingly ambitious in the search for signs of even thin atmospheres on small exoplanets, the transit light source effect (TLSE), caused by unocculted stellar surface heterogeneities, is becoming a limiting factor: it is imperative to develop robust inference methods to disentangle planetary and stellar contributions to the observed spectra. Here, I present STCTM, the STellar ConTamination Modeling framework, a flexible Bayesian retrieval framework to model the impact of the TLSE on any exoplanet transmission spectrum, and infer the range of stellar surface parameters that are compatible with the observations in the absence of any planetary contribution. With the "exotune" sub-module, users can also perform retrievals directly on out-of-transit stellar spectra in order to place data-driven priors on the extent to which the TLSE can impact any planet's transmission spectrum. The input data formats, stellar models, and fitted parameters are easily tunable using human-readable files and the code is fully parallelized to enable fast inferences.

      <title>Sensitive Constraints on Coherent Radio Emission from Five Isolated White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent, periodic radio emission from pulsars has been widely interpreted as evidence of neutron stars as strongly magnetized compact objects. In recent years, radio pulses have also been detected from white dwarfs (WDs) in tight binary systems, raising the question of whether isolated WDs could similarly host pulsar-like emission. We conducted the most sensitive search to date for coherent radio signals from five isolated, rapidly rotating, and magnetized WDs, using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). No pulsed or continuum radio emission was detected down to $\mu$Jy levels. These non-detections place the most stringent observational constraints yet on the existence of isolated WD pulsars. Our results suggest that either such emission is intrinsically weak, narrowly beamed, or requires binary-induced magnetospheric interactions absent in solitary systems. Comparison with the known radio-emitting WDs highlights the critical role of companion interaction in enabling detectable emission. This work expands on prior surveys by targeting sources with the most favorable physical conditions for WD pulsar-like activity and employing highly sensitive, targeted observations. Future observations with next-generation facilities such as the SKA will be essential to explore fainter or sporadic emission from massive, magnetic WDs and to investigate their potential as compact radio transients further.</description>

      <title>On Ultra-long Period (53.8 min) Pulsar ASKAP J1935+2148: Coherent Radio Emission Triggered by Local Superstrong Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eight ultra-long period pulsars (ULPPs) in radio bands have been discovered recently, e.g., ASKAP J1935+2148 with a spin period of 53.8\,min, which are much longer than those of normal pulsars, spanning from 0.016\,s to 23.5\,s, however the origins, spin evolutions and emission mechanisms of these sources are still puzzling. We investigate how the ultra-long period of ASKAP J1935+2148 is evolved by the braking of relativistic particle wind, in a time scale of about 0.1 - 1 Myr, from a normal pulsar with local superstrong magnetic fields. In addition, it is noticed that the ULPPs in the period versus period derivative diagram are much below the ``death line", implying their different characteristics from the normal pulsars. Five sources (including ASKAP J1935+2148) in total eight ULPPs share the rotational energy loss rates to be lower than their respective radio emission luminosities, a phenomenon that can be accounted for by the sustainable radio bursts induced through the reconnection of locally concentrated magnetic field lines.The diversity and complexity of ULPP radio emissions should be closely related to the presence of magnetic reconnection rather than rotational powered discharges in the gaps. Furthermore, it is suggested that the coherent radio emissions of pulsars may have two origins, one from the rotation-powered electric voltage that accounts for the normal pulsar phenomena and the other from the magnetic reconnection-induced continual radio bursts that account for the ULPP observations.</description>

      <title>A unique solution to overcome the barriers to planetesimal formation at low dust-to-gas ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the incremental growth model, planetesimal formation constitutes the least understood step in the process of planetary formation. The two main difficulties in this regard are the collision/fragmentation and the drift barriers. Numerous solutions have been proposed to overcome these barriers, but often need a conjunction of processes to reach the conditions for planetesimal formation. We present numerical simulations, in which the protoplanetary disk turbulence is fully captured rather than modeled with a turbulent diffusion or turbulent viscosity parameter. When the turbulent cascade is taken into account, and in the case of weakly turbulent disks, not only can solid grains be highly concentrated in clusters, but their radial drift can also be slowed or even halted. These results open a unique path to planetesimal formation starting at disk canonical dust-to-gas ratio, namely Keplerian turbulence.</description>

      <title>Global impact of emerging internetwork fields on the low solar atmosphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.09111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small-scale, newly emerging internetwork (IN) magnetic fields are considered a viable source of energy and mass for the solar chromosphere and possibly the corona. Multiple studies show that single events of flux emergence can indeed locally heat the low solar atmosphere through interactions of the upward propagating magnetic loops and the preexisting ambient field lines. However, the global impact of the newly emerging IN fields on the solar atmosphere is still unknown. In this paper, we study the spatio-temporal evolution of IN bipolar flux features and analyze their impact on the energetics and dynamics of the quiet Sun atmosphere. We use high resolution, multi-wavelength, coordinated observations obtained with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), Hinode, and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to identify emerging IN magnetic fields and follow their evolution. Our observational results suggest that only the largest IN bipoles are capable of heating locally the low solar atmosphere, while the global contribution of these bipoles appears to be marginal. However, the total number of bipoles detected and their impact estimated in this work is limited by the sensitivity level, spatial resolution, and duration of our observations. To detect smaller and weaker IN fields that would maintain the basal flux, and examine their contribution to the chromospheric heating, we will need higher resolution, higher sensitivity and longer time series obtained with current and next-generation ground- and space-based telescopes.</description>

      <title>A Spectroscopic Search for Dormant Black Holes in Low-Metallicity Binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of the massive black hole (BH) system Gaia BH3 in pre-release Gaia DR4 data suggests that wide BH binaries with luminous companions may be significantly overrepresented at low metallicities. Motivated by this finding, we have initiated a spectroscopic survey of low-metallicity stars exhibiting elevated RUWE values in Gaia DR3, using the FEROS and APF spectrographs. We identify promising BH binary candidates as objects with instantaneously measured radial velocities (RVs) that are very different from their mean RVs reported in Gaia DR3. Thus far, we have observed over 500 targets, including a nearly complete sample of stars with $\text{[Fe/H]} &lt; -1.5$, RUWE $&gt; 2$, and $G &lt; 15$. Our search has yielded one promising target exhibiting slow acceleration and an RV more than 98 km s$^{-1}$ different from its DR3 mean RV, as well as dozens of other candidates with smaller RV discrepancies. We quantify the sensitivity of our search using simulations, demonstrating that it recovers at least half of the BH companions within our selection criteria. We make all the spectra and RVs from our survey publicly available and encourage further follow-up.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismic modelling of Kepler Legacy stars including lithium depletion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. The Kepler Legacy sample is, to this day, the sample of solar-like oscillators with the most exquisite asteroseismic data. In this work, we carry out a detailed modelling of a subsample of these stars for which the surface lithium abundance has also been observed by the LAMOST survey and a photometric surface rotation as been measured. Aims. We aim at studying the impact of additional mixing processes on the asteroseismic modelling of Kepler Legacy G and F-type stars. We also investigate whether a single process can be invoked to reproduce the lithium depletion and asteroseismic constraints at the same time. Methods. We use detailed asteroseismic modelling techniques combining global and local minimization techniques. We start by using standard models and then aim at improving this solution by the addition of extra-mixing at the border of convective regions using either convective penetration or turbulence in radiative layers. Results. We find that lower mass models ($\sim 1M_\odot$) have no problem in reproducing the observed lithium depletion using only turbulence in the radiative zone, similarly to solar models. F-type stars, having a shallower convective envelope, are unaffected by additional turbulence at the BCZ, but require significant convective penetration values to actually reproduce the observed lithium depletion. The extent of this penetration is however incompatible with the frequency separation ratios. Conclusions. We conclude that the impact of extra-mixing is moderate for solar-type stars of the Kepler Legacy sample and well within the requirements of the PLATO mission. For more massive stars ($\sim 1.5M_\odot$), we conclude that the behaviour of the frequency separation ratios must be further investigated, as even models with large convective penetration at the base of their convective envelope are unable to reproduce them.</description>

Abstract: We present ultraviolet (UV) through near-infrared (NIR) photometric and spectroscopic observations of the nearby SN 2024pxl, the third Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) in NGC 6384. SN 2024pxl is a Type Iax supernova (SN Iax) with an intermediate luminosity ($M_r = -16.99\pm0.32$ mag) and an average SN Iax light curve decline rate. SN 2024pxl was discovered $\sim$3 days after first light, and the rising light curve follows a single power law that is inconsistent with significant interaction with a companion star or circumstellar material. Our extensive NIR photometric coverage is comparable to that of the well-observed SNe Iax 2005hk and 2012Z, and we demonstrate that the $J-H$ colors of SNe Iax differ from normal SNe Ia and appear to be more homogeneous as a class. Spectroscopically, we report the earliest-ever NIR spectrum of a SN Iax as measured from maximum light ($t\approx-9$ days): a featureless continuum with similarities to a $\sim$9,000 K blackbody, and the line velocities are consistent with a mixed-ejecta structure, with C, Si, and Fe having similar velocities and velocity evolutions. We find a tentative correlation between the $H$-band break Co II velocity $\sim$20 days post-peak and absolute magnitude, with more luminous SNe Iax showing faster Co II velocities. Our observations suggest that SN 2024pxl resulted from the thermonuclear disruption of a CO white dwarf star that undergoes deflagration burning.</description>

      <title>Planetary Nebulae in the eROSITA eRASS1 catalog</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some planetary nebulae (PNe) host X-ray-emitting hot bubbles shaped by stellar wind interactions and/or harbor X-ray-emitting central stars due to accretion, shocks within their fast stellar winds, or even chromospheric emission from binary companions. In both cases, the properties of the X-ray emission critically probe late-stages of stellar evolution for such low- and intermediate-mass stars. While extant Chandra and XMM-Newton observations have detected X-ray emission in PNe, the numbers known remain very small ($\sim40$) compared to the overall Galactic PNe population ($\sim4000$). We have initiated a project aimed at increasing the sample of known PNe with X-ray emission using both current and new space-based X-ray telescopes such as the Einstein probe. To further investigate their X-ray properties to elucidate what drives current X-ray PN detections, we have cross-searched the SRG {\it eROSITA-DE} eRASS1 source catalogue and Hong Kong (HASH) PNe Database. Five known X-ray PNe have been detected (Abell\,30, NGC\,2392, NGC\,3242, NGC\,5315, and LoTr\,5), two new X-ray PNe are revealed (IC\,1297 and NGC\,2867), one (K\,1-27) is removed from previous X-ray compilations, and another 11 previously detected X-ray emitting PNe are not recovered. A comparison of the X-ray flux of detected and undetected X-ray PNe reveals that eROSITA eRASS1 is sensitive to PNe with X-ray fluxes larger than $\approx2\times10^{-14}$ erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. The frequency of occurrence is $\simeq$0.5\% among the 1430 HASH True PNe in the eRASS1 footprint.</description>

      <title>Non-Thermal Ionization of Kilonova Ejecta: Observable Impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The characteristic rapid rise and decline at optical wavelengths of a kilonova is the product of the low ejecta mass ($\lesssim 0.05 M_\odot$) and high ejecta velocity ($\gtrsim 0.1$c). We show that, even at very early times ($\lesssim 2$ days), regions of ejecta fall below critical density and temperature thresholds at which non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects become important. Here, we present an approximate method for calculating the ionization state of the ejecta that accounts for the NLTE impact of high-energy electrons produced in the beta decay of freshly synthesized $r$-process elements. We find that incorporating ionization from high-energy electrons produces an ``inverted" and ``blended" ionization structure, where the most highly ionized species are located in the fastest moving homologous ejecta and multiple ionization states coexist. In radiation transport calculations, the higher degree of ionization reduces line blanketing in optical bands, leading to improved agreement with the light curve properties of AT\,2017gfo such as the duration, decay rates, brightness, and colors. Our quasi-NLTE implementation helps to alleviate tensions in kilonova modeling: for high-velocity ($\sim 0.3c$) ejecta components our models require less mass for a given peak brightness in optical bands, by as much as a factor of 3; our models can explain the presence of observed features associated to Sr II, W III, Se III, and Te III under conditions where LTE models would predict only neutral species; and we naturally predict the coexistence of species like Sr II and Ce III without the need for fine-tuning of the ejecta properties.</description>
