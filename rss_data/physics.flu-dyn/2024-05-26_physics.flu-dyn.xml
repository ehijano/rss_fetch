      <title>Multi-Point Gradient Estimation in Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When studying turbulence, it is often desirable to be able to estimate the local spatial gradient of a vector quantity using in situ measurements from a small number of irregularly spaced points. While previous studies have focused on the accuracy of these methods as the number of measurement points varies, we focus on the accuracy of gradient estimations as a function of shape of the measurement point configuration. We find that for well-shaped configurations that are of correct relative size, we can very accurately estimate the local spatial gradient using only four points.</description>

      <title>SNF-ROM: Projection-based nonlinear reduced order modeling with smooth neural fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced order modeling lowers the computational cost of solving PDEs by learning a low-order spatial representation from data and dynamically evolving these representations using manifold projections of the governing equations. While commonly used, linear subspace reduced-order models (ROMs) are often suboptimal for problems with a slow decay of Kolmogorov $n$-width, such as advection-dominated fluid flows at high Reynolds numbers. There has been a growing interest in nonlinear ROMs that use state-of-the-art representation learning techniques to accurately capture such phenomena with fewer degrees of freedom. We propose smooth neural field ROM (SNF-ROM), a nonlinear reduced modeling framework that combines grid-free reduced representations with Galerkin projection. The SNF-ROM architecture constrains the learned ROM trajectories to a smoothly varying path, which proves beneficial in the dynamics evaluation when the reduced manifold is traversed in accordance with the governing PDEs. Furthermore, we devise robust regularization schemes to ensure the learned neural fields are smooth and differentiable. This allows us to compute physics-based dynamics of the reduced system nonintrusively with automatic differentiation and evolve the reduced system with classical time-integrators. SNF-ROM leads to fast offline training as well as enhanced accuracy and stability during the online dynamics evaluation. We demonstrate the efficacy of SNF-ROM on a range of advection-dominated linear and nonlinear PDE problems where we consistently outperform state-of-the-art ROMs.</description>

      <title>Neural Fluidic System Design and Control with Differentiable Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework to explore neural control and design of complex fluidic systems with dynamic solid boundaries. Our system features a fast differentiable Navier-Stokes solver with solid-fluid interface handling, a low-dimensional differentiable parametric geometry representation, a control-shape co-design algorithm, and gym-like simulation environments to facilitate various fluidic control design applications. Additionally, we present a benchmark of design, control, and learning tasks on high-fidelity, high-resolution dynamic fluid environments that pose challenges for existing differentiable fluid simulators. These tasks include designing the control of artificial hearts, identifying robotic end-effector shapes, and controlling a fluid gate. By seamlessly incorporating our differentiable fluid simulator into a learning framework, we demonstrate successful design, control, and learning results that surpass gradient-free solutions in these benchmark tasks.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Hydroacoustic Noise from Marine Propellers with Tip Vortex Cavitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work aims to study the cavitating turbulent flow of a full-scale marine propeller and explore the physical mechanism underpinning the underwater radiated noise. We employ the standard dynamic large eddy simulation for the turbulent wake flow and the Schnerr-Sauer cavitation model, while the Ffowcs-Williams-Hawkings acoustic analogy is considered for the hydroacoustic modeling. For the current investigation, we consider a well-known Potsdam Propeller Test Case to analyze the turbulent cavitating flow and the associated hydroacoustic emissions. To begin, the modeling framework is validated using the available experimental data, and distinctive double-helical tip vortex cavitation and its qualitative patterns along the vortex trajectory are captured. In comparison to the non-cavitating condition, the pressure distribution on the propeller surface is more disordered for the cavitating condition, which is further reflected by a relatively stronger power of both low-frequency tonal peaks and high-frequency broadband components in the spectrum of thrust generation. Specifically, the generation of cavitation leads to the enhancement of the monopole noise source and the breakdown of cavitation bubbles as well as vortex structures in the turbulent wake. Furthermore, the tonal noise with the frequency corresponding to the harmonics of blade passing frequency is also enhanced. Generally speaking, the generation of cavitation structures enhances the hydroacoustics energy of URN at all orientations, especially in the downstream direction with sound pressure level increasing up to 20 dB.</description>

      <title>A Misleading Gallery of Fluid Motion by Generative Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this technical report, we extensively investigate the accuracy of outputs from well-known generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications in response to prompts describing common fluid motion phenomena familiar to the fluid mechanics community. We examine a range of applications, including Midjourney, Dall-E, Runway ML, Microsoft Designer, Gemini, Meta AI, and Leonardo AI, introduced by prominent companies such as Google, OpenAI, Meta, and Microsoft. Our text prompts for generating images or videos include examples such as "Von Karman vortex street", "flow past an airfoil", "Kelvin-Helmholtz instability", "shock waves on a sharp-nosed supersonic body", etc. We compare the images generated by these applications with real images from laboratory experiments and numerical software. Our findings indicate that these generative AI models are not adequately trained in fluid dynamics imagery, leading to potentially misleading outputs. Beyond text-to-image/video generation, we further explore the transition from image/video to text generation using these AI tools, aiming to investigate the accuracy of their descriptions of fluid motion phenomena. This report serves as a cautionary note for educators in academic institutions, highlighting the potential for these tools to mislead students. It also aims to inform researchers at these renowned companies, encouraging them to address this issue. We conjecture that a primary reason for this shortcoming is the limited access to copyright-protected fluid motion images from scientific journals.</description>

      <title>Unsteady aerodynamic prediction using limited samples based on transfer learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, a method for predicting unsteady aerodynamic forces under different initial conditions using a limited number of samples based on transfer learning is proposed, aiming to avoid the need for large-scale high-fidelity aerodynamic simulations. First, a large number of training samples are acquired through high-fidelity simulation under the initial condition for the baseline, followed by the establishment of a pre-trained network as the source model using a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. When unsteady aerodynamic forces are predicted under the new initial conditions, a limited number of training samples are collected by high-fidelity simulations. Then, the parameters of the source model are transferred to the new prediction model, which is further fine-tuned and trained with limited samples. The new prediction model can be used to predict the unsteady aerodynamic forces of the entire process under the new initial conditions. The proposed method is validated by predicting the aerodynamic forces of free flight of a high-spinning projectile with a large extension of initial angular velocity and pitch angle. The results indicatethat the proposed method can predict unsteady aerodynamic forces under different initial conditions using 1/3 of the sample size of the source model. Compared with direct modeling using the LSTM networks, the proposed method shows improved accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>pyLOM: A HPC open source reduced order model suite for fluid dynamics applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the numerical implementation in a high-performance computing environment of an open-source library for model order reduction in fluid dynamics. This library, called pyLOM, contains the algorithms of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD), as well as, efficient SVD and matrix-matrix multiplication, all of them tailored for supercomputers. The library is profiled in detail under the MareNostrum IV supercomputer. The bottleneck is found to be in the QR factorization, which has been solved by an efficient binary tree communications pattern. Strong and weak scalability benchmarks reveal that the serial part (i.e., the part of the code that cannot be parallelized) of these algorithms is under 10% for the strong scaling and under 0.7% for the weak scaling. Using pyLOM, a POD of a dataset containing 1.14 x 108 gridpoints and 1808 snapshots that takes 6.3Tb of memory can be computed in 81.08 seconds using 10368 CPUs. Additioally, the algorithms are validated using the datasets of a flow around a circular cylinder at ReD = 100 and ReD = 1 x 104, as well as the flow in the Stanford diffuser at Reh = 1 x 104.</description>

      <title>Slow linear shear flow past discrete particles adhered to a plane wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear shear flow bounded by a plane wall is an idealization that occurs in microfluidic devices and many other applications. Perfect plane approximation neglects surface irregularities and discrete particles adsorbed at the surface. Here we study the disturbance to the linear shear flow due to the particle(s) rigidly attached to the surface. We first revisit the exact solution of O'Neill for a spherical particle in contact with an infinite plane boundary. While the original paper contains multiple typos and provides very few details of the derivation, we present detailed solution accompanied by an alternative and simpler derivation of the viscous force torque exerted on the particle. We further study the universal far-field behavior of the flow due to an arbitrary particle adhered to the surface, and demonstrate that it is controlled by the stress moment of magnitude depending on particle's volume and shape. Using the revised O'Neill solution, we compute the stress moment for a spherical particle. Using the far-field asymptotic form of the flow we estimate the net flow due to uniform and sparse layer of discrete adsorbates by superposition and demonstrate that it does not decay away from the plane.</description>

      <title>Causal features in turbulent channel flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The causal relevance of local flow conditions in wall-bounded turbulence is analysed using ensembles of interventional experiments in which the effect of perturbing the flow within a small cell is monitored at some future time. When this is done using the relative amplification of the perturbation energy, causality depends on the flow conditions within the cell before it is perturbed, and can be used as a probe of the flow dynamics. The key scaling parameter is the ambient shear, which is also the dominant diagnostic variable for wall-attached perturbations. Away from the wall, the relevant variables are the streamwise and wall-normal velocities. Causally significant cells are associated with sweeps that carry the perturbation towards the stronger shear near the wall, whereas irrelevant ones are associated with ejections that carry it towards the weaker shear in the outer layers. Causally significant and irrelevant cells are themselves organised into structures that share many characteristics with classical sweeps and ejections, such as forming spanwise pairs whose dimensions and geometry are similar to those of classical quadrants. At the wall, this is consistent with causally significant configurations in which a high-speed streak overtakes a low-speed one, and causally irrelevant ones in which the two streaks pull apart from each other. It is argued that this is probably associated with streak meandering.</description>

      <title>Material Barriers to the Diffusion of the Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has identified objective (frame-indifferent) material barriers that inhibit the transport of dynamically active vectorial quantities (such as linear momentum, angular momentum and vorticity) in Navier-Stokes flows. In magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), a similar setting arises: the magnetic field vector impacts the evolution of the velocity field through the Lorentz force and hence is a dynamically active vector field. Here, we extend the theory of active material barriers from Navier-Stokes flows to MHD flows in order to locate frame-indifferent barriers to the diffusive transport of the magnetic field in turbulent two-dimensional and three-dimensional MHD flows. From this approach we obtain an algorithm for the automated extraction of such barriers from MHD turbulence data.</description>

      <title>Cracking of submerged beds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomena of crater formation and gas release caused by projectile impact on underwater beds, which occurs in many natural, geophysical, and industrial applications. The bed in our experiment is constructed of hydrophobic particles, which trap a substantial amount of air in its pores. In contrast to dry beds, the air-water interface in a submerged bed generates a granular skin that provides rigidity to the medium by producing skin over the bulk. The projectile's energy is used to reorganise the grains, which causes the skin to crack, allowing the trapped air to escape. The morphology of the craters as a function of impact energy in submerged beds exhibits different scaling laws than what is known for dry beds. This phenomenon is attributed to the contact line motion on the hydrophobic fractal-like surface of submerged grains. The volume of the gas released is a function of multiple factors, chiefly the velocity of the projectile, depth of the bed and depth of the water column.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed dynamic manifold solutions for the Navier-Stokes equations using an extension of differential geometry called the calculus for moving surfaces. Specifically, we have shown that the geometric solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations can take the form of fluctuating spheres, constant mean curvature surfaces, generic wave equations for compressible systems, and arbitrarily curved shapes for incompressible systems in various scenarios. These solutions apply to predominantly incompressible and compressible systems for the equations in any dimension, while the remaining cases are yet to be solved. We have demonstrated that for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, geometric solutions are always bound by the curvature tensor of the closed smooth manifold for every smooth velocity field. As a result, solutions always converge for systems with constant volumes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past years, the amount of research on active matter has grown extremely rapidly, a fact that is reflected in particular by the existence of more than 600 review articles on this topic. Moreover, the field has become very diverse, ranging from theoretical studies of the statistical mechanics of active particles to applied work on medical applications of microrobots and from biological systems to artificial swimmers. This makes it very difficult to get an overview over the field as a whole. Here, we provide such an overview in the form of a metareview article that surveys the existing review articles on active matter. Thereby, this article provides an introduction to the various subdisciplines of active matter science and constitutes a useful starting point for finding literature about a specific topic.</description>

      <title>Dynamic regimes in planetary cores: {\tau}-{\ell} diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planetary cores are the seat of rich and complex fluid dynamics, in which the effects of rotation and magnetic field combine. The equilibria governing the strength of the magnetic field produced by the dynamo effect, the organisation and amplitude of the flow, and those of the density field, remain debated despite remarkable progress made in their numerical simulation. This paper proposes a new approach based on the explicit consideration of the variation of time scales {\tau} with spatial scales {\ell} for the different physical phenomena involved. The {\tau}-{\ell} diagrams thus constructed constitute a very complete graphic summary of the dynamics of the object under study. We highlight the role of the available convective power in controlling this dynamics, together with the relevant force balance, for which we derive a very telling {\tau}-{\ell} translation. Several scenarios are constructed and discussed for the Earth's core, shedding new light on the width of convective columns and on the force equilibria to be considered. A QG-MAC scenario adapted from Aubert [2019] gives a good account of the observations. A diversion to Venus reveals the subtlety and relativity of the notion of 'fast rotator'. We discuss scaling laws and their validity domain, and illustrate 'path strategies'. A complete toolbox is provided, allowing everyone to construct a {\tau}-{\ell} diagram of a numerical simulation, a laboratory experiment, a theory, or a natural object.

      <title>On energy-aware hybrid models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13328v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes deterministic and stochastic energy-aware hybrid models that should enable simulations of idealized and primitive-equations Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) models at low resolutions without compromising on quality compared with high-resolution runs. Such hybrid models bridge the data-driven and physics-driven modelling paradigms by combining regional stability and classical GFD models at low resolution that cannot reproduce high-resolution reference flow features (large-scale flows and small-scale vortices) which are, however, resolved. Hybrid models use an energy-aware correction of advection velocity and extra forcing compensating for the drift of the low-resolution model away from the reference phase space. The main advantages of hybrid models are that they allow for physics-driven flow recombination within the reference energy band, reproduce resolved reference flow features, and produce more accurate ensemble forecasts than their classical GFD counterparts.
  Hybrid models offer appealing benefits and flexibility to the modelling and forecasting communities, as they are computationally cheap and can use both numerically-computed flows and observations from different sources. All these suggest that the hybrid approach has the potential to exploit low-resolution models for long-term weather forecasts and climate projections thus offering a new cost effective way of GFD modelling.
  The proposed hybrid approach has been tested on a three-layer quasi-geostrophic model for a beta-plane Gulf Stream flow configuration. The results show that the low-resolution hybrid model reproduces the reference flow features that are resolved on the coarse grid and also gives a more accurate ensemble forecast than the physics-driven model.</description>

Abstract: We present a theory to describe the Nusselt number ($Nu$), corresponding to the heat or mass flux, as a function of the Rayleigh--Darcy number ($Ra$), the ratio of buoyant driving force over diffusive dissipation, in convective porous media flows. First, we derive exact relationships within the system for the kinetic energy and the thermal dissipation rate. Second, by segregating the thermal dissipation rate into contributions from the boundary layer and the bulk, which is inspired by the ideas of the Grossmann and Lohse theory (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 407, 2000; Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 86, 2001), we derive the scaling relation for $Nu$ as a function of $Ra$ and provide a robust theoretical explanation to the empirical relations proposed in previous studies. Specifically, by incorporating the length scale of the flow structure into the theory, we demonstrate why heat or mass transport differs between two-dimensional and three-dimensional porous media convection. Our model is in excellent agreement with the data obtained from numerical simulations, affirming its validity and predictive capabilities.</description>

      <title>Frozen Cheerios effect: Particle-particle interaction induced by an advancing solidification front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particles at liquid interfaces have the tendency to cluster due to capillary forces competing to gravitational buoyancy (i.e., normal to the distorted free surface). This is known as the Cheerios effect. Here we experimentally and theoretically study the interaction between two submerged particles near an advancing water-ice interface during the freezing process. Particles that are thermally more conductive than water are observed to attract each other and form clusters once frozen. We call this feature the frozen Cheerios effect, where interactions are driven by alterations to the direction of the experienced repelling force (i.e., normal to the distorted isotherm). On the other hand, particles less conductive than water separate, highlighting the importance of thermal conduction during freezing. Based on existing models for single particle trapping in ice, we develop an understanding of multiple particle interaction. We find that the overall efficacy of the particle-particle interaction critically depends on the solidification front velocity. Our theory explains why the thermal conductivity mismatch between the particles and water dictates the attractive/repulsive nature of the particle-particle interaction.</description>

      <title>An unfitted high-order HDG method for two-fluid Stokes flow with exact NURBS geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A high-order, degree-adaptive hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method is presented for two-fluid incompressible Stokes flows, with boundaries and interfaces described using NURBS. The NURBS curves are embedded in a fixed Cartesian grid, yielding an unfitted HDG scheme capable of treating the exact geometry of the boundaries/interfaces, circumventing the need for fitted, high-order, curved meshes. The framework of the NURBS-enhanced finite element method (NEFEM) is employed for accurate quadrature along immersed NURBS and in elements cut by NURBS curves. A Nitsche's formulation is used to enforce Dirichlet conditions on embedded surfaces, yielding unknowns only on the mesh skeleton as in standard HDG, without introducing any additional degree of freedom on non-matching boundaries/interfaces. The resulting unfitted HDG-NEFEM method combines non-conforming meshes, exact NURBS geometry and high-order approximations to provide high-fidelity results on coarse meshes, independent of the geometric features of the domain. Numerical examples illustrate the optimal accuracy and robustness of the method, even in the presence of badly cut cells or faces, and its suitability to simulate microfluidic systems from CAD geometries.</description>

      <title>New limiter regions for multidimensional flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate transport algorithms are crucial for computational fluid dynamics and more accurate and efficient schemes are always in development. One dimensional limiting is commonly employed to suppress nonphysical oscillations. However, the application of such limiters can reduce accuracy. It is important to identify the weakest set of sufficient conditions required on the limiter as to allow the development of successful numerical algorithms.
  The main goal of this paper is to identify new less restrictive sufficient conditions for flux form in-compressible advection to remain monotonic. We identify additional necessary conditions for incompressible flux form advection to be monotonic, demonstrating that the Spekreijse limiter region is not sufficient for incompressible flux form advection to remain monotonic. Then a convex combination argument is used to derive new sufficient conditions that are less restrictive than the Sweby region for a discrete maximum principle. This allows the introduction of two new more general limiter regions suitable for flux form incompressible advection.</description>

      <title>On pressureless Euler equation with external force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hodograph equations for the n-dimensional Euler equations with the constant pressure and external force linear in velocity are presented. They provide us with solutions of the Euler in implicit form and information on existence or absence of gradient catastrophes. It is shown that in even dimensions the constructed solutions are periodic in time for particular subclasses of external forces. Several particular examples in one, two and three dimensions are considered, including the case of Coriolis external force.</description>
