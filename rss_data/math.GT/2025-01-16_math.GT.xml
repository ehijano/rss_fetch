      <title>Critical Exponents on Hyperbolic Surfaces with Long Boundaries and the Asymptotic Weil-Petersson Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the critical exponent random variable $\delta_X$ on moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces with boundary, using the normalized Weil-Petersson measures $d\mu_{WP}$ as probability measures. We use the spine graph construction of Bowditch and Epstein to compare this random variable to the corresponding critical exponent random variable $\delta_\Gamma$ on moduli spaces of metric ribbon graphs with the normalized Kontsevich measures $d\mu_K$, proving an asymptotic convergence-in-mean result in the long boundary length regime. In particular, we show that $d\mu_K$ approximately pulls back to $d\mu_{WP}$ with quantitative uniform estimates.</description>

      <title>On $h$-cobordisms of complexity $2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $5$-dimensional $h$-cobordisms of Morgan-Szab\'o complexity $2$. We compute the monopole Floer homology and the action of the twisting involution of the protocork boundary associated with such $h$-cobordisms, obtaining an obstruction for $h$-cobordisms between exotic pairs to have minimal complexity. We construct the first examples of $h$-cobordisms of non-minimal, in fact, arbitrarily large, complexity between an exotic pair of closed, $1$-connected $4$-manifolds. Further applications include strong corks.</description>

      <title>Rigidity, volume and angle structures of 1-3 type hyperbolic polyhedral 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the rigidity of hyperbolic polyhedral 3-manifolds and the volume optimization program of angle structures. We first study the rigidity of decorated 1-3 type hyperbolic polyhedral metrics on 3-manifolds which are isometric gluing of decorated 1-3 type hyperbolic tetrahedra. Here a 1-3 type hyperbolic tetrahedron is a truncated hyperbolic tetrahedron with one hyperideal vertex and three ideal vertices. A decorated 1-3 type polyhedron is a 1-3 type hyperbolic polyhedron with a horosphere centered at each ideal vertex. We show that a decorated 1-3 type hyperbolic polyhedral metric is determined up to isometry and change of decorations by its curvature. We also prove several results on the volume optimization program of Casson and Rivin, i,e. Casson-Rivin's volume optimization program is shown to be still valid for 1-3 type ideal triangulated 3-manifolds. We also get a strongly 1-efficiency triangulation when assuming the existence of an angle structure. On the whole, we follow the spirit of Luo-Yang's work in 2018 to prove our main results. The main differences come from that the hyperbolic tetrahedra considered here have completely different geometry with those considered in Luo-Yang's work in 2018.</description>

      <title>Properties of contact toric structures and concave boundaries of linear plumbings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider plumbings of symplectic disk bundles over spheres admitting concave contact boundary, with the goal of understanding the geometric properties of the boundary contact structure in terms of the data of the plumbing. We focus on the linear plumbing case in this article. We study the properties of the contact structure using two different sets of tools. First, we prove that all such contact manifolds have a global contact toric structure, and use tools from toric geometry to identify when the contact structure is tight versus overtwisted. Second, we study algebraic torsion measurements from embedded contact homology for these concavely induced contact manifolds, which has largely been unexplored. We develop a toolkit establishing existence and constraints of pseudoholomorphic curves adapted to the Morse-Bott Reeb dynamics of these plumbing examples, to provide the algebraic torsion and contact invariant calculations for the concave boundaries of linear plumbings.</description>

      <title>Relative knot probabilities in confined lattice polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we examine the relative knotting probabilities in a lattice model of ring polymers confined in a cavity. The model is of a lattice knot of size $n$ in the cubic lattice, confined to a cube of side-length $L$ and with volume $V=(L{+}1)^3$ sites. We use Monte Carlo algorithms to approximately enumerate the number of conformations of lattice knots in the confining cube. If $p_{n,L}(K)$ is the number of conformations of a lattice polygon of length $n$ and knot type $K$ in a cube of volume $L^3$, then the relative knotting probability of a lattice polygon to have knot type $K$, relative to the probability that the polygon is the unknot (the trivial knot, denoted by $0_1$), is $\rho_{n,L}(K/0_1) = p_{n,L}(K)/p_{n,L}(0_1)$. We determine $\rho_{n,L}(K/0_1)$ for various knot types $K$ up to six crossing knots. Our data show that these relative knotting probabilities are small so that the model is dominated by lattice polygons of knot type the unknot. Moreover, if the concentration of the monomers of the lattice knot is $\varphi = n/V$, then the relative knot probability increases with $\varphi$ along a curve that flattens off as the Hamiltonian state is approached.</description>

      <title>The pinning ideal of a multiloop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16216v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A loop is a generic immersion of the circle in a surface, considered up to isotopy. A loop is taut when it is minimally intersecting in its homotopy class. A pinning set of a loop is a set of points $P$ in the surface avoiding the loop, such that the loop is taut in the surface punctured at $P$. The collection of pinning sets forms a poset under inclusion, endowed with the cardinal function: its minimum defines the pinning number of the loop.
  We show that the decision problem associated to computing the pinning number of a plane loop is NP-complete. First, we implement a polynomial algorithm to check if a point-set is pinning, adapting a method of Birman--Series for computing intersection numbers of curves in surfaces. Then we reduce the problem to a boolean formula whose solutions correspond to pinning sets: for this we study immersed discs in detail to improve a theorem of Hass--Scott characterising taut loops, and apply an algorithm of Blank and Frisch. Finally, we reduce the vertex-cover problem for graphs to the pinning problem for plane loops.</description>

      <title>Grid homology for singular links in lens space and a resolution cube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we define grid homology for singular links in lens spaces and use it to construct a resolution cube for knot Floer homology of regular links in lens spaces. The results will first be proven over $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ and then extended to be over $\mathbb{Z}$ via a sign assignment. We will also describe the relationship between our grid homology and classical knot Floer homology over $\mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <title>Exotic elliptic surfaces without 1-handles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we consider a sufficient condition that a knot-surgery or log-transformation of $E(n)$ admits a handle decomposition without 1-handles. We show that if $K$ is a knot that the bridge number is $b(K)\le 9n$, then the knot-surgery $E(n)_K$ of the elliptic surface $E(n)$ admits a handle decomposition without 1-handles. This means that if $\gcd(p,q)=1$, and $\min\{p,q\}\le 9$, then $E(1)_{p,q}$ admits a handle decomposition without 1-handles. We also show that if $\gcd (p,q)=1$, $\min\{p,q\}\le 4$, then the double log-transformation $E(n)_{p,q}$ admits a handle decomposition without 1-handles for any positive integer $n$.</description>

      <title>Metric Space Magnitude for Evaluating the Diversity of Latent Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16054v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnitude of a metric space is a novel invariant that provides a measure of the 'effective size' of a space across multiple scales, while also capturing numerous geometrical properties, such as curvature, density, or entropy. We develop a family of magnitude-based measures of the intrinsic diversity of latent representations, formalising a novel notion of dissimilarity between magnitude functions of finite metric spaces. Our measures are provably stable under perturbations of the data, can be efficiently calculated, and enable a rigorous multi-scale characterisation and comparison of latent representations. We show their utility and superior performance across different domains and tasks, including (i) the automated estimation of diversity, (ii) the detection of mode collapse, and (iii) the evaluation of generative models for text, image, and graph data.</description>
