      <title>Crystal Ball: A Simple Model for Phase Transitions on a Classical Spherical Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When compressed, certain lattices undergo phase transitions that may allow nuclei to gain significant kinetic energy. To explore the dynamics of this phenomenon, we develop a framework to study Coulomb coupled N-body systems constrained to a parametric surface, focusing specifically on the case of a sphere, as in the Thomson problem. We initialize $N$ total Boron nuclei as point particles on the surface of a sphere, allowing the particles to equilibrate via Coulomb scattering with a viscous damping term. To simulate a phase transition, we remove $N_{rm}$ particles, forcing the system to rearrange into a new equilibrium. We develop a scaling relation for the average peak kinetic energy attained by a single particle as a function of $N$ and $N_{rm}$. For certain values of $N$, we find an order of magnitude energy gain when increasing $N_{rm}$ from 1 to 6, indicating that it may be possible to engineer a lattice that maximizes the energy output.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Majorana modes in the $p$-wave Kitaev chains on a square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological characteristics of the $p$-wave Kitaev chains on a square lattice with nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor inter-chains hopping and pairing are investigated. Besides gapless exact zero-energy modes, this model exhibits topological gapless phase hosting edge modes, which do not reside strictly at zero energy. However, these modes can be distinguished from the bulk states. These states are known as pseudo- or quasi-Majorana Modes (qMMs). The exploration of this system's bulk spectrum and Berry curvature reveals singularities and flux-carrying vortices within its Brillouin zone. These vortices indicate the presence of four-fold Dirac points arising from two-fold degenerate bands. Examining the Hamiltonian under a cylindrical geometry uncovers the edge properties, demonstrating the existence of topological edge modes. These modes are a direct topological consequence of the Dirac semimetal characteristics of the system. The system is analyzed under open boundary conditions to distinguish the multiple MZMs and qMMs. This analysis includes a study of the normalized site-dependent local density of states, which pinpoints the presence of localized edge states. Additionally, numerical evidence confirms the robustness of the edge modes against disorder perturbations. The emergence of topological edge states and Dirac points with zero Chern number indicates that this model is a weak topological superconductor.</description>

      <title>Concentrated subradiant modes in one-dimensional atomic array coupled with chiral waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.10785v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems have recently attracted broad interest and exhibited intriguing physical phenomena, in which the non-Hermitian skin effect is one of the most remarkable quantum phenomena desiring detailed investigations and has been widely studied in various fermionic and bosonic systems. Here we propose a non-Hermitian atom-waveguide system composed of a tilted one-dimensional atomic array coupled with two identical waveguides with opposite chiralities. Such system creates an effective lattice model including nonreciprocal long-range hoppings through the chiral-waveguide photon-mediated interactions. We find the excitation of the collective atomic states concentrates in the middle interface, pointing towards the non-Hermitian skin effect associated with subradiant modes, while, on the contrary, superradiant modes exhibit extended features. Simulation results present subradiant funneling effect, with robustness against small atomic position disorders. Our work underpins the fundamental comprehension towards the non-Hermitian skin effect in open quantum systems and also provide prospective paths to study non-Hermitian systems in the area of quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Two dark components of de Sitter Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The de Sitter vacuum serves as the thermal bath for matter with local temperature, which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature related to the cosmological horizon. This local temperature leads to the heating of matter. Here do not consider the real matter, but only the component which is related to the gravitational degrees of freedom and participates the thermodynamics of the de Sitter state. This gravitational component behaves as Zel'dovich stiff matter. The vacuum energy and the analog of the Zel'dovich stiff matter represent correspondingly the dark energy and dark matter. In equilibrium the positive partial pressure of dark matter compensates the negative partial pressure of quantum vacuum. That is why in the full equilibrium the total pressure is zero. This is rather similar to the correspondingly superfluid and normal components of superfluid liquid, which together produce the zero pressure of the liquid in the absence of environment. We extend this two dark components approach and the suggest the phenomenological theory, which describes the dynamics of the dark energy and the dark matter. For that we assume that the in dynamics, the gravitational dark matter also behaves as the real Zel'dovich stiff matter. In this phenomenological model, both components experience the power law decay due to the energy exchange between these components. Then it follows that their values at present time have the correct order of magnitude. How this phenomenology is supported by the microscopic physics is an open question.</description>

      <title>Thickness-Driven Transitions Between Novel Magnetic States in Ferromagnetic Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic materials hosting stable topological spin textures have demonstrated energy efficiency and potential as information carriers in novel logic and memory devices, offering an alternative to magnetic tunnel junction technology. While these structures are well understood in 2D, in 3D their stability, interactions, and topological transitions require further exploration. Here we present two thermodynamically stable topological states, termed the "hourglass" and "dome", in centrosymmetric magnetic films of varying thickness. Crucially, we observe thickness-dependent transitions between the two states, with regions of metastability where both configurations coexist. We construct a phase diagram detailing the parameter space for their existence and transitions, provide an effective description of the interactions that mediate the transition, and discuss the implications of this type of state switching.</description>

      <title>Transition between cooperative emission regimes in giant perovskite nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactions between emitters within an ensemble can give rise to cooperative processes that significantly alter the properties of the emitted light. One such process is superfluorescence (SF), where excited electric dipoles spontaneously couple coherently and effectively radiate as one macroscopic emitter. It requires low energetic disorder, high temporal coherence and oscillator strength, and sub-wavelength volumes of material can be sufficient. Conversely, amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) originates from an avalanche-like stimulated amplification of initially spontaneously emitted photons and does not necessitate temporally coherent interactions among the emitters, but rather requires spatially long enough light propagation within the material to harvest the optical gain. Cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) are one of the very few materials where both ASE (in disordered films) and SF (in ordered assemblies) were observed, however leaving unclear whether and how these regimes could be connected. Here, we demonstrate that temperature and excitation density can drive the transition between both regimes in a thin film of giant CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs. At temperatures below 45 K, excitonic SF was observed, whereas above a transition range between 45 K and 100 K, ASE prevails, but requires increased optical excitation and emitter density. Our results work out the different collective effects present in lead halide perovskites, providing fundamental insights into cooperative phenomena and important guidance for the development of compact and bright (quantum) light sources.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear transport theory at the order of quantum metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum metric, a probe to spacetime of the Hilbert space, has been found measurable in the nonlinear electronic transport and attracted tremendous interest. We show that the quantum metric is only a tip of the iceberg, by deriving unknown 11 out of 14 formulas of the quadratic nonlinear conductivity under the same symmetry that the quantum metric emerges. The formulas allow us to determine nonzero nonlinear conductivity elements for the magnetic point groups, calculate the quadratic nonlinear conductivity for arbitrary Hamiltonian, e.g., the even-layered MnBi$_2$Ti$_4$ thin films with and without the $C_{3}$ symmetry, and formulate scaling laws at the order of quantum metric to distinguish different mechanisms in the recent experiments. The theory is a comprehensive description of the quadratic nonlinear transport and will facilitate future experiments and applications.</description>

      <title>Self-Attention Assistant Classification of non-Hermitian Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14453v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classification of non-Hermitian topological phases becomes challenging due to interplay of the band topology and non-Hermiticity. The significant increase in data dimensions and the number of categories has rendered traditional supervised learning and unsupervised manifold learning failed. Here, we propose the self-attention assistant machine learning for clustering topological phases. By incorporating the self-attention mechanism, the model can effectively capture long-range dependencies and important patterns, resulting in a more compact and information-rich latent space. It can directly classify the eigenvectors and obtains the information of all topological phases. Our results provide a general method for studying non-Hermitian topological phase via machine learning.</description>

      <title>Fully Tunable Fano Resonances in Chiral Electronic Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fano resonance is believed to arise when a direct path interferes with a resonant path. We demonstrate that this is not true for chiral electronic transmission without additional direct paths. To address the Fano effect in chiral electronic transport, we suggest an electronic Mach-Zehnder-Fano interferometer (MZFI), which combines a quantum dot with an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Backscattering is completely suppressed in chiral electronic transport, yielding perfect Fano profiles that can be fully adjusted by an external magnetic flux in the transmission, linear conductance, and differential spectra. Even the current and shot noise for a symmetric interferometer with two arms of the same length exhibit fully controllable resonances and distinct Fano resonance characteristics. Along with the profiles, all of the transport spectra follow the same evolution pattern in a cycle that is resistant to changes in the device's defining parameters.</description>
