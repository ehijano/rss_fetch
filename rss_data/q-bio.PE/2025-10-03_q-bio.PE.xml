      <title>Bayesian Re-Analysis of the Phylogenetic Topology of Early SARS-CoV-2 Case Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A much-cited 2022 paper by Pekar et al. claimed that Bayesian analysis of the molecular phylogeny of early SARS-CoV-2 cases indicated that it was more likely that two successful introductions to humans had occurred than that just one had. Here I show that after correcting a fundamental error in Bayesian reasoning the results in that paper give larger likelihood for a single introduction than for two.</description>

      <title>Bi-Virus SIS Epidemic Propagation under Mutation and Game-theoretic Protection Adoption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a bi-virus susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model in which individuals are either susceptible or infected with one of two virus strains, and consider mutation-driven transitions between strains. The general case of bi-directional mutation is first analyzed, where we characterize the disease-free equilibrium and establish its global asymptotic stability, as well as the existence, uniqueness, and stability of an endemic equilibrium. We then present a game-theoretic framework where susceptible individuals strategically choose whether to adopt protection or remain unprotected, to maximize their instantaneous payoffs. We derive Nash strategies under bi-directional mutation, and subsequently consider the special case of unidirectional mutation. In the latter case, we show that coexistence of both strains is impossible when mutation occurs from the strain with lower reproduction number and transmission rate to the other strain. Furthermore, we fully characterize the stationary Nash equilibrium (SNE) in the setting permitting coexistence, and examine how mutation rates influence protection adoption and infection prevalence at the SNE. Numerical simulations corroborate the analytical results, demonstrating that infection levels decrease monotonically with higher protection adoption, and highlight the impact of mutation rates and protection cost on infection state trajectories.</description>

      <title>On the Geographic Spread of Chikungunya between Brazil and Florida: A Multi-patch Model with Time Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chikungunya (CHIK) is a viral disease transmitted to humans through the bites of {\it Aedes} mosquitoes infected with the chikungunya virus (CHIKV). CHIKV has been imported annually to Florida in the last decade due to Miami's crucial location as a hub for international travel, particularly from Central and South America including Brazil, where CHIK is endemic. This work addresses to the geographic spread of CHIK, incorporating factors such as human movement, temperature dependency, as well as vertical transmission, and incubation periods, for different patches. Central to the model is the integration of a multi-patch framework, and in the numerical analysis it is considered human movement between endemic Brazilian states and Florida. We establish crucial correlations between the mosquito reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_{m}$ and the disease reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_{0}$ with the disease dynamics in a multi-patch environment, encompassing not only a numerical analysis but also from a theoretical perspective. Through numerical simulations, validated with real population and temperature data, it is possible to understand the disease dynamics under many different scenarios and make future projections, offering insights for potential effective control strategies, as well as addressing the timing for these strategies to be adopted.</description>

      <title>Optimization of sequential therapies to maximize extinction of resistant bacteria through collateral sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) threatens global health. A promising and underexplored strategy to tackle this problem are sequential therapies exploiting collateral sensitivity (CS), whereby resistance to one drug increases sensitivity to another. Here, we develop a four-genotype stochastic birth-death model with two bacteriostatic antibiotics to identify switching periods that maximize bacterial extinction under subinhibitory concentrations. We show that extinction probability depends nonlinearly on switching period, with stepwise increases aligned to discrete switch events: fast sequential therapies are suboptimal as they do not allow for the evolution of resistance, a key ingredient in these therapies. A geometric distribution framework accurately predicts cumulative extinction probabilities where the per-switch extinction probability rises with switching period. We further derive a heuristic approximation for the extinction probability based on times to fixation of single-resistant mutants. Sensitivity analyses reveal that strong reciprocal CS is required for this strategy to work, and we explore how increasing antibiotic doses and higher mutation rates modulate extinction in a nonmonotonic manner. Finally, we discuss how optimal switching periods depend on treatment duration. Our results provide quantitative design principles for in vitro and clinical sequential antibiotic therapies, underscoring the potential of CS-guided regimens to suppress resistance evolution and eradicate infections.</description>
