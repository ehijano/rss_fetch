      <title>Dynamic tail risk forecasting: what do realized skewness and kurtosis add?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper compares the accuracy of tail risk forecasts with a focus on including realized skewness and kurtosis in "additive" and "multiplicative" models. Utilizing a panel of 960 US stocks, we conduct diagnostic tests, employ scoring functions, and implement rolling window forecasting to evaluate the performance of Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) forecasts. Additionally, we examine the impact of the window length on forecast accuracy. We propose model specifications that incorporate realized skewness and kurtosis for enhanced precision. Our findings provide insights into the importance of considering skewness and kurtosis in tail risk modeling, contributing to the existing literature and offering practical implications for risk practitioners and researchers.</description>

      <title>A simple but powerful tail index regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a flexible framework for the estimation of the conditional tail index of heavy tailed distributions. In this framework, the tail index is computed from an auxiliary linear regression model that facilitates estimation and inference based on established econometric methods, such as ordinary least squares (OLS), least absolute deviations, or M-estimation. We show theoretically and via simulations that OLS provides interesting results. Our Monte Carlo results highlight the adequate finite sample properties of the OLS tail index estimator computed from the proposed new framework and contrast its behavior to that of tail index estimates obtained by maximum likelihood estimation of exponential regression models, which is one of the approaches currently in use in the literature. An empirical analysis of the impact of determinants of the conditional left- and right-tail indexes of commodities' return distributions highlights the empirical relevance of our proposed approach. The novel framework's flexibility allows for extensions and generalizations in various directions, empowering researchers and practitioners to straightforwardly explore a wide range of research questions.</description>

      <title>Decomposition and Interpretation of Treatment Effects in Settings with Delayed Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11505v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies settings where the analyst is interested in identifying and estimating the average causal effect of a binary treatment on an outcome. We consider a setup in which the outcome realization does not get immediately realized after the treatment assignment, a feature that is ubiquitous in empirical settings. The period between the treatment and the realization of the outcome allows other observed actions to occur and affect the outcome. In this context, we study several regression-based estimands routinely used in empirical work to capture the average treatment effect and shed light on interpreting them in terms of ceteris paribus effects, indirect causal effects, and selection terms. We obtain three main and related takeaways. First, the three most popular estimands do not generally satisfy what we call \emph{strong sign preservation}, in the sense that these estimands may be negative even when the treatment positively affects the outcome conditional on any possible combination of other actions. Second, the most popular regression that includes the other actions as controls satisfies strong sign preservation \emph{if and only if} these actions are mutually exclusive binary variables. Finally, we show that a linear regression that fully stratifies the other actions leads to estimands that satisfy strong sign preservation.</description>
