      <title>Scalable Bayesian Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) plays a pivotal role in scientific machine learning, especially when surrogate models are used to approximate complex systems. Although multilayer perceptions (MLPs) are commonly employed as surrogates, they often suffer from overfitting due to their large number of parameters. Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) offer an alternative solution with fewer parameters. However, gradient-based inference methods, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), may result in computational inefficiency when applied to KANs, especially for large-scale datasets, due to the high cost of back-propagation.To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, combining the dropout Tikhonov ensemble Kalman inversion (DTEKI) with Chebyshev KANs. This gradient-free method effectively mitigates overfitting and enhances numerical stability. Additionally, we incorporate the active subspace method to reduce the parameter-space dimensionality, allowing us to improve the accuracy of predictions and obtain more reliable uncertainty estimates.Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in various test cases, including scenarios with large datasets and high noise levels. Our results show that the new method achieves comparable or better accuracy, much higher efficiency as well as stability compared to HMC, in addition to scalability. Moreover, by leveraging the low-dimensional parameter subspace, our method preserves prediction accuracy while substantially reducing further the computational cost.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Singular Value Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singular value decomposition is widely used in modal analysis, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and resolvent analysis, to extract key features from complex problems. SVD derivatives need to be computed efficiently to enable the large scale design optimization. However, for a general complex matrix, no method can accurately compute this derivative to machine precision and remain scalable with respect to the number of design variables without requiring the all of the singular variables. We propose two algorithms to efficiently compute this derivative based on the adjoint method and reverse automatic differentiation and RAD-based singular value derivative formula. Differentiation results for each method proposed were compared with FD results for one square and one tall rectangular matrix example and matched with the FD results to about 5 to 7 digits. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of the proposed method by calculating the derivatives of singular values with respect to the snapshot matrix derived from the POD of a large dataset for a laminar-turbulent transitional flow over a flat plate, sourced from the John Hopkins turbulence database.</description>

      <title>Stability and convergence of relaxed scalar auxiliary variable schemes for Cahn-Hilliard systems with bounded mass source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach of Shen et al. (2018), which presents a novel way to discretize a large class of gradient flows, has been extended and improved by many authors for general dissipative systems. In this work we consider a Cahn-Hilliard system with mass source that, for image processing and biological applications, may not admit a dissipative structure involving the Ginzburg-Landau energy. Hence, compared to previous works, the stability of SAV-discrete solutions for such systems is not immediate. We establish, with a bounded mass source, stability and convergence of time discrete solutions for a first-order relaxed SAV scheme in the sense of Jiang et al. (2022), and apply our ideas to Cahn-Hilliard systems appearing in diblock co-polymer phase separation, tumor growth, image inpainting and segmentation.</description>

      <title>Robust Multipatch IGA with Singular Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider elliptic problems in multipatch IGA where the patch parameterizations may be singular. To deal with this issue, we develop a robust weak formulation that allows trimmed (cut) elements, enforces interface and Dirichlet conditions weakly, and does not depend on specially constructed approximation spaces. Our technique for dealing with the singular maps is based on the regularization of the Riemannian metric tensor, and we detail how to implement this robustly. We investigate the method's behavior when applied to a square-to-cusp parameterization that allows us to vary the singular behavior's aggressiveness. We propose a scaling of the regularization parameter to obtain optimal order approximation. Our numerical experiments indicate that the method is robust also for quite aggressive singular parameterizations.</description>

      <title>Transient Instability and Patterns of Reactivity in Diffusive-Chemotaxis Soil Carbon Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pattern formation in diffusive-chemotaxis models has become increasingly important for understanding spatial structures in biological, ecological, and chemical systems. In soil, certain bacteria involved in the degradation of soil organic carbon (SOC) exhibit both motility and chemotactic behavior, as observed in experiments and field studies. To capture the formation of hot-spot soil aggregations resulting from bacterial and microorganism spatial organization, the spatially explicit MOMOS model incorporates chemotaxis into soil carbon dynamics, effectively describing the emergence of microbial aggregations and their impact on SOC dynamics. While classical studies on pattern formation primarily rely on asymptotic stability analysis, transient instability has emerged as a key mechanism for generating patterns in asymptotically stable systems. In this work, we investigate pattern formation outside the classical diffusive-chemotaxis-driven instability conditions by focusing on regions of parameter space associated with reactive equilibria. The MOMOS model for soil carbon dynamics serves as a case study to illustrate how transient behaviors can influence environmental dynamical systems. Using Klika's indicator, we estimate the maximum amplification and show that it provides a more accurate lower bound compared to the Kreiss constant. Furthermore, we explore the critical role of return time, showing that short return times suppress the emergence of stable reactive patterns. By employing the determinant of the linearized Jacobian as a proxy for return time, we identify a critical region near the instability boundary where multiple stable reactive patterns emerge.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Vector Subdivision Schemes with a General Matrix-valued Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subdivision schemes are closely related to splines and wavelets and have numerous applications in CAGD and numerical differential equations. Subdivision schemes employ a scalar filter; that is, scalar subdivision schemes, have been extensively studied in the literature. In contrast, subdivision schemes with a matrix filter, which are the so-called vector subdivision schemes, are far from being well understood. So far, only vector subdivision schemes that use special matrix-valued filters have been well-investigated, such as the Lagrange and Hermite subdivision schemes. To the best of our knowledge, it remains unclear how to define and characterize the convergence of a vector subdivision scheme that uses a general matrix-valued filter. Though filters from Lagrange and Hermite subdivision schemes have nice properties and are widely used in practice, filters not from either subdivision scheme appear in many applications. Hence, it is necessary to study vector subdivision schemes with a general matrix-valued filter. In this paper, from the perspective of a vector cascade algorithm, we show that there is only one meaningful way to define a vector subdivision scheme. We will analyze the convergence of the newly defined vector subdivision scheme and show that it is equivalent to the convergence of the corresponding vector cascade algorithm. Applying our theory, we show that existing results on the convergence of Lagrange and Hermite subdivision schemes can be easily obtained and improved. Finally, we will present some examples of vector subdivision schemes to illustrate our main results.</description>

      <title>A simple-to-implement nonlinear preconditioning of Newton's method for solving the steady Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Newton's method for solving stationary Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) is known to convergent fast, however, may fail due to a bad initial guess. This work presents a simple-to-implement nonlinear preconditioning of Newton's iteration, that remains the quadratic convergence and enlarges the domain of convergence. The proposed AAPicard-Newton method adds the Anderson accelerated Picard step at each iteration of Newton's method for solving NSE, which has been shown globally stable for the relaxation parameter $\beta_{k+1}\equiv1$ in the Anderson acceleration optimization step, convergent quadratically, and converges faster with a smaller convergence rate for large Reynolds number. Several benchmark numerical tests have been tested and are well-aligned with the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Implicit Time-Marching for Lagrange Multiplier Formulation for Couple Stress Elastodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of metamaterials and architected materials has increased interest in continuum mechanics models that capture size-dependent microstructure interactions. Among these, Consistent Couple-Stress Theory (C-CST) accounts for mechanical interactions at the microscale adding higher-order derivatives in the strain energy. Previous studies have explored the dynamics of C-CST using methods such as convolutional principles or inverse Laplace transforms to obtain time-dependent solutions. In contrast, our results show that implicit time integration, applied to a mixed finite element method with a Lagrange multiplier, provides direct time-domain solutions for dynamic C-CST modeling and ensures solution stability. In particular, the proposed finite element scheme is verified in comparison with results from previous literature, by employing the Method of Manufactured Solutions in the static case and dynamic simulations of simple cases. The approach presented introduces new tools for studying size-dependent material behavior, laying the groundwork for further applications in advanced material design and wave propagation studies.</description>

      <title>Surrogate-based multilevel Monte Carlo methods for uncertainty quantification in the Grad-Shafranov free boundary problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a hybrid technique to quantify the variability in the numerical solutions to a free boundary problem associated with magnetic equilibrium in axisymmetric fusion reactors amidst parameter uncertainties. The method aims at reducing computational costs by integrating a surrogate model into a multilevel Monte Carlo method. The resulting surrogate-enhanced multilevel Monte Carlo methods reduce the cost of simulation by factors as large as $10^4$ compared to standard Monte Carlo simulations involving direct numerical solutions of the associated Grad-Shafranov partial differential equation. Accuracy assessments also show that surrogate-based sampling closely aligns with the results of direct computation, confirming its effectiveness in capturing the behavior of plasma boundary and geometric descriptors.</description>

      <title>Analytical and Numerical Study of a Convection-Diffusion-Reaction-Source Problem in Multilayered Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, a thermal energy transfer problem in a one-dimensional multilayer body is theoretically analyzed, considering diffusion, advection, internal heat generation or loss linearly dependent on temperature in each layer, as well as heat generation due to external sources. Additionally, the thermal contact resistance at the interfaces between each pair of materials is taken into account. The problem is mathematically modeled, and explicit analytical solutions are derived using Fourier techniques. A convergent finite difference scheme is also formulated to simulate specific cases. The solution is consistent with previous results. A numerical example is provided, demonstrating the coherence between the obtained results and the physical behavior of the problem. This work was recently published for a two-layer body; the generalization to m-layer bodies allows for conclusions that enhance the theoretical understanding of heat transfer in multilayer materials and may contribute to improving the thermal design of multilayer engineering systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the properties of continuous frames, with a particular focus on phase retrieval and norm retrieval in the context of Hilbert spaces. We introduce the concept of continuous near-Riesz bases and prove their invariance under invertible operators. Some equivalent conditions for phase and norm retrieval property of continuous frames are presented. We study the stability of phase retrieval under perturbations. Furthermore, tensor product frames for separable Hilbert spaces are studied, and we establish the equivalence of phase retrieval and norm retrieval properties between components and their tensor products.</description>

      <title>Sharp estimates for the convergence rate of Orthomin(k) for a class of linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.2669</link>
      <description>arXiv:1109.2669v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we show that the convergence rate of Orthomin($k$) applied to systems of the form $(I+\rho U) x = b$, where $U$ is a unitary operator and $0&lt;\rho&lt;1$, is less than or equal to $\rho$. Moreover, we give examples of operators $U$ and $\rho&gt;0$ for which the asymptotic convergence rate of Orthomin($k$) is exactly $\rho$, thus showing that the estimate is sharp. While the systems under scrutiny may not be of great interest in themselves, their existence shows that, in general, Orthomin($k$) does not converge faster than Orthomin(1). Furthermore, we give examples of systems for which Orthomin($k$) has the same asymptotic convergence rate as Orthomin(2) for $k\ge 2$, but smaller than that of Orthomin(1). The latter systems are related to the numerical solution of certain partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Multiscale analysis via pseudo-reversing and applications to manifold-valued sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling data using manifold values is a powerful concept with numerous advantages, particularly in addressing nonlinear phenomena. This approach captures the intrinsic geometric structure of the data, leading to more accurate descriptors and more efficient computational processes. However, even fundamental tasks like compression and data enhancement present meaningful challenges in the manifold setting. This paper introduces a multiscale transform that aims to represent manifold-valued sequences at different scales, enabling novel data processing tools for various applications. Similar to traditional methods, our construction is based on a refinement operator that acts as an upsampling operator and a corresponding downsampling operator. Inspired by Wiener's lemma, we term the latter as the reverse of the former. It turns out that some upsampling operators, for example, least-squares-based refinement, do not have a practical reverse. Therefore, we introduce the notion of pseudo-reversing and explore its analytical properties and asymptotic behavior. We derive analytical properties of the induced multiscale transform and conclude the paper with numerical illustrations showcasing different aspects of the pseudo-reversing and two data processing applications involving manifolds.</description>

      <title>Discrete de-Rham complex involving a discontinuous finite element space for velocities: the case of periodic straight triangular and Cartesian meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to derive discontinuous finite elements vector spaces which can be put in a discrete de-Rham complex for which an harmonic gap property may be proven. First, discontinuous finite element spaces inspired by classical N{\'e}d{\'e}lec or Raviart-Thomas conforming space are considered, and we prove that by relaxing the normal or tangential constraint, discontinuous spaces ensuring the harmonic gap property can be built. Then the triangular case is addressed, for which we prove that such a property holds for the classical discontinuous finite element space for vectors. On Cartesian meshes, this result does not hold for the classical discontinuous finite element space for vectors. We then show how to use the de-Rham complex found for triangular meshes for enriching the finite element space on Cartesian meshes in order to recover a de-Rham complex, on which the same harmonic gap property is proven.</description>

      <title>Approximation properties relative to continuous scale space for hybrid discretizations of Gaussian derivative operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05095v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of properties of two hybrid discretization methods for Gaussian derivatives, based on convolutions with either the normalized sampled Gaussian kernel or the integrated Gaussian kernel followed by central differences. The motivation for studying these discretization methods is that in situations when multiple spatial derivatives of different order are needed at the same scale level, they can be computed significantly more efficiently compared to more direct derivative approximations based on explicit convolutions with either sampled Gaussian kernels or integrated Gaussian kernels.
  While these computational benefits do also hold for the genuinely discrete approach for computing discrete analogues of Gaussian derivatives, based on convolution with the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel followed by central differences, the underlying mathematical primitives for the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel, in terms of modified Bessel functions of integer order, may not be available in certain frameworks for image processing, such as when performing deep learning based on scale-parameterized filters in terms of Gaussian derivatives, with learning of the scale levels.
  In this paper, we present a characterization of the properties of these hybrid discretization methods, in terms of quantitative performance measures concerning the amount of spatial smoothing that they imply, as well as the relative consistency of scale estimates obtained from scale-invariant feature detectors with automatic scale selection, with an emphasis on the behaviour for very small values of the scale parameter, which may differ significantly from corresponding results obtained from the fully continuous scale-space theory, as well as between different types of discretization methods.</description>

Abstract: The paper addresses the numerical approximation of two variants of hyperbolic mean curvature flow of surfaces in $\mathbb R^3$. For each evolution law we propose both a finite element method, as well as a finite difference scheme in the case of axially symmetric surfaces. We present a number of numerical simulations, including convergence tests as well as simulations suggesting the onset of singularities.</description>

      <title>Multilevel randomized quasi-Monte Carlo estimator for nested integration</title>

Abstract: Nested integration problems arise in various scientific and engineering applications, including Bayesian experimental design, financial risk assessment, and uncertainty quantification. These nested integrals take the form $\int f\left(\int g(\bs{y},\bs{x})\di{}\bs{x}\right)\di{}\bs{y}$, for nonlinear $f$, making them computationally challenging, particularly in high-dimensional settings. Although widely used for single integrals, traditional Monte Carlo (MC) methods can be inefficient when encountering complexities of nested integration. This work introduces a novel multilevel estimator, combining deterministic and randomized quasi-MC (rQMC) methods to handle nested integration problems efficiently. In this context, the inner number of samples and the discretization accuracy of the inner integrand evaluation constitute the level. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the estimator, deriving error bounds demonstrating significant reductions in bias and variance compared with standard methods. The proposed estimator is particularly effective in scenarios where the integrand is evaluated approximately, as it adapts to different levels of resolution without compromising precision. We verify the performance of our method via numerical experiments, focusing on estimating the expected information gain of experiments. When applied to Gaussian noise in the experiment, a truncation scheme ensures finite error bounds at the same computational complexity as in the bounded noise case up to multiplicative logarithmic terms. The results reveal that the proposed multilevel rQMC estimator outperforms existing MC and rQMC approaches, offering a substantial reduction in computational costs and offering a powerful tool for practitioners dealing with complex, nested integration problems across various domains.</description>

      <title>Improving Numerical Error Bounds Near Sharp Interface Limit for Stochastic Reaction-Diffusion Equations</title>

Abstract: In the study of geometric surface evolutions, stochastic reaction-diffusion equation provides a powerful tool for capturing and simulating complex dynamics. A critical challenge in this area is developing numerical approximations that exhibit error bounds with polynomial dependence on $\vv^{-1}$, where the small parameter $\vv&gt;0$ represents the diffuse interface thickness. The existence of such bounds for fully discrete approximations of stochastic reaction-diffusion equations remains unclear in the literature. In this work, we address this challenge by leveraging the asymptotic log-Harnack inequality to overcome the exponential growth of $\vv^{-1}$. Furthermore, we establish the numerical weak error bounds under the truncated Wasserstein distance for the spectral Galerkin method and a fully discrete tamed Euler scheme, with explicit polynomial dependence on $\vv^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Dual Cone Gradient Descent for Training Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a prominent approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by minimizing a combined loss function that incorporates both boundary loss and PDE residual loss. Despite their remarkable empirical performance in various scientific computing tasks, PINNs often fail to generate reasonable solutions, and such pathological behaviors remain difficult to explain and resolve. In this paper, we identify that PINNs can be adversely trained when gradients of each loss function exhibit a significant imbalance in their magnitudes and present a negative inner product value. To address these issues, we propose a novel optimization framework, Dual Cone Gradient Descent (DCGD), which adjusts the direction of the updated gradient to ensure it falls within a dual cone region. This region is defined as a set of vectors where the inner products with both the gradients of the PDE residual loss and the boundary loss are non-negative. Theoretically, we analyze the convergence properties of DCGD algorithms in a non-convex setting. On a variety of benchmark equations, we demonstrate that DCGD outperforms other optimization algorithms in terms of various evaluation metrics. In particular, DCGD achieves superior predictive accuracy and enhances the stability of training for failure modes of PINNs and complex PDEs, compared to existing optimally tuned models. Moreover, DCGD can be further improved by combining it with popular strategies for PINNs, including learning rate annealing and the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK).</description>

      <title>An accelerated gradient method with adaptive restart for convex multiobjective optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, based on the continuous time approach, we propose an accelerated gradient method with adaptive residual restart for convex multiobjective optimization problems. For the first, we derive rigorously the continuous limit of the multiobjective accelerated proximal gradient method by Tanabe et al. [Comput. Optim. Appl., 2023]. It is a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) that involves a special projection operator and can be viewed as an extension of the ODE by Su et al. [J. Mach. Learn. Res., 2016] for Nesterov's accelerated gradient method. Then, we introduce a novel accelerated multiobjective gradient (AMG) flow with tailored time scaling that adapts automatically to the convex case and the strongly convex case, and the exponential decay rate of a merit function along with the solution trajectory of AMG flow is established via the Lyapunov analysis. After that, we consider an implicit-explicit time discretization and obtain an accelerated multiobjective gradient method with a convex quadratic programming subproblem. The fast sublinear rate and linear rate are proved respectively for convex and strongly convex problems. In addition, we present an efficient residual based adaptive restart technique to overcome the oscillation issue and improve the convergence significantly. Numerical results are provided to validate the practical performance of the proposed method.</description>
