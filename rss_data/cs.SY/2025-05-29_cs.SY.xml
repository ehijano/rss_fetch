      <title>Learning-Based Robust Fixed-Time Terminal Sliding Mode Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop and analyze an integral fixed-time sliding mode control method for a scenario in which the system model is only partially known, utilizing Gaussian processes. We present two theorems on fixed-time convergence. The first theorem addresses the fully known system model, while the second considers situations where the system's drift is approximated utilizing Gaussian processes (GP) for approximating unknown dynamics. Both theorems establish the global fixed-time stability of the closed-loop system. The stability analysis is based on a straightforward quadratic Lyapunov function. Our proposed method outperforms an established adaptive fixed-time sliding mode control approach, especially when ample training data is available.</description>

      <title>Local Stability and Region of Attraction Analysis for Neural Network Feedback Systems under Positivity Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the local stability of nonlinear systems in the Lur'e form with static nonlinear feedback realized by feedforward neural networks (FFNNs). By leveraging positivity system constraints, we employ a localized variant of the Aizerman conjecture, which provides sufficient conditions for exponential stability of trajectories confined to a compact set. Using this foundation, we develop two distinct methods for estimating the Region of Attraction (ROA): (i) a less conservative Lyapunov-based approach that constructs invariant sublevel sets of a quadratic function satisfying a linear matrix inequality (LMI), and (ii) a novel technique for computing tight local sector bounds for FFNNs via layer-wise propagation of linear relaxations. These bounds are integrated into the localized Aizerman framework to certify local exponential stability. Numerical results demonstrate substantial improvements over existing integral quadratic constraint-based approaches in both ROA size and scalability.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of DC Network Representation for GIC Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geomagnetic disturbances are a threat to the reliability and security of our national critical energy infrastructures. These events specifically result in geomagnetically induced currents, which can cause damage to transformers due to magnetic saturation. In order to mitigate these effects, blocker devices must be placed in optimal locations. Finding this placement requires a dc representation of the ac transmission lines, which this paper discusses. Different decisions in this process, including the method of representing the blocking devices, result in significant variations to the power loss calculations. To analyze these effects, we conclude the paper by comparing the losses on a sample network with different modeling implementations.</description>

      <title>Detecting Switching Attacks On Traffic Flow Regulation For Changing Driving Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern traffic management systems increasingly adopt hierarchical control strategies for improved efficiency and scalability, where a local traffic controller mode is chosen by a supervisory controller based on the changing large-scale driving patterns. Unfortunately, such local metering controllers are also vulnerable to cyberattacks that can disrupt the controller switching, leading to undesired, inefficient, and even unsafe traffic operations. Additionally, the detection of such attacks becomes challenging when the operational mode of the traffic is uncertain and the operational mode identification is delayed. Thus, in this work, we propose a cyberattack detection scheme to detect the compromised controller switching in ramp metering for an uncertain, multimodal macroscopic traffic operation of a freeway segment. In particular, we propose a bank of detectors corresponding to each admissible traffic mode that can compensate for the uncertain traffic mode of the freeway. Furthermore, we utilize backstepping tools along with Lyapunov function theory to achieve analytical performance guarantees for the detector, such as nominal exponential stability, anomaly/uncertainty-to-residual stability, robustness, and sensitivity. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed detection scheme through simulations of free traffic under realistic traffic parameters, uncertainties, and commonly occurring attack scenarios.</description>

      <title>Voltage Control of the Boost Converter: PI vs. Nonlinear Passivity-based Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry-out a detailed analysis of direct voltage control of a Boost converter feeding a simple resistive load. First, we prove that using a classical PI control to stabilize a desired equilibrium leads to a very complicated dynamic behavior consisting of two equilibrium points, one of them always unstable for all PI gains and circuit parameter values. Interestingly, the second equilibrium point may be rendered stable -- but for all tuning gains leading to an extremely large value of the circuit current and the controller integrator state. Moreover, if we neglect the resistive effect of the inductor, there is only one equilibrium and it is always unstable. From a practical point of view, it is important to note that the only useful equilibrium point is that of minimum current and that, in addition, there is always a resistive component in the inductor either by its parasitic resistance or by the resistive component of the output impedance of the previous stage. In opposition to this troublesome scenario we recall three nonlinear voltage-feedback controllers, that ensure asymptotic stability of the desired equilibrium with simple gain tuning rules, an easily defined domain of attraction and smooth transient behavior. Two of them are very simple, nonlinear, static voltage feedback rules, while the third one is a variation of the PID scheme called PID-Passivity-based Control (PBC). In its original formulation PID-PBC requires full state measurement, but we present a modified version that incorporates a current observer. All three nonlinear controllers are designed following the principles of PBC, which has had enormous success in many engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Interturn Fault Detection in IPMSMs: Two Adaptive Observer-based Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of online detection of inter-turn short-circuit faults (ITSCFs) that occur in permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs). We propose two solutions to this problem: (i) a very simple linear observer and (ii) a generalized parameter estimation based observer, that incorporates a high performance estimator -- with both observers detecting the short-circuit current and the fault intensity. Although the first solution guarantees the detection of the fault exponentially fast, the rate of convergence is fully determined by the motor parameters that, in some cases, may be too slow. The second observer, on the other hand, ensures finite convergence time under the weakest assumption of interval excitation. To make the observers adaptive, we develop a parameter estimator that, in the case of isotropic PMSMs, estimates on-line (exponentially fast) the resistance and inductance of the motor. It should be underscored that, in contrast with existing observers (including the widely popular Kalman filter) that provide indirect information of the fault current, our observers provide explicit one -- namely the amplitude of the fault current. The performance of both observers, in their linear and generalized parameter estimation-based versions, is illustrated with realistic simulation studies.</description>

      <title>System Identification for Virtual Sensor-Based Model Predictive Control: Application to a 2-DoF Direct-Drive Robotic Arm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) offers a powerful approach for controlling complex nonlinear systems, yet faces two key challenges. First, accurately modeling nonlinear dynamics remains difficult. Second, variables directly related to control objectives often cannot be directly measured during operation. Although high-cost sensors can acquire these variables during model development, their use in practical deployment is typically infeasible. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Predictive Virtual Sensor Identification (PVSID) framework that leverages temporary high-cost sensors during the modeling phase to create virtual sensors for NMPC implementation. We validate PVSID on a Two-Degree-of-Freedom (2-DoF) direct-drive robotic arm with complex joint interactions, capturing tip position via motion capture during modeling and utilize an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in NMPC. Experimental results show our NMPC with identified virtual sensors achieves precise tip trajectory tracking without requiring the motion capture system during operation. PVSID offers a practical solution for implementing optimal control in nonlinear systems where the measurement of key variables is constrained by cost or operational limitations.</description>

      <title>Latent Representations for Control Design with Provable Stability and Safety Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate a formal study on the use of low-dimensional latent representations of dynamical systems for verifiable control synthesis. Our main goal is to enable the application of verification techniques -- such as Lyapunov or barrier functions -- that might otherwise be computationally prohibitive when applied directly to the full state representation. Towards this goal, we first provide dynamics-aware approximate conjugacy conditions which formalize the notion of reconstruction error necessary for systems analysis. We then utilize our conjugacy conditions to transfer the stability and invariance guarantees of a latent certificate function (e.g., a Lyapunov or barrier function) for a latent space controller back to the original system. Importantly, our analysis contains several important implications for learning latent spaces and dynamics, by highlighting the necessary geometric properties which need to be preserved by the latent space, in addition to providing concrete loss functions for dynamics reconstruction that are directly related to control design. We conclude by demonstrating the applicability of our theory to two case studies: (1) stabilization of a cartpole system, and (2) collision avoidance for a two vehicle system.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Connectivity and Scheduling of Near/Far Field Users in Massive MIMO NOMA System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is envisioned that the next generations of wireless communication environment will be characterized with dense traffic demand due to the prediction that there will be large numbers of active users. Hence, it is important to find a solution to deal with such dense numbers of users. This paper investigates optimizing the connectivity and users scheduling to improve the performance of near and far field users in a downlink, multiuser, massive MIMO-NOMA system. For the considered system model, combining NOMA side by side with massive MIMO offers a great opportunity to exploit the available radio resources and boost the overall system efficiency. The paper proposes separate clustering of near field users and far field users. It also proposes using a beamforming scheme to separately serve the users within each cluster. However, NOMA is proposed to be applied among all users to boost resource sharing. In particular, a cognitive-NOMA beamforming scheme and NOMA themed beamforming are proposed to serve the users within each cluster, and they are compared against random beamforming from literature. Simulation results show that both of the proposed beamforming schemes proved their superiority as compared to random beamforming. Several scheduling techniques were also considered in this paper to examine possible solutions for boosting the system performance considered, namely, priority, joint, dynamic, and fairness-based scheduling techniques for both near field and far field users. The paper also proposes a suboptimal, fairness aiming and gradual allocation approach for allocating the transmission power among the users. The results show that user-clustering offers better connectivity and scheduling performance than the case where no clustering is applied.</description>

      <title>CF-DETR: Coarse-to-Fine Transformer for Real-Time Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection Transformers (DETR) are increasingly adopted in autonomous vehicle (AV) perception systems due to their superior accuracy over convolutional networks. However, concurrently executing multiple DETR tasks presents significant challenges in meeting firm real-time deadlines (R1) and high accuracy requirements (R2), particularly for safety-critical objects, while navigating the inherent latency-accuracy trade-off under resource constraints. Existing real-time DNN scheduling approaches often treat models generically, failing to leverage Transformer-specific properties for efficient resource allocation. To address these challenges, we propose CF-DETR, an integrated system featuring a novel coarse-to-fine Transformer architecture and a dedicated real-time scheduling framework NPFP**. CF-DETR employs three key strategies (A1: coarse-to-fine inference, A2: selective fine inference, A3: multi-level batch inference) that exploit Transformer properties to dynamically adjust patch granularity and attention scope based on object criticality, aiming to satisfy R2. The NPFP** scheduling framework (A4) orchestrates these adaptive mechanisms A1-A3. It partitions each DETR task into a safety-critical coarse subtask for guaranteed critical object detection within its deadline (ensuring R1), and an optional fine subtask for enhanced overall accuracy (R2), while managing individual and batched execution. Our extensive evaluations on server, GPU-enabled embedded platforms, and actual AV platforms demonstrate that CF-DETR, under an NPFP** policy, successfully meets strict timing guarantees for critical operations and achieves significantly higher overall and critical object detection accuracy compared to existing baselines across diverse AV workloads.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Voltage Unbalance Metrics in Distribution Networks with High DER Penetration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voltage unbalance, caused by variations in voltage magnitude and phase angle, is a significant power quality issue in three-phase systems, leading to equipment inefficiencies and increased system losses. The integration of distributed energy resources (DER) into the grid adds complexity, as DER can either reduce or worsen voltage unbalance, depending on factors such as grid configuration and the distribution of loads and DER themselves. This study explores the effects of DER penetration on voltage unbalance levels and the accuracy of the different indices most commonly used to quantify this unbalance. The results highlight the varying impacts of DER on unbalance and index performance, emphasizing the need for effective strategies to assess voltage unbalance in modern distribution systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of designing an aperiodic sampled-data controller stabilizing the zero-input equilibrium of an uncertain affine plant. The closed-loop system is modeled as a hybrid dynamical system incorporating a timer triggering the occurrence of the sampling events and two memory states storing the value of the controller state and controller output at each sampling time. Necessary and sufficient conditions on the controller parameters are given to establish the sought property. A constructive controller design algorithm based on sum-of-squares programming is given. A numerical example illustrates the effectiveness of the approach.</description>

      <title>Integrated design of system structure and delayed resonator towards efficient non-collocated vibration absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of non-collocated vibration absorption by a delayed resonator is addressed with emphasis on system fatigue resistance and energy efficiency of control actions. The analysis is performed for a system consisting of an arbitrary large series of flexibly linked single-degree-of-freedom masses. For the stage where the vibration of the target mass is fully absorbed by the non-collocated resonator, key forces, motion amplitudes and potential energies across the system structure are assessed. Next, a complete parameter set of the resonator gain and delay is derived, and the actuation force and power needed by the resonator for the full vibration absorption is determined. The derived quantities are utilized in forming an optimization problem to balance minimal risk of fatigue across the system structure and power needed by the resonator, under the closed loop stability and parameter constraints. Next to the gain and delay of the resonator, selected structural parameters of the system are used as variables in the constrained nonlinear optimization problem. Experimental and numerical case studies are included to demonstrate benefits of the proposed integrated structural and control design.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Periodic Systems: An Algebraic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of row-by-row (or diagonal) decoupling of discrete-time linear multi-input multi-output systems with periodic time-varying coefficients using periodic state feedback. Previous solutions have tackled row-by-row decoupling using dynamic compensation for square systems and block-decoupling through regular state feedback for nonsquare systems with more outputs than inputs. While it appears likely that a row-by-row state feedback solution for square systems can be deduced from these findings, a direct argument seems more appropriate here as it presents a natural extension for decoupling nonsquare systems with more inputs than outputs. This extension, which necessitates nonregular state feedback, has yet to be explored for periodic systems. Our approach is purely algebraic, based on a time-invariant representation of the periodic system.</description>

      <title>Split the Yield, Share the Risk: Pricing, Hedging and Fixed rates in DeFi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first formal treatment of \emph{yield tokenization}, a mechanism that decomposes yield-bearing assets into principal and yield components to facilitate risk transfer and price discovery in decentralized finance (DeFi). We propose a model that characterizes yield token dynamics using stochastic differential equations. We derive a no-arbitrage pricing framework for yield tokens, enabling their use in hedging future yield volatility and managing interest rate risk in decentralized lending pools. Taking DeFi lending as our focus, we show how both borrowers and lenders can use yield tokens to achieve optimal hedging outcomes and mitigate exposure to adversarial interest rate manipulation. Furthermore, we design automated market makers (AMMs) that incorporate a menu of bonding curves to aggregate liquidity from participants with heterogeneous risk preferences. This leads to an efficient and incentive-compatible mechanism for trading yield tokens and yield futures. Building on these foundations, we propose a modular \textit{fixed-rate} lending protocol that synthesizes on-chain yield token markets and lending pools, enabling robust interest rate discovery and enhancing capital efficiency. Our work provides the theoretical underpinnings for risk management and fixed-income infrastructure in DeFi, offering practical mechanisms for stable and sustainable yield markets.</description>

      <title>PGLearn -- An Open-Source Learning Toolkit for Optimal Power Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) techniques for Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems have recently garnered significant attention, reflecting a broader trend of leveraging ML to approximate and/or accelerate the resolution of complex optimization problems. These developments are necessitated by the increased volatility and scale in energy production for modern and future grids. However, progress in ML for OPF is hindered by the lack of standardized datasets and evaluation metrics, from generating and solving OPF instances, to training and benchmarking machine learning models. To address this challenge, this paper introduces PGLearn, a comprehensive suite of standardized datasets and evaluation tools for ML and OPF. PGLearn provides datasets that are representative of real-life operating conditions, by explicitly capturing both global and local variability in the data generation, and by, for the first time, including time series data for several large-scale systems. In addition, it supports multiple OPF formulations, including AC, DC, and second-order cone formulations. Standardized datasets are made publicly available to democratize access to this field, reduce the burden of data generation, and enable the fair comparison of various methodologies. PGLearn also includes a robust toolkit for training, evaluating, and benchmarking machine learning models for OPF, with the goal of standardizing performance evaluation across the field. By promoting open, standardized datasets and evaluation metrics, PGLearn aims at democratizing and accelerating research and innovation in machine learning applications for optimal power flow problems. Datasets are available for download at https://www.huggingface.co/PGLearn.</description>

      <title>Flexure-FET-Based Receiver with Competitive Binding for Interference Mitigation in Molecular Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC), a biologically inspired technology, enables applications in nanonetworks and the Internet of Everything (IoE), with great potential for intra-body systems such as drug delivery, health monitoring, and disease detection. This paper extends our prior work on the Flexure-FET MC receiver by integrating a competitive binding model to enhance performance in high-interference environments, where multiple molecular species coexist in the reception space. Previous studies have largely focused on ligand concentration estimation and detection, without fully addressing the effects of inter-species competition for receptor binding. Our proposed framework captures this competition, offering a more biologically accurate model for multitarget environments. By incorporating competition dynamics, the model improves understanding of MC behavior under interference. This approach enables fine-tuning of receptor responses by adjusting ligand concentrations and receptor affinities, thereby optimizing the performance of the Flexure-FET MC receiver. Comprehensive analysis shows that accounting for competitive binding is crucial for improving reliability and accuracy in complex MC systems. Factors such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), symbol error probability (SEP), interferer concentration, and receptor dynamics are shown to significantly affect performance. The proposed framework highlights the need to manage these factors effectively. Results demonstrate that modeling interference through competitive binding offers a realistic system perspective and allows tuning of receiver response, enabling robust detection in environments with multiple coexisting species.</description>

      <title>Spring-Brake! Handed Shearing Auxetics Improve Efficiency of Hopping and Standing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy efficiency is critical to the success of legged robotics. Efficiency is lost through wasted energy during locomotion and standing. Including elastic elements has been shown to reduce movement costs, while including breaks can reduce standing costs. However, adding separate elements for each increases the mass and complexity of a leg, reducing overall system performance. Here we present a novel compliant mechanism using a Handed Shearing Auxetic (HSA) that acts as a spring and break in a monopod hopping robot. The HSA acts as a parallel elastic actuator, reducing electrical power for dynamic hopping and matching the efficiency of state-of-the-art compliant hoppers. The HSA\u2019s auxetic behavior enables dual functionality. During static tasks, it locks under large forces with minimal input power by blocking deformation, creating high friction similar to a capstan mechanism. This allows the leg to support heavy loads without motor torque, addressing thermal inefficiency. The multi-functional design enhances both dynamic and static performance, offering a versatile solution for robotic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lyapunov's theorem provides a foundational characterization of stable equilibrium points in dynamical systems. In this paper, we develop a framework for stability for F-coalgebras. We give two definitions for a categorical setting in which we can study the stability of a coalgebra for an endofunctor F. One is minimal and better suited for concrete settings, while the other is more intricate and provides a richer theory. We prove a Lyapunov theorem for both notions of setting for stability, and a converse Lyapunov theorem for the second.</description>

      <title>Long Duration Inspection of GNSS-Denied Environments with a Tethered UAV-UGV Marsupial System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become essential tools in inspection and emergency response operations due to their high maneuverability and ability to access hard-to-reach areas. However, their limited battery life significantly restricts their use in long-duration missions. This paper presents a novel tethered marsupial robotic system composed of a UAV and an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV), specifically designed for autonomous, long-duration inspection tasks in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments. The system extends the UAV's operational time by supplying power through a tether connected to high-capacity battery packs carried by the UGV. We detail the hardware architecture based on off-the-shelf components to ensure replicability and describe our full-stack software framework, which is composed of open-source components and built upon the Robot Operating System (ROS). The proposed software architecture enables precise localization using a Direct LiDAR Localization (DLL) method and ensures safe path planning and coordinated trajectory tracking for the integrated UGV-tether-UAV system. We validate the system through three field experiments: (1) a manual flight endurance test to estimate the operational duration, (2) an autonomous navigation test, and (3) an inspection mission to demonstrate autonomous inspection capabilities. Experimental results confirm the robustness and autonomy of the system, its capacity to operate in GNSS-denied environments, and its potential for long-endurance, autonomous inspection and monitoring tasks.</description>

      <title>Constraints and Variables Reduction for Optimal Power Flow Using Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks with Virtual Node-Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power system networks are often modeled as homogeneous graphs, which limits the ability of graph neural network (GNN) to capture individual generator features at the same nodes. By introducing the proposed virtual node-splitting strategy, generator-level attributes like costs, limits, and ramp rates can be fully captured by GNN models, improving GNN's learning capacity and prediction accuracy. Optimal power flow (OPF) problem is used for real-time grid operations. Limited timeframe motivates studies to create size-reduced OPF (ROPF) models to relieve the computational complexity. In this paper, with virtual node-splitting, a novel two-stage adaptive hierarchical GNN is developed to (i) predict critical lines that would be congested, and then (ii) predict base generators that would operate at the maximum capacity. This will substantially reduce the constraints and variables needed for OPF, creating the proposed ROPFLG model with reduced monitor lines and reduced generator-specific variables and constraints. Two ROPF models, ROPFL and ROPFG, with just reduced lines or generators respectively, are also implemented as additional benchmark models. Case studies show that the proposed ROPFLG consistently outperforms the benchmark full OPF (FOPF) and the other two ROPF methods, achieving significant computational time savings while reliably finding optimal solutions.</description>

      <title>Geometry of the Feasible Output Regions of Grid-Interfacing Inverters with Current Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many resources in the grid connect to power grids via programmable grid-interfacing inverters that can provide grid services and offer greater control flexibility and faster response times compared to synchronous generators. However, the current through the inverter needs to be limited to protect the semiconductor components. Existing controllers are designed using somewhat ad hoc methods, for example, by adding current limiters to preexisting control loops, which can lead to stability issues or overly conservative operations.
  In this paper, we study the geometry of the feasible output region of a current-limited inverter. We show that under a commonly used model, the feasible region is convex. We provide an explicit characterization of this region, which allows us to efficiently find the optimal operating points of the inverter. We demonstrate how knowing the feasible set and its convexity allows us to improve upon existing grid-forming inverters such that their steady-state currents always remain within the current magnitude limit, whereas standard grid-forming controllers can lead to instabilities and violations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0, we introduce a framework for synthesizing Abstraction-Based Controller Design (ABCD) for reach-avoid problems from Natural Language (NL) specifications using Large Language Models (LLMs). A Code Agent interprets an NL description of the control problem and translates it into a formal language interpretable by state-of-the-art symbolic control software, while a Checker Agent verifies the correctness of the generated code and enhances safety by identifying specification mismatches. Evaluations show that the system handles linguistic variability and improves robustness over direct planning with LLMs. The proposed approach lowers the barrier to formal control synthesis by enabling intuitive, NL-based task definition while maintaining safety guarantees through automated validation.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Verification with Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06136v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a data-driven approach to the quantitative verification of probabilistic programs and stochastic dynamical models. Our approach leverages neural networks to compute tight and sound bounds for the probability that a stochastic process hits a target condition within finite time. This problem subsumes a variety of quantitative verification questions, from the reachability and safety analysis of discrete-time stochastic dynamical models, to the study of assertion-violation and termination analysis of probabilistic programs. We rely on neural networks to represent supermartingale certificates that yield such probability bounds, which we compute using a counterexample-guided inductive synthesis loop: we train the neural certificate while tightening the probability bound over samples of the state space using stochastic optimisation, and then we formally check the certificate's validity over every possible state using satisfiability modulo theories; if we receive a counterexample, we add it to our set of samples and repeat the loop until validity is confirmed. We demonstrate on a diverse set of benchmarks that, thanks to the expressive power of neural networks, our method yields smaller or comparable probability bounds than existing symbolic methods in all cases, and that our approach succeeds on models that are entirely beyond the reach of such alternative techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive conditions for the identifiability of nonlinear networks characterized by additive dynamics at the level of the edges when all the nodes are excited. In contrast to linear systems, we show that the measurement of all sinks is necessary and sufficient for the identifiability of directed acyclic graphs, under the assumption that dynamics are described by analytic functions without constant terms (i.e., $f(0)=0$). But if constant terms are present, then the identifiability is impossible as soon as one node has more than one in-neighbor. In the case of general digraphs that may contain cycles, we consider additively separable functions for the analysis of the identifiability, and we show that the measurement of one node of all the sinks of the condensation digraph is necessary and sufficient. Several examples are added to illustrate the results.</description>

      <title>Approximate Thompson Sampling for Learning Linear Quadratic Regulators with $O(\sqrt{T})$ Regret</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel Thompson sampling algorithm that learns linear quadratic regulators (LQR) with a Bayesian regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T})$. Our method leverages Langevin dynamics with a carefully designed preconditioner and incorporates a simple excitation mechanism. We show that the excitation signal drives the minimum eigenvalue of the preconditioner to grow over time, thereby accelerating the approximate posterior sampling process. Furthermore, we establish nontrivial concentration properties of the approximate posteriors generated by our algorithm. These properties enable us to bound the moments of the system state and attain an $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound without relying on the restrictive assumptions that are often used in the literature.</description>

      <title>SCoTT: Strategic Chain-of-Thought Tasking for Wireless-Aware Robot Navigation in Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Path planning under wireless performance constraints is a complex challenge in robot navigation. However, naively incorporating such constraints into classical planning algorithms often incurs prohibitive search costs. In this paper, we propose SCoTT, a wireless-aware path planning framework that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to co-optimize average path gains and trajectory length using wireless heatmap images and ray-tracing data from a digital twin (DT). At the core of our framework is Strategic Chain-of-Thought Tasking (SCoTT), a novel prompting paradigm that decomposes the exhaustive search problem into structured subtasks, each solved via chain-of-thought prompting. To establish strong baselines, we compare classical A* and wireless-aware extensions of it, and derive DP-WA*, an optimal, iterative dynamic programming algorithm that incorporates all path gains and distance metrics from the DT, but at significant computational cost. In extensive experiments, we show that SCoTT achieves path gains within 2% of DP-WA* while consistently generating shorter trajectories. Moreover, SCoTT's intermediate outputs can be used to accelerate DP-WA* by reducing its search space, saving up to 62% in execution time. We validate our framework using four VLMs, demonstrating effectiveness across both large and small models, thus making it applicable to a wide range of compact models at low inference cost. We also show the practical viability of our approach by deploying SCoTT as a ROS node within Gazebo simulations. Finally, we discuss data acquisition pipelines, compute requirements, and deployment considerations for VLMs in 6G-enabled DTs, underscoring the potential of natural language interfaces for wireless-aware navigation in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Global Tensor Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19393v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Batch planning is increasingly necessary to quickly produce diverse and quality motion plans for downstream learning applications, such as distillation and imitation learning. This paper presents Global Tensor Motion Planning (GTMP) -- a sampling-based motion planning algorithm comprising only tensor operations. We introduce a novel discretization structure represented as a random multipartite graph, enabling efficient vectorized sampling, collision checking, and search. We provide a theoretical investigation showing that GTMP exhibits probabilistic completeness while supporting modern GPU/TPU. Additionally, by incorporating smooth structures into the multipartite graph, GTMP directly plans smooth splines without requiring gradient-based optimization. Experiments on lidar-scanned occupancy maps and the MotionBenchMarker dataset demonstrate GTMP's computation efficiency in batch planning compared to baselines, underscoring GTMP's potential as a robust, scalable planner for diverse applications and large-scale robot learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Neuro-Symbolic Decision Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a hierarchical neuro-symbolic control framework that tightly couples a classical symbolic planner with a transformer-based policy to address long-horizon decision-making under uncertainty. At the high level, the planner assembles an interpretable sequence of operators that guarantees logical coherence with task constraints, while at the low level each operator is rendered as a sub-goal token that conditions a decision transformer to generate fine-grained actions directly from raw observations. This bidirectional interface preserves the combinatorial efficiency and explainability of symbolic reasoning without sacrificing the adaptability of deep sequence models, and it permits a principled analysis that tracks how approximation errors from both planning and execution accumulate across the hierarchy. Empirical studies in stochastic grid-world domains demonstrate that the proposed method consistently surpasses purely symbolic, purely neural and existing hierarchical baselines in both success and efficiency, highlighting its robustness for sequential tasks.</description>

      <title>Identification and Optimal Nonlinear Control of Turbojet Engine Using Koopman Eigenfunction Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gas turbine engines represent complex highly nonlinear dynamical systems. Deriving their physics-based models can be challenging as it requires performance characteristics, that are not always available, and one often has to make many simplifying assumptions. In this paper, the limitations of conventional experimental methods used to derive component-level and locally linear parameter-varying models are discussed and addressed by employing identification techniques based on data collected from standard engine operation under closed-loop control. The rotor dynamics were estimated using the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics. Subsequently, the autonomous part of the dynamics was mapped into an optimally constructed Koopman eigenfunction space. The process included eigenvalue optimization using metaheuristic algorithms and temporal projection, followed by gradient-based eigenfunction identification. The resulting Koopman model was validated against an in-house reference component-level model. A globally optimal nonlinear feedback controller and a Kalman estimator were then designed in the eigenfunction space and compared to the classical and gain-scheduled proportional-integral controllers, as well as a proposed internal model control approach. The eigenmode structure allowed targeting individual modes during the optimization process, resulting in a better performance tuning. The results showed that the Koopman-based controller outperformed the other benchmark controllers in both reference tracking and disturbance rejection, under sea-level and varying flight conditions, due to its global nature.</description>

      <title>Performance Guaranteed Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning: A Sliding Mode Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Manipulation of local training data and local updates, i.e., the poisoning attack, is the main threat arising from the collaborative nature of the federated learning (FL) paradigm. Most existing poisoning attacks aim to manipulate local data/models in a way that causes denial-of-service (DoS) issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel attack method, named Federated Learning Sliding Attack (FedSA) scheme, aiming at precisely introducing the extent of poisoning in a subtle controlled manner. It operates with a predefined objective, such as reducing global model's prediction accuracy by 10%. FedSA integrates robust nonlinear control-Sliding Mode Control (SMC) theory with model poisoning attacks. It can manipulate the updates from malicious clients to drive the global model towards a compromised state, achieving this at a controlled and inconspicuous rate. Additionally, leveraging the robust control properties of FedSA allows precise control over the convergence bounds, enabling the attacker to set the global accuracy of the poisoned model to any desired level. Experimental results demonstrate that FedSA can accurately achieve a predefined global accuracy with fewer malicious clients while maintaining a high level of stealth and adjustable learning rates.</description>
