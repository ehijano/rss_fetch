      <title>Local Geometric and Transport Properties of Networks that are Generated from Hyperuniform Point Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperuniformity, which is a type of long-range order that is characterized by the suppression of long-range density fluctuations in comparison to the fluctuations in standard disordered systems, has emerged as a powerful concept to aid in the understanding of diverse natural and engineered phenomena. In the present paper, we harness hyperuniform point patterns to generate a class of disordered, spatially embedded networks that are distinct from both perfectly ordered lattices and uniformly random geometric graphs. We refer to these networks as \emph{hyperuniform-point-pattern-induced (HuPPI) networks}, and we compare them to their counterpart \emph{Poisson-point-pattern-induced (PoPPI) networks}. By computing the local geometric and transport properties of HuPPI networks, we demonstrate how hyperuniformity imparts advantages in both transport efficiency and robustness. Specifically, we show that HuPPI networks have systematically smaller total effective resistances, slightly faster random-walk mixing times, and fewer extreme-curvature edges than PoPPI networks. Counterintuitively, we also find that HuPPI networks simultaneously have more negative mean Ollivier--Ricci curvatures and smaller global resistances than PoPPI networks, indicating that edges with moderately negative curvatures need not create severe bottlenecks to transport. We also demonstrate that the network-generation method strongly influences these properties and in particular that it often overshadows differences that arise from underlying point patterns. These results collectively demonstrate potential advantages of hyperuniformity in network design and motivate further theoretical and experimental exploration of HuPPI networks.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Trust under Institutional Moral Hazard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of for-profit institutions that broadcast reputations to foster trust among market participants. We develop a theoretical model in which buyers and sellers are matched on a platform to engage in transactions involving a moral hazard: sellers can either faithfully deliver goods after receiving payment, or not. Although the buyer does not know a seller's true type, the platform maintains a reputation system that probabilistically assigns binary reputation signals. Buyers make purchase decisions based on reputation signals, which influence the payoffs to sellers who then adapt their type over time. These market dynamics ultimately shape the platform's profit from commissions on sales. Our analysis reveals that platforms inherently have an incentive for rating inflation, driven by the desire to increase commission. This introduces a second layer of moral hazard: the platform's incentive to distort reputations for its own profit. Such distortion is self-limited by the platform's need to maintain enough accuracy that trustworthy sellers remain in the market, without which rational buyers would refrain from purchases altogether. Nonetheless, the optimal strategy for the platform can be to invest in order to reduce signal accuracy. When the platform can freely set commission fees, however, maximum profit may be achieved by costly investment in an accurate reputation system. These findings highlight the intricate tensions between platform incentives and resulting social utility for marketplace participants.</description>

      <title>Kuramoto meets Koopman: Constants of motion, symmetries, and network motifs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06248v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partial integrability in phase-oscillator dynamics is typically examined for identically connected oscillators or groups thereof. Yet, the precise connectivity conditions that ensure conserved quantities on general networks remain unclear. Using Koopman theory, we rigorously derive conditions for the existence of distinct conserved quantities in the Kuramoto model with heterogeneous phase lags on any weighted, directed, and signed graph. In the process, we establish a criterion for Lie symmetries in general dynamical systems in terms of the Koopman generator, allowing us to identify symmetries that generate new conserved quantities. These results reveal a broad class of network motifs that support conserved quantities and we detect these motifs in hundreds of complex empirical networks. Our results provide a rigorous theoretical application of Koopman's framework to nonlinear dynamics on complex networks and reveal new possibilities for preserving phase relationships over time in complex systems through a careful design of their structure.</description>

      <title>Bayesian tit-for-tat fosters cooperation in evolutionary stochastic games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning from experience is a key feature of decision-making in cognitively complex organisms. Strategic interactions involving Bayesian inferential strategies can enable us to better understand how evolving individual choices to be altruistic or selfish can affect collective outcomes in social dilemmas. Bayesian strategies are distinguished, from their reactive opponents, in their ability to modulate their actions in the light of new evidence. We investigate whether such strategies can be resilient against reactive strategies when actions not only determine the immediate payoff but can affect future payoffs by changing the state of the environment. We use stochastic games to mimic the change in environment in a manner that is conditioned on the players' actions. By considering three distinct rules governing transitions between a resource-rich and a resource-poor states, we ascertain the conditions under which Bayesian tit-for-tat strategy can resist being invaded by reactive strategies. We find that the Bayesian strategy is resilient against a large class of reactive strategies and is more effective in fostering cooperation leading to sustenance of the resource-rich state. However, the extent of success of the Bayesian strategies depends on the other strategies in the pool and the rule governing transition between the two different resource states.</description>

      <title>Kinetic description of one-dimensional stochastic dynamics with small inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study single-variable approaches for describing stochastic dynamics with small inertia. The basic models we deal with describe passive Brownian particles and phase elements (phase oscillators, rotators, superconducting Josephson junctions) with an effective inertia in the case of a linear dissipation term and active Brownian particles in the case of a nonlinear dissipation. Elimination of a fast variable (velocity) reduces the characterization of the system state to a single variable and is formulated in four representations: moments, cumulants, the basis of Hermite functions, and the formal cumulant variant of the last. This elimination provides rigorous mathematical description for the overdamped limit in the case of linear dissipation and the overactive limit of active Brownian particles. For the former, we derive a low-dimensional equation system which generalizes the Ott-Antonsen Ansatz to systems with small effective inertia. In the latter case, we derive a Fokker-Planck-type equation with a forced drift term and an effective diffusion in one dimension, where the standard two-/three-dimensional mechanism is impossible. In the four considered representations, truncated equation chains are demonstrated to be utilitary for numerical simulation for a small finite inertia.</description>
