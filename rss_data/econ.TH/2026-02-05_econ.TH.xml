      <title>Dynamic Matching Under Patience Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a dynamic matching problem on a two-sided platform with unbalanced patience, in which long-lived supply accumulates over time with a unit waiting cost per period, while short-lived demand departs if not matched promptly. High- or low-quality agents arrive sequentially with one supply agent and one demand agent arriving in each period, and matching payoffs are supermodular. In the centralized benchmark, the optimal policy follows a threshold-based rule that rations high-quality supply, preserving it for future high-quality demand. In the decentralized system, where self-interested agents decide whether to match under an exogenously specified payoff allocation proportion, we characterize a welfare-maximizing Markov perfect equilibrium. Unlike outcomes in the centralized benchmark or in full-backlog markets, the equilibrium exhibits distinct matching patterns in which low-type demand may match with high-type supply even when low-type supply is available. Unlike settings in which both sides have long-lived agents and perfect coordination is impossible, the decentralized system can always be perfectly aligned with the centralized optimum by appropriately adjusting the allocation of matching payoffs across agents on both sides. Finally, when the arrival probabilities for H- and L-type arrivals are identical on both sides, we compare social welfare across systems with different patience levels: full backlog on both sides, one-sided backlog, and no backlog. In the centralized setting, social welfare is weakly ordered across systems. However, in the decentralized setting, the social welfare ranking across the three systems depends on the matching payoff allocation rule and the unit waiting cost, and enabling patience can either increase or decrease social welfare.</description>

      <title>Anchor-proofness in Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work contributes to a foundational question in economic theory: how do individual-level cognitive biases interact with collective choice mechanisms? We study a setting where voters hold intrinsic preference rankings over a set of alternatives but cast approval ballots to determine the collective outcome. The ballots are shaped by an anchoring bias: alternatives are presented sequentially by a social planner, and a voter approves an alternative if and only if it is acceptable and strictly preferred to all alternatives previously encountered. We first analyze which approval-based voting rules are anchor-proof, in the sense that they always select the same winner regardless of the presentation order. We show that this requirement is extremely demanding: only very restrictive rules satisfy it. We then turn to the potential influence of the social planner. On the upside, when the planner has no information about the voters' intrinsic preferences, she cannot manipulate the outcome.</description>

      <title>Choice via AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a model of choice via agentic artificial intelligence (AI). A key feature is that the AI may misinterpret a menu before recommending what to choose. A single acyclicity condition guarantees that there is a monotonic interpretation and a strict preference relation that together rationalize the AI's recommendations. Since this preference is in general not unique, there is no safeguard against it misaligning with that of a decision maker. What enables the verification of such AI alignment is interpretations satisfying double monotonicity. Indeed, double monotonicity ensures full identifiability and internal consistency. But, an additional idempotence property is required to guarantee that recommendations are fully rational and remain grounded within the original feasible set.</description>

      <title>Integrating Linear Regression and Multi-Criteria Decision Making for Assessing Financial Statement Risks in Manufacturing Firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating the financial performance of manufacturing firms requires consideration of both the time value of money and the relative importance of multiple decision criteria. Conventional approaches relying solely on deterministic discounting often fail to account for interactions among economic, operational, and managerial factors. This study proposes an integrated framework that combines time-discounted economic analysis with linear regression to evaluate control system efficiency. A theoretical discounting model is first developed to convert costs and benefits occurring at different times into present-value terms using compound interest functions. The model accommodates one-time expenditures, time-proportional costs, and complex cost structures arising during system development and commissioning. To empirically assess how discounted economic performance is influenced by multiple criteria, linear regression serves as the approximation method.</description>

      <title>Winning in the Limit: Average-Case Committee Selection with Many Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the committee selection problem in the canonical impartial culture model with a large number of voters and an even larger candidate set. Here, each voter independently reports a uniformly random preference order over the candidates. For a fixed committee size $k$, we ask when a committee can collectively beat every candidate outside the committee by a prescribed majority level $\alpha$. We focus on two natural notions of collective dominance, $\alpha$-winning and $\alpha$-dominating sets, and we identify sharp threshold phenomena for both of them using probabilistic methods, duality arguments, and rounding techniques.
  We first consider $\alpha$-winning sets. A set $S$ of $k$ candidates is $\alpha$-winning if, for every outside candidate $a \notin S$, at least an $\alpha$-fraction of voters rank some member of $S$ above $a$. We show a sharp threshold at \[ \alpha_{\mathrm{win}}^\star = 1 - \frac{1}{k}. \] Specifically, an $\alpha$-winning set of size $k$ exists with high probability when $\alpha &lt; \alpha_{\mathrm{win}}^\star$, and is unlikely to exist when $\alpha &gt; \alpha_{\mathrm{win}}^\star$.
  We then study the stronger notion of $\alpha$-dominating sets. A set $S$ of $k$ candidates is $\alpha$-dominating if, for every outside candidate $a \notin S$, there exists a single committee member $b \in S$ such that at least an $\alpha$-fraction of voters prefer $b$ to $a$. Here we establish an analogous sharp threshold at \[ \alpha_{\mathrm{dom}}^\star = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2k}. \] As a corollary, our analysis yields an impossibility result for $\alpha$-dominating sets: for every $k$ and every $\alpha &gt; \alpha_{\mathrm{dom}}^\star = 1 / 2 - 1 / (2k)$, there exist preference profiles that admit no $\alpha$-dominating set of size $k$. This corollary improves the best previously known bounds for all $k \geq 2$.</description>

      <title>A Dutch-Book Trap for Misspecification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.10121v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide Dutch-book arguments against misspecified Bayesian learning. An agent progressively learns about a state and is offered a bet after every discovery. We say the agent is deterministically Dutch-booked when they would accept all bets, but their payoff is ex-post negative under each state. More generally, we say that the agent is Dutch-booked when they would accept all bets, but their expected payoff under each fundamental state is negative. With this, the agent cannot be deterministically Dutch-booked if and only if they update their beliefs using Bayes' rule, even with misspecified likelihoods. The agent cannot be Dutch booked if and only if they update their beliefs using Bayes' rule with a lexicographic prior and using the correct data-generating process. We show that offers of financial instruments and behavior in Monty Hall problems can be viewed as Dutch books that extract a sure expected gain from a misspecified population.</description>

      <title>Axioms for Top Trading Cycles in Multi-Object Reallocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04822v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies multi-object reallocation without monetary transfers, where agents initially own multiple indivisible objects and have strict preferences over bundles (e.g., shift exchange among workers at a firm). Focusing on marginal rules that elicit only rankings over individual objects, we provide axiomatic characterizations of the generalized Top Trading Cycles rule (TTC) on the lexicographic and responsive domains. On the lexicographic domain, TTC is characterized by balancedness, individual-good efficiency, the worst-endowment lower bound, and either truncation-proofness or drop strategy-proofness. On the responsive domain, TTC is the unique marginal rule satisfying individual-good efficiency, truncation-proofness, and either the worst-endowment lower bound or individual rationality. In the Shapley--Scarf housing market, TTC is characterized by Pareto efficiency, individual rationality, and truncation-proofness. Finally, on the conditionally lexicographic domain, the augmented Top Trading Cycles rule is characterized by balancedness, Pareto efficiency, the worst-endowment lower bound, and drop strategy-proofness. The conditionally lexicographic domain is a maximal domain on which Pareto efficiency coincides with individual-good efficiency.</description>

      <title>No Screening is More Efficient with Multiple Objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study efficient mechanism design for allocating multiple heterogeneous objects. The aim is to maximize the residual surplus, the total value generated from an allocation minus the costs of screening. We discover a robust trend indicating that no-screening mechanisms, such as serial dictatorship with exogenous priority order, tend to perform better as the variety of goods increases. We analyze the underlying reasons by characterizing asymptotically efficient mechanisms in a stylized environment. We also apply an automated mechanism design approach to numerically derive efficient mechanisms and validate the trend in general environments. Building on these implications, we propose the register-invite-book system (RIB) as an efficient system for scheduling vaccinations against pandemic diseases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study multidimensional cheap talk with simple language and aligned preferences. An expert communicates with a decision-maker using a score that aggregates a multidimensional state into a one-dimensional message. Even though the expert and the decision-maker share the same payoffs, the use of simple language introduces strategic frictions. As a result, equilibrium payoffs may be lower than those achievable under commitment to a score. Additionally, under quadratic-loss utility, any equilibrium score must be linear in the state or discrete. Finally, for normally distributed states, we characterize the set of equilibrium linear scores and show that it consists of the ex-ante best and worst linear scores.</description>

      <title>Coordinate-free utility theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard decision theory seeks conditions under which a preference relation can be compressed into a single real-valued function. However, when preferences are incomplete or intransitive, a single function fails to capture the agent's evaluative structure. Recent literature on multi-utility representations suggests that such preferences are better represented by families of functions. This paper provides a canonical and intrinsic geometric characterization of this family. We construct the \textit{ledger group} $U(P)$, a partially ordered group that faithfully encodes the native structure of the agent's preferences in terms of trade-offs. We show that the set of all admissible utility functions is precisely the \textit{dual cone} $U^*$ of this structure. This perspective shifts the focus of utility theory from the existence of a specific map to the geometry of the measurement space itself. We demonstrate the power of this framework by explicitly reconstructing the standard multi-attribute utility representation as the intersection of the abstract dual cone with a subspace of continuous functionals, and showing the impossibility of this for a set of lexicographic preferences.</description>

      <title>Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases -- OPTiMEM and the Heat Conjecture(s)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite well-meaning scenarios that propose global CO2 emissions will decline presented in every IPCC report since 1988, the trend of global CO2 increase continues without significant change. Even if any individual nation manages to flatten its emissions, what matters is the trajectory of the globe. Together the gulf between climate science and climate economics, plus the urgent need for alternative methods of estimation, provided the incentives for development of our Ocean-Heat-Content (OHC) Physics and Time Macro Economic Model (OPTiMEM) system.
  To link NOAA damages to climate required creating a carbon consumption model to drive a physics model of climate. How fast could carbon be burned and how much coal, oil and natural gas was reasonably available? A carbon model driving climate meant burning the carbon, and modelling how the earth heated up. We developed this using the most recent best greenhouse gas equations and production models for CO2, CH4, N2O, and halogenated gases. This developed an ocean heat content model for the globe. Each step is validated against Known carbon consumption, CO2, temperature, and ocean heat content. This allows a physics founded model of climate costs to be projected.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Mechanism Design without Monetary Transfers: A Queueing Theory Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the design of optimal allocation mechanisms in an environment where agents and goods arrive stochastically. Agents have private types that determine the principal payoff. Either agents or goods can be held in a queue at a flow cost until allocation. The principal cannot use monetary transfers, but can verify agents types at a cost. We characterize the optimal mechanism at the steady state of the system. It is a dynamic threshold mechanism in which the principal sets type thresholds for agent admission and goods allocation. These thresholds depend on the current state of the mechanism. The model applies to public programs such as public housing and grant allocation, and to allocation problems within organizations such as capital budgeting.</description>
