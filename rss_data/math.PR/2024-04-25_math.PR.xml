      <title>Critical Multitype Branching Processes with Random Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to introduce a multitype branching process with random migration following the research initiated with the Galton-Watson process with migration introduced in [Yanev &amp; Mitov (1980) C. R. Acad. Bulg. Sci. 33(4):473-475]. We focus our attention in what we call the critical case. Sufficient conditions are provided for the process to have unlimited growth or not. Furthermore, using suitable normalizing sequences, we study the asymptotic distribution of the process. Finally, we obtain a Feller-type diffusion approximation.</description>

      <title>Convergence of stochastic integrals with applications to transport equations and conservation laws with noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convergence of stochastic integrals driven by Wiener processes $W_n$, with $W_n \to W$ almost surely in $C_t$, is crucial in analyzing SPDEs. Our focus is on the convergence of the form $\int_0^T V_n\, \mathrm{d} W_n \to \int_0^T V\, \mathrm{d} W$, where $\{V_n\}$ is bounded in $L^p(\Omega \times [0,T];X)$ for a Banach space $X$ and some finite $p &gt; 2$. This is challenging when $V_n$ converges to $V$ weakly in the temporal variable. We supply convergence results to handle stochastic integral limits when strong temporal convergence is lacking. A key tool is a uniform mean $L^1$ time translation estimate on $V_n$, an estimate that is easily verified in many SPDEs. However, this estimate alone does not guarantee strong compactness of $(\omega,t)\mapsto V_n(\omega,t)$. Our findings, especially pertinent to equations exhibiting singular behavior, are substantiated by establishing several stability results for stochastic transport equations and conservation laws.</description>

      <title>Concentration estimates for SPDEs driven by fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of this work is to provide sample-path estimates for the solution of slowly time-dependent SPDEs perturbed by a cylindrical fractional Brownian motion. Our strategy is similar to the approach by Berglund and Nader for space-time white noise. However, the setting of fractional Brownian motion does not allow us to use any martingale methods. Using instead optimal estimates for the probability that the supremum of a Gaussian process exceeds a certain level, we derive concentration estimates for the solution of the SPDE, provided that the Hurst index $H$ of the fractional Brownian motion satisfies $H&gt;\frac14$. As a by-product, we also obtain concentration estimates for one-dimensional fractional SDEs valid for any $H\in(0,1)$.</description>

      <title>On first passage time problems of Brownian motion -- The inverse method of images revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $W$ be a standard Brownian motion with $W_0 = 0$ and let $b\colon[0,\infty) \to \mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function with $b(0) &gt; 0$. In this article, we look at the classical First Passage Time (FPT) problem, i.e., the question of determining the distribution of $\tau := \inf \{ t\in [0,\infty)\colon W_t \geq b(t) \}.$ More specifically, we revisit the method of images, which we feel has received less attention than it deserves. The main observation of this approach is that the FPT problem is fully solved if a measure $\mu$ exists such that \begin{align*} \int_{(0,\infty)} \exp\left(-\frac{\theta^2}{2t}+\frac{\theta b(t)}{t}\right)\mu(d\theta)=1, \qquad t\in(0,\infty). \end{align*} The goal of this article is to lay the foundation for answering the still open question of the existence and characterisation of such a measure $\mu$ for a given curve $b$. We present a new duality approach that allows us to give sufficient conditions for the existence. Moreover, we introduce a very efficient algorithm for approximating the representing measure $\mu$ and provide a rigorous theoretical foundation.</description>

      <title>Gaussian free field and Liouville quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over fourty years ago, the physicist Polyakov proposed a bold framework for string theory, in which the problem was reduced to the study of certain "random surfaces". He further made the tantalising suggestion that this theory could be explicitly solved. Recent breakthroughs from the last fifteen years have not only given a concrete mathematical basis for this theory but also verified some of its most striking predictions, as well as Polyakov's original vision. This theory, now known in the mathematics literature either as Liouville quantum gravity or Liouville conformal field theory, is based on a remarkable combination of ideas coming from different fields, above all probability and geometry. This book is intended to be an introduction to these developments assuming as few prerequisites as possible.</description>

      <title>Martin boundary of a space-time Brownian motion with drift killed at the boundary of a moving cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a space-time Brownian motion with drift B(t)=(t_0+t,y_0+W(t)+t) killed at the moving boundary of the cone {(t,x):0&lt;x&lt;t}. This article determines the parabolic Martin boundary and all harmonic functions associated with this process. To that end, the asymptotics of Green's functions are determined along all directions. We also find the exit probabilities at the edges, the probability of remaining in the cone forever and the laws of the exit point and exit time. From this, we derive an explicit formula for the transition kernel of the process. These results arise from two different methods initially introduced to study random walks. An analytical approach, developed in the 1970s by Malyshev and based on the steepest descent method on a Riemann surface, is used to determine the asymptotics of the Green's functions. A recursive compensation approach, inspired by the method developed in the 1990s by Adan, Wessels and Zijm, is used to determine the harmonic functions.</description>

      <title>Concentration inequalities for Poisson $U$-statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we obtain concentration inequalities for Poisson $U$-statistics $F_m(f,\eta)$ of order $m\ge 1$ with kernels $f$ under general assumptions on $f$ and the intensity measure $\gamma \Lambda$ of underlying Poisson point process $\eta$. The main result are new concentration bounds of the form \[
  \mathbb{P}(|F_m ( f , \eta) -\mathbb{E} F_m ( f , \eta)| \ge t)\leq 2\exp(-I(\gamma,t)), \]
  where $I(\gamma,t)$ satisfies $I(\gamma,t)=\Theta(t^{1\over m}\log t)$ as $t\to\infty$ and $\gamma$ is fixed. The function $I(\gamma,t)$ is given explicitly in terms of parameters of the assumptions satisfied by $f$ and $\Lambda$. One of the key ingredients of the proof are fine bounds for the centred moments of $F_m(f,\eta)$. We discuss the optimality of obtained bounds and consider a number of applications related to Gilbert graphs and Poisson hyperplane processes in constant curvature spaces.</description>

Abstract: We discuss a complementary asymptotic analysis of the so called minimal random walk. More precisely, we present a version of the almost sure central limit theorem as well as a generalization of the recently proposed quadratic strong laws. In addition, alternative demonstrations of the functional limit theorems will be supplied based on a P\'olya urn scheme instead of a martingale approach.</description>

      <title>The Directed Landscape is a Black Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the directed landscape is a black noise in the sense of Tsirelson and Vershik. As a corollary, we show that for any microscopic system in which the height profile converges in law to the directed landscape, the driving noise is asymptotically independent of the height profile. This decoupling result provides one answer to the question of what happens to the driving noise in the limit under the KPZ scaling, and illustrates a type of noise sensitivity for systems in the KPZ universality class. Such decoupling and sensitivity phenomena are not present in the intermediate-disorder or weak-asymmetry regime, thus illustrating a contrast from the weak KPZ scaling regime. Along the way, we prove a strong mixing property for the directed landscape on a bounded time interval under spatial shifts, with a mixing rate $\alpha(N)\leq Ce^{-dN^3}$ for some $C,d&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Anomalous random flights and time-fractional run-and-tumble equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random flights (also called run-and-tumble walks or transport processes) represent finite velocity random motions changing direction at any Poissonian time. These models in d-dimension, can be studied giving a general formulation of the problem valid at any spatial dimension. The aim of this paper is to extend this general analysis to time-fractional processes arising from a non-local generalization of the kinetic equations. The probabilistic interpretation of the solution of the time-fractional equations leads to a time-changed version of the original transport processes. The obtained results provides a clear picture of the role played by the time-fractional derivatives in this kind of random motions. They displayed an anomalous behavior and are useful to describe several complex systems arising in statistical physics and biology. In particular, we focus on the one-dimensional random flight, called telegraph process, studying the time-fractional version of the classical telegraph equation and providing a suitable interpretation of its stochastic solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider periodic homogenisation problems for gPAM, $\Phi^{4}_{3}$ and modified KPZ equations. Using Littlewood-Paley blocks, we establish para-products and commutator estimates for generalised Besov spaces associated with self-adjoint elliptic operators. With this, we show that, the homogenisation and renormalisation procedures commute in aforementioned models under suitable assumptions.</description>

      <title>Numerical integrators for confined Langevin dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive and analyze numerical methods for weak approximation of underdamped (kinetic) Langevin dynamics in bounded domains. First-order methods are based on an Euler-type scheme interlaced with collisions with the boundary. To achieve second order, composition schemes are derived based on decomposition of the generator into collisional drift, impulse, and stochastic momentum evolution. In a deterministic setting, this approach would typically lead to first-order approximation, even in symmetric compositions, but we find that the stochastic method can provide second-order weak approximation with a single gradient evaluation, both at finite times and in the ergodic limit. We provide theoretical and numerical justification for this observation using model problems and compare and contrast the numerical performance of different choices of the ordering of the terms in the splitting scheme.</description>

      <title>Markov generators as non-hermitian supersymmetric quantum Hamiltonians: spectral properties via bi-orthogonal basis and Singular Value Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuity equations associated to continuous-time Markov processes can be considered as Euclidean Schr\"odinger equations, where the non-hermitian quantum Hamiltonian $\bold{H}={\bold{div}}{\bold J}$ is naturally factorized into the product of the divergence operator ${\bold {div}}$ and the current operator ${\bold J}$. For non-equilibrium Markov jump processes in a space of $N$ configurations with $M$ links and $C=M-(N-1)\geq 1$ independent cycles, this factorization of the $N \times N$ Hamiltonian ${\bold H}={\bold I}^{\dagger}{\bold J}$ involves the incidence matrix ${\bold I}$ and the current matrix ${\bold J}$ of size $M \times N$, so that the supersymmetric partner ${\hat{\bold H}}= {\bold J}{\bold I}^{\dagger}$ governing the dynamics of the currents living on the $M$ links is of size $M \times M$. To better understand the relations between the spectral decompositions of these two Hamiltonians $\bold{H}={\bold I}^{\dagger}{\bold J}$ and ${\hat {\bold H}} ={\bold J}{\bold I}^{\dagger}$ with respect to their bi-orthogonal basis of right and left eigenvectors that characterize the relaxation dynamics towards the steady state and the steady currents, it is useful to analyze the properties of the Singular Value Decompositions of the two rectangular matrices ${\bold I}$ and ${\bold J} $ of size $M \times N$ and the interpretations in terms of discrete Helmholtz decompositions. This general framework concerning Markov jump processes can be adapted to non-equilibrium diffusion processes governed by Fokker-Planck equations in dimension $d$, where the number $N$ of configurations, the number $M$ of links and the number $C=M-(N-1)$ of independent cycles become infinite, while the two matrices ${\bold I}$ and ${\bold J}$ become first-order differential operators acting on scalar functions to produce vector fields.</description>

      <title>Stability and chaos in dynamical last passage percolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.05837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many complex statistical mechanical models have intricate energy landscapes. The ground state, or lowest energy state, lies at the base of the deepest valley. In examples such as spin glasses and Gaussian polymers, there are many valleys; the abundance of near-ground states (at the base of valleys) indicates the phenomenon of chaos, under which the ground state alters profoundly when the model's disorder is slightly perturbed. In this article, we compute the critical exponent that governs the onset of chaos in a dynamic manifestation of a canonical model in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang [KPZ] universality class, Brownian last passage percolation [LPP]. In this model in its static form, semi-discrete polymers advance through Brownian noise, their energy given by the integral of the white noise encountered along their journey. A ground state is a geodesic, of extremal energy given its endpoints. We perturb Brownian LPP by evolving the disorder under an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck flow. We prove that, for polymers of length $n$, a sharp phase transition marking the onset of chaos is witnessed at the critical time $n^{-1/3}$. Indeed, the overlap between the geodesics at times zero and $t &gt; 0$ that travel a given distance of order $n$ will be shown to be of order $n$ when $t\ll n^{-1/3}$; and to be of smaller order when $t\gg n^{-1/3}$. We expect this exponent to be shared among many interface models. The present work thus sheds light on the dynamical aspect of the KPZ class; it builds on several recent advances. These include Chatterjee's harmonic analytic theory [Cha14] of equivalence of superconcentration and chaos in Gaussian spaces; a refined understanding of the static landscape geometry of Brownian LPP developed in the companion paper [GH20]; and, underlying the latter, strong comparison estimates of the geodesic energy profile to Brownian motion in [CHH19].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.04162v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sticky diffusion processes spend finite time (and finite mean time) on a lower-dimensional boundary. Once the process hits the boundary, then it starts again after a random amount of time. While on the boundary it can stay or move according to dynamics that are different from those in the interior. Such processes may be characterized by a time-derivative appearing in the boundary condition for the governing problem. We use time changes obtained by right-inverses of suitable processes in order to describe fractional sticky conditions and the associated boundary behaviours. We obtain that fractional boundary value problems (involving fractional dynamic boundary conditions) lead to sticky diffusions spending an infinite mean time (and finite time) on a lower-dimensional boundary. Such a behaviour can be associated with a trap effect in the macroscopic point of view.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of Balancing Allocations and Factor Point Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we show that every stationary random measure on $\mathbb R^d$ that is essentially free (i.e., has no symmetries a.s.) admits a point process as a factor (i.e., as a measurable and translation-equivariant function of the measure). As a result, we improve the results of Last and Thorisson (2022) on the existence of a factor balancing allocation between ergodic pairs of stationary random measures $\Phi$ and $\Psi$ with equal intensities. In particular, we prove that such an allocation exists if $\Phi$ is diffuse and either $(\Phi,\Psi)$ is essentially free or $\Phi$ assigns zero measure to every $(d-1)$-dimensional affine hyperplane. The main result is deduced from an existing result in descriptive set theory, that is, the existence of lacunary sections. We also weaken the assumption of being essentially free to the case where a discrete group of symmetries is allowed.</description>

      <title>Latent mutations in the ancestries of alleles under selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a single genetic locus with two alleles $A_1$ and $A_2$ in a large haploid population. The locus is subject to selection and two-way, or recurrent, mutation. Assuming the allele frequencies follow a Wright-Fisher diffusion and have reached stationarity, we describe the asymptotic behaviors of the conditional gene genealogy and the latent mutations of a sample with known allele counts, when the count $n_1$ of allele $A_1$ is fixed, and when either or both the sample size $n$ and the selection strength $\lvert\alpha\rvert$ tend to infinity. Our study extends previous work under neutrality to the case of non-neutral rare alleles, asserting that when selection is not too strong relative to the sample size, even if it is strongly positive or strongly negative in the usual sense ($\alpha\to -\infty$ or $\alpha\to +\infty$), the number of latent mutations of the $n_1$ copies of allele $A_1$ follows the same distribution as the number of alleles in the Ewens sampling formula. On the other hand, very strong positive selection relative to the sample size leads to neutral gene genealogies with a single ancient latent mutation. We also demonstrate robustness of our asymptotic results against changing population sizes, when one of $\lvert\alpha\rvert$ or $n$ is large.</description>

      <title>Divisibility and primality in random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the divisibility and primality properties of the Bernoulli random walk. We improve or extend some of our divisibility results to wide classes of iid or independent non iid random walks. We also obtain new primality results for the Rademacher random walk. We study the value distribution of divisors of the random walk in the Cram\'er model, and obtain a general estimate of a similar kind to that of the Bernouilli model. Earlier results on divisors and quasi-prime numbers in the Bernoulli model are recorded, as well as some other recent for the Cram\'er random model, based on an estimate due to Selberg.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17543v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce simple conditions ensuring that invariant distributions of a Feller Markov chain on a compact Riemannian manifold are absolutely continuous with a lower semi-continuous, continuous or smooth density with respect to the Riemannian measure. This is applied to Markov chains obtained by random composition of maps and to piecewise deterministic Markov processes obtained by random switching between flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a probabilistic formulation for the isometric embedding of a Riemannian manifold $(M^n,g)$ into Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^q$. Given $\alpha \in ]\tfrac{1}{2},1]$, we show that a $C^{1,\alpha}$ embedding $u: M \to \mathbb{R}^q$ is isometric if and only if the intrinsic and extrinsic constructions of Brownian motion on $u(M)\subset \mathbb{R}^q$ yield processes with the same law. The equivalence is first established for smooth embeddings; this is followed by a renormalization procedure for $C^{1,\alpha}$ embeddings. In particular, we also construct extrinsic Brownian motion when $g \in C^2$ and $u$ is a $C^{1,\alpha}$ isometric embedding.
  This formulation is based on a gedanken experiment that relates the intrinsic and extrinsic constructions of Brownian motion on an embedded manifold to the measurement of geodesic distance by observers in distinct frames of reference. This viewpoint provides a thermodynamic formalism for the isometric embedding problem that is suited to applications in geometric deep learning, stochastic optimization and turbulence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07811v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study delves into the exploration of the limiting shape theorem for subadditive processes on finitely generated groups with polynomial growth, commonly referred to as virtually nilpotent groups. Investigating the algebraic structures underlying these processes, we present a generalized form of the asymptotic shape theorem within this framework. Extending subadditive ergodic theory in this context, we consider processes which exhibit both at most and at least linear random growth. We conclude with applications and illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Road layout in the KPZ class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a road layout and traffic model, based on last passage percolation (LPP). An easy naive argument shows that coalescence of traffic trajectories is essential to be considered when observing traffic networks around us. This is a fundamental feature in first passage percolation (FPP) models where nearby geodesics naturally coalesce in search of the easiest passage through the landscape. Road designers seek the same in pursuing cost savings, hence FPP geodesics are straightforward candidates to model road layouts. Unfortunately no detailed knowledge is rigorously available on FPP geodesics. To address this, we use exponential LPP instead to build a stochastic model of road traffic and prove certain characteristics thereof. Cars start from every point of the lattice and follow half-infinite geodesics in random directions. Exponential LPP is known to be in the KPZ universality class and it is widely expected that FPP shares very similar properties, hence our findings should equally apply to FPP-based modelling. We address several traffic-related quantities of this model and compare our theorems to real life road networks.</description>

      <title>Absolute moments of the variance-gamma distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain exact formulas for the absolute raw and central moments of the variance-gamma distribution, as infinite series involving the modified Bessel function of the second kind and the modified Lommel function of the first kind. When the skewness parameter is equal to zero (the symmetric variance-gamma distribution), the infinite series reduces to a single term. Moreover, for the case that the shape parameter is a half-integer (in our parameterisation of the variance-gamma distribution), we obtain a closed-form expression for the absolute moments in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions. As a consequence, we deduce new exact formulas for the absolute raw and central moments of the asymmetric Laplace distribution and the product of two correlated zero mean normal random variables, and more generally the sum of independent copies of such random variables.</description>

      <title>Convolution Bounds on Quantile Aggregation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.09320v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantile aggregation with dependence uncertainty has a long history in probability theory with wide applications in finance, risk management, statistics, and operations research. Using a recent result on inf-convolution of quantile-based risk measures, we establish new analytical bounds for quantile aggregation which we call convolution bounds. Convolution bounds both unify every analytical result available in quantile aggregation and enlighten our understanding of these methods. These bounds are the best available in general. Moreover, convolution bounds are easy to compute, and we show that they are sharp in many relevant cases. They also allow for interpretability on the extremal dependence structure. The results directly lead to bounds on the distribution of the sum of random variables with arbitrary dependence. We discuss relevant applications in risk management and economics.</description>

      <title>Partial recovery and weak consistency in the non-uniform hypergraph Stochastic Block Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.11671v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the community detection problem in sparse random hypergraphs under the non-uniform hypergraph stochastic block model (HSBM), a general model of random networks with community structure and higher-order interactions. When the random hypergraph has bounded expected degrees, we provide a spectral algorithm that outputs a partition with at least a $\gamma$ fraction of the vertices classified correctly, where $\gamma\in (0.5,1)$ depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the model. When the SNR grows slowly as the number of vertices goes to infinity, our algorithm achieves weak consistency, which improves the previous results in Ghoshdastidar and Dukkipati (2017) for non-uniform HSBMs.
  Our spectral algorithm consists of three major steps: (1) Hyperedge selection: select hyperedges of certain sizes to provide the maximal signal-to-noise ratio for the induced sub-hypergraph; (2) Spectral partition: construct a regularized adjacency matrix and obtain an approximate partition based on singular vectors; (3) Correction and merging: incorporate the hyperedge information from adjacency tensors to upgrade the error rate guarantee. The theoretical analysis of our algorithm relies on the concentration and regularization of the adjacency matrix for sparse non-uniform random hypergraphs, which can be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Active Learning for Non-Parametric Choice Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of actively learning a non-parametric choice model based on consumers' decisions. We present a negative result showing that such choice models may not be identifiable. To overcome the identifiability problem, we introduce a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representation of the choice model. This representation provably encodes all the information about the choice model which can be inferred from the available data, in the sense that it permits computing all choice probabilities.
  We establish that given exact choice probabilities for a collection of item sets, one can reconstruct the DAG. However, attempting to extend this methodology to estimate the DAG from noisy choice frequency data obtained during an active learning process leads to inaccuracies. To address this challenge, we present an inclusion-exclusion approach that effectively manages error propagation across DAG levels, leading to a more accurate estimate of the DAG. Utilizing this technique, our algorithm estimates the DAG representation of an underlying non-parametric choice model. The algorithm operates efficiently (in polynomial time) when the set of frequent rankings is drawn uniformly at random. It learns the distribution over the most popular items among frequent preference types by actively and repeatedly offering assortments of items and observing the chosen item. We demonstrate that our algorithm more effectively recovers a set of frequent preferences on both synthetic and publicly available datasets on consumers' preferences, compared to corresponding non-active learning estimation algorithms. These findings underscore the value of our algorithm and the broader applicability of active-learning approaches in modeling consumer behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that in the overparametrized regime, deep neural network provide universal approximations and can interpolate any data set, as long as the activation function is locally in $L^1(\RR)$ and not an affine function.
  Additionally, if the activation function is smooth and such an interpolation networks exists, then the set of parameters which interpolate forms a manifold. Furthermore, we give a characterization of the Hessian of the loss function evaluated at the interpolation points.
  In the last section, we provide a practical probabilistic method of finding such a point under general conditions on the activation function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A collection of identical and independent rare event first passage times is considered. The problem of finding the fastest out of $N$ such events to occur is called an extreme first passage time. The rare event times are singular and limit to infinity as a positive parameter scaling the noise magnitude is reduced to zero. In contrast, previous work has shown that the mean of the fastest event time goes to zero in the limit of an infinite number of walkers. The combined limit is studied. In particular, the mean time and the most likely path taken by the fastest random walker are investigated. Using techniques from large deviation theory, it is shown that there is a distinguished limit where the mean time for the fastest walker can take any positive value, depending on a single proportionality constant. Furthermore, it is shown that the mean time and most likely path can be approximated using the solution to a variational problem related to the single-walker rare event.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional analysis of ridge regression for non-identically distributed data with a variance profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional linear regression has been thoroughly studied in the context of independent and identically distributed data. We propose to investigate high-dimensional regression models for independent but non-identically distributed data. To this end, we suppose that the set of observed predictors (or features) is a random matrix with a variance profile and with dimensions growing at a proportional rate. Assuming a random effect model, we study the predictive risk of the ridge estimator for linear regression with such a variance profile. In this setting, we provide deterministic equivalents of this risk and of the degree of freedom of the ridge estimator. For certain class of variance profile, our work highlights the emergence of the well-known double descent phenomenon in high-dimensional regression for the minimum norm least-squares estimator when the ridge regularization parameter goes to zero. We also exhibit variance profiles for which the shape of this predictive risk differs from double descent. The proofs of our results are based on tools from random matrix theory in the presence of a variance profile that have not been considered so far to study regression models. Numerical experiments are provided to show the accuracy of the aforementioned deterministic equivalents on the computation of the predictive risk of ridge regression. We also investigate the similarities and differences that exist with the standard setting of independent and identically distributed data.</description>
