      <title>Intersection Multiplicity in Loop Spaces and the String Topology Coproduct</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The string topology coproduct is often perceived as a counterpart in string topology to the Chas-Sullivan product. However, in certain aspects the string topology coproduct is much harder to understand than the Chas-Sullivan product. In particular the coproduct is not homotopy-invariant and it seems much harder to compute. In this article we give an overview over the string topology coproduct and use the notion of intersection multiplicity of homology classes in loop spaces to show that the string topology coproduct and the based string topology coproduct are trivial for certain classes of manifolds. In particular we show that the string topology coproduct vanishes on product manifolds where both factors have vanishing Euler characteristic and we show that the based coproduct is trivial for total spaces of fiber bundles with sections. We also discuss implications of these results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the homotopy theory of diagrams of chain complexes over a field indexed by a finite poset, and show that it can be completely described in terms of appropriate diagrams of graded vector spaces.</description>

      <title>Foundation of Floer homotopy theory I: Flow categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a stable infinity category with objects flow categories and morphisms flow bimodules; our construction has many flavors, related to a choice of bordism theory, and we discuss in particular framed bordism and the bordism theory of complex oriented derived orbifolds. In this setup, the construction of homotopy types associated to Floer-theoretic data is immediate: the moduli spaces of solutions to Floer's equation assemble into a flow category with respect to the appropriate bordism theory, and the associated Floer homotopy types arise as suitable mapping spectra in this category. The definition of these mapping spectra is sufficiently explicit to allow a direct interpretation of the Floer homotopy groups as Floer bordism groups. In the setting of framed bordism, we show that the category we construct is a model for the category of spectra. We implement the construction of Floer homotopy types in this new formalism for the case of Hamiltonian Floer theory.</description>

      <title>Abstract Excision and $\ell^1$-Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.06120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the abstract setting of excisive functors in the language of $\infty$-categories to show that the best approximation to the $\ell^1$-homology functor by an excisive functor is trivial.
  Then we make an effort to explain the used language on a conceptual level for those who do not feel at home with $\infty$-categories, prove that the singular chain complex functor is indeed excisive in the abstract sense, and show how the latter leads to classical excision statements in the form of Mayer-Vietoris sequences.</description>

      <title>Computing Generalized Ranks of Persistence Modules via Unfolding to Zigzag Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a $P$-indexed persistence module ${\sf M}$, the (generalized) rank of ${\sf M}$ is defined as the rank of the limit-to-colimit map for the diagram of vector spaces of ${\sf M}$ over the poset $P$. For $2$-parameter persistence modules, recently a zigzag persistence based algorithm has been proposed that takes advantage of the fact that generalized rank for $2$-parameter modules is equal to the number of full intervals in a zigzag module defined on the boundary of the poset. Analogous definition of boundary for $d$-parameter persistence modules or general $P$-indexed persistence modules does not seem plausible. To overcome this difficulty, we first unfold a given $P$-indexed module ${\sf M}$ into a zigzag module ${\sf M}_{ZZ}$ and then check how many full interval modules in a decomposition of ${\sf M}_{ZZ}$ can be folded back to remain full in a decomposition of ${\sf M}$. This number determines the generalized rank of ${\sf M}$. For special cases of degree-$d$ homology for $d$-complexes, we obtain a more efficient algorithm including a linear time algorithm for degree-$1$ homology in graphs.</description>

      <title>Loop homology of moment-angle complexes in the flag case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general homological approach to presentations of connected graded associative algebras, and apply it to loop homology of moment-angle complexes $Z_K$ that correspond to flag simplicial complexes $K$. For arbitrary coefficient ring, we describe generators of the Pontryagin algebra $H_*(\Omega Z_K)$ and defining relations between them. We prove that such moment-angle complexes are coformal over $\mathbb{Q},$ give a necessary condition for rational formality, and compute their homotopy groups in terms of homotopy groups of spheres.</description>

      <title>The complex genera, symmetric functions and multiple zeta values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.01192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the coefficients in front of Chern numbers for complex genera, and pay special attention to the $\text{Td}^{\frac{1}{2}}$-genus, the $\Gamma$-genus as well as the Todd genus. Some related geometric applications to hyper-K\"{a}hler and Calabi-Yau manifolds are discussed. Along this line and building on the work of Doubilet in 1970s, various Hoffman-type formulas for multiple-(star) zeta values and transition matrices among canonical bases of the ring of symmetric functions can be uniformly treated in a more general framework.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolicity and bounded-valued cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15575v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalise a theorem of Gersten on surjectivity of the restriction map in $\ell^{\infty}$-cohomology of groups. This leads to applications on subgroups of hyperbolic groups, quasi-isometric distinction of finitely generated groups and $\ell^{\infty}$-cohomology calculations for some well-known classes of groups. Along the way, we obtain hyperbolicity criteria for groups of type $FP_2(\mathbb Q)$ and for those satisfying a rational homological linear isoperimetric inequality, answering a question of Arora and Mart\'{i}nez-Pedroza.</description>

      <title>Mapping fiber, loop and suspension graphs in naive discrete homotopy theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete homotopy theory or A-homotopy theory is a combinatorial homotopy theory defined on graphs, simplicial complexes and metric spaces, reflecting information about their connectivity. The purpose of the present paper is to further understanding of the similarities between the A-homotopy and ordinary homotopy theories. More precisely, we define the notion of a mapping fiber in the category of graphs and study its basic properties, providing non-compatibility with projection.</description>
