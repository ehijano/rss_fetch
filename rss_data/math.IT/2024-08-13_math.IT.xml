      <title>Interactive Coding with Small Memory and Improved Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study two-party interactive coding for adversarial noise, when both parties have limited memory. We show how to convert any adaptive protocol $\Pi$ into a protocol $\Pi'$ that is robust to an $\epsilon$-fraction of adversarial corruptions, not too much longer than $\Pi$, and which uses small space. More precisely, if $\Pi$ requires space $\log(s)$ and has $|\Pi|$ rounds of communication, then $\Pi'$ requires $O_\epsilon(\log s \log |\Pi|)$ memory, and has $$|\Pi'| = |\Pi|\cdot\left( 1 + O\left( \sqrt{ \epsilon \log \log 1/\epsilon } \right)\right)$$ rounds of communication. The above matches the best known communication rate, even for protocols with no space restrictions.</description>

      <title>An Information Geometry Interpretation for Approximate Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an information geometry (IG) framework to solve the standard linear regression problem. The proposed framework is an extension of the one for computing the mean of complex multivariate Gaussian distribution. By applying the proposed framework, the information geometry approach (IGA) and the approximate information geometry approach (AIGA) for basis pursuit de-noising (BPDN) in standard linear regression are derived. The framework can also be applied to other standard linear regression problems. With the transformations of natural and expectation parameters of Gaussian distributions, we then show the relationship between the IGA and the message passing (MP) algorithm. Finally, we prove that the AIGA is equivalent to the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm. These intrinsic results offer a new perspective for the AMP algorithm, and clues for understanding and improving stochastic reasoning methods.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Privacy Measures for Load Hiding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In smart grids, the use of smart meters to measure electricity consumption at a household level raises privacy concerns. To address them, researchers have designed various load hiding algorithms that manipulate the electricity consumption measured. To compare how well these algorithms preserve privacy, various privacy measures have been proposed. However, there currently is no consensus on which privacy measure is most appropriate to use. In this study, we aim to identify the most effective privacy measure(s) for load hiding algorithms. We have crafted a series of experiments to assess the effectiveness of these measures. found 20 of the 25 measures studied to be ineffective. Next, focused on the well-known "appliance usage" secret, we have designed synthetic data to find the measure that best deals with this secret. We observe that such a measure, a variant of mutual information, actually exists.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic quantification of entanglement with a single copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the central importance of quantum entanglement in fueling many quantum technologies, the understanding of the optimal ways to exploit it is still beyond our reach, and even measuring entanglement in an operationally meaningful way is prohibitively difficult. This is due to the need to precisely characterise many-copy, asymptotic protocols for entanglement processing. Here we overcome these issues by introducing a new way of benchmarking the fundamental protocol of entanglement distillation (purification), where instead of measuring its asymptotic yield, we focus on the best achievable error. We connect this formulation of the task with an information-theoretic problem in composite quantum hypothesis testing known as generalised Sanov's theorem. By solving the latter problem -- which had no previously known solution even in classical information theory -- we thus compute the optimal asymptotic error exponent of entanglement distillation. We show this asymptotic solution to be given by the reverse relative entropy of entanglement, a single-letter quantity that can be evaluated using only a single copy of a quantum state, which is a unique feature among operational measures of entanglement. Altogether, we thus demonstrate a measure of entanglement that admits a direct operational interpretation as the optimal asymptotic rate of an important entanglement manipulation protocol while enjoying an exact, single-letter formula.</description>

      <title>Deep Unfolding-Based Channel Estimation for Wideband TeraHertz Near-Field Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The combination of Terahertz (THz) and massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is promising to meet the increasing data rate demand of future wireless communication systems thanks to the huge bandwidth and spatial degrees of freedom. However, unique channel features such as the near-field beam split effect make channel estimation particularly challenging in THz massive MIMO systems. On one hand, adopting the conventional angular domain transformation dictionary designed for low-frequency far-field channels will result in degraded channel sparsity and destroyed sparsity structure in the transformed domain. On the other hand, most existing compressive sensing-based channel estimation algorithms cannot achieve high performance and low complexity simultaneously. To alleviate these issues, in this paper, we first adopt frequency-dependent near-field dictionaries to maintain good channel sparsity and sparsity structure in the transformed domain under the near-field beam split effect. Then, a deep unfolding-based wideband THz massive MIMO channel estimation algorithm is proposed. In each iteration of the unitary approximate message passing-sparse Bayesian learning algorithm, the optimal update rule is learned by a deep neural network (DNN), whose structure is customized to effectively exploit the inherent channel patterns. Furthermore, a mixed training method based on novel designs of the DNN structure and the loss function is developed to effectively train data from different system configurations. Simulation results validate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of performance, complexity, and robustness.</description>

      <title>3D Beamforming Through Joint Phase-Time Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-frequency wideband cellular communications over mmWave and sub-THz offer the opportunity for high data rates. However, it also presents high path loss, resulting in limited coverage. High-gain beamforming from the antenna array is essential to mitigate the coverage limitations. The conventional phased antenna arrays (PAA) cause high scheduling latency owing to analog beam constraints, i.e., only one frequency-flat beam is generated. Recently introduced joint phase-time array (JPTA) architecture, which utilizes both true-time-delay (TTD) units and phase shifters (PSs), alleviates analog beam constraints by creating multiple frequency-dependent beams for scheduling multiple users at different directions in a frequency-division manner. One class of previous studies offered solutions with ``rainbow" beams, which tend to allocate a small bandwidth per beam direction. Another class focused on uniform linear array (ULA) antenna architecture, whose frequency-dependent beams were designed along a single axis of either azimuth or elevation direction. This paper presents a novel 3D beamforming design that maximizes beamforming gain toward desired azimuth and elevation directions and across sub-bands partitioned according to scheduled users' bandwidth requirements. We provide analytical solutions and iterative algorithms to design the PSs and TTD units for a desired subband beam pattern. Through simulations of the beamforming gain, we observe that our proposed solutions outperform the state-of-the-art solutions reported elsewhere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unequal error protection (UEP) codes can facilitate the transmission of messages with different protection levels. In this paper, we study the achievability bounds on UEP by the generalization of Gilbert-Varshamov (GV) bound. For the first time, we show that under certain conditions, UEP enhances the code rate comparing with time-sharing (TS) strategies asymptotically.</description>

      <title>Cache-Aided MIMO Communications: DoF Analysis and Transmitter Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cache-aided MIMO communications aims to jointly exploit both coded caching~(CC) and spatial multiplexing gains to enhance communication efficiency. In this paper, we first analyze the achievable degrees of freedom~(DoF) in a MIMO-CC system with CC gain \(t\), where a server with \(L\) transmit antennas communicates with \(K\) users, each equipped with \(G\) receive antennas. We demonstrate that the enhanced achievable DoF is \(\max_{\beta, \Omega} \Omega \beta\), where the number of users \(\Omega\) served in each transmission is fine-tuned to maximize DoF, and \(\beta \le \min\big(G, \nicefrac{L \binom{\Omega-1}{t}}{1 + (\Omega - t - 1)\binom{\Omega-1}{t}}\big)\) represents the number of parallel streams decoded by each user. Second, we introduce an effective transmit covariance matrix design aimed at maximizing the symmetric rate, solved iteratively via successive convex approximation. Third, we propose a new class of MIMO-CC schemes using a novel scheduling mechanism leveraging maximal multicasting opportunities to maximize delivery rates at given SNR levels while adhering to linear processing constraints. Lastly, we devise linear multicast beamforming strategies tailored for the flexible scheduling schemes in MIMO-CC systems and present an iterative solution for the efficient design of beamformers. Extensive numerical simulations are used to verify the results of the paper.</description>

      <title>Nonconvex Factorization and Manifold Formulations are Almost Equivalent in Low-rank Matrix Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.01772v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the geometric landscape connection of the widely studied manifold and factorization formulations in low-rank positive semidefinite (PSD) and general matrix optimization. We establish a sandwich relation on the spectrum of Riemannian and Euclidean Hessians at first-order stationary points (FOSPs). As a result of that, we obtain an equivalence on the set of FOSPs, second-order stationary points (SOSPs) and strict saddles between the manifold and the factorization formulations. In addition, we show the sandwich relation can be used to transfer more quantitative geometric properties from one formulation to another. Similarities and differences in the landscape connection under the PSD case and the general case are discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first geometric landscape connection between the manifold and the factorization formulations for handling rank constraints, and it provides a geometric explanation for the similar empirical performance of factorization and manifold approaches in low-rank matrix optimization observed in the literature. In the general low-rank matrix optimization, the landscape connection of two factorization formulations (unregularized and regularized ones) is also provided. By applying these geometric landscape connections, in particular, the sandwich relation, we are able to solve unanswered questions in literature and establish stronger results in the applications on geometric analysis of phase retrieval, well-conditioned low-rank matrix optimization, and the role of regularization in factorization arising from machine learning and signal processing.</description>

      <title>How Transformers Learn Causal Structure with Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The incredible success of transformers on sequence modeling tasks can be largely attributed to the self-attention mechanism, which allows information to be transferred between different parts of a sequence. Self-attention allows transformers to encode causal structure which makes them particularly suitable for sequence modeling. However, the process by which transformers learn such causal structure via gradient-based training algorithms remains poorly understood. To better understand this process, we introduce an in-context learning task that requires learning latent causal structure. We prove that gradient descent on a simplified two-layer transformer learns to solve this task by encoding the latent causal graph in the first attention layer. The key insight of our proof is that the gradient of the attention matrix encodes the mutual information between tokens. As a consequence of the data processing inequality, the largest entries of this gradient correspond to edges in the latent causal graph. As a special case, when the sequences are generated from in-context Markov chains, we prove that transformers learn an induction head (Olsson et al., 2022). We confirm our theoretical findings by showing that transformers trained on our in-context learning task are able to recover a wide variety of causal structures.</description>
