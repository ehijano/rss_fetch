      <title>Assessing the Validity of the Fixed Tree Topology Assumption in Phylodynamic Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fixed tree topologies are widely used in phylodynamic analyses to reduce computational burden, yet the consequences of this assumption remain insufficiently understood. Here, we systematically assess the impact of various fixed-topology strategies on phylogenetic and phylodynamic parameter estimates across a diverse set of viral datasets. We compare fully Bayesian joint inference with fixed-topology strategies, including conditioning on maximum likelihood trees subsequently dated with LSD or TreeTime. Our analyses show that global parameters of the substitution and site models are largely robust to the fixed-topology assumption, whereas parameters that depend on the temporal structure of the tree, such as molecular clock rates, node ages, and demographic histories, can exhibit substantial biases. We do treat unconstrained Bayesian analyses as the reference, although we recognize that these too are model-based approximations. Nevertheless, our results highlight serious discordance associated with fixing the topology and underscore the need for faster, time-aware methods that simultaneously integrate topology and parameter estimation. These findings raise important questions about the balance between computational efficiency and inferential accuracy in phylodynamic studies.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the sequence length sufficient to reconstruct level-1 phylogenetic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees and networks are graphs used to model evolutionary relationships, with trees representing strictly branching histories and networks allowing for events in which lineages merge, called reticulation events. While the question of data sufficiency has been studied extensively in the context of trees, it remains largely unexplored for networks. In this work we take a first step in this direction by establishing bounds on the amount of genomic data required to reconstruct binary level-$1$ semi-directed phylogenetic networks, which are binary networks in which reticulation events are indicated by directed edges, all other edges are undirected, and cycles are vertex-disjoint. For this class, methods have been developed recently that are statistically consistent. Roughly speaking, such methods are guaranteed to reconstruct the correct network assuming infinitely long genomic sequences. Here we consider the question whether networks from this class can be uniquely and correctly reconstructed from finite sequences. Specifically, we present an inference algorithm that takes as input genetic sequence data, and demonstrate that the sequence length sufficient to reconstruct the correct network with high probability, under the Cavender-Farris-Neyman model of evolution, scales logarithmically, polynomially, or polylogarithmically with the number of taxa, depending on the parameter regime. As part of our contribution, we also present novel inference rules for quartet data in the semi-directed phylogenetic network setting.</description>

      <title>A novel approach to profile global circulation pathway of SARS-CoV-2 variants by site-based mutation dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has caused recurring epidemic waves, understanding its global dispersal patterns is critical for effective surveillance. We developed the Site-based mutation dynamics - Equal Power Sampling (S-EPS) framework, a phylogenetic-free, bias-correcting framework for profiling viral source-sink dynamics. Applying S-EPS to 6.6 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes (March 2020 - June 2024) from 13 regions worldwide, we identified Africa and the Indian subcontinent as the predominant sources of key mutations. Southeast Asia serves as an early transmission hub, while Russia and South America mainly acted as sinks. Key mutations took longer to establish fitness in source regions than externally. Once an amino acid substitution on the receptor-binding domain reached 1% prevalence in major sources, there is an 80% probability it would spread elsewhere, with a 2-month median lead time (IQR: 1-4). Our findings underscore the importance of genetic surveillance, with S-EPS offering enhanced capability for monitoring emerging viral threats.</description>

      <title>Stochastic fluctuations in an eco-evolutionary game dynamics with environmental feedbacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon the eco-evolutionary game dynamics framework established by Tilman et al., we investigate stochastic fluctuations in a two-strategy system incorporating environmental feedback mechanisms, where the payoff matrix exhibits population size dependence. We adopt a systematic approach which is the so-called $\Omega$-expansion. When the stochastic factor is integrated, it is shown that the population size for each strategy fluctuates around the interior equilibrium of the macroscopic equations (corresponding to the deterministic model of the eco-evolutionary game) and its variance converges to a constant that is proportional to the environmental carrying capacity if the interior equilibrium is asymptotically stable. The simulation results demonstrate that the $\Omega$ expansion provides a valid approximation, and the reliability of the aforementioned conclusions is verified. Therefore, analogous to Fudenberg and Harris' s stochastic replicator dynamics for infinite populations under external noise (\emph{J. Econ. Theory 57, 420-441}), the dynamic stability of the eco-evolutionary game can be extended to the stochastic regime when the environmental carrying capacity is sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Classical JAK2V617F+ Myeloproliferative Neoplasms emergence and development based on real life incidence and mathematical modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mathematical modeling allows us to better understand myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) emergence and development. We tested different mathematical models on an initial cohort to determine the emergence and evolution times before diagnosis of JAK2V617F classical MPN (Polycythemia Vera (PV) and Essential Thrombocythemia (ET)). We considered the time before diagnosis as the sum of two independent periods: the time (from embryonic development) for the JAK2V617F mutation to occur, not disappear and enter proliferation, and a second time corresponding to the expansion of the clonal population until diagnosis. We demonstrate using progressively complexified models that the rate of active mutation occurrence cannot be constant, but rather increases exponentially with age following the Gompertz model. We found that the first tumorous cell takes an average time of $63.1 \pm 13$ years to appear and start proliferation. On the other hand, the expansion time is constant: $8.8$ years once the mutation has emerged. These results were validated in an external cohort. Using this model, we analyzed JAK2V167F ET versus PV, and obtained that the time of active mutation occurrence for PV takes approximately $1.5$ years more than for ET to develop, while the expansion time was similar. In conclusion, our multi-step approach and the ultimate age-dependent model for the emergence and development of MPN demonstrates that the emergence of a JAKV617F mutation should be linked to an aging mechanism, and indicates a $8-9$ years period of time to develop a full MPN.</description>

      <title>Bayesian tit-for-tat fosters cooperation in evolutionary stochastic games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning from experience is a key feature of decision-making in cognitively complex organisms. Strategic interactions involving Bayesian inferential strategies can enable us to better understand how evolving individual choices to be altruistic or selfish can affect collective outcomes in social dilemmas. Bayesian strategies are distinguished, from their reactive opponents, in their ability to modulate their actions in the light of new evidence. We investigate whether such strategies can be resilient against reactive strategies when actions not only determine the immediate payoff but can affect future payoffs by changing the state of the environment. We use stochastic games to mimic the change in environment in a manner that is conditioned on the players' actions. By considering three distinct rules governing transitions between a resource-rich and a resource-poor states, we ascertain the conditions under which Bayesian tit-for-tat strategy can resist being invaded by reactive strategies. We find that the Bayesian strategy is resilient against a large class of reactive strategies and is more effective in fostering cooperation leading to sustenance of the resource-rich state. However, the extent of success of the Bayesian strategies depends on the other strategies in the pool and the rule governing transition between the two different resource states.</description>

      <title>A homoclinic route to chaos in omnivore communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Omnivory, where species feed across multiple trophic levels, is a widespread feature of ecological networks. A key mechanism underlying such complexity is intraguild predation (IGP), in which a top predator consumes both an intermediate predator and a shared resource. Here, we show that Shilnikov homoclinic orbits emerge in a minimal intraguild predation model, triggering a cascade of homoclinic bifurcations near a saddle-focus equilibrium that culminates in chaos. Numerical simulations and Lyapunov spectrum analysis reveal multiple coexistence modes, ranging from regular oscillations to Shilnikov homoclinic orbits and chaos. Our model quantitatively reproduces patterns observed in natural omnivore networks, providing mechanistic insights into complex population fluctuations in ecological systems.</description>
