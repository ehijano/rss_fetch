      <title>Gosling Designer: a Platform to Democratize Construction and Sharing of Genomics Data Visualization Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis of genomics data is central to nearly all areas of modern biology. Despite significant progress in artificial intelligence (AI) and computational methods, these technologies require significant human oversight to generate novel and reliable biological insights. Consequently, the genomics community has developed a substantial number of diverse visualization approaches and a proliferation of tools that biologists rely on in their data analysis workflows. While there are a few commonly used visualization tools for genomics data, many tools target specific use cases for genomics data interpretation and offer only a limited, predefined set of visualization types. Moreover, static visualizations often fail to support exploratory analysis. Developing interactive visualizations and tools typically requires significant time and technical expertise, even when supported by modern LLM-powered coding assistants, and the resulting visualizations can be difficult to share among collaborators. We developed Gosling Designer, an all-in-one platform for editing, exploring, and sharing visualizations of genomics data. Gosling Designer addresses four key challenges observed in existing genomics visualization tools: (1) limited versatility, (2) difficulty of visualization authoring, (3) complexity of data management, and (4) barriers to sharing and collaboration.</description>

      <title>scMRDR: A scalable and flexible framework for unpaired single-cell multi-omics data integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in single-cell sequencing have enabled high-resolution profiling of diverse molecular modalities, while integrating unpaired multi-omics single-cell data remains challenging. Existing approaches either rely on pair information or prior correspondences, or require computing a global pairwise coupling matrix, limiting their scalability and flexibility. In this paper, we introduce a scalable and flexible generative framework called single-cell Multi-omics Regularized Disentangled Representations (scMRDR) for unpaired multi-omics integration. Specifically, we disentangle each cell's latent representations into modality-shared and modality-specific components using a well-designed $\beta$-VAE architecture, which are augmented with isometric regularization to preserve intra-omics biological heterogeneity, adversarial objective to encourage cross-modal alignment, and masked reconstruction loss strategy to address the issue of missing features across modalities. Our method achieves excellent performance on benchmark datasets in terms of batch correction, modality alignment, and biological signal preservation. Crucially, it scales effectively to large-level datasets and supports integration of more than two omics, offering a powerful and flexible solution for large-scale multi-omics data integration and downstream biological discovery.</description>
