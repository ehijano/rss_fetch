      <title>A dynamical mechanism rooted in the Lorenz system for giant negative and positive mobility of a memory-driven active particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On applying a small bias force, non-equilibrium systems may respond in paradoxical ways such as with giant negative mobility (GNM) -- a large net drift opposite to the applied bias, or giant positive mobility (GPM) -- an anomalously large drift in the same direction as the applied bias. We consider an idealized model of a memory-driven active particle inspired from experiments with walking/superwalking droplets that takes the form of the celebrated Lorenz system. By adding a small bias force to this Lorenz model, we uncover a mechanism for simultaneous emergence of GNM and GPM in the parameter space. Within the chaotic sea of the parameter space, a symmetric pair of coexisting asymmetric limit cycles separate and migrate under applied bias force, resulting in anomalous transport behaviors that are sensitive to the particle's memory. This provides a general dynamical mechanism for the emergence of anomalous transport behaviors for self-driven particles described by low-dimensional autonomous chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Microphase Segregation in Polyelectrolyte Brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polyelectrolyte (PE) brushes have ubiquitous applications as surface modifiers which regulate various structural and dynamic properties. Here, we apply a continuous-space self-consistent field theory to study the structural heterogeneity in PE brushes induced by competing electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. For brushes with high grafting densities, we find a series of microphase-segregated morphologies with alternating polymer-rich and polymer-poor layers in the direction normal to the substrate. The transitions between multi-layer morphologies with consecutive numbers of condensed layers as well as the melting transition to the fully swollen brush are all discontinuous. We also elucidate that the segregated layers are formed by different subpopulations of all chains, significantly different from the scenario of the pearl-necklace structure formed by a single PE in poor solvents. Furthermore, we bridge the microstructure of multi-layer brushes to experimentally measurable reflectivity spectra, where the oscillation period and amplitude in the spectra are shown to be very sensitive to the number of layers and the sharpness of the polymer-solvent interface. The multi-layer morphology predicted by our theory is in good agreement with the lamellae structure experimentally observed at hydrated Nafion film interfaces.</description>

      <title>Cybloids $-$ Creation and Control of Cybernetic Colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloids play an important role in fundamental science as well as in nature and technology. They have had a strong impact on the fundamental understanding of statistical physics. For example, colloids have helped to obtain a better understanding of collective phenomena, ranging from phase transitions and glass formation to the swarming of active Brownian particles. Yet the success of colloidal systems hinges crucially on the specific physical and chemical properties of the colloidal particles, i.e. particles with the appropriate characteristics must be available. Here we present an idea to create particles with freely selectable properties. The properties might depend, for example, on the presence of other particles (hence mimicking specific pair or many-body interactions), previous configurations (hence introducing some memory or feedback), or a directional bias (hence changing the dynamics). Without directly interfering with the sample, each particle is fully controlled and can receive external commands through a predefined algorithm that can take into account any input parameters. This is realized with computer-controlled colloids, which we term cybloids - short for cybernetic colloids. The potential of cybloids is illustrated by programming a time-delayed external potential acting on a single colloid and interaction potentials for many colloids. Both an attractive harmonic potential and an annular potential are implemented. For a single particle, this programming can cause subdiffusive behavior or lend activity. For many colloids, the programmed interaction potential allows to select a crystal structure at wish. Beyond these examples, we discuss further opportunities which cybloids offer.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal patterns in Growing Bacterial Suspensions: Impact of Growth dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of active matter explores the behaviors of self propelled agents out of equilibrium, with active suspensions, such as swimming bacteria in solutions, serving as impactful models. These systems exhibit spatio-temporal patterns akin to active turbulence, driven by internal energy injection. While bacterial turbulence in dense suspensions is well studied, the dynamics in growing bacterial suspensions are less understood. This work presents a phenomenological coarse-grained model for growing bacterial suspensions, incorporating hydrodynamic equations for bacterial density, orientation, and fluid velocity, with birth and death terms for colony growth. Starting with low density and random orientations, the model shows the development of local ordering as bacterial density increases. As density continues to rise, the model captures four distinct phases; dilute, clustered, turbulent, and trapped based on structural patterns and dynamics, with the turbulent phase characterized by spatio-temporal vortex structures, aligning with observations in dense bacterial suspensions.</description>

      <title>Line tension from dual-geometry sessile droplet measurements: Combining contact angle size dependence data for axisymmetric and cylindrical droplets to determine the line tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a thermodynamic analysis of various contributions to the size dependence of the contact angle cosine for axisymmetric and cylindrical sessile droplets. This shows that a widely used method to determine the line tension from the slope of the contact angle cosine dependence on the three-phase contact line curvature (for axisymmetric droplets) provides a certain combination of the line tension, adsorptions at the three interfaces, and the macroscopic contact angle. To extract the leading-order contact-line-related contribution and determine the line tension, we propose a simple technique using contact angle size dependences for axisymmetric and cylindrical droplets at the same conditions.</description>

      <title>Propagation of Enzyme-driven Active Fluctuations in Crowded Milieu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the energy transfer from active enzymes to their surroundings in crowded environments by measuring the diffusion of passive microscopic tracers in active solutions of ficoll and glycerol. Despite observing lower rates of substrate turnover and relatively smaller enhancement of passive tracer diffusion in artificial crowded media compared to those in aqueous solutions, we found a significantly higher relative diffusion enhancement in crowded environments in the presence of enzymatic activity. Our experimental observations, coupled with supporting analytical estimations, underscored the critical role of the intervening media in facilitating mechanical energy distribution around active enzymes.</description>

      <title>Induced smectic ordering and blue phase formation in mixtures of cyanobiphenyls and cholesterol esters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been found that in mixtures of nematic E7 and smectogenic cholesteryl oleyl carbonate (COC) the S$_A$-N* transition temperature is substantially (by ~20 K) increased, as compared with pure COC, at E7 concentrations around ~40%. Within the same concentration range, the isotropic transition is preceded by formation of blue phase, with its maximum width of ~3.5 K clearly correlated to the increased thermal stability of the S$_A$ phase. With other cholesterol esters or cyanobiphenyls (cholesteryl nonanoate, 5CB), this effect was either much weaker or not observed. No enhancement of smectic phase was noted when E7 was replaced by N$_{tb}$-forming nematic mixture based on CB7CB with two cyanobiphenyl moieties. Selective Bragg reflection of light (BRL) spectra were measured in all three temperature regions, including the unwinding of the cholesteric helix on cooling towards S$_A$ phase and characteristic selective BRL changes in the blue phase. In the latter case, the measured {\lambda}$_{max}$ values were dependent both on the helical twisting power in the cholesteric phase and on the lattice size and orientation in the blue phase. Also considered were the effects of ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ nanoparticles accumulated at disclination lines upon the blue phase thermal stability.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of random walking vortex loops in counterflowing superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the theory of the thermodynamic equilibrium in a system of quantum vortices in superfluids in the presence of a counterflow, the influence of a vortex tangle on various thermodynamic phenomena in quantum liquids is studied. Using the early calculated partition function we study some of the properties of He II related to counterflow, such as the distribution of vortex loops in their length, the suppression of the superfluid density $\rho _{s}$ and the shift $T_{\lambda}$. Good agreement with the early obtained results is a fairly strong argument in favor of the point of view that the gas of string-like topological excitations can indeed be considered as a additional kind of quasi-particles having the inner structure at high temperatures, especially near the phase transition. The application of the developed formalism to the theory of quantum turbulence is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Microscopic model for aging of biocondensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates are membraneless compartments in the cell that are involved in a wide diversity of biological processes. These phase-separated droplets usually exhibit a viscoelastic mechanical response. A behavior rationalized by modeling the complex molecules that make up a condensate as stickers and spacers, which assemble into a network-like structure. The proper functioning of biocondensates requires precise control over their composition, size, and mechanical response. For example, several neurodegenerative diseases are associated with dysfunctional condensates that solidify over a long period of time (days) until they become solid. A phenomenon usually described as aging. The emergence of such a long timescale of evolution from microscopic events, as well as the associated microscopic reorganization leading to aging, remains mostly an open question. In this article, we explore the connection between the mechanical properties of the condensates and their microscopic structure. We propose a minimal model for the dynamic of stickers and spacers, and show that entropy minimization of spacers leads to an attractive force between stickers. Our system displays a surprisingly slow relaxation toward equilibrium, reminiscent of glassy systems and consistent with the liquid-to-solid transition observed. To explain this behavior, we study the clustering dynamic of stickers and successfully explain the origin of glassy relaxation.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Progression of Cancerous Tumors in Mice: A Machine and Deep Learning Intuition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study explores Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered modeling to predict the evolution of cancer tumor cells in mice under different forms of treatment. The AI models are analyzed against varying ambient and systemic parameters, e.g. drug dosage, volume of the cancer cell mass, and time taken to destroy the cancer cell mass. The data required for the analysis have been synthetically extracted from plots available in both published and unpublished literature (primarily using a Matlab architecture called "Grabit"), that are then statistically standardized around the same baseline for comparison. Three forms of treatment are considered - saline (multiple concentrations used), magnetic nanoparticles (mNPs) and fluorodeoxyglycose iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (mNP-FDGs) - analyzed using three Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Multilinear Regression (MLR), and a Deep Learning (DL) module, the Adaptive Neural Network (ANN). The AI models are trained on 60-80% data, the rest used for validation. Assessed over all three forms of treatment, ANN consistently outperforms other predictive models. Our models predict mNP-FDG as the most potent treatment regime that kills the cancerous tumor completely in ca 13 days from the start of treatment. The models can be generalized to other forms of cancer treatment regimens.</description>
