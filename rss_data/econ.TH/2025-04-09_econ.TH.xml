      <title>On The Merit Principle in Strategic Exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New fairness notions in align with the merit principle are proposed for designing exchange rules. We show that, for an obviously strategy-proof, efficient and individually rational rule, an upper bound of fairness attainable is that, if two agents possess objects considered the best by all others, then at least one receives her favorite object. Notably, it is not possible to guarantee them both receiving favorites. Our results thus indicate an unambiguous trade-off between incentives and fairness in the design of exchange rules.</description>

      <title>Optimal classification with outcome performativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I consider the problem of classifying individual behavior in a simple setting of outcome performativity where the behavior the algorithm seeks to classify is itself dependent on the algorithm. I show in this context that the most accurate classifier is either a threshold or a negative threshold rule. A threshold rule offers the "good" classification to those individuals whose outcome likelihoods are greater than some cutpoint, while a negative threshold rule offers the "good" outcome to those whose outcome likelihoods are less than some cutpoint. While seemingly pathological, I show that a negative threshold rule can be the most accurate classifier when outcomes are performative. I provide an example of such a classifier, and extend the analysis to more general algorithm objectives, allowing the algorithm to differentially weigh false negatives and false positives, for example.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Double Auction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Auctions are important mechanisms extensively implemented in various markets, e.g., search engines' keyword auctions, antique auctions, etc. Finding an optimal auction mechanism is extremely difficult due to the constraints of imperfect information, incentive compatibility (IC), and individual rationality (IR). In addition to the traditional economic methods, some recently attempted to find the optimal (single) auction using deep learning methods. Unlike those attempts focusing on single auctions, we develop deep learning methods for double auctions, where imperfect information exists on both the demand and supply sides. The previous attempts on single auction cannot directly apply to our contexts and those attempts additionally suffer from limited generalizability, inefficiency in ensuring the constraints, and learning fluctuations. We innovate in designing deep learning models for solving the more complex problem and additionally addressing the previous models' three limitations. Specifically, we achieve generalizability by leveraging a transformer-based architecture to model market participants as sequences for varying market sizes; we utilize the numerical features of the constraints and pre-treat them for a higher learning efficiency; we develop a gradient-conflict-elimination scheme to address the problem of learning fluctuation. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our approach to classical and machine learning baselines.</description>

      <title>Competitive and Revenue-Optimal Pricing with Budgets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03692v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In markets with budget-constrained buyers, competitive equilibria need not be efficient in the utilitarian sense, or maximise the seller's revenue. We consider a setting with multiple divisible goods. Competitive equilibrium outcomes, and only those, are constrained utilitarian efficient, a notion of utilitarian efficiency that respects buyers' demands and budgets. Our main contribution establishes that, when buyers have linear valuations, competitive equilibrium prices are unique and revenue-optimal for a zero-cost seller.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Sequential Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a differentially private sequential learning setting, agents introduce endogenous noise into their actions to maintain privacy. Applying this to a standard sequential learning model leads to different outcomes for continuous vs. binary signals. For continuous signals with a nonzero privacy budget, we introduce a novel smoothed randomized response mechanism that adapts noise based on distance to a threshold, unlike traditional randomized response, which applies uniform noise. This enables agents' actions to better reflect both private signals and observed history, accelerating asymptotic learning speed to $\Theta_{\epsilon}(\log(n))$, compared to $\Theta(\sqrt{\log(n)})$ in the non-private regime where privacy budget is infinite. Moreover, in the non-private setting, the expected stopping time for the first correct decision and the number of incorrect actions diverge, meaning early agents may make mistakes for an unreasonably long period. In contrast, under a finite privacy budget $\epsilon \in (0,1)$, both remain finite, highlighting a stark contrast between private and non-private learning. Learning with continuous signals in the private regime is more efficient, as smooth randomized response enhances the log-likelihood ratio over time, improving information aggregation. Conversely, for binary signals, differential privacy noise hinders learning, as agents tend to use a constant randomized response strategy before an information cascade forms, reducing action informativeness and hampering the overall process.</description>

      <title>Walrasian equilibrium: An alternate proof of existence and lattice structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a model of two-sided matching market where buyers and sellers trade indivisible goods with the feature that each buyer has unit demand and seller has unit supply. The result of the existence of Walrasian equilibrium and lattice structure of equilibrium price vectors is known. We provide an alternate proof for existence and lattice structure using Tarksi's fixed point theorem.</description>
