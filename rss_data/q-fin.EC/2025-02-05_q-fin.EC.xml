      <title>Study on the impact of trade policy uncertainty on the performance of enterprise ESG performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trade policy uncertainty has become a significant feature of today's global economy. While its impact on free trade is evident, its microeconomic effects remain open to debate. This study explores the influence of trade policy uncertainty on corporate ESG performance and its underlying mechanisms, using data from A-share listed companies in China from 2010 to 2020. The findings reveal that increased trade policy uncertainty significantly and robustly enhances corporate ESG performance. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that high-tech enterprises are better equipped to improve their ESG performance in response to trade policy uncertainty. Furthermore, strengthening internal controls and appointing CEOs with environmental backgrounds also help firms seize the opportunities arising from trade policy uncertainty. In terms of mechanisms, trade policy uncertainty intensifies industry competition, compelling firms to enhance their ESG performance to gain market share. Additionally, it stimulates green technological innovation, further optimizing ESG outcomes. Therefore, efforts should focus on improving the ESG standards system, establishing ESG incentive policies, increasing the transparency and predictability of trade policies, and promoting corporate green development to advance national sustainable development goals.</description>

      <title>Innovative activities of Activision Blizzard: A patent network analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard valued at $68.7 billion has drastically altered the landscape of the video game industry. At the time of the takeover, the intellectual properties of Activision Blizzard included World of Warcraft, Diablo, Hearthstone, StarCraft, Overwatch, Battle.net, Candy Crush Saga, and Call of Duty. This article aims to explore the patenting activity of Activision Blizzard between 2008 (the original merger) and 2023 (the Microsoft acquisition). Four IPC code co-occurrence networks (co-classification maps) are constructed and analyzed based on the patent data downloaded from the WIPO Patentscope database. International Patent Classification (IPC) codes are a language agnostic system for the classification of patents. When multiple IPC codes co-occur in a patent, it shows that the technologies are connected. These relationships can be used for patent mapping. The analysis identifies the prolific and bridging technologies of Activision Blizzard and explores its synergistic role as a subsidiary of Microsoft Corporation.</description>

      <title>Stochastic optimal control problems with measurable coefficients via $L^p$-viscosity solutions and applications to optimal advertising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider fully non-linear stochastic optimal control problems in infinite horizon with measurable coefficients and uniformly elliptic diffusion. Using the theory of $L^p$-viscosity solutions, we show existence of an $L^p$-viscosity solution $v\in W_{\rm loc}^{2,p}$ of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which, in turn, is also a strong solution (i.e. it satisfies the HJB equation pointwise a.e.). We are then led to prove verification theorems, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality. These results allow us to construct optimal feedback controls. We use the theory developed to solve a stochastic optimal control problem arising in economics within the context of optimal advertising.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Errors or Surprises?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08908v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional finance and macroeconomic models usually assume people can form rational expectations or reach them via a learning path by minimizing prediction errors. The recent Reference Model Based Learning (RMBL) model provides a new perspective: It hypothesizes that people minimize surprises instead of errors. Following the spirit of Simon's "satisficing" criteria, RMBL predicts that they will minimize errors only when the prediction error exceeds a threshold. We conduct meta-analyses based on 18 Learning-to-Forecast Experiments (LtFEs; N=41,490). Our results from the horse race test consistently show that student participants minimize surprises instead of errors in the LtFEs. In contrast, the results based on the data from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) show no evidence that they minimize surprises. Together, our results suggest that minimizing surprises by implementing RMBL may be the simple procedure people employ when navigating complexity in forecasting.</description>

      <title>Gender Bias and Property Taxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gender bias distorts the economic behavior and outcomes of women and households. We investigate gender biases in property taxes. We analyze records of more than 100,000 property tax appeal hearings and more than 2.7 years of associated audio recordings, considering how panelist and appellant genders associate with hearing outcomes. We first observe that female appellants fare systematically worse than male appellants in their hearings. Second, we show that, whereas male appellants' hearing outcomes do not vary meaningfully with the gender composition of the panel they face, those of female appellants' do, such that female appellants obtain systematically lesser (greater) reductions to their home values when facing female (male) panelists. Employing a multi-modal large language model (M-LLM), we next construct measures of participant behavior and tone from hearing audio recordings. We observe markedly different behaviors between male and female appellants and, in the case of male appellants, we find that these differences also depend on the gender of the panelists they face (e.g., male appellants appear to behave systematically more aggressively towards female panelists). In contrast, the behavior of female appellants remains relatively constant, regardless of their panel's gender. Finally, we show that female appellants continue to fare worse in front of female panels, even when we condition upon the appelant's in-hearing behavior and tone. Our results are thus consistent with the idea that gender biases are driven, at least in part, by unvoiced beliefs and perceptions on the part of ARB panelists. Our study documents the presence of gender biases in property appraisal appeal hearings and highlights the potential value of generative AI for analyzing large-scale, unstructured administrative data.</description>

      <title>Auction-Based Regulation for Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an era of "moving fast and breaking things", regulators have moved slowly to pick up the safety, bias, and legal debris left in the wake of broken Artificial Intelligence (AI) deployment. While there is much-warranted discussion about how to address the safety, bias, and legal woes of state-of-the-art AI models, rigorous and realistic mathematical frameworks to regulate AI are lacking. Our paper addresses this challenge, proposing an auction-based regulatory mechanism that provably incentivizes devices (i) to deploy compliant models and (ii) to participate in the regulation process. We formulate AI regulation as an all-pay auction where enterprises submit models for approval. The regulator enforces compliance thresholds and further rewards models exhibiting higher compliance than their peers. We derive Nash Equilibria demonstrating that rational agents will submit models exceeding the prescribed compliance threshold. Empirical results show that our regulatory auction boosts compliance rates by 20% and participation rates by 15% compared to baseline regulatory mechanisms, outperforming simpler frameworks that merely impose minimum compliance standards.</description>
