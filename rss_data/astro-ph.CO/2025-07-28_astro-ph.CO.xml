      <title>Reconciling Fractional Power Potential and EGB Gravity in the light of ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results from the ACT collaboration indicate a higher value for the scalar spectral index, with $n_s = 0.9743 \pm 0.0034$, which sets tighter constraints on inflationary models, and these shifts are not in favor of many pre existing scenarios, including the widely studied and accepted standard Starobinsky model. In this paper, we examine the fractional power scalar potential within the framework of Einstein Gauss Bonnet (EGB) gravity, incorporating standard slow roll approximation. The EGB theory, motivated by higher dimensional models, introduces quadratic curvature corrections and a coupling between the scalar field and the Gauss Bonnet term, thereby modifying the cosmological dynamics. The results show good agreement with observational data, placing the predictions within the $1 \sigma$ region of the ACT $r-n_s$ constraint plot. Furthermore, incorporating the running of the scalar spectral index reinforces the models consistency with observational bounds. We also explore the parameter space of the EGB couplings and identify the range of free parameters for which the results of $n_s$ and $r$ values remain within the $1 \sigma$ region of the ACT constraints. Finally, we also investigate the reheating phase, demonstrating that the model not only agrees with ACT data but also satisfies the lower bound on the reheating temperature, thereby ensuring a consistent and viable cosmological scenario.</description>

      <title>Cosmic homogeneity: the effect of redshift-space distortions and bias and cosmological constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel cosmological analysis based on the angular correlation dimension $D_2$ curve, a cumulative statistic derived from the two-point correlation function. Unlike traditional 3D approaches, angular $D_2$ is inherently less sensitive to nonlinear dynamical distortions, such as the small-scale Finger-of-God (FoG) effect. Using both MultiDark-Patchy and EZmock galaxy catalogs, we assess the scale-dependent impact of redshift-space distortions on $D_2$ and bias measurements. We demonstrate that the systematic errors associated with FoG modeling can be significantly reduced by restricting the analysis to appropriate minimum comoving angular scales of $\sim 1.25^{\circ} $, which corresponds to comoving scales of $\sim 20\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ within the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Since the observational estimative of $D_2(\theta)$ is not dependent on a cosmological model we obtain robust estimates of the galaxy bias and place competitive constraints on the physical matter density $\omega_m$. By applying this framework to SDSS DR12 and DR16 Luminous Red Galaxy data, we obtain $\omega_m = 0.142^{+0.014}_{-0.022}$ (1$\sigma$), which agrees with current CMB analyses. Our results highlight the potential of the angular $D_2$ curve as a model-independent and robust tool for cosmological parameter inference.</description>

      <title>Quadratic estimators for unwindowed power spectrum of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing and its application to $P_{\rm gm}(k)$ estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy-galaxy weak lensing provides a powerful means of measuring the average matter distribution around lens galaxies -- i.e., the galaxy bias relation. Properly accounting for the spin-2 nature of weak lensing distortions, we develop a quadratic estimator for measuring the $E$- and $B$-mode angular power spectra from galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, correcting for survey window effects arising from, for example, survey geometry and bright star masks. The estimator can be implemented efficiently by adopting FFTs on pixelized maps of the lens galaxy distribution and source galaxy ellipticities, under the flat-sky approximation. Using simulated weak lensing fields and halo catalogs in the light-cone ray-tracing simulations, we show that the estimator can recover the underlying $E$-mode power spectrum, $C_{{\rm g}E}(\ell)$, to within a few percent in fractional error, while minimizing the leakage of $E$-mode into the $B$-mode power spectrum, in each multipole bin over the wide range of multipoles (up to $\ell \sim 3000$ studied in this paper). We then discuss that the estimator can be used to estimate the 3D galaxy-matter power spectrum, $P_{\rm gm}(k)$, by dividing lens galaxies into multiple redshift slices. We also derive an optimal weighting for each lens redshift slice in the shot noise-limited regime for the estimation of $P_{\rm gm}(k)$, which reduces the statistical errors by up to $\sim$20\% compared to the case without weighting.</description>

      <title>Refined Constraints on the Hubble Constant from Localized FRBs with Assessment of Systematic Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dispersion measure-redshift relation of fast radio bursts (FRBs) provides a valuable cosmological probe for constraining the Hubble constant, offering an independent measurement that could help resolve the ongoing Hubble tension. In this paper, we begin with a sample of 117 localized FRBs and use 95 of them to constrain $H_0$ to $71.28^{+1.90}_{-2.08}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ within the standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. The resulting statistical uncertainty is below 2.8\%, improving previous FRB-based measurements and highlighting the promise of larger future samples. Beyond statistical improvements, we note that different parameter choices have been adopted in previous studies and some results show discrepancies in $H_0$. To address this issue, we perform a systematic assessment of modeling uncertainties that can affect the inferred value of $H_0$, including Galactic electron density models, the contribution of the Galactic halo, outliers such as FRB~20190520B located in extreme environments, and the other parameter selections. We also discuss possible approaches to mitigate these sources of uncertainty, emphasizing both the challenges and prospects of using FRBs as reliable cosmological tools.</description>

      <title>Emulating redshift-mixing due to blending in weak gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies whose images overlap in the focal plane of a telescope, commonly referred to as blends, are often located at different redshifts. Blending introduces a challenge to weak lensing cosmology probes, as such blends are subject to shear signals from multiple redshifts. This effect can be described by joining shear bias and redshift characterisation in the effective redshift distribution, $n_{\gamma}(z)$, which includes the response of apparent shapes of detected objects to shear of galaxies at redshift $z$. In this work, we propose a novel method to correct $n_{\gamma}(z)$ for redshift-mixed blending by emulating the shear response to neighbouring galaxies. Specifically, we design a ``half-sky-shearing'' simulation with HSC-Wide-like specifications, in which we extract the response of a detected object's measured ellipticity to shear of neighbouring galaxies among numerous galaxy pairs. We demonstrate the feasibility of accurately emulating these pairwise responses and validate the robustness of our approach under varying observing conditions and galaxy population uncertainties. We find that the effective redshift of sources at the high-redshift tail of the distribution is about 0.05 lower than expected when not modelling the effect. Given appropriately processed image simulations, our correction method can be readily incorporated into future cosmological analyses to mitigate this source of systematic error.</description>

      <title>Non-linear Dynamics and Primordial Black Hole Formation During Kination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of large scalar inhomogeneities during the kination epoch, a period in which the universe's dynamics are dominated by the kinetic energy of a scalar field, by fully evolving the Einstein equations using numerical relativity. By tracking the non-linear growth of scalar perturbations with both sub-horizon and super-horizon initial wavelengths, we are able to compare their evolution to perturbative results. Our key findings show that in the deep sub-horizon limit, the perturbative behaviour remains valid, whereas in the super-horizon regime, non-linear dynamics exhibit a much richer phenomenology. Finally, we discuss the possibility of primordial black hole formation from the collapse of such perturbations and assess whether this process could serve as a viable mechanism to reheat the universe in the post-inflationary era.</description>

      <title>A Truncated Primordial Power Spectrum and its Impact on CMB Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of a hypothesized delayed initiation of inflation, characterized by a cutoff k_min to the primordial power spectrum in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This cutoff affects both the scalar and tensor spectra, which therefore impacts several measurements of the temperature and polarization distributions. We calculate the angular power spectrum and correlation function with and without k_min in the context of Planck-LCDM, and demonstrate that a non-zero k_min significantly improves the alignment between theory and the observations, including the temperature, E-mode polarization, TE cross-correlation, Q+U polarization and Q-U polarization. It creates an observable signature in both the angular power spectrum and correlation function for all cases. We thus also explore the B-mode polarization, for which current data are not yet precise enough to determine k_min, but whose impact should be detectable with high-precision measurements using future missions, such as LiteBIRD, if the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r, is not much smaller than its current upper limit. We find that the introduction of k_min not only addresses large-angle anomalies in the CMB but also provides a more consistent framework for understanding the early Universe's inflationary phase. These findings highlight the importance of future high-precision CMB observations in validating the existence and implications of k_min.</description>

      <title>Dark energy constraints in light of theoretical priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to derive model-independent observational bounds on dark energy/modified gravity theories, a typical approach is to constrain parametrised models intended to capture the space of dark energy theories. Here we investigate in detail the effect that the nature of these parametrisations can have, finding significant effects on the resulting cosmological dark energy constraints. In order to observationally distinguish well-motivated and physical parametrisations from unphysical ones, it is crucial to understand the theoretical priors that physical parametrisations place on the phenomenology of dark energy. To this end we discuss a range of theoretical priors that can be imposed on general dark energy parametrisations, and their effect on the constraints on the phenomenology of dynamical dark energy. More specifically, we investigate both the phenomenological $\{\mu,\Sigma\}$ parametrisation as well as effective field theory (EFT) inspired approaches to model dark energy interactions. We compare the constraints obtained in both approaches for different phenomenological and theory-informed time-dependences for the underlying functional degrees of freedom, discuss the effects of priors derived from gravitational wave physics, and investigate the interplay between constraints on parameters constraining only the background evolution vs. parameters controlling linear perturbations.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole formation in matter domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) formed by the collapse of rare primordial fluctuations during an early period of Matter Domination. The collapse threshold strongly depends on the shape of the peaks, decreasing as they become flatter and hence rarer. In the extreme limit of a top-hat perturbation, Harada, Kohri, Sasaki, Terada, and Yoo have argued that the growth of velocity dispersion prevents the formation of black holes unless the initial peak is larger than $\zeta_{\rm th} \sim \zeta_{\rm rms}^{2/5}$. Including the shape distribution of the peaks, we find that for a realistic cosmic abundance of PBHs, the effective threshold is larger, $\zeta_{\rm th} \sim \zeta_{\rm rms }^{1/10}$. And this model requires $\zeta_{\rm rms}\sim 10^{-1}$, which is much larger than the observed value at the CMB scales. Hence, PBH formation during Matter Domination is barely more efficient than Radiation Domination. We estimate the dimensionless spin parameter to be $a_{\rm rms} \sim \zeta_{\rm rms}^{7/4}\ll 1$, slightly larger than PBHs formed in Radiation Domination.</description>

      <title>Non-singular bouncing cosmology in $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ gravity with energy condition violations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The singularity and inflationary problems have posed significant challenges for understanding the universe's origin and evolution. Bouncing cosmology has emerged as a promising alternative to standard cosmological models, offering a non-singular approach to early universe dynamics by facilitating a "bounce" rather than a singular beginning. In this study, we explore the feasibility of modeling specific bouncing scenarios within the framework of $ f(T, \mathcal{T}) $ gravity, allowing for a comprehensive coupling between the torsion scalar $T$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $\mathcal{T}$. We analyze two $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ models: a linear model $f(T, \mathcal{T}) = \alpha T + \beta \mathcal{T}$ and a non-linear model $f(T, \mathcal{T}) = \alpha \sqrt{-T} + \beta \mathcal{T}$, with a parameterized scale factor $a(t) = \sqrt{a_0^2 + \gamma^2 t^2}$ to capture the bounce behavior. The analysis confirms a cosmic bounce at $t = 0 $, where the Hubble parameter $H = 0$ signals a transition from contraction to expansion. A crucial condition for achieving the bounce is the violation of the null energy condition (NEC) near the bounce, enabling the equation of state (EoS) parameter to enter the phantom region ($\omega &lt; -1$). Both models exhibit an increase in energy density as the universe approaches the bounce, peaking at the bounce epoch and then decreasing post-bounce. Pressure remains negative throughout, with the EoS parameter crossing into the phantom region near the bounce in both positive and negative time zones. Our findings show that NEC and strong energy condition (SEC) violations are essential for the non-singular bounce, while the dominant energy condition (DEC) is satisfied, ensuring a consistent matter distribution...</description>

      <title>Bayesian Deep Gaussian Processes for Correlated Functional Data: A Case Study in Cosmological Matter Power Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the structure of our universe and the distribution of matter is an area of active research. As cosmological surveys grow in complexity, the development of emulators to efficiently and effectively predict matter power spectra is essential. We are particularly motivated by the Mira-Titan Universe simulation suite that, for a specified cosmological parameterization (termed a "cosmology"), provides multiple response curves of various fidelities, including correlated functional realizations. Our objective is two-fold. First, we estimate the underlying true matter power spectra, with appropriate uncertainty quantification (UQ), from all of the provided curves. To this end, we propose a novel Bayesian deep Gaussian process (DGP) hierarchical model which synthesizes all the simulation information to estimate the underlying matter power spectra while providing effective UQ. Our model extends previous work on Bayesian DGPs from scalar responses to correlated functional outputs. Second, we leverage our predicted power spectra from various cosmologies in order to accurately predict the entire matter power spectra for an unobserved cosmology. For this task, we use basis function representations of the functional spectra to train a separate Gaussian process emulator. Our method performs well in synthetic exercises and against the benchmark cosmological emulator (Cosmic Emu).</description>

      <title>Cosmic Rays Masquerading as Cool Cores: An Inverse-Compton Origin for Cool Core Cluster Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray bright cool-core (CC) clusters contain luminous radio sources accelerating cosmic ray (CR) leptons at prodigious rates. Near the acceleration region, high-energy leptons produce synchrotron (mini)halos and sometimes observable gamma rays, but these leptons have short lifetimes and so cannot propagate far from sources without some rejuvenation. However, low-energy (~0.1-1 GeV) CRs should survive for &gt;Gyr, potentially reaching ~100 kpc before losing energy via inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons to keV X-ray energies, with remarkably thermal X-ray spectra. In groups/clusters, this will appear similar to relatively 'cool' gas in cluster cores (i.e. CCs). In lower-mass (e.g. Milky Way/M31) halos, analogous CR IC emission will appear as hot (super-virial) gas at outer CGM radii, explaining recent diffuse X-ray observations. We show that for plausible (radio/gamma-ray observed) lepton injection rates, the CR-IC emission could contribute significantly to the X-ray surface brightness (SB) in CCs, implying that CC gas densities may have been overestimated and alleviating the cooling flow problem. A significant IC contribution to diffuse X-ray emission in CC clusters also explains the tight correlation between the X-ray 'cooling luminosity' and AGN/cavity/jet power, because the apparent CC emission is itself driven by the radio source. Comparing observed Sunyaev Zeldovich to X-ray inferred pressures at $\ll 100$ kpc in CCs represents a clean test of this scenario, and existing data appears to favor significant CR-IC. A significant IC contribution also implies that X-ray inferred gas-phase metallicities have been underestimated in CCs, potentially explaining the discrepancy between X-ray (sub-Solar) and optical/UV (super-Solar) observed metallicities in the central ~10 kpc of nearby CCs. We also discuss the model's connection to observations of multiphase gas in clusters.</description>

      <title>Return of the Lepton Number: Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter Production and the Revival of the Shi-Fuller Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore resonant production of sterile neutrino dark matter via the Shi-Fuller (SF) mechanism, revisiting its cosmological viability in light of recent results demonstrating that lepton-number asymmetries $L_\alpha \gtrsim 1$ at temperatures $T &gt; 20\rm\,MeV$ are consistent with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Using a quasi-classical Boltzmann transport calculation of the dark matter production, we compute the non-thermal phase space distributions of sterile neutrinos across a broad range of particle mass $m_s$ and mixing angle $\sin^2{(2\theta)}$ parameter space. We then evolve the resulting distributions through linear structure formation using CLASS and fit the resulting matter power spectra to thermal warm dark matter (WDM) transfer functions, enabling a direct mapping between SF models and equivalent thermal WDM particle masses $m_{\mathrm{th}}$. This allows us to reinterpret existing structure formation limits and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest preferences in the context of SF production. We find that lepton asymmetries $L \gtrsim 0.5$ at high temperatures open significant viable parameter space in the $m_s \gtrsim 10\,\mathrm{keV}$ and $\sin^2 (2\theta) \lesssim 10^{-14}$ regime, compatible with both X-ray constraints from NuSTAR and INTEGRAL/SPI and recent Lyman-$\alpha$ inferences of $m_{\mathrm{th}} \approx 4.1\,\mathrm{keV}$. Following lepton number evolution below 20 MeV, we also specifically show that this lepton asymmetry parameter space is compatible with BBN and cosmic microwave background constraints. We present updated constraints, a refined $m_{\mathrm{th}}$ fitting function, and power-law approximations for $L$ across the parameter space. Our results motivate future X-ray observations targeting the $\sim 20$ keV photon regime and testing of the $m_\mathrm{th} \gtrsim 10\,\mathrm{keV}$ WDM region.</description>

      <title>A New Framework to Detect Multi-Messenger Signals from Bright Sporadic Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The temporal dependence of the astrophysical stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background (SGWB) in the hecto-hertz band brings a unique avenue to identify multi-messenger signals to these sources by using coincident detection in both GW and multi-band EM signals. We developed a new analysis pipeline, \textit{Multi-messenger Cross-Correlation} (MC$^2$) that can search for EM counterparts to the SGWB signal originating from both modeled and unmodeled sources by harnessing the nearly full-sky gamma-ray sky map. We provide an observation strategy that can be followed by current and future missions to discover EM counterparts to the weak GW signal hidden in the SGWB. We demonstrate the ability of this technique to drastically reduce the false alarm rates when involving EM multi-band analysis. This formalism aims towards advancing the multi-messenger observation frontier and improving our understanding of the population of bright SGWB sources present in the high-redshift universe and can also be applied to other messengers such as neutrinos in the future.</description>

      <title>Reionization and the Hubble Constant: Correlations in the Cosmic Microwave Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has found early galaxies producing photons from more efficient ionization than previously assumed. This may suggest a reionization process with a larger reionization optical depth, $\tau_{\rm reio}$, in some mild disagreement with that inferred from measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB). Intriguingly, the CMB would prefer larger values of $\tau_{\rm reio}$, more consistent with the recent JWST hint, if the large-scale measurements (i.e. $\ell &lt;30$) of E-mode polarization are removed. In addition, $\tau_{\rm reio}$ has an indirect correlation with today's Hubble constant $H_0$ in $\Lambda$CDM. Motivated by these interesting observations, we investigate and reveal the underlying mechanism for this correlation, using the CMB dataset without the low-$\ell$ polarization data as a proxy for a potential cosmology with a larger $\tau_{\rm reio}$. We further explore how this correlation may impact the Hubble tension between early and late universe measurements of $H_0$, in $\Lambda$CDM as well as two proposals to alleviate the Hubble tension: the dark radiation (DR) and early dark energy (EDE) models. We find that the Hubble tension gets further reduced mildly for almost all cases due to the larger $\tau_{\rm reio}$ and its positive correlation with $H_0$, with either the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data before those from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) or the DESI data.</description>

      <title>J-PAS and PFS surveys in the era of dark energy and neutrino mass measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fisher-matrix forecasts are presented for the cosmological surveys of the Javalambre Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS) and the Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS). The wide, low-redshift coverage of J-PAS and the high-density, high-redshift mapping of PFS are strongly complementary: combining the two reduces marginalized uncertainties on all primary parameters compared with either survey individually. Adding the joint J-PAS+PFS data to next-generation CMB measurements from CMB-S4 and \textsc{LiteBird} yields an expected precision of $\sigma(\sum m_\nu)=0.017\,$eV in the $\Lambda$CDM$+\sum m_\nu+N_{\rm eff}$ framework, sufficient to disfavour the inverted neutrino hierarchy at $2.35\,\sigma$ if the true mass sum equals the normal-ordering minimum. Motivated by recent DESI results, we also forecast within a $w_0w_a$CDM$+\sum m_\nu+N_{\rm eff}$ cosmology, adopting the DESI\,DR2 best-fit values ($w_0=-0.758$, $w_a=-0.82$) as fiducial. The combination CMB+J-PAS+PFS then delivers $\sigma(w_0)=0.044$ and $\sigma(w_a)=0.18$, corresponding to a $5.1\,\sigma$ preference for a time-varying dark-energy equation of state. These findings show that J-PAS and PFS, especially when coupled with Stage-IV CMB observations, will provide competitive tests of neutrino physics and the dynamics of cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Robust {\mu}-distortion constraints on primordial supermassive black holes from cubic (gNL) non-Gaussian perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We make the first calculation of the spectral distortion constraints on the primordial curvature power spectrum in the limit of large cubic non-Gaussianity. This calculation involves computing a 2-loop integral, which we perform analytically. Despite being non-perturbatively non-Gaussian, we show that the constraints only change significantly from the case of Gaussian perturbations in the high-k tail, where spectral distortions become weak. We conclude that generating primordial supermassive black holes requires even more extreme forms of non-Gaussianity. We also argue why the mu-distortion constraint is unlikely to significantly change even in the presence of more extreme local non-Gaussianity.</description>

      <title>Cluster optical depth and pairwise velocity estimation using machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply two machine learning methods, a CNN deep-leaning model and a gradient-boosting decision tree, to estimate individual cluster optical depths from observed properties derived from multiple complementary datasets. The models are trained and tested with simulated N-body derived halo catalogs and synthetic full-sky CMB maps designed to mirror data from the DESI and Simons Observatory experiments. Specifically, the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) and CMB lensing convergence, along with cluster virial mass estimates are used as features to train the machine learning models. The predicted optical depths are combined with kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) measurements to estimate individual cluster radial peculiar velocities. The method is shown to recover an unbiased estimate of the pairwise velocity statistics of the simulated cluster sample. The model's efficacy is demonstrated for halos with mass range $10^{13} M_{\odot} &lt; M_{200} &lt; 10^{15} M_{\odot}$ over a redshift range $0&lt;z&lt;1$, and validated in the presence of primary CMB, instrument noise, lensing convergence noise, and potential uncertainties in halo virial mass estimates. We apply the method to ACT CMB data, using ACT DR4 component-separated maps for tSZ and CMB lensing and ACT DR5 maps for kSZ, in conjunction with galaxy clusters observed in the SDSS DR15 spectroscopic survey. We demonstrate that the machine learning approach is an effective one to analyze data from current and upcoming CMB experiments such as Simons Observatory and CCAT, and galaxy surveys, such as DESI and Roman, for which the pairwise velocity statistics can provide valuable insights into the properties of neutrinos and gravity on cosmic scales.</description>

      <title>Modelling Galaxy Clustering and Tomographic Galaxy-Galaxy Lensing with HSC Y3 and SDSS using the Point-Mass Correction Model and Redshift Self-Calibration</title>

Abstract: The combination of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing and galaxy clustering is a powerful probe of the cosmological model, and exploration of how to best model and extract this information from the signals is essential. We present the measurement of the galaxy-galaxy weak lensing signals using the SDSS DR11 spectroscopic galaxies as lens galaxies, and the HSC Y3 shear catalog as source galaxies, binned into four tomographic bins by their photometric redshift. The SDSS DR11 galaxies, with a redshift range $0.15&lt;z&lt;0.7$, are binned into three redshift bins, each as a probe for measuring the projected correlation function, $w_p(R_p)$. We measure the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal $\Delta \Sigma (R_p)$ in 12 lens-source bin pairs and show that there is no evidence for significant systematic biases in the measurement with null testing. We combine our $w_p(R_p)$ and $\Delta \Sigma (R_p)$ ($2\times2$pt) data vectors and perform likelihood inference with a flat $\Lambda$CDM model. For $\Delta \Sigma (R_p)$, we extend the lower limit of the scale cut compared to previous HSC Y3 analyses to $2 h^{-1}$Mpc by including a point-mass correction term in addition to the minimal bias model. We present various tests to validate our model and provide extended consistency tests. In the $\Lambda$CDM context, our fiducial model yields $S_8 = 0.804^{+0.051}_{-0.051}$. The $2\times2$pt data vector provides redshift parameter constraints for the third and fourth redshift bins $\Delta z_3 = -0.079^{+0.074}_{-0.084}$, and $\Delta z_4 = -0.203^{+0.167}_{-0.206}$, which is consistent with results from the previous tomographic cosmic shear studies, and serves as the foundation for a future $3\times 2$pt analysis.</description>

      <title>Cosmology and Source Redshift Constraints from Galaxy Clustering and Tomographic Weak Lensing with HSC Y3 and SDSS using the Point-Mass Correction Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The combination of galaxy clustering and weak lensing is a powerful probe of the cosmology model. We present a joint analysis of galaxy clustering and weak lensing cosmology using SDSS data as the tracer of dark matter (lens sample) and the HSC Y3 dataset as source galaxies. The analysis divides HSC Y3 galaxies into four tomographic bins for both galaxy-galaxy lensing and cosmic shear measurements, and employs a point-mass correction model to utilize galaxy-galaxy lensing signals down to 2$h^{-1}$Mpc, extending up to 70$h^{-1}$Mpc. These strategies enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the galaxy-galaxy lensing data vector. Using a flat $\Lambda$CDM model, we find $S_8 = 0.780^{+0.029}_{-0.030}$, and using a $w$CDM model, we obtain $S_8 = 0.756^{+0.038}_{-0.036}$ with $w = -1.176^{+0.310}_{-0.346}$. We apply uninformative priors on the redshift mean-shift parameters for the third and fourth tomographic bins. Leveraging the self-calibration power of tomographic weak lensing, we measure $\Delta z_3 = -0.112^{+0.046}_{-0.049}$ and $\Delta z_4 = -0.185^{+0.071}_{-0.081}$, in agreement with previous HSC Y3 results. This demonstrates that weak lensing self-calibration can achieve redshift constraints comparable to other methods such as photometric and clustering redshift calibration.</description>

      <title>CLASS_SZ II: Notes and Examples of Fast and Accurate Calculations of Halo Model, Large Scale Structure and Cosmic Microwave Background Observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07346v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These notes are very much work-in-progress and simply intended to showcase, in various degrees of details (and rigour), some of the cosmology calculations that class_sz can do. We describe the class_sz code in C, Python and Jax. Based on the Boltzmann code class, it can compute a wide range of observables relevant to current and forthcoming CMB and Large Scale Structure surveys. This includes galaxy shear and clustering, CMB lensing, thermal and kinetic Sunyaev and Zeldovich observables, Cosmic Infrared Background, cross-correlations and three-point statistics. Calculations can be done either within the halo model or the linear bias model. For standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and extensions, class_sz uses high-accuracy cosmopower emulators of the CMB and matter power spectrum to accelerate calculations. With this, along with efficient numerical integration routines, most class_sz output can be obtained in less than 500 ms (CMB $C_\ell$'s or matter $P(k)$ take $\mathcal{O}(1\mathrm{ms})$), allowing for fast or ultra-fast parameter inference analyses. Parts of the calculations are "jaxified", so the software can be integrated into differentiable pipelines.</description>

      <title>Exploring Direct Detection of Massive Particles Using Wave Propagation from Gravitational Coupling with a Wire Under Tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of detecting galactic orbit dark matter passing through Earth by measuring its gravitational coupling with a wire under tension. We do so by exploring the transverse and longitudinal waves induced on the wire to detect a massive particle passing within $\sim 1$ m of the wire. The particle's $r^{-2}$ interaction with the wire provides an initial momentum which develops into a propagating wave carrying a distinctive time dependent displacement. Most interestingly, we find that both transverse and longitudinal waves develop with unique profiles, allowing for a full, three dimensional reconstruction of the particle's trajectory and its mass over velocity ratio. We find that, at interaction distances of 0.1 to 100 mm with a 90 micron diameter copper beryllium wire, Planck scale dark matter with mass $\sim 10^{19}$ GeV/$c^2$ would create immeasurable displacements on the scale of $10^{-24}$ to $10^{-26}$ m. In order to create displacements detectable by modern, commercially available, displacement sensors on the nanometer scale we require dark matter with a particle mass greater than $4 \times 10^7$ kg ($\sim 2 \times 10^{32}$ GeV/$c^2$). This is outside the upper limit of the Planck scale by 13 orders of magnitude and would also have such a low particle flux that a detection event would be implausible. Finally, we perform a similar analysis for a charged wire and an elementary charged particle with their electrostatic interaction, finding that a sufficiently slow charged particle would produce a transverse displacement comparable to the sensitivity of currently available sensors.</description>

      <title>Optimising the sample selection for photometric galaxy surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining cosmological parameters with high precision, as well as resolving current tensions in their values derived from low and high redshift probes, is one of the main objectives of the new generation of cosmological surveys. The combination of complementary probes in terms of parameter degeneracies and systematics is key to achieving these ambitious scientific goals. In this context, determining the optimal survey configuration for an analysis that combines galaxy clustering, weak lensing, and galaxy-galaxy lensing, the so-called 3x2pt analysis, remains an open problem. In this paper, we present an efficient and flexible end-to-end pipeline to optimise the sample selection for 3x2pt analyses in an automated way. Our pipeline is articulated in two main steps: we first consider a self-organising map to determine the photometric redshifts of a simulated galaxy sample. As a proof of method for stage-IV surveys, we use samples from the DESC Data Challenge 2 catalogue. This allows us to classify galaxies into tomographic bins based on their colour phenotype clustering. We then explore different redshift-bin edge configurations for weak lensing only as well as 3x2pt analyses in a novel way. Our method explores multiple configurations of perturbed redshift-bin edges with respect to the fiducial case in an iterative manner. In particular, we sample tomographic configurations for the source and lens galaxies separately. We show that, using this method we quickly converge into an optimised configuration for different numbers of redshift bins and cosmologies. Our analysis demonstrates that for stage-IV surveys an optimal tomographic sample selection can increase the figure of merit of the dark energy (DE) equation of state by a factor of $\sim$2, comparable to an effective increase in survey area of $\sim$4 for non-optimal photometric survey analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00939v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) spectrum from the first-order phase transition can be characterized by a few phenomenological parameters but with high degeneracies in model/data distinguishments. In this paper, we look into the high-frequency power law of the GW spectrum with preliminary numerical simulations for both quantum and semiclassical pictures of vacuum decay. We first reveal an anticorrelation of the high-frequency power law to a certain power of the ratio between the wall thickness and bubble radius at the onset of bubble collisions, which can be further approximated analytically by some other phenomenological model characteristics to break the model degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers (RAIL): Rubin-era photometric redshift stress-testing and at-scale production</title>

Abstract: Virtually all extragalactic use cases of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) require the use of galaxy redshift information, yet the vast majority of its sample of tens of billions of galaxies will lack high-fidelity spectroscopic measurements thereof, instead relying on photometric redshifts (photo-$z$) subject to systematic imprecision and inaccuracy best encapsulated by photo-$z$ probability density functions (PDFs). We present the version 1 release of Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers (RAIL), an open source Python library for at-scale probabilistic photo-$z$ estimation, initiated by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) with contributions from the LSST Interdisciplinary Network for Collaboration and Computing (LINCC) Frameworks team. RAIL's three subpackages provide modular tools for end-to-end stress-testing, including a forward modeling suite to generate realistically complex photometry, a unified API for estimating per-galaxy and ensemble redshift PDFs by an extensible set of algorithms, and built-in metrics of both photo-$z$ PDFs and point estimates. RAIL serves as a flexible toolkit enabling the derivation and optimization of photo-$z$ data products at scale for a variety of science goals and is not specific to LSST data. We thus describe to the extragalactic science community, including and beyond Rubin the design and functionality of the RAIL software library so that any researcher may have access to its wide array of photo-$z$ characterization and assessment tools.</description>

      <title>Asymgenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework based on the standard type-I seesaw model that relates the baryon asymmetry of the universe to the dark matter (DM) density. The framework, which we name "Asymgenesis", relies on the presence of primordial charge asymmetries seeded either in the dark sector or in the visible sector. A higher-dimensional portal operator reshuffles this initial asymmetry into both sectors, eventually resulting in a nonzero $B-L$ asymmetry and an asymmetric DM component. Compared to conventional asymmetric-dark-matter (ADM) schemes, our framework imposes far milder requirements on the portal interaction. In particular, the portal interaction need not violate $B-L$, and the temperature scales of efficient $B-L$ violation and efficient charge-transfer interaction mediated by the portal operator can be separated. We develop the formalism in detail and argue that the flexibility of our framework enlarges the model-building landscape for ADM.</description>

      <title>A Metal-Free Galaxy at $z = 3.19$? Evidence of Late Population III Star Formation at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Star formation from metal-free gas, the hallmark of the first generation of Population III stars, was long assumed to occur in the very early Universe. We report the discovery of MPG-CR3 (Metal-Pristine Galaxy COSMOS Redshift 3; hereafter CR3), an extremely metal-poor galaxy at redshift $z= 3.193\pm0.016$. From JWST, VLT, and Subaru observations, CR3 exhibits exceptionally strong Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$, and He I $\lambda$10830 emission. We measure rest-frame equivalent widths of EW$_0$(Ly$\alpha$) $\approx822$ Angstrom and EW$_0$(H$\alpha$) $\approx2814$ Angstrom, among the highest seen in star-forming systems. No metal lines, e.g. [O III] $\lambda\lambda4959,5007$, C IV $\lambda\lambda1548,1550$, have statistically significant detections, placing a 2-$\sigma$ abundance upper limit of 12+log(O/H) &lt; 6.52 ($Z &lt; 8\times10^{-3}\ Z_\odot$). The observed Ly$\alpha$/H$\alpha$ flux ratio is $\approx13.9$, indicating negligible dust attenuation. Spectral energy distribution modeling with Pop III stellar templates indicates a very young ($\sim2$ Myr), low-mass ($M_* \approx 6.1\times 10^5 M_\odot$) stellar population. Further, the photometric redshifts reveal that CR3 could reside in a slightly underdense environment ($\delta \approx -0.12$). CR3 provides evidence that first-generation star formation could persist well after the epoch of reionization, challenging the conventional view that pristine star formation ended by $z\gtrsim6$.</description>
