      <title>Potential Indicator for Continuous Emotion Arousal by Dynamic Neural Synchrony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The need for automatic and high-quality emotion annotation is paramount in applications such as continuous emotion recognition and video highlight detection, yet achieving this through manual human annotations is challenging. Inspired by inter-subject correlation (ISC) utilized in neuroscience, this study introduces a novel Electroencephalography (EEG) based ISC methodology that leverages a single-electrode and feature-based dynamic approach. Our contributions are three folds. Firstly, we reidentify two potent emotion features suitable for classifying emotions-first-order difference (FD) an differential entropy (DE). Secondly, through the use of overall correlation analysis, we demonstrate the heterogeneous synchronized performance of electrodes. This performance aligns with neural emotion patterns established in prior studies, thus validating the effectiveness of our approach. Thirdly, by employing a sliding window correlation technique, we showcase the significant consistency of dynamic ISCs across various features or key electrodes in each analyzed film clip. Our findings indicate the method's reliability in capturing consistent, dynamic shared neural synchrony among individuals, triggered by evocative film stimuli. This underscores the potential of our approach to serve as an indicator of continuous human emotion arousal. The implications of this research are significant for advancements in affective computing and the broader neuroscience field, suggesting a streamlined and effective tool for emotion analysis in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Continuous Boostlet Transform and Associated Uncertainty Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Continuous Boostlet Transform (CBT) is introduced as a powerful tool for analyzing spatiotemporal signals, particularly acoustic wavefields. Overcoming the limitations of classical wavelets, the CBT leverages the Poincar\'e group and isotropic dilations to capture sparse features of natural acoustic fields. This paper presents the mathematical framework of the CBT, including its definition, fundamental properties, and associated uncertainty principles, such as Heisenberg's, logarithmic, Pitt's, and Nazarov's inequalities. These results illuminate the trade-offs between time and frequency localization in the boostlet domain. Practical examples with constant and exponential functions highlight the CBT's adaptability. With applications in radar, communications, audio processing, and seismic analysis, the CBT offers flexible time-frequency resolution, making it ideal for non-stationary and transient signals, and a valuable tool for modern signal processing.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Deep Learning for Real-Time Neuroimaging-Based Assessment of Bimanual Motor Skills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The real-time assessment of complex motor skills presents a challenge in fields such as surgical training and rehabilitation. Recent advancements in neuroimaging, particularly functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), have enabled objective assessment of such skills with high accuracy. However, these techniques are hindered by extensive preprocessing requirements to extract neural biomarkers. This study presents a novel end-to-end deep learning framework that processes raw fNIRS signals directly, eliminating the need for intermediate preprocessing steps. The model was evaluated on datasets from three distinct bimanual motor tasks--suturing, pattern cutting, and endotracheal intubation (ETI)--using performance metrics derived from both training and retention datasets. It achieved a mean classification accuracy of 93.9% (SD 4.4) and a generalization accuracy of 92.6% (SD 1.9) on unseen skill retention datasets, with a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation yielding an accuracy of 94.1% (SD 3.6). Contralateral prefrontal cortex activations exhibited task-specific discriminative power, while motor cortex activations consistently contributed to accurate classification. The model also demonstrated resilience to neurovascular coupling saturation caused by extended task sessions, maintaining robust performance across trials. Comparative analysis confirms that the end-to-end model performs on par with or surpasses baseline models optimized for fully processed fNIRS data, with statistically similar (p&lt;0.05) or improved prediction accuracies. By eliminating the need for extensive signal preprocessing, this work provides a foundation for real-time, non-invasive assessment of bimanual motor skills in medical training environments, with potential applications in robotics, rehabilitation, and sports.</description>

      <title>Robust Blind Channel Estimation for Bursty Impulsive Noise with a Constrained EM Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impulsive noise (IN) commonly generated by power devices can severely degrade the performance of high sensitivity wireless receivers. Accurate channel state information (CSI) knowledge is essential for designing optimal maximum a posteriori detectors. This paper examines blind channel estimation methods based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm tailored for scenarios impacted by bursty IN, which can be described by the Markov-Middleton model. We propose a constrained EM algorithm that exploits the trellis structure of the IN model and the transmitted binary phase shift keying (BPSK) symbols. By enforcing shared variance among specific trellis states and symmetry in the transition matrix, the proposed constrained EM algorithm adapted for the bursty IN channel has an almost two times faster convergence rate and better estimation performance than the standard EM approach. We comprehensively evaluate the robustness of both standard and constrained EM estimators under different types of CSI uncertainties. The results indicate that the final estimations of both EM estimators are robust enough to mismatch Markov-Middleton model parameters. However, as the level of CSI uncertainty increases, the convergence rate decreases.</description>

      <title>Process Optimization and Deployment for Sensor-Based Human Activity Recognition Based on Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensor-based human activity recognition is a key technology for many human-centered intelligent applications. However, this research is still in its infancy and faces many unresolved challenges. To address these, we propose a comprehensive optimization process approach centered on multi-attention interaction. We first utilize unsupervised statistical feature-guided diffusion models for highly adaptive data enhancement, and introduce a novel network architecture-Multi-branch Spatiotemporal Interaction Network, which uses multi-branch features at different levels to effectively Sequential ), which uses multi-branch features at different levels to effectively Sequential spatio-temporal interaction to enhance the ability to mine advanced latent features. In addition, we adopt a multi-loss function fusion strategy in the training phase to dynamically adjust the fusion weights between batches to optimize the training results. Finally, we also conducted actual deployment on embedded devices to extensively test the practical feasibility of the proposed method in existing work. We conduct extensive testing on three public datasets, including ablation studies, comparisons of related work, and embedded deployments.</description>

      <title>An optimal baseline selection methodology for data-driven damage detection and temperature compensation in acousto-ultrasonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global trends in the construction of modern structures require the integration of sensors together with data recording and analysis modules so that their integrity can be continuously monitored for safe-life, economic and ecological reasons. This process of measuring and analyzing the data from a distributed sensor network all over a structural system in order to quantify its condition is known as structural health monitoring (SHM). Guided ultrasonic wave-based techniques are increasingly being adapted and used in several SHM systems which benefit from built-in transduction, large inspection ranges, and high sensitivity to small flaws. Nonetheless, for the design of a trustworthy health monitoring system, a vast amount of information regarding the inherent physical characteristics of the sources and their propagation and interaction across the structure is crucial. Moreover, any SHM system which is expected to transition to field operation must take into account the influence of environmental and operational changes which cause modifications in the stiffness and damping of the structure and consequently modify its dynamic behaviour. On that account, special attention is paid in this paper to the development of an efficient SHM methodology where robust signal processing and pattern recognition techniques are integrated for the correct interpretation of complex ultrasonic waves within the context of damage detection and identification. The methodology is based on an acousto-ultrasonics technique where the discrete wavelet transform is evaluated for feature extraction and selection, linear principal component analysis for data-driven modelling and selforganizing maps for a two-level clustering under the principle of local density. At the end, the methodology is experimentally demonstrated and results show that all the damages were detectable and identifiable.</description>

      <title>Are Anxiety Detection Models Generalizable? A Cross-Activity and Cross-Population Study Using Wearables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anxiety-provoking activities, such as public speaking, can trigger heightened anxiety responses in individuals with anxiety disorders. Recent research suggests that physiological signals, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and electrodermal activity (EDA), collected via wearable devices, can be used to detect anxiety in such contexts through machine learning models. However, the generalizability of these anxiety prediction models across different activities and diverse populations remains underexplored-an essential step for assessing model bias and fostering user trust in broader applications. To address this gap, we conducted a study with 111 participants who engaged in three anxiety-provoking activities. Utilizing both our collected dataset and two well-known publicly available datasets, we evaluated the generalizability of anxiety detection models within participants (for both same-activity and cross-activity scenarios) and across participants (within-activity and cross-activity). In total, we trained and tested more than 3348 anxiety detection models (using six classifiers, 31 feature sets, and 18 train-test configurations). Our results indicate that three key metrics-AUROC, recall for anxious states, and recall for non-anxious states-were slightly above the baseline score of 0.5. The best AUROC scores ranged from 0.62 to 0.73, with recall for the anxious class spanning 35.19% to 74.3%. Interestingly, model performance (as measured by AUROC) remained relatively stable across different activities and participant groups, though recall for the anxious class did exhibit some variation.</description>

      <title>Chemistry-aware battery degradation prediction under simulated real-world cyclic protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Battery degradation is governed by complex and randomized cyclic conditions, yet existing modeling and prediction frameworks usually rely on rigid, unchanging protocols that fail to capture real-world dynamics. The stochastic electrical signals make such prediction extremely challenging, while, on the other hand, they provide abundant additional information, such as voltage fluctuations, which may probe the degradation mechanisms. Here, we present chemistry-aware battery degradation prediction under dynamic conditions with machine learning, which integrates hidden Markov processes for realistic power simulations, an automated batch-testing system that generates a large electrochemical dataset under randomized conditions, an interfacial chemistry database derived from high-throughput X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for mechanistic probing, and a machine learning model for prediction. By automatically constructing a polynomial-scale feature space from irregular electrochemical curves, our model accurately predicts both battery life and critical knee points. This feature space also predicts the composition of the solid electrolyte interphase, revealing six distinct failure mechanisms-demonstrating a viable approach to use electrical signals to infer interfacial chemistry. This work establishes a scalable and adaptive framework for integrating chemical engineering and data science to advance noninvasive diagnostics and optimize processes for more durable and sustainable energy storage technologies.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Attention Network for Interpretable ECG-based Heart Disease Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiovascular disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, underscoring the need for accurate as well as interpretable diagnostic machine learning tools. In this work, we investigate heart disease classification using electrocardiogram (ECG) data from two widely-utilized datasets: The MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and the PTB-XL datasets. We adapt a hierarchical attention network (HAN), originally developed for text classification, into an ECG-based heart-disease classification task. Our adapted HAN incorporates two attention layers that focus on ECG data segments of varying sizes. We conduct a comparative analysis between our adapted HAN and a more sophisticated state-of-the-art architecture, featuring a network with convolution, attention, and transformer layers (CAT-Net). Our empirical evaluation encompasses multiple aspects including test accuracy (quantified by 0-1 loss); model complexity (measured by the number of model parameters); and interpretability (through attention map visualization). Our adapted HAN demonstrates comparable test accuracy with significant reductions in model complexity and enhanced interpretability analysis: For the MIT-BIH dataset, our adapted HAN achieves 98.55\% test accuracy compared to 99.14\% for CAT-Net, while reducing the number of model parameters by a factor of 15.6. For the PTB-XL dataset, our adapted HAN achieves a 19.3-fold reduction in model complexity compared to CAT-Net, with only a 5\% lower test accuracy. From an interpretability perspective, the significantly simpler architecture and the hierarchical nature of our adapted HAN model facilitate a more straightforward interpretability analysis based on visualizing attention weights. Building on this advantage, we conduct an interpretability analysis of our HAN that highlights the regions of the ECG signal most relevant to the model's decisions.</description>

      <title>A multi-scale lithium-ion battery capacity prediction using mixture of experts and patch-based MLP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium-ion battery health management has become increasingly important as the application of batteries expands. Precise forecasting of capacity degradation is critical for ensuring the healthy usage of batteries. In this paper, we innovatively propose MSPMLP, a multi-scale capacity prediction model utilizing the mixture of experts (MoE) architecture and patch-based multi-layer perceptron (MLP) blocks, to capture both the long-term degradation trend and local capacity regeneration phenomena. Specifically, we utilize patch-based MLP blocks with varying patch sizes to extract multi-scale features from the capacity sequence. Leveraging the MoE architecture, the model adaptively integrates the extracted features, thereby enhancing its capacity and expressiveness. Finally, the future battery capacity is predicted based on the integrated features, achieving high prediction accuracy and generalization. Experimental results on the public NASA dataset indicate that MSPMLP achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0078, improving by 41.8\% compared to existing methods. These findings highlight that MSPMLP, owing to its multi-scale modeling capability and generalizability, provides a promising solution to the battery capacity prediction challenges caused by capacity regeneration phenomena and complex usage conditions.

      <title>Towards Practical Emotion Recognition: An Unsupervised Source-Free Approach for EEG Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotion recognition is crucial for advancing mental health, healthcare, and technologies like brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, EEG-based emotion recognition models face challenges in cross-domain applications due to the high cost of labeled data and variations in EEG signals from individual differences and recording conditions. Unsupervised domain adaptation methods typically require access to source domain data, which may not always be feasible in real-world scenarios due to privacy and computational constraints. Source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SF-UDA) has recently emerged as a solution, enabling target domain adaptation without source data, but its application in emotion recognition remains unexplored. We propose a novel SF-UDA approach for EEG-based emotion classification across domains, introducing a multi-stage framework that enhances model adaptability without requiring source data. Our approach incorporates Dual-Loss Adaptive Regularization (DLAR) to minimize prediction discrepancies on confident samples and align predictions with expected pseudo-labels. Additionally, we introduce Localized Consistency Learning (LCL), which enforces local consistency by promoting similar predictions from reliable neighbors. These techniques together address domain shift and reduce the impact of noisy pseudo-labels, a key challenge in traditional SF-UDA models. Experiments on two widely used datasets, DEAP and SEED, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 65.84% accuracy when trained on DEAP and tested on SEED, and 58.99% accuracy in the reverse scenario. It excels at detecting both positive and negative emotions, making it well-suited for practical emotion recognition applications.</description>

      <title>Graph Transformer-Based Flood Susceptibility Mapping: Application to the French Riviera and Railway Infrastructure Under Climate Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing flood frequency and severity due to climate change threatens infrastructure and demands improved susceptibility mapping techniques. While traditional machine learning (ML) approaches are widely used, they struggle to capture spatial dependencies and poor boundary delineation between susceptibility classes. This study introduces the first application of a graph transformer (GT) architecture for flood susceptibility mapping to the flood-prone French Riviera (e.g., 2020 Storm Alex) using topography, hydrology, geography, and environmental data. GT incorporates watershed topology using Laplacian positional encoders (PEs) and attention mechanisms. The developed GT model has an AUC-ROC (0.9739), slightly lower than XGBoost (0.9853). However, the GT model demonstrated better clustering and delineation with a higher Moran's I value (0.6119) compared to the random forest (0.5775) and XGBoost (0.5311) with p-value lower than 0.0001. Feature importance revealed a striking consistency across models, with elevation, slope, distance to channel, and convergence index being the critical factors. Dimensionality reduction on Laplacian PEs revealed partial clusters, indicating they could capture spatial information; however, their importance was lower than flood factors. Since climate and land use changes aggravate flood risk, susceptibility maps are developed for the 2050 year under different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and railway track vulnerability is assessed. All RCP scenarios revealed increased area across susceptibility classes, except for the very low category. RCP 8.5 projections indicate that 17.46% of the watershed area and 54% of railway length fall within very-high susceptible zones, compared to 6.19% and 35.61%, respectively, under current conditions. The developed maps can be integrated into a multi-hazard framework.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) offers significant diagnostic potential but is inherently constrained by low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While increasing the main magnetic field strength B_0 is theoretically linked to increased SNR, practically obtained gains in SNR from B07/4 to B0 depending on the domination of thermal noise at high B0, are not always realized. Especially in clinical settings the maximum reachable SNR is further constrained by the total available acquisition time (TA) and the regulatory limits on maximum tolerable specific absorption rate (SAR). This work attempts to derive mathematical expressions that enable systematical analysis of the theoretical achievable SNR-gain. One important notion is this context is the SNR gain per unit of measurement time as a function of the main magnetic field B0 strengths in the case of single voxel spectroscopy (SVS) pulse sequences. Our findings indicate that under given fixed total amount of (patient acceptable) measurement time TA, and maximum tolerable SAR limitation, together with conditions that ensure the adiabaticity of specific sequences, further increasing B0 does not further improve SNR per unit of measurement time. Key factors were identified, including RF-pulse bandwidth scaling with B0 and longitudinal relaxation time (T1) dependencies, impact the net gain as well. Our theoretical analysis emphasizes critical considerations for optimizing SNR per unit time in clinical MRS, even challenging the presumption that higher magnetic fields B0 always yield improved SNR per time unit of measurement time performance.</description>

      <title>EEG2GAIT: A Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Network for EEG-based Gait Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding gait dynamics from EEG signals presents significant challenges due to the complex spatial dependencies of motor processes, the need for accurate temporal and spectral feature extraction, and the scarcity of high-quality gait EEG datasets. To address these issues, we propose EEG2GAIT, a novel hierarchical graph-based model that captures multi-level spatial embeddings of EEG channels using a Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) Pyramid. To further improve decoding accuracy, we introduce a Hybrid Temporal-Spectral Reward (HTSR) loss function, which combines time-domain, frequency-domain, and reward-based loss components. Moreover, we contribute a new Gait-EEG Dataset (GED), consisting of synchronized EEG and lower-limb joint angle data collected from 50 participants over two lab visits. Validation experiments on both the GED and the publicly available Mobile Brain-body imaging (MoBI) dataset demonstrate that EEG2GAIT outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves the best joint angle prediction. Ablation studies validate the contributions of the hierarchical GCN modules and HTSR Loss, while saliency maps reveal the significance of motor-related brain regions in decoding tasks. These findings underscore EEG2GAIT's potential for advancing brain-computer interface applications, particularly in lower-limb rehabilitation and assistive technologies.</description>

Abstract: A new benchmark dataset for functional data analysis (FDA) is presented, focusing on the reconstruction of eye movements from EEG data. The contribution is twofold: first, open challenges and evaluation metrics tailored to FDA applications are proposed.

      <title>Augmentation of EEG and ECG Time Series for Deep Learning Applications: Integrating Changepoint Detection into the iAAFT Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of deep learning methods critically depends on the quality and quantity of the available training data. This is especially the case for physiological time series, which are both noisy and scarce, which calls for data augmentation to artificially increase the size of datasets. Another issue is that the time-evolving statistical properties of nonstationary signals prevent the use of standard data augmentation techniques. To this end, we introduce a novel method for augmenting nonstationary time series. This is achieved by combining offline changepoint detection with the iterative amplitude-adjusted Fourier transform (iAAFT), which ensures that the time-frequency properties of the original signal are preserved during augmentation. The proposed method is validated through comparisons of the performance of i) a deep learning seizure detection algorithm on both the original and augmented versions of the CHB-MIT and Siena scalp electroencephalography (EEG) databases, and ii) a deep learning atrial fibrillation (AF) detection algorithm on the original and augmented versions of the Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017 dataset. By virtue of the proposed method, for the CHB-MIT and Siena datasets respectively, accuracy rose by 4.4% and 1.9%, precision by 10% and 5.5%, recall by 3.6% and 0.9%, and F1 by 4.2% and 1.4%. For the AF classification task, accuracy rose by 0.3%, precision by 2.1%, recall by 0.8%, and F1 by 2.1%.</description>

      <title>Decoding Covert Speech from EEG Using a Functional Areas Spatio-Temporal Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covert speech involves imagining speaking without audible sound or any movements. Decoding covert speech from electroencephalogram (EEG) is challenging due to a limited understanding of neural pronunciation mapping and the low signal-to-noise ratio of the signal. In this study, we developed a large-scale multi-utterance speech EEG dataset from 57 right-handed native English-speaking subjects, each performing covert and overt speech tasks by repeating the same word in five utterances within a ten-second duration. Given the spatio-temporal nature of the neural activation process during speech pronunciation, we developed a Functional Areas Spatio-temporal Transformer (FAST), an effective framework for converting EEG signals into tokens and utilizing transformer architecture for sequence encoding. Our results reveal distinct and interpretable speech neural features by the visualization of FAST-generated activation maps across frontal and temporal brain regions with each word being covertly spoken, providing new insights into the discriminative features of the neural representation of covert speech. This is the first report of such a study, which provides interpretable evidence for speech decoding from EEG.

      <title>Optimal Sensor Placement Using Combinations of Hybrid Measurements for Source Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on static source localization employing different combinations of measurements, including time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA), received-signal-strength (RSS), angle-of-arrival (AOA), and time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements. Since sensor-source geometry significantly impacts localization accuracy, the strategies of optimal sensor placement are proposed systematically using combinations of hybrid measurements. Firstly, the relationship between sensor placement and source estimation accuracy is formulated by a derived Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Secondly, the A-optimality criterion, i.e., minimizing the trace of the CRB, is selected to calculate the smallest reachable estimation mean-squared-error (MSE) in a unified manner. Thirdly, the optimal sensor placement strategies are developed to achieve the optimal estimation bound. Specifically, the specific constraints of the optimal geometries deduced by specific measurement, i.e., TDOA, AOA, RSS, and TOA, are found and discussed theoretically. Finally, the new findings are verified by simulation studies.</description>

      <title>Low-cost Embedded Breathing Rate Determination Using 802.15.4z IR-UWB Hardware for Remote Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Respiratory diseases account for a significant portion of global mortality. Affordable and early detection is an effective way of addressing these ailments. To this end, a low-cost commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), IEEE 802.15.4z standard compliant impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar system is exploited to estimate human respiration rates. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict breathing rates from ultra-wideband (UWB) channel impulse response (CIR) data, and compare its performance with other rule-based algorithms. The study uses a diverse dataset of 16 individuals, incorporating various real-life environments to evaluate system robustness. Results show that the CNN achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.73 breaths per minute (BPM) in unseen situations, significantly outperforming rule-based methods (3.40 BPM). By incorporating calibration data from other individuals in the unseen situations, the error is further reduced to 0.84 BPM. In addition, this work evaluates the feasibility of running the pipeline on a low-cost embedded device. Applying 8-bit quantization to both the weights and input/ouput tensors, reduces memory requirements by 67% and inference time by 64% with only a 3% increase in MAE. As a result, we show it is feasible to deploy the algorithm on an nRF52840 system-on-chip (SoC) requiring only 46 KB of memory and operating with an inference time of only 192 ms. Once deployed, the system can last up to 268 days without recharging using a 20 000 mAh battery pack. For breathing monitoring in bed, the sampling rate can be lowered, extending battery life to 313 days, making the solution highly efficient for real-world, low-cost deployments.</description>

      <title>Advancing Air Quality Monitoring: TinyML-Based Real-Time Ozone Prediction with Cost-Effective Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escalation of urban air pollution necessitates innovative solutions for real-time air quality monitoring and prediction. This paper introduces a novel TinyML-based system designed to predict ozone concentration in real-time. The system employs an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense microcontroller equipped with an MQ7 sensor for carbon monoxide (CO) detection and built-in sensors for temperature and pressure measurements. The data, sourced from a Kaggle dataset on air quality parameters from India, underwent thorough cleaning and preprocessing. Model training and evaluation were performed using Edge Impulse, considering various combinations of input parameters (CO, temperature, and pressure). The optimal model, incorporating all three variables, achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.03 and an R-squared value of 0.95, indicating high predictive accuracy. The regression model was deployed on the microcontroller via the Arduino IDE, showcasing robust real-time performance. Sensitivity analysis identified CO levels as the most critical predictor of ozone concentration, followed by pressure and temperature. The system's low-cost and low-power design makes it suitable for widespread implementation, particularly in resource-constrained settings. This TinyML approach provides precise real-time predictions of ozone levels, enabling prompt responses to pollution events and enhancing public health protection.</description>

      <title>Detecting Plant VOC Traces Using Indoor Air Quality Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of growing interest in healthy buildings and smart homes, the importance of sustainable, health conscious indoor environments is paramount. Smart tools, especially VOC sensors, are crucial for monitoring indoor air quality, yet interpreting signals from various VOC sources remains challenging. A promising approach involves understanding how indoor plants respond to environmental conditions. Plants produce terpenes, a type of VOC, when exposed to abiotic and biotic stressors - including pathogens, predators, light, and temperature - offering a novel pathway for monitoring indoor air quality. While prior work often relies on specialized laboratory sensors, our research leverages readily available commercial sensors to detect and classify plant emitted VOCs that signify changes in indoor conditions. We quantified the sensitivity of these sensors by measuring 16 terpenes in controlled experiments, then identified and tested the most promising terpenes in realistic environments. We also examined physics based models to map VOC responses but found them lacking for real world complexity. Consequently, we trained machine learning models to classify terpenes using commercial sensors and identified optimal sensor placement. To validate this approach, we analyzed emissions from a living basil plant, successfully detecting terpene output. Our findings establish a foundation for overcoming challenges in plant VOC detection, paving the way for advanced plant based sensors to enhance indoor environmental quality in future smart buildings.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the application of novel model architectures and large-scale foundational models in temporal series analysis of lower limb rehabilitation motion data, aiming to leverage advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence to empower active rehabilitation guidance strategies for post-stroke patients in limb motor function recovery.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the implementation of four FPGA-accelerated convolutional neural network (CNN) models for onboard cloud detection in resource-constrained CubeSat missions, leveraging Xilinx's Vitis AI (VAI) framework and Deep Learning Processing Unit (DPU), a programmable engine with pre-implemented, parameterizable IP cores optimized for deep neural networks, on a Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC. This study explores both pixel-wise (Pixel-Net and Patch-Net) and image-wise (U-Net and Scene-Net) models to benchmark trade-offs in accuracy, latency, and model complexity. Applying channel pruning, we achieved substantial reductions in model parameters (up to 98.6%) and floating-point operations (up to 90.7%) with minimal accuracy loss. Furthermore, the VAI tool was used to quantize the models to 8-bit precision, ensuring optimized hardware performance with negligible impact on accuracy. All models retained high accuracy post-FPGA integration, with a cumulative maximum accuracy drop of only 0.6% after quantization and pruning. The image-wise Scene-Net and U-Net models demonstrated strong real-time inference capabilities, achieving frame rates per second of 57.14 and 37.45, respectively, with power consumption of around 2.5 W, surpassing state-of-the-art onboard cloud detection solutions. Our approach underscores the potential of DPU-based hardware accelerators to expand the processing capabilities of small satellites, enabling efficient and flexible onboard CNN-based applications.</description>

      <title>On Symbol Error Probability-based Beamforming in MIMO Gaussian Wiretap Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates beamforming schemes designed to minimize the symbol error probability (SEP) for an authorized user while guaranteeing that the likelihood of an eavesdropper correctly recovering symbols remains below a predefined threshold. Unlike previous works that focus on maximizing secrecy capacity, our work is centered around finding an optimal beamforming vector for binary antipodal signal detection in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Gaussian wiretap channels. Finding the optimal beamforming vector in this setting is challenging. Computationally efficient algorithms such as convex techniques cannot be applied to find the optimal solution. To that end, our proposed algorithm relies on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and a generalized eigen-decomposition method to find the exact solution. In addition, we also develop an approximate, practical algorithm to find a good beamforming matrix when using M-ary detection schemes. Numerical results are presented to assess the performance of the proposed methods across various scenarios.</description>

      <title>FMCW Radar Interference Mitigation based on the Fractional Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel method for frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar mutual interference mitigation based on the discrete fractional Fourier transform (DFrFT). Interference chirps are detected and mitigated by compression and zeroing in the fractional domain. We provide an efficient implementation that can deal with multiple interferers, where we perform consecutive DFrFTs utilizing its angle-additivity property. For that purpose, we generalize and reduce the computational complexity of the multi-angle centered discrete fractional Fourier transform [1]. Our algorithm is designed to be simple and fast such that it can be implemented in hardware. We evaluate our algorithm on a synthetic I/Q-modulated dataset and outperform reference methods in terms of the mean squared error, signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, error vector magnitude, true positive rate, false alarm rate and F1-score.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Machine learning- and deep learning-based models have recently been employed in motor imagery intention classification from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Nevertheless, there is a limited understanding of feature selection to assist in identifying the most significant features in different spatial locations. Methods: This study proposes a feature selection technique using sequential forward feature selection with support vector machines and feeding the selected features to deep neural networks to classify motor imagery intention using multi-channel EEG. Results: The proposed model was evaluated with a publicly available dataset and achieved an average accuracy of 79.70 percent with a standard deviation of 7.98 percent for classifying two motor imagery scenarios. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that our method effectively identifies the most informative and discriminative characteristics of neural activity at different spatial locations, offering potential for future prosthetics and brain-computer interface applications. Significance: This approach enhances model performance while identifying key spatial EEG features, advancing brain-computer interfaces and prosthetic systems.</description>

      <title>Harnessing FFT for Rapid Community Travel Distance and Step Estimation in Children with DMD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of gait characteristics, including step length, step velocity, and travel distance, is critical for assessing mobility in toddlers, children and teens with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and typically developing (TD) peers. This study introduces a novel method leveraging Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-derived step frequency from a single waist-worn consumer-grade accelerometer to predict gait parameters efficiently. The proposed FFT-based step frequency detection approach, combined with regression-derived stride length estimation, enables precise measurement of temporospatial gait features across various walking and running speeds. Our model, developed from a diverse cohort of children aged 3-16, demonstrated high accuracy in step length estimation (R^2=0.92, RMSE = 0.06) using only step frequency and height as inputs. Comparative analysis with ground-truth observations and AI-driven Walk4Me models validated the FFT-based method, showing strong agreement across step count, step frequency, step length, step velocity, and travel distance metrics. The results highlight the feasibility of using widely available mobile devices for gait assessment in real-world settings, offering a scalable solution for monitoring disease progression and mobility changes in individuals with DMD. Future work will focus on refining model performance and expanding applicability to additional movement disorders.</description>

      <title>Space Surveillance with High-Frequency Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-Frequency (HF) radar is well suited to the surveillance of low-earth-orbit space. For large targets, a small deployable HF radar is able to match the detection performance of much larger space surveillance radar systems operating at higher frequencies. However, there are some unique challenges associated with the use of HF, including the range--Doppler coupling bias, coarse detection-level localisation, and the presence of meteor returns and other unwanted signals. This paper details the use of HF radar for space surveillance, including signal processing and radar product formation, tracking, ionospheric correction, and orbit determination. It is shown that by fusing measurements from multiple passes, accurate orbital estimates can be obtained. Included are results from recent SpaceFest trials of the Defence Science and Technology Group's HF space surveillance radar, achieving real-time wide-area surveillance in tracking, orbit determination, and cueing of other space surveillance sensors.</description>

      <title>Model Selection via MCRB Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many estimation theory and statistical analysis problems, the true data model is unknown, or partially unknown. To describe the model generating the data, parameterized models of some degree are used. A question that arises is which model should be used to best approximate the true model, a.k.a. model selection. In the field of machine learning, it is encountered in the form of architecture types of neural networks, number of model parameters, etc. In this paper, we propose a new model selection criterion, based on the misspecified Cramer-Rao bound (MCRB) for mean-squared-error (MSE) performance. The criterion selects the model in which the bound on the estimated parameters MSE is the lowest, compared to other candidate models. Its goal is to minimize the MSE with-respect-to (w.r.t.) the model. The criterion is applied to the problems of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation under unknown clutter / interference, and spectrum estimation of auto-regressive (AR) model. It is shown to incorporate the bias-variance trade-off, and outperform the Akaike information criterion (AIC), finite-sample corrected AIC (AICc), and minimum description length (MDL) in terms of MSE performance.</description>

      <title>TFDWT: Fast Discrete Wavelet Transform TensorFlow Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TFDWT is an open-source Python library that allows the construction of TensorFlow Layers for Fast Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT) in end-to-end backpropagation learning networks. By definition, a multiresolution signal representation using a multi-rate discrete wavelet system creates enriched joint natural-frequency representations. These layers facilitate the construction of multilevel DWT filter banks and Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) filter banks for a spatial-frequency representation of the inputs and features in shallow or deep networks. The discrete wavelet system partitions the frequency plane into subbands using orthogonal dilated and translated lowpass scaling and highpass wavelet function. The realization of a fast discrete wavelet system is a two-band perfect reconstruction multi-rate filter bank with FIR filters corresponding to the impulse responses of the scaling and wavelet function with downsampling and upsampling operations. A filter bank for a higher dimensional input is a seamless extension by successive separable circular convolutions across each independent axis. The command `pip install TFDWT' installs the latest version of the package.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the performance of an Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) node as a range extender for beyond-5G networks, focusing on the significant challenges of effective power allocation and beamforming strategies, which are vital for maximizing users' spectral efficiency (SE). We present both max-sum SE and max-min fairness power allocation strategies, to assess their effects on system performance. The results underscore the necessity of power optimization, particularly as the number of users served by the IAB node increases, demonstrating how efficient power allocation enhances service quality in high-load scenarios. The results also show that the typical line-of-sight link between the IAB donor and the IAB node has rank one, posing a limitation on the effective SEs that the IAB node can support.</description>

      <title>DSSR-Net for Super-Resolution Radar Range Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution radar range profile (RRP) is crucial for accurate target recognition and scene perception. To get a high-resolution RRP, many methods have been developed, such as multiple signal classification (MUSIC), orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), and a few deep learning-based approaches. Although they break through the Rayleigh resolution limit determined by radar signal bandwidth, these methods either get limited super-resolution capability or work well just in high signal to noise ratio (SNR) scenarios. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, an interpretable neural network for super-resolution RRP (DSSR-Net) is proposed by integrating the advantages of both model-guided and data-driven models. Specifically, DSSR-Net is designed based on a sparse representation model with dimension scaling, and then trained on a training dataset. Through dimension scaling, DSSR-Net lifts the radar signal into high-dimensional space to extract subtle features of closely spaced objects and suppress the noise of the high-dimensional features. It improves the super-resolving power of closely spaced objects and lowers the SNR requirement of radar signals compared to existing methods. The superiority of the proposed algorithm for super-resolution RRP reconstruction is verified via experiments with both synthetic and measured data.</description>

      <title>Opportunistic Beamforming and Dynamic Scheduling for Multi-User MIMO-ISAC Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research presents a novel framework integrating Flexible-Duplex (FlexD) and Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) technologies to address the challenges of spectrum efficiency and resource optimization in next-generation wireless networks. We develop a unified system model for a dual-functional radar-communication base station with multiple-input multiple-output capabilities, enabling dynamic uplink and downlink channel allocation. The framework maximizes network throughput while maintaining radar sensing performance, subject to signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) requirements and power constraints. Given the non-convex and combinatorial nature of the resulting optimization problem, we propose an iterative algorithm that converges to a locally optimal solution. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed FlexD-ISAC framework compared to conventional half-duplex networks. Additionally, sensitivity analyses reveal the impact of SCNR requirements and power constraints on system performance, providing valuable insights for practical implementation. This work establishes a foundation for future research in dynamic, resource-efficient wireless systems that simultaneously support sensing and communication capabilities.</description>

      <title>ANN-Driven Adaptive Power Allocation for OWC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) have gained popularity in Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) due to their high bandwidth and directional beam compared to Light-emitting diodes (LEDs). In this work, we explore the deployment of VCSELs as Access Points (APs) in an indoor environment with time-varying user distributions and traffic demands. To enhance performance, a merged access point (MAP) topology is introduced to extend the serving area of each cell using Zero Forcing (ZF) for interference management. A power allocation optimisation problem is formulated aimed at maximising the sum rate of the dynamic network. Deterministic approaches can solve the formulated problem but are impractical for real-time scenarios. In this work, we propose an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for adaptive power allocation with reduced computational complexity. Our results show that the designed ANN learns and effectively provides instantaneous solutions in dynamic scenarios, resulting in improved performance in terms of sum rate compared to a baseline uniform power allocation scheme.</description>

      <title>Post-Quantum Wireless-based Key Encapsulation Mechanism via CRYSTALS-Kyber for Resource-Constrained Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of adapting a Post-Quantum cryptosystem to be used in resource-constrained devices, such as those typically used in Device-to-Device and Internet of Things systems. In particular, we propose leveraging the characteristics of wireless communications channels to minimize the complexity of implementation of a Post-Quantum public key encryption scheme, without diminishing its security. To that end, we focus on the adaptation of a well-known cryptosystem, namely CRYSTALS-Kyber, so as to enable its direct integration into the lowest layer of the communication stack, the physical layer, defining two new transport schemes for CRYSTALS-Kyber to be used in Device-to-Device communications, both of which are modeled under a wireless channel subject to Additive White Gaussian Noise, using a 4 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation constellation and a BCH-code to communicate CRYSTALSKyber's polynomial coefficients. Simulation results demonstrate the viability of the adapted Kyber algorithm due to its low key error probability, while maintaining the security reductions of the original Kyber by considering the error distribution imposed by the channel on the cipher.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Deep Learning Tuning of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface for OFDM Radar Interference Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a deep learning-based framework for enhancing radar systems in the presence of interference, leveraging Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS). The proposed technique uses a modified MUSIC algorithm to estimate the angles of the target and interference. The core of the method is a deep learning model that optimizes the RIS configuration to reduce the impact of interference while maintaining accurate angle estimates. The model consists of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that takes estimated angles as inputs and outputs the configuration of the RIS. A specially designed loss function ensures that the interference is properly suppressed and the target remains detectable. To further enhance performance, a convolution technique is introduced to create a notch at the interference angle, ensuring better separation between the target and interference. Additionally, the method is extended to work over multiple subcarriers, improving robustness and performance in practical scenarios. Simulation results show that the technique enhances the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and provides accurate localization estimates, demonstrating its potential for radar systems in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Turbocharging Fluid Antenna Multiple Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the massive connectivity challenge by considering the case where no CSI is available at the BS and no precoding is used. In this situation, inter-user interference (IUI) mitigation can only be performed at the user terminal (UT) side. Leveraging the position flexibility of fluid antenna system (FAS), we adopt a fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA) approach that exploits the interference signal fluctuation in the spatial domain. Specifically, we assume that we have N spatially correlated received signals per symbol duration from FAS. Our main approach uses a simple heuristic port shortlisting method that identifies promising ports to obtain favourable received signals that can be combined via maximum ratio combining (MRC) to form the received output signal for final detection. On top of this, a pre-trained deep joint source channel coding (JSCC) scheme is employed, which together with a diffusion-based denoising model (MixDDPM) at the UT side, can improve the IUI immunity. We refer to the proposed scheme as turbo FAMA. Simulation results show that with a physical FAS size of 20 wavelengths at each UT transmitting quaternary phase shift keying (QPSK) symbols, fast FAMA can support 50 users while turbo FAMA can handle up to 200 users if the required symbol error rate (SER) is 10 2. If a higher error tolerance is acceptable, say SER at 01, turbo FAMA can even serve up to 1000 users but fast FAMA is only able to handle 160 users, all remarkably achieved without CSI at the BS.</description>

      <title>Classification of ADHD and Healthy Children Using EEG Based Multi-Band Spatial Features Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in children, characterized by difficulties in attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Early and accurate diagnosis of ADHD is critical for effective intervention and management. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have emerged as a non-invasive and efficient tool for ADHD detection due to their high temporal resolution and ability to capture neural dynamics. In this study, we propose a method for classifying ADHD and healthy children using EEG data from the benchmark dataset. There were 61 children with ADHD and 60 healthy children, both boys and girls, aged 7 to 12. The EEG signals, recorded from 19 channels, were processed to extract Power Spectral Density (PSD) and Spectral Entropy (SE) features across five frequency bands, resulting in a comprehensive 190-dimensional feature set. To evaluate the classification performance, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with the RBF kernel demonstrated the best performance with a mean cross-validation accuracy of 99.2\% and a standard deviation of 0.0079, indicating high robustness and precision. These results highlight the potential of spatial features in conjunction with machine learning for accurately classifying ADHD using EEG data. This work contributes to developing non-invasive, data-driven tools for early diagnosis and assessment of ADHD in children.</description>

      <title>Localization and Tracking for Cooperative Users in Multi-RIS-assisted Systems: Theoretical Analysis and Principles of Interpretations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization and tracking (LocTrack) are fundamental enablers for a wide range of emerging applications. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as key components for enhancing the LocTrack performance. This paper investigates a multi-RIS-assisted multi-user (MRMU) LocTrack system, where multiple RISs collaboratively reflect the position-bearing signals for information fusion at the base station, leveraging spatial-temporal correlations in user positions. While studies have shown these correlations improve localization accuracy, their trade-offs with system complexity remain unclear. To address this gap, we characterize the effectiveness of spatial-temporal correlation priors (STPs) utilization in MRMU LocTrack systems using a metric, termed efficiency of correlation (EoC). To further elucidate correlation propagation and RIS interactions, we provide a "correlation information routing" interpretation of EoC through random walk theory. EoC provides a principled performance evaluation metric, that enables system designers to balance localization accuracy enhancement against the increased complexity. Additionally, we investigate the error propagation phenomenon, analyzing its convergence and asymptotic behavior in MRMU LocTrack systems. Finally, we validate the theoretical results through extensive numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Curse of Scenario and Task Generalization in AI-6G: A Multi-Modal Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing works on machine learning (ML)-empowered wireless communication primarily focus on monolithic scenarios and single tasks. However, with the blooming growth of communication task classes coupled with various task requirements in future 6G systems, this working pattern is obviously unsustainable. Therefore, identifying a groundbreaking paradigm that enables a universal model to solve multiple tasks in the physical layer within diverse scenarios is crucial for future system evolution. This paper aims to fundamentally address the curse of ML model generalization across diverse scenarios and tasks by unleashing multi-modal feature integration capabilities in future systems. Given the universality of electromagnetic propagation theory, the communication process is determined by the scattering environment, which can be more comprehensively characterized by cross-modal perception, thus providing sufficient information for all communication tasks across varied environments. This fact motivates us to propose a transformative two-stage multi-modal pre-training and downstream task adaptation paradigm...</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) is a potential waveform for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems because it can manage communication and sensing metrics in one unified domain, and has better performance in high mobility scenarios. In practice, a target might come from far distance or with ultra-high speed. However, the max unambiguous range and max tolerable velocity of OTFS-ISAC system is limited by the unambiguous round-trip delay and Doppler shift, which are related to OTFS frame, i.e., time slots and subcarrier spacing, respectively. To enlarge the sensing range, a novel OTFS cross-frame ranging and velocity estimation model as well as its corresponding method based on the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) are proposed in this paper. By designing co-prime numbers of subcarriers and time slots in different subframes, the difference in the responses of the subframes for a target can be used to estimate the distance and velocity of an out-of-range target. Several frame structures are further designed for specific sensing scenarios, such as target with ultra-high speed or at far distance. Simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve significantly better performance in NMSE compared with the classic sensing methods under the condition of same time and frequency resources.</description>

      <title>Parallelization is All System Identification Needs: End-to-end Vibration Diagnostics on a multi-core RISC-V edge device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The early detection of structural malfunctions requires the installation of real-time monitoring systems ensuring continuous access to the damage-sensitive information; nevertheless, it can generate bottlenecks in terms of bandwidth and storage. Deploying data reduction techniques at the edge is recognized as a proficient solution to reduce the system's network traffic. However, the most effective solutions currently employed for the purpose are based on memory and power-hungry algorithms, making their embedding on resource-constrained devices very challenging; this is the case of vibration data reduction based on System Identification models. This paper presents PARSY-VDD, a fully optimized PArallel end-to-end software framework based on SYstem identification for Vibration-based Damage Detection, as a suitable solution to perform damage detection at the edge in a time and energy-efficient manner, avoiding streaming raw data to the cloud. We evaluate the damage detection capabilities of PARSY-VDD with two benchmarks: a bridge and a wind turbine blade, showcasing the robustness of the end-to-end approach. Then, we deploy PARSY-VDD on both commercial single-core and a specific multi-core edge device. We introduce an architecture-agnostic algorithmic optimization for SysId, improving the execution by 90x and reducing the consumption by 85x compared with the state-of-the-art SysId implementation on GAP9. Results show that by utilizing the unique parallel computing capabilities of GAP9, the execution time is 751{\mu}s with the high-performance multi-core solution operating at 370MHz and 0.8V, while the energy consumption is 37{\mu}J with the low-power solution operating at 240MHz and 0.65V. Compared with other single-core implementations based on STM32 microcontrollers, the GAP9 high-performance configuration is 76x faster, while the low-power configuration is 360x more energy efficient.</description>

      <title>Advanced Codebook Design for SCMA-aided NTNs With Randomly Distributed Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, a novel class of sparse codebooks is proposed for sparse code multiple access (SCMA) aided non-terrestrial networks (NTN) with randomly distributed users characterized by Rician fading channels. Specifically, we first exploit the upper bound of bit error probability (BEP) of an SCMA-aided NTN with large-scale fading of different users under Rician fading channels. Then, the codebook is designed by employing pulse-amplitude modulation constellation, user-specific rotation and power factors. To further reduce the optimization complexity while maintaining the power diversity of different users, an orthogonal layer-assisted joint layer and power assignment strategy is proposed. Finally, unlike existing SCMA codebook designs that treat all users as one super-user, we propose to minimize the BEP of the worst user to ensure user fairness. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme is capable of providing a substantial performance gain over conventional codebooks.</description>

      <title>Grouped Target Tracking and Seamless People Counting with a 24 GHz MIMO FMCW</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of radar-based tracking of groups of people moving together and counting their numbers in indoor environments is considered here. A novel processing pipeline to track groups of people moving together and count their numbers is proposed and validated. The pipeline is specifically designed to deal with frequent changes of direction and stop &amp; go movements typical of indoor activities. The proposed approach combines a tracker with a classifier to count the number of grouped people; this uses both spatial features extracted from range-azimuth maps, and Doppler frequency features extracted with wavelet decomposition. Thus, the pipeline outputs over time both the location and number of people present. The proposed approach is verified with experimental data collected with a 24 GHz Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar. It is shown that the proposed method achieves 95.59% accuracy in counting the number of people, and a tracking metric OSPA of 0.338. Furthermore, the performance is analyzed as a function of different relevant variables such as feature combinations and scenarios.</description>

      <title>Low-Rate Semantic Communication with Codebook-based Conditional Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative semantic communication models are reshaping semantic communication frameworks by moving beyond pixel-wise optimization to align with human perception. However, many existing approaches prioritize image-level perceptual quality, often neglecting alignment with downstream tasks, which can lead to suboptimal semantic representation. This paper introduces an Ultra-Low Bitrate Semantic Communication (ULBSC) system that employs a conditional generative model and a learnable condition codebook.By integrating saliency conditions and image-level semantic information, the proposed method enables high-perceptual-quality and controllable task-oriented image transmission. Recognizing shared patterns among objects, we propose a codebook-assisted condition transmission method, integrated with joint source-channel coding (JSCC)-based text transmission to establish ULBSC. The codebook serves as a knowledge base, reducing communication costs to achieve ultra-low bitrate while enhancing robustness against noise and inaccuracies in saliency detection. Simulation results indicate that, under ultra-low bitrate conditions with an average compression ratio of 0.57Z%o, the proposed system delivers superior visual quality compared to traditional JSCC techniques and achieves higher saliency similarity between the generated and source images compared to state-of-the-art generative semantic communication methods.</description>

      <title>Joint BS Deployment and Power Optimization for Minimum EMF Exposure with RL in Real-World Based Urban Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional base station (BS) deployments typically prioritize coverage, quality of service (QoS), or cost reduction, often overlooking electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure. Whereas EMF exposure triggers significant public concern due to its potential health implications, making it crucial to address when deploying BS in densely populated areas. To this end, this paper addresses minimizing average EMF exposure while maintaining coverage in a 3D urban scenario by jointly optimizing BS deployment and power. To address this, firstly, accurate EMF prediction is essential, as traditional empirical models lack the required accuracy, necessitating a deterministic channel model. A novel least-time shoot-and-bounce ray (SBR) ray-launching (RL) algorithm is therefore developed to overcome several limitations of current simulators and is validated with real-world measurements. Secondly, to further reduce computational complexity, unlike using a fixed grid size to discretize the target area, the adaptive grid refinement (AGR) algorithm is designed with a flexible grid to predict the overall EMF exposure. Finally, based on the EMF exposure predictions, the Nelder-Mead (NM) method is used in the joint optimization, and urban user equipment (UE) distributions are incorporated to better reflect real-world conditions. When evaluating the benefits of the whole process, the results are compared against using empirical channel models, revealing notable differences and underestimation of EMF exposure that highlight the importance of considering real-world scenario.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Position-Aided Beam Selection for mmWave MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems rely on highly directional beamforming to overcome severe path loss and ensure robust communication links. However, selecting the optimal beam pair efficiently remains a challenge due to the large search space and the overhead of conventional methods. This paper proposes a probabilistic position-aided beam selection approach that exploits the statistical dependence between user equipment (UE) positions and optimal beam indices. We model the underlying joint probability mass function (PMF) of the positions and the beam indices as a low-rank tensor and estimate its parameters from training data using Bayesian inference. The estimated model is then used to predict the best (or a list of the top) beam pair indices for new UE positions. The proposed method is evaluated using data generated from a state-of-the-art ray tracing simulator and compared with neural network-based and fingerprinting approaches. The results show that our approach achieves a high data rate with fewer training samples and a significantly reduced beam search space. These advantages render it a promising solution for practical mmWave MIMO deployments, reducing the beam search overhead while maintaining a reliable connectivity.</description>

      <title>Secure Communications for All Users in Low-Resolution IRS-aided Systems Under Imperfect and Unknown CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Provisioning secrecy for all users, given the heterogeneity and uncertainty of their channel conditions, locations, and the unknown location of the attacker/eavesdropper, is challenging and not always feasible. This work takes the first step to guarantee secrecy for all users where a low resolution intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) is used to enhance legitimate users' reception and thwart the potential eavesdropper (Eve) from intercepting. In real-life scenarios, due to hardware limitations of the IRS' passive reflective elements (PREs), the use of a full-resolution (continuous) phase shift (CPS) is impractical. In this paper, we thus consider a more practical case where the phase shift (PS) is modeled by a low-resolution (quantized) phase shift (QPS) while addressing the phase shift error (PSE) induced by the imperfect channel state information (CSI). To that end, we aim to maximize the minimum secrecy rate (SR) among all users by jointly optimizing the transmitter's beamforming vector and the IRS's passive reflective elements (PREs) under perfect/imperfect/unknown CSI. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex and even more complicated under imperfect/unknown CSI.</description>

      <title>"Security for Everyone" in Finite Blocklength IRS-aided Systems With Perfect and Imperfect CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Provisioning secrecy for all users, given the heterogeneity in their channel conditions, locations, and the unknown location of the attacker/eavesdropper, is challenging and not always feasible. The problem is even more difficult under finite blocklength constraints that are popular in ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) and massive machine-type communications (mMTC). This work takes the first step to guarantee secrecy for all URLLC/mMTC users in the finite blocklength regime (FBR) where intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) are used to enhance legitimate users' reception and thwart the potential eavesdropper (Eve) from intercepting. To that end, we aim to maximize the minimum secrecy rate (SR) among all users by jointly optimizing the transmitter's beamforming and IRS's passive reflective elements (PREs) under the FBR latency constraints. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex and even more complicated under imperfect channel state information (CSI). To tackle it, we linearize the objective function, and decompose the problem into sequential subproblems. When perfect CSI is not available, we use the successive convex approximation (SCA) approach to transform imperfect CSI-related semi-infinite constraints into finite linear matrix inequalities (LMI).</description>

      <title>Modeling Micro-Doppler Signature of Multi-Propeller Drones in Distributed ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) will be one key feature of future 6G networks, enabling simultaneous communication and radar sensing. The radar sensing geometry of ISAC will be multistatic since that corresponds to the common distributed structure of a mobile communication network. Within this framework, micro-Doppler analysis plays a vital role in classifying targets based on their micromotions, such as rotating propellers, vibration, or moving limbs. However, research on bistatic micro-Doppler effects, particularly in ISAC systems utilizing OFDM waveforms, remains limited. Existing methods, including electromagnetic simulations often lack scalability for generating the large datasets required to train machine learning algorithms. To address this gap, this work introduces an OFDM-based bistatic micro-Doppler model for multi-propeller drones. The proposed model adapts the classic thin-wire model to include bistatic sensing configuration with an OFDM-like signal. Then, it extends further by incorporating multiple propellers and integrating the reflectivity of the drone's static parts. Measurements were performed to collect ground truth data for verification of the proposed model. Validation results show that the model generates micro-Doppler signatures closely resembling those obtained from measurements, demonstrating its potential as a tool for data generation. In addition, it offers a comprehensive approach to analyzing bistatic micro-Doppler effects.</description>

      <title>On multipolar magnetic anomaly detection: multipolar signal subspaces, an analytical orthonormal basis, multipolar truncature and detection performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the magnetic anomaly detection problem which aims to find hidden ferromagnetic masses by estimating the weak perturbation they induce on local Earth's magnetic field. We consider classical detection schemes that rely on signals recorded on a moving sensor, and modeling of the source as a function of unknown parameters. As the usual spherical harmonic decomposition of the anomaly has to be truncated in practice, we study the signal vector subspaces induced by each multipole of the decomposition, proving they are not in direct sum, and discussing the impact it has on the choice of the truncation order. Further, to ease the detection strategy based on generalized likelihood ratio test, we rely on orthogonal polynomials theory to derive an analytical set of orthonormal functions (multipolar orthonormal basis functions) that spans the space of the noise-free measured signal. Finally, based on the subspace structure of the multipole vector spaces, we study the impact of the truncation order on the detection performance, beyond the issue of potential surparametrization, and the behaviour of the information criteria used to choose this order.</description>

      <title>Performance and Complexity Analysis of Terahertz-Band MIMO Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving terabit-per-second (Tbps) data rates in terahertz (THz)-band communications requires bridging the complexity gap in baseband transceiver design. This work addresses the signal processing challenges associated with data detection in THz multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We begin by analyzing the trade-offs between performance and complexity across various detection schemes and THz channel models, demonstrating significant complexity reduction by leveraging spatial parallelizability over subspaces of correlated THz MIMO channels. We derive accurate detection error probability bounds by accounting for THz-specific channel models and mismatches introduced by subspace decomposition. Building on this, we propose a subspace detector that integrates layer sorting, QR decomposition, and channel-matrix puncturing to balance performance loss and parallelizability. Furthermore, we introduce a channel-matrix reuse strategy for wideband THz MIMO detection. Simulations over accurate, ill-conditioned THz channels show that efficient parallelizability achieves multi-dB performance gains, while wideband reuse strategies offer computational savings with minimal performance degradation.</description>

      <title>SAFE: Self-Adjustment Federated Learning Framework for Remote Sensing Collaborative Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid increase in remote sensing satellites has led to the emergence of distributed space-based observation systems. However, existing distributed remote sensing models often rely on centralized training, resulting in data leakage, communication overhead, and reduced accuracy due to data distribution discrepancies across platforms. To address these challenges, we propose the \textit{Self-Adjustment FEderated Learning} (SAFE) framework, which innovatively leverages federated learning to enhance collaborative sensing in remote sensing scenarios. SAFE introduces four key strategies: (1) \textit{Class Rectification Optimization}, which autonomously addresses class imbalance under unknown local and global distributions. (2) \textit{Feature Alignment Update}, which mitigates Non-IID data issues via locally controlled EMA updates. (3) \textit{Dual-Factor Modulation Rheostat}, which dynamically balances optimization effects during training. (4) \textit{Adaptive Context Enhancement}, which is designed to improve model performance by dynamically refining foreground regions, ensuring computational efficiency with accuracy improvement across distributed satellites. Experiments on real-world image classification and object segmentation datasets validate the effectiveness and reliability of the SAFE framework in complex remote sensing scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based base stations offer a promising solution in emergencies where the rapid deployment of cutting-edge networks is crucial for maximizing life-saving potential. Optimizing the strategic positioning of these UAVs is essential for enhancing communication efficiency. This paper introduces an automated reinforcement learning approach that enables UAVs to dynamically interact with their environment and determine optimal configurations. By leveraging the radio signal sensing capabilities of communication networks, our method provides a more realistic perspective, utilizing state-of-the-art algorithm -- proximal policy optimization -- to learn and generalize positioning strategies across diverse user equipment (UE) movement patterns. We evaluate our approach across various UE mobility scenarios, including static, random, linear, circular, and mixed hotspot movements.

      <title>Meta-Learning Driven Movable-Antenna-assisted Full-Duplex RSMA for Multi-User Communication: Performance and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full-duplex (FD) radios at base station (BS) have gained significant interest because of their ability to simultaneously transmit and receive signals on the same frequency band. However, FD communication is hindered by self-interference (SI) and intra-cell interference caused by simultaneous uplink (UL) transmissions affecting downlink (DL) reception. These interferences significantly limit the ability to fully exploit FD's potential. Recently, movable antenna (MA) technology has emerged as a groundbreaking innovation, offering an effective way to mitigate interference by adjusting the position of each MA within the transmitter or receiver region. This dynamic repositioning allows MAs to move away from high-interference zones to areas with minimal interference, thereby enhancing multiplexing gain and improving spectral efficiency (SE). In light of this, in this paper, we investigate an FD communication system by integrating it with MAs to evaluate and investigate its effectiveness in handling SI and intra-cell interference. Moreover, we utilize rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) as our multiple access technique in both UL and DL transmission. To achieve the full potential of the system, we evaluated three different scenarios with FD-BS-RSMA with MAs where our goal is to maximize the total sum rate of the system by jointly optimizing the transmitting and receiving beamforming vectors, UL user equipment (UE) transmission power, MA positions, and common stream split ratio of RSMA while satisfying the minimum data rate requirements of all UEs, common stream constraint, power budget requirements of BS and UL UEs, and inter-MA distance. The formulated optimization problem is highly non-convex in nature, and hence, we propose a gradient-based meta-learning (GML) approach which can handle the non-convexity in a discrete manner by optimizing each variable in a different neural network.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Auralization for First-Person Vocal Interaction in Immersive Virtual Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal research and applications are becoming more commonplace as Virtual Reality (VR) technology integrates different sensory feedback, enabling the recreation of real spaces in an audio-visual context. Within VR experiences, numerous applications rely on the user's voice as a key element of interaction, including music performances and public speaking applications. Self-perception of our voice plays a crucial role in vocal production. When singing or speaking, our voice interacts with the acoustic properties of the environment, shaping the adjustment of vocal parameters in response to the perceived characteristics of the space. This technical report presents a real-time auralization pipeline that leverages three-dimensional Spatial Impulse Responses (SIRs) for multimodal research applications in VR requiring first-person vocal interaction. It describes the impulse response creation and rendering workflow, the audio-visual integration, and addresses latency and computational considerations. The system enables users to explore acoustic spaces from various positions and orientations within a predefined area, supporting three and five Degrees of Freedom (3Dof and 5DoF) in audio-visual multimodal perception for both research and creative applications in VR.</description>

      <title>Cramer-Rao Bounds for Laplacian Matrix Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the performance of the estimation of Laplacian matrices under general observation models. Laplacian matrix estimation involves structural constraints, including symmetry and null-space properties, along with matrix sparsity. By exploiting a linear reparametrization that enforces the structural constraints, we derive closed-form matrix expressions for the Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) specifically tailored to Laplacian matrix estimation. We further extend the derivation to the sparsity-constrained case, introducing two oracle CRBs that incorporate prior information of the support set, i.e. the locations of the nonzero entries in the Laplacian matrix. We examine the properties and order relations between the bounds, and provide the associated Slepian-Bangs formula for the Gaussian case. We demonstrate the use of the new CRBs in three representative applications: (i) topology identification in power systems, (ii) graph filter identification in diffused models, and (iii) precision matrix estimation in Gaussian Markov random fields under Laplacian constraints. The CRBs are evaluated and compared with the mean-squared-errors (MSEs) of the constrained maximum likelihood estimator (CMLE), which integrates both equality and inequality constraints along with sparsity constraints, and of the oracle CMLE, which knows the locations of the nonzero entries of the Laplacian matrix. We perform this analysis for the applications of power system topology identification and graphical LASSO, and demonstrate that the MSEs of the estimators converge to the CRB and oracle CRB, given a sufficient number of measurements.</description>

      <title>Diff-SSL-G-Comp: Towards a Large-Scale and Diverse Dataset for Virtual Analog Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual Analog (VA) modeling aims to simulate the behavior of hardware circuits via algorithms to replicate their tone digitally. Dynamic Range Compressor (DRC) is an audio processing module that controls the dynamics of a track by reducing and amplifying the volumes of loud and quiet sounds, which is essential in music production. In recent years, neural-network-based VA modeling has shown great potential in producing high-fidelity models. However, due to the lack of data quantity and diversity, their generalization ability in different parameter settings and input sounds is still limited. To tackle this problem, we present Diff-SSL-G-Comp, the first large-scale and diverse dataset for modeling the SSL 500 G-Bus Compressor. Specifically, we manually collected 175 unmastered songs from the Cambridge Multitrack Library. We recorded the compressed audio in 220 parameter combinations, resulting in an extensive 2528-hour dataset with diverse genres, instruments, tempos, and keys. Moreover, to facilitate the use of our proposed dataset, we conducted benchmark experiments in various open-sourced black-box and grey-box models, as well as white-box plugins. We also conducted ablation studies in different data subsets to illustrate the effectiveness of improved data diversity and quantity. The dataset and demos are on our project page: http://www.yichenggu.com/DiffSSLGComp/.</description>

      <title>Grant-Free Random Access in Uplink LEO Satellite Communications with OFDM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04686v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates joint device activity detection and channel estimation for grant-free random access in Low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications. We consider uplink communications from multiple single-antenna terrestrial users to a LEO satellite equipped with a uniform planar array of multiple antennas, where orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation is adopted. To combat the severe Doppler shift, a transmission scheme is proposed, where the discrete prolate spheroidal basis expansion model (DPS-BEM) is introduced to reduce the number of unknown channel parameters. Then the vector approximate message passing (VAMP) algorithm is employed to approximate the minimum mean square error estimation of the channel, and the Markov random field is combined to capture the channel sparsity. Meanwhile, the expectation-maximization (EM) approach is integrated to learn the hyperparameters in priors. Finally, active devices are detected by calculating energy of the estimated channel. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional algorithms in terms of activity error rate and channel estimation precision.</description>

      <title>Beyond Answers: How LLMs Can Pursue Strategic Thinking in Education</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds transformative potential in education, enabling personalized learning, enhancing inclusivity, and encouraging creativity and curiosity. In this paper, we explore how Large Language Models (LLMs) can act as both patient tutors and collaborative partners to enhance education delivery. As tutors, LLMs personalize learning by offering step-by-step explanations and addressing individual needs, making education more inclusive for students with diverse backgrounds or abilities. As collaborators, they expand students' horizons, supporting them in tackling complex, real-world problems and co-creating innovative projects. However, to fully realize these benefits, LLMs must be leveraged not as tools for providing direct solutions but rather to guide students in developing resolving strategies and finding learning paths together. Therefore, a strong emphasis should be placed on educating students and teachers on the successful use of LLMs to ensure their effective integration into classrooms. Through practical examples and real-world case studies, this paper illustrates how LLMs can make education more inclusive and engaging while empowering students to reach their full potential.</description>

      <title>Attentional Graph Meta-Learning for Indoor Localization Using Extremely Sparse Fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fingerprint-based indoor localization is often labor-intensive due to the need for dense grids and repeated measurements across time and space. Maintaining high localization accuracy with extremely sparse fingerprints remains a persistent challenge. Existing benchmark methods primarily rely on the measured fingerprints, while neglecting valuable spatial and environmental characteristics. In this paper, we propose a systematic integration of an Attentional Graph Neural Network (AGNN) model, capable of learning spatial adjacency relationships and aggregating information from neighboring fingerprints, and a meta-learning framework that utilizes datasets with similar environmental characteristics to enhance model training. To minimize the labor required for fingerprint collection, we introduce two novel data augmentation strategies: 1) unlabeled fingerprint augmentation using moving platforms, which enables the semi-supervised AGNN model to incorporate information from unlabeled fingerprints, and 2) synthetic labeled fingerprint augmentation through environmental digital twins, which enhances the meta-learning framework through a practical distribution alignment, which can minimize the feature discrepancy between synthetic and real-world fingerprints effectively. By integrating these novel modules, we propose the Attentional Graph Meta-Learning (AGML) model. This novel model combines the strengths of the AGNN model and the meta-learning framework to address the challenges posed by extremely sparse fingerprints. To validate our approach, we collected multiple datasets from both consumer-grade WiFi devices and professional equipment across diverse environments. Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the AGML model-based localization method consistently outperforms all baseline methods using sparse fingerprints across all evaluated metrics.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric 4.77 Three-Way Unequal Filtering Power Divider/Combiner for Communication Systems Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel three-way unequal filtering power divider/combiner, addressing challenges in unequal power distribution while incorporating filtering functions in communication systems. Wilkinson power divider (WPD) is the traditional power division approach using quarter-wavelength transmission lines [1]. This type of power divider is popularly used in communication systems due to its good electrical isolation and simple structure. The problem with WPD is that its operation requires the use of an externally connected bandpass filter (BPF) to achieve filtering functionality. This leads to increased footprint and increased loss coefficients in a system. In contrast to the traditional design approach involving a BPF, a matching transmission line, and a Wilkinson power divider as separate components, the proposed integrated filtering power divider (FPD) consolidates all three components into a single device, leading to lower footprint and lower loss coefficient in a system. Circuit modelling and electromagnetic (EM) simulations were conducted to ensure alignment between theoretical and practical results. The design demonstrates effective unequal power division at the three output ports while maintaining very good filtering performance. Results show a return loss better than 15 dB and a minimum insertion loss of 1.2 dB. The overall size of the device is 32.2 x 50.0 mm. This paper contributes to advancements in power divider design by addressing unequal power division challenges and integrating filtering functions. The findings offer a foundation for future developments in advanced power divider/combiner systems, with insights into potential challenges and areas for further improvements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a rectangular-shaped power divider has been presented operating at 27.9 GHz. The power divider has achieved acceptable results for important parameters such as S11, S12, S21, and S22. The substrate employed for the power divider is Roger 3003 which has a thickness of 1.6 mm. This power divider provides a reflection coefficient of -12.2 dB and an insertion loss of 3.1 dB at 28 GHz. This ka-band T-junction power divider covers 68% of the bandwidth. Dimensions of the ka-band T-junction power divider are 50x80 mm. Due to its dimensions and bandwidth this power divider is more suitable for millimetre wave applications like RADAR, beamforming, and 5G applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel fault localisation methodology for linear time-invariant electrical networks with infinite-dimensional edge dynamics and uncertain fault dynamics. The theory accommodates instability and also bounded propagation delays in the network. The goal is to estimate the location of a fault along a given network edge, using sensors positioned arbitrarily throughout the network. Passive faults of unknown impedance are considered, along with stable faults of known impedance. To illustrate the approach, we tackle a significant use-case: a multi-conductor transmission line, with dynamics modelled by the Telegrapher's equation, subject to a line-to-ground fault. Frequency-domain insights are used to reformulate the general fault localisation problem into a non-convex scalar optimisation problem, of which the true fault location is guaranteed to be a global minimiser. Numerical experiments are run to quantify localisation performance over a range of fault resistances.</description>

      <title>Efficient Gaussian Process Classification-based Physical-Layer Authentication with Configurable Fingerprints for 6G-Enabled IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12263v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The future 6G-enabled IoT will facilitate seamless global connectivity among ubiquitous wireless devices, but this advancement also introduces heightened security risks such as spoofing attacks. Physical-Layer Authentication (PLA) has emerged as a promising, inherently secure, and energy-efficient technique for authenticating IoT terminals. Nonetheless, the direct application of state-of-the-art PLA schemes to 6G-enabled IoT encounters two major hurdles: inaccurate channel fingerprints and the inefficient utilization of prior fingerprint information. To tackle these challenges, we leverage Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) to enhance fingerprint accuracy. Additionally, we integrate active learning and Gaussian Processes (GPs) to propose an Efficient Gaussian Process Classification (EGPC)-based PLA scheme, aiming for reliable and lightweight authentication. Following Bayes' theorem, we model configurable fingerprints using GPs and employ the expectation propagation method to identify unknown fingerprints. Given the difficulty of obtaining sufficient labeled fingerprint samples to train PLA models, we propose three fingerprint selection algorithms. These algorithms select unlabeled fingerprints and query their identities using upper-layer authentication mechanisms. Among these methods, the optimal algorithm reduces the number of training fingerprints needed through importance sampling and eliminates the requirement for PLA model retraining through joint distribution calculation. Simulations results reveal that, in comparison with non-RIS-based approaches, the RIS-aided PLA framework decreases the authentication error rate by 98.69%. In addition, our designed fingerprint selection algorithms achieve a reduction in the authentication error rate of up to 86.93% compared to baseline active learning schemes.</description>

      <title>Wideband THz Multi-User Downlink Communications with Leaky Wave Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future wireless systems are envisioned to utilize the large spectra available at THz bands for wireless communications. Extremely massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antennas can be costly and power inefficient for wideband THz communications. An alternative antenna technology, which can achieve low cost and power efficient THz signaling, is based on leaky wave antennas (LWAs). In this paper, we explore the usage of the LWAs for wideband downlink multi-user THz communications. We propose a model for LWA-aided communication systems that faithfully captures the antenna operations. We that LWAs yield frequency-dependent beams, where the equivalent wideband channel induces dependence between angle, frequency, and spectral lobe width. We identify the LWAs inherent frequency-selective beamsteering capabilities as motivating multi-band THz communications that deviate from conventional orthogonal frequency-division, and employ non-identical subbands. Then, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm for jointly optimizing the LWA configuration along with the spectral division and power allocation to maximize the achievable sum-rate. Our numerical results show that a single LWA can generate diverse beampatterns, exhibiting performance comparable to costly fully digital MIMO. Interestingly, we demonstrate that allowing transmission with non-identical subbands leverages the characteristics of LWA-based channels compared to uniform division, yielding improved beamsteering that translate to higher rates.</description>

      <title>A Novel Terabit Grid-of-Beam Optical Wireless Multi-User Access Network with Beam Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we put forward a proof of concept for sixth generation (6G) Terabit infrared (IR) laser-based indoor optical wireless networks. We propose a novel double-tier access point (AP) architecture based on an array of arrays of vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) to provide a seamless grid-of-beam coverage with multi-Gb/s per beam. We present systematic design and thorough analytical modeling of the AP architecture, which are then applied to downlink system modeling using non-imaging angle diversity receivers (ADRs). We propose static beam clustering with coordinated multi-beam joint transmission (CoMB-JT) for network interference management and devise various clustering strategies to address inter-beam interference (IBI) and inter-cluster interference (ICI). Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) schemes are also adopted to handle intra-cluster interference, and the resulting signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and achievable data rate are derived. The network performance is studied in terms of spatial distributions and statistics of the downlink SINR and data rate through extensive computer simulations. The results demonstrate that data rates up to 15 Gb/s are achieved within the coverage area and a properly devised clustering strikes a balance between the sum rate and fairness depending on the number of users.</description>

      <title>Joint Channel, Data, and Radar Parameter Estimation for AFDM Systems in Doubly-Dispersive Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16945v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose new schemes for joint channel and data estimation (JCDE) and radar parameter estimation (RPE) in doubly-dispersive channels, such that integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is enabled by user equipment (UE) independently performing JCDE, and base stations (BSs) performing RPE. The contributed JCDE and RPE schemes are designed for waveforms known to perform well in doubly-dispersive channels, under a unified model that captures the features of either legacy orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), state-of-the-art (SotA) orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), and next-generation affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) systems. The proposed JCDE algorithm is based on a Bayesian parametric bilinear Gaussian belief propagation (PBiGaBP) framework first proposed for OTFS and here shown to apply to all aforementioned waveforms, while the RPE scheme is based on a new probabilistic data association (PDA) approach incorporating a Bernoulli-Gaussian denoising, optimized via expectation maximization (EM). Simulation results demonstrate that JCDE in AFDM systems utilizing a single pilot per block significantly outperforms the SotA alternative even if the latter is granted a substantial power advantage. Similarly, the AFDM-based RPE scheme is found to outperform the OTFS-based approach, as well as the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) technique, regardless of the waveform used.</description>

      <title>Challenge-Response to Authenticate Drone Communications: A Game Theoretic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As drones are increasingly used in various civilian applications, the security of drone communications is a growing concern. In this context, we propose novel strategies for challenge-response physical layer authentication (CR-PLA) of drone messages. The ground receiver (verifier) requests the drone to move to a defined position (challenge), and authenticity is verified by checking whether the corresponding measured channel gain (response) matches the expected statistic. In particular, the challenge is derived from a mixed strategy obtained by solving a zero-sum game against the intruder, which in turn decides its own positions. In addition, we derive the optimal strategy for multi-round authentication, where the CR-PLA procedure is iterated over several rounds. We also consider the energy minimization problem, where legitimate users want to minimize the energy consumption without compromising the security performance of the protocol. The performance of the proposed scheme is tested in terms of both security and energy consumption through numerical simulations, considering different protocol parameters, different scenarios (urban and rural), different drone altitudes, and also in the context of drone swarms.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air DPD and Reciprocity Calibration in Massive MIMO and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study an over-the-air (OTA) approach for digital pre-distortion (DPD) and reciprocity calibration in massive multiple-input-multiple-output systems. In particular, we consider a memory-less non-linearity model for the base station (BS) transmitters and propose a methodology to linearize the transmitters and perform the calibration by using mutual coupling OTA measurements between BS antennas. We show that by only using the OTA-based data, we can linearize the transmitters and design the calibration to compensate for both the non-linearity and non-reciprocity of BS transceivers effectively. This allows to alleviate the requirement to have dedicated hardware modules for transceiver characterization. Moreover, exploiting the results of the DPD linearization step, our calibration method may be formulated in terms of closed-form transformations, achieving a significant complexity reduction over state-of-the-art methods, which usually rely on costly iterative computations. Simulation results showcase the potential of our approach in terms of the calibration matrix estimation error and downlink data-rates when applying zero-forcing precoding after using our OTA-based DPD and calibration method.</description>

      <title>Large Intelligent Surfaces with Low-End Receivers: From Scaling to Antenna and Panel Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the performance of large intelligent surface (LIS) with hardware distortion at its RX-chains. In particular, we consider the memory-less polynomial model for non-ideal hardware and derive analytical expressions for the signal to noise plus distortion ratio after applying maximum ratio combining (MRC) at the LIS. We also study the effect of back-off and automatic gain control on the RX-chains. The derived expressions enable us to evaluate the scalability of LIS when hardware impairments are present. We also study the cost of assuming ideal hardware by analyzing the minimum scaling required to achieve the same performance with a non-ideal hardware. Then, we exploit the analytical expressions to propose optimized antenna selection schemes for LIS and we show that such schemes can improve the performance significantly. In particular, the antenna selection schemes allow the LIS to have lower number of non-ideal RX-chains for signal reception while maintaining a good performance. We also consider a more practical case where the LIS is deployed as a grid of multi-antenna panels, and we propose panel selection schemes to optimize the complexity-performance trade-offs and improve the system overall efficiency.</description>

      <title>Antenna Position Optimization for Movable Antenna-Empowered Near-Field Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03169v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) show great promise for enhancing the sensing capabilities of future sixth-generation (6G) networks. With the growing prevalence of near-field propagation at ultra-high frequencies, this paper focuses on the application of MAs for near-field sensing to jointly estimate the angle and distance information of a target. First, to gain essential insights into MA-enhanced near-field sensing, we investigate two simplified cases with only the spatial angle-of-arrival (AoA) or distance estimation, respectively, assuming that the other information is already known. We derive the worst-case Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) on the mean square errors (MSEs) of the AoA estimation and the distance estimation via the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm in these two cases. Then, we jointly optimize the positions of the MAs within a linear array to minimize these CRBs and derive their closed-form solutions, which yield an identical array geometry to MA-aided far-field sensing. Furthermore, we proceed to the more challenging case with the joint AoA and distance estimation and derive the worst-case CRB under the two-dimensional (2D) MUSIC algorithm. The corresponding CRB minimization problem is efficiently solved by adopting a discrete sampling-based approach. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MA-enhanced near-field sensing significantly outperforms conventional sensing with fixed-position antennas (FPAs). Moreover, the joint angle and distance estimation results in a different array geometry from that in the individual estimation of angle or distance.</description>

      <title>Chirp-Permuted AFDM for Quantum-Resilient Physical-Layer Secure Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel physical-layer secure communications scheme based on a chirp-permuted variant of the affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) waveform recently proposed for sixth-generation (6G) systems, which ensures that eavesdroppers unaware of the correct chirp-permutation face significant challenges in signal detection, even with perfect channel state information (CSI) and co-location with the legitimate user. The security of the proposed scheme is studied in terms of the complexity required to find the correct permutation via classical and quantum search algorithms, analytically shown to be infeasible in both cases due to the factorially-scaling search space, and the probability of breach under the random-guess approach, also shown to be negligible.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17475v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present ECG-Expert-QA, a comprehensive multimodal dataset for evaluating diagnostic capabilities in electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation. It combines real-world clinical ECG data with systematically generated synthetic cases, covering 12 essential diagnostic tasks and totaling 47,211 expert-validated QA pairs. These encompass diverse clinical scenarios, from basic rhythm recognition to complex diagnoses involving rare conditions and temporal changes. A key innovation is the support for multi-turn dialogues, enabling the development of conversational medical AI systems that emulate clinician-patient or interprofessional interactions. This allows for more realistic assessment of AI models' clinical reasoning, diagnostic accuracy, and knowledge integration. Constructed through a knowledge-guided framework with strict quality control, ECG-Expert-QA ensures linguistic and clinical consistency, making it a high-quality resource for advancing AI-assisted ECG interpretation. It challenges models with tasks like identifying subtle ischemic changes and interpreting complex arrhythmias in context-rich scenarios. To promote research transparency and collaboration, the dataset, accompanying code, and prompts are publicly released at https://github.com/Zaozzz/ECG-Expert-QA</description>

      <title>Sum-Rate Maximization for Pinching Antenna-assisted NOMA Systems with Multiple Dielectric Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the resource allocation design for a pinching antenna (PA)-assisted multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system featuring multiple dielectric waveguides. To enhance model accuracy, we propose a novel frequency-dependent power attenuation model for the dielectric waveguides in PA-assisted systems. By jointly optimizing the precoder vector and the PA placement, we aim to maximize the system's sum-rate while accounting for the power attenuation across the dielectric waveguides. The design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem. To effectively address the problem at hand, we introduce an alternating optimization-based algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution in polynomial time. Our results demonstrate that the proposed PA-assisted system not only significantly outperforms the conventional system but also surpasses a naive PA-assisted system that disregards power attenuation. The performance gain compared to the naive PA-assisted system becomes more pronounced at high carrier frequencies, emphasizing the importance of considering power attenuation in system design.</description>

      <title>Near-Field THz Bending Beamforming: A Convex Optimization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20274v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication systems suffer severe blockage issues, which may significantly degrade the communication coverage and quality. Bending beams, capable of adjusting their propagation direction to bypass obstacles, have recently emerged as a promising solution to resolve this issue by engineering the propagation trajectory of the beam. However, traditional bending beam generation methods rely heavily on the specific geometric properties of the propagation trajectory and can only achieve sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a new and general bending beamforming method by adopting the convex optimization techniques. In particular, we formulate the bending beamforming design as a max-min optimization problem, aiming to optimize the analog or digital transmit beamforming vector to maximize the minimum received signal power among all positions along the bending beam trajectory. However, the resulting problem is non-convex and difficult to be solved optimally. To tackle this difficulty, we apply the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. Numerical results show that our proposed bending beamforming method outperforms the traditional method and shows robustness to the obstacle in the environment.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Graph Discovery in D2D-Enabled Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Augmenting federated learning (FL) with device-to-device (D2D) communications can help improve convergence speed and reduce model bias through local information exchange. However, data privacy concerns, trust constraints between devices, and unreliable wireless channels each pose challenges in finding an effective yet resource efficient D2D graph structure. In this paper, we develop a decentralized reinforcement learning (RL) method for D2D graph discovery that promotes communication of impactful datapoints over reliable links for multiple learning paradigms, while following both data and device-specific trust constraints. An independent RL agent at each device trains a policy to predict the impact of incoming links in a decentralized manner without exposure of local data or significant communication overhead. For supervised settings, the D2D graph aims to improve device-specific label diversity without compromising system-level performance. For semi-supervised settings, we enable this by incorporating distributed label propagation. For unsupervised settings, we develop a variation-based diversity metric which estimates data diversity in terms of occupied latent space. Numerical experiments on five widely used datasets confirm that the data diversity improvements induced by our method increase convergence speed by up to 3 times while reducing energy consumption by up to 5 times. They also show that our method is resilient to stragglers and changes in the aggregation interval. Finally, we show that our method offers scalability benefits for larger system sizes without increases in relative overhead, and adaptability to various downstream FL architectures and to dynamic wireless environments.</description>

      <title>Attentional Graph Neural Network Is All You Need for Robust Massive Network Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we design Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with attention mechanisms to tackle an important yet challenging nonlinear regression problem: massive network localization. We first review our previous network localization method based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), which can exhibit state-of-the-art localization accuracy, even under severe Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) conditions, by carefully preselecting a constant threshold for determining adjacency. As an extension, we propose a specially designed Attentional GNN (AGNN) model to resolve the sensitive thresholding issue of the GCN-based method and enhance the underlying model capacity. The AGNN comprises an Adjacency Learning Module (ALM) and Multiple Graph Attention Layers (MGAL), employing distinct attention architectures to systematically address the demerits of the GCN-based method, rendering it more practical for real-world applications. Comprehensive analyses are conducted to explain the superior performance of these methods, including a theoretical analysis of the AGNN's dynamic attention property and computational complexity, along with a systematic discussion of their robust characteristic against NLOS measurements. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the GCN-based and AGNN-based network localization methods. Notably, integrating attention mechanisms into the AGNN yields substantial improvements in localization accuracy, approaching the fundamental lower bound and showing approximately 37\% to 53\% reduction in localization error compared to the vanilla GCN-based method across various NLOS noise configurations. Both methods outperform all competing approaches by far in terms of localization accuracy, robustness, and computational time, especially for considerably large network sizes.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI for Enhancing Efficiency of DL-based Channel Estimation</title>

Abstract: The support of artificial intelligence (AI) based decision-making is a key element in future 6G networks, where the concept of native AI will be introduced. Moreover, AI is widely employed in different critical applications such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis. In such applications, using AI as black-box models is risky and challenging. Hence, it is crucial to understand and trust the decisions taken by these models. Tackling this issue can be achieved by developing explainable AI (XAI) schemes that aim to explain the logic behind the black-box model behavior, and thus, ensure its efficient and safe deployment. Recently, we proposed a novel perturbation-based XAI-CHEST framework that is oriented toward channel estimation in wireless communications. The core idea of the XAI-CHEST framework is to identify the relevant model inputs by inducing high noise on the irrelevant ones. This manuscript provides the detailed theoretical foundations of the XAI-CHEST framework. In particular, we derive the analytical expressions of the XAI-CHEST loss functions and the noise threshold fine-tuning optimization problem. Hence the designed XAI-CHEST delivers a smart input feature selection methodology that can further improve the overall performance while optimizing the architecture of the employed model. Simulation results show that the XAI-CHEST framework provides valid interpretations, where it offers an improved bit error rate performance while reducing the required computational complexity in comparison to the classical DL-based channel estimation.</description>

      <title>Evaluating 5G Networks for U-Space Applications: Insights from Dense Urban Measurement Campaign</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the burgeoning interest in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) utilization within human-inhabited spaces, critical challenges arise in ensuring reliable, low-latency communication-particularly important given the safety-critical nature of such operations in densely populated urban environments. Therefore, adequate cellular communication capabilities are essential to enable safe and effective operations within the so-called U-Spaces. In this context, this paper investigates the communication performance of cellular-connected UAVs in dense urban environments. In particular, the analysis is based on a comprehensive measurement campaign conducted in the city of Benidorm, Spain-an urban area well known for its high concentration of tall buildings and overall urban density. More specifically, we evaluated key performance indicators (KPIs) related to received signal strength and quality, data rate, and latency across various altitudes, mobile network operators, access technologies, and frequency bands, using multiple types of measurement equipment. The results highlight significant challenges, primarily due to the lack of dedicated planning for aerial coverage and interference management, revealing that current cellular networks may fall short in supporting reliable and ubiquitous UAVs communication. Thus, this paper calls for improved network solutions to ensure the reliability of UAV operations in urban airspace, thereby contributing to the integration of UAVs into urban logistics and mobility.</description>

      <title>Deep Joint Source Channel Coding for Privacy-Aware End-to-End Image Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN)-based joint source and channel coding is proposed for privacy-aware end-to-end image transmission against multiple eavesdroppers. Both scenarios of colluding and non-colluding eavesdroppers are considered. Unlike prior works that assume perfectly known and independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) source and channel statistics, the proposed scheme operates under unknown and non-i.i.d. conditions, making it more applicable to real-world scenarios. The goal is to transmit images with minimum distortion, while simultaneously preventing eavesdroppers from inferring certain private attributes of images. Simultaneously generalizing the ideas of privacy funnel and wiretap coding, a multi-objective optimization framework is expressed that characterizes the tradeoff between image reconstruction quality and information leakage to eavesdroppers, taking into account the structural similarity index (SSIM) for improving the perceptual quality of image reconstruction. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10 and CelebA, along with ablation studies, demonstrate significant performance improvements in terms of SSIM, adversarial accuracy, and the mutual information leakage compared to benchmarks. Experiments show that the proposed scheme restrains the adversarially-trained eavesdroppers from intercepting privatized data for both cases of eavesdropping a common secret, as well as the case in which eavesdroppers are interested in different secrets. Furthermore, useful insights on the privacy-utility trade-off are also provided.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO Systems with Decentralized Baseband Processing: Integrating Local Reconstruction with Global Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17059v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation problem for extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems with a hybrid analog-digital architecture, implemented within a decentralized baseband processing (DBP) framework with a star topology. Existing centralized and fully decentralized channel estimation methods face limitations due to excessive computational complexity or degraded performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage channel estimation scheme that integrates local sparse reconstruction with global fusion and refinement. Specifically, in the first stage, by exploiting the sparsity of channels in the angular-delay domain, the local reconstruction task is formulated as a sparse signal recovery problem. To solve it, we develop a graph neural networks-enhanced sparse Bayesian learning (SBL-GNNs) algorithm, which effectively captures dependencies among channel coefficients, significantly improving estimation accuracy. In the second stage, the local estimates from the local processing units (LPUs) are aligned into a global angular domain for fusion at the central processing unit (CPU). Based on the aggregated observations, the channel refinement is modeled as a Bayesian denoising problem. To efficiently solve it, we devise a variational message passing algorithm that incorporates a Markov chain-based hierarchical sparse prior, effectively leveraging both the sparsity and the correlations of the channels in the global angular-delay domain. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SBL-GNNs algorithm over existing methods, demonstrating improved estimation performance and reduced computational complexity.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on Six-Dimensional Movable Antenna Enhanced Wireless Networks: Synergizing Positionable and Rotatable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is a new
  and revolutionary technique that fully exploits the wireless
  channel spatial variations at the transmitter/receiver by flexibly
  adjusting the three-dimensional (3D) positions and/or 3D rotations
  of antennas/antenna surfaces (sub-arrays), thereby improving the performance of wireless
  networks cost-effectively without the need to deploy additional
  antennas. It is thus expected that
  the integration of new 6DMAs into future sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks will fundamentally enhance
  antenna agility and adaptability, and introduce new degrees
  of freedom (DoFs) for system design. Despite its great potential,
  6DMA faces new challenges to be efficiently implemented in wireless
  networks, including corresponding architectures, antenna position and rotation optimization, channel estimation,
  and system design from both communication and sensing perspectives. In
  this paper, we provide a tutorial on 6DMA-enhanced wireless
  networks to address the above issues by unveiling associated new channel models, hardware implementations and
  practical position/rotation constraints, as well as various appealing applications in
  wireless networks. Moreover, we discuss two special cases of 6DMA, namely, rotatable 6DMA with fixed antenna position and positionable 6DMA with fixed antenna rotation, and highlight their respective design challenges and applications.
  We further present prototypes developed for 6DMA-enhanced communication along with experimental results obtained with these prototypes. Finally, we outline promising directions for further investigation.</description>
