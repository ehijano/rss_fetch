      <title>Classical equipartition dynamics between axions and non-Abelian gauge fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by axion-like inflation and its warm embedding within the Standard Model, we study the early stages of the energy transfer between an axion condensate and an SU(2) gauge ensemble, by employing non-linear classical real-time lattice simulations. The discretized equations of motion are worked out, elaborating on Gauss constraints. A numerical solution is implemented on the CosmoLattice platform. Adopting a quadratic potential, and omitting universe expansion for the moment, we establish initial exponential growth of the low-momentum gauge modes; damping of axion oscillations after some delay; and subsequent energy equipartition between axion and gauge ensembles. A clear difference between the SU(2) and U(1) dynamics is observed, likely associated with non-Abelian self-interactions. We elaborate on what this implies for the possible thermalization of the SU(2) ensemble.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic Neutrino Background is within Reach of Future Neutrino Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B) can be boosted to high energies due to scatterings with energetic cosmic rays (CRs) across cosmological scales. Previous calculations focused on neutral current incoherent and coherent elastic scatterings of cosmic-ray protons off relic neutrinos. However, charged current interactions and deep inelastic scatterings are also expected to occur, which enhances the boosted relic neutrino fluxes on Earth. Here, we compute the \textit{total} diffuse boosted cosmic neutrino background (DBC$\nu$B) arising from CRs at all redshifts in the Universe, accounting for neutral current and charged current elastic and deep inelastic scatterings. We find that IceCube already places an upper limit on the cosmic neutrino background overdensity in cosmological scales of ~$\mathcal{O}(100-1000)$ at $E_{\nu}=10^{10}$ GeV, for a lightest neutrino mass of $m_{\nu} \gtrsim 0.1$ eV. We further show that IceCube-Gen2 could test $\mathcal{O}(1-10)$ C$\nu$B overdensities, and the combination of $10$ future neutrino telescopes with similar sensitivity would allow us to test the $\Lambda$CDM expected C$\nu$B density for a lightest neutrino mass compatible with the KATRIN bound.</description>

      <title>Lessons from the first JUNO results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First results from the JUNO reactor neutrino experiment already determine with world-leading precision the small neutrino squared-mass splitting $\Delta m^2_{21}$ and the mixing angle $\theta_{12}$. In this article we perform an exploratory study beyond these, taking advantage of the first JUNO data release to discuss its sensitivity to the large squared-mass splitting, $\Delta m^2_{3\ell}$. When combined with constraints from global oscillation data, this may already contain some information on the neutrino mass ordering. Indeed, we find that the combination of the complementary $\Delta m^2_{3\ell}$-determinations gives a slight preference for Normal Ordering, with a p-value for Inverted Ordering of 2%-2.6% ($2.2\sigma$-$2.3\sigma$). We study the robustness of this result with respect to potential systematic uncertainties and statistical fluctuations. Taken at face value, a full global analysis of oscillation data including the publicly available JUNO information and data leads to a preference for Normal Ordering with $\Delta\chi^2 = 4.6$ and 9.4 without and with Super-K and IceCube-24 atmospheric neutrino data, respectively.</description>

      <title>Very-High-Frequency Gravitational Waves from Multi-Monodromy Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that in multi-stage axion monodromy inflation an interruption near the end of the penultimate stage can lead to a spike in the gravitational wave background. These gravitational waves are in the frequency range and with an amplitude accessible to proposed terrestrial detectors such as the Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer, and future Levitated Sensor Detector experiments.</description>

      <title>On Dispersive and Nondispersive K-matrix Formalisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modeling of coupled-channel effects has become increasingly important due to the availability of highly precise data for a large variety of hadronic (re)scattering processes. The K-matrix is a powerful, yet comparatively simple, method to describe scattering amplitudes, including coupled-channel effects, with the aim to interpret experimental data. Throughout the literature, a range of dispersive and nondispersive K-matrix methods are employed. Here, we compare the dispersive and nondispersive formulations in the context of the N/D method. It is shown that the methods are equivalent in the physical region under K-matrix reparameterization. Differences away from the physical region are examined. Applications to synthetic data are used to illustrate the effects of model choices concerning form factors and the application of dispersion relations, with the goal of clarifying best practices. We find no clear preference with regards to dispersive modeling. In contrast, we find that interpretational ambiguity of the bare model parameters -- and even of the form of the bare model -- is endemic, and recommend a thorough sampling of data and model spaces to assess conclusion robustness.</description>

      <title>Dirac mass matrix textures and the lightest right-handed neutrino mass scale in Type I seesaw leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The type I seesaw mechanism is one of the leading proposed explanations for how neutrinos acquire their tiny masses. However, the mass scale of the undiscovered right-handed neutrinos required by this mechanism remains undetermined. Assuming vanilla leptogenesis in the two-flavor regime, we work backwards to find the required general textures of the Dirac mass matrix from which we determine the mass of the lightest right-handed neutrino to be around $10^9 {\rm GeV}$ to $10^{12} {\rm GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Bulk viscosity of quark matter across the QCD phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the kinetic theory with relaxation time approximation, we investigate the bulk viscosity ($\zeta$) and its ratio to shear viscosity ($\zeta/\eta$) of quark matter at finite temperature and chemical potential with the in-medium particle masses derived in the 2+1 flavor Polyakov-loop improved Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model. We explore the behaviors of specific bulk viscosity ($\zeta/s$) and $\zeta/\eta$ across different QCD phase transitions, including the Mott phase transition, the chiral crossover, and the first-order transition with the associated metastable phase. The calculation shows that both $\zeta/s$ and $\zeta/\eta$ are extremely small at high temperatures, approaching the nature of a conformal theory. Larger $\zeta/s$ and $\zeta/\eta$ are derived near the chiral phase transition at finite temperature. Along the chiral crossover line, $\zeta/s$ and $\zeta/\eta$ generally increase with decreasing temperature, though $\zeta/\eta$ exhibits a slight decline near the critical endpoint (CEP). On the boundary of the first-order transition, $\zeta/s$ shows a non-monotonic variation with temperature. Furthermore, an additional peak structure emerges beyond the chiral phase boundary for both $\zeta/s$ and $\zeta/\eta$, with magnitudes even exceeding those near the chiral crossover of $u, d$ quarks. Our analysis indicates this peak originates from the chiral crossover transformation of strange quark.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks for angular-momentum conservation in computational relativistic spin hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical developments in relativistic spin hydrodynamics, which describes the macroscopic transport of spin angular momentum alongside other fundamental conserved quantities, have progressed rapidly since the experimental observation of the global spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons in relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments. However, numerical simulations of relativistic spin hydrodynamics remain largely unaddressed due to computational challenges, particularly the accurate numerical conservation of total angular momentum. In this work, we propose the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for computational relativistic spin hydrodynamics. As a concrete application, we consider a rotating fluid confined within a cylindrical container. We show that angular-momentum conservation can be accurately achieved in the PINNs-based numerical framework. Furthermore, we investigate the spin-orbit conversion induced by the rotational viscous effect, which is the intrinsic dissipative process of relativistic spin hydrodynamics. Our analysis numerically identifies the mismatch between the transverse thermal vorticity and the spin potential as the driving mechanism of the spin-orbit conversion.</description>

      <title>Warm Hybrid Axion Inflation in $\alpha$-Attractor Models Constrained by ACT and Future Plan experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of warm hybrid inflation within the framework of $\alpha$-attractor models, where an axionic inflaton is coupled to a waterfall field in the presence of thermal dissipation. The model is analyzed for both linear ($\Upsilon \propto T$) and cubic ($\Upsilon \propto T^{3}$) dissipation regimes. Confronting the theoretical predictions with the latest observational data from Planck+BICEP/Keck, P-ACT-LB-BK18 and SPT, and , we find that in the weak dissipative regime ($Q_{*} \lesssim 10^{-5}$), the scalar spectral index $n_{s} \simeq 0.965$ lies at the boundary of the combined P-ACT-LB-BK18 constraints, while the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ remains within observable ranges. For stronger dissipation ($Q_{*} \gtrsim 10^{-5}$), the model predicts values of $n_{s}$ well within the $1$--$2\sigma$ confidence region of all datasets, with tensor modes remaining fully observable in both dissipation scenarios. These results indicate that forthcoming CMB polarization experiments may be capable of detecting primordial gravitational waves, thereby providing a robust observational test of warm hybrid inflation across different dissipative regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this proceedings we explore the physics potential of the ESSnuSBplus setup to study beam and non-beam based physics scenarios in both standard and new physics cases. The ESSnuSBplus setup consists of three neutrino sources: the main ESS linac, a low energy monitored neutrino beam and a low energy nuSTORM facility and three detectors: the main far detector and two near detectors. The goal of this facility is to measure the leptonic CP phase with extremely high precision and the neutrino nucleus cross-section in the few hundred MeV region.</description>

      <title>Revealing Neutrino Mass Ordering at CEPC and FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutrino masses ordering remains one of the most important open questions in neutrino physics. While upcoming oscillation experiments aim to resolve this problem at low energies, complementary approaches are highly desirable. In this Letter, we show that the neutrino mass ordering can be probed at high-energy colliders through the lepton-flavor structure of heavy neutral lepton (HNL) interactions. In the minimal Type-I seesaw scenario with two nearly degenerate HNLs, the heavy--light neutrino mixings are strongly correlated with the light-neutrino mass spectrum, leading to distinct flavor patterns for the normal and inverted hierarchies. We demonstrate that future $Z$ factories, such as CEPC and FCC-ee, can probe the neutrino mass ordering for total HNL mixings as small as $U_{\rm tot}^2 \gtrsim 4 \times 10^{-9}$, and discriminate between the two hierarchies for $U_{\rm tot}^2 \gtrsim 10^{-6}$. Our results establish collider searches for HNLs as a powerful and complementary probe of the neutrino mass ordering.</description>

      <title>Flavour hierarchies from radiative corrections in latticed theory space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that when $N_f$ generations of chiral fermions are coupled in a specific manner to $N$ (with $N \geq 2N_f-1$) pairs of vectorlike fermions whose mass terms form a one-dimensional lattice-like structure in theory space, locality along the lattice ensures that only a single fermion generation acquires a mass at tree level. Radiative corrections can induce controlled departures from locality in the latticed space, thereby generating suppressed but non-vanishing masses for the remaining $N_f-1$ generations. In this work, we present an explicit implementation of this mechanism to address the flavour hierarchies of the Standard Model. After delineating the minimal extensions of the gauge, scalar, and Yukawa sectors required for feasible implementation of the mechanism, we demonstrate that the framework successfully reproduces the observed charged-fermion mass spectrum and quark mixing pattern. We analyse the new-physics effects arising from the extended sectors and confront them with existing constraints from direct, indirect searches and precision measurements. It is shown that a viable realisation of the mechanism allows the spectrum of vectorlike fermions and additional gauge boson to lie at scales as low as $\mathcal{O}(5)\,\mathrm{TeV}$ with the lightest states typically corresponding to top partners. This stands in sharp contrast to conventional radiative mass-generation scenarios, in which phenomenological constraints typically impose a lower bound on the new-physics scale of order a few hundred to several thousand TeV.</description>

      <title>Two-Loop DGLAP Splitting Functions from Light Cone Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a two-loop calculation in Light Cone Perturbation Theory (LCPT) to evaluate the next-to-leading order nonsinglet splitting function. Our calculation demonstrates the methodology and feasibility of performing higher order calculations in LCPT. Since in Hamiltonian perturbation theory the longitudinal $k^+$ momentum is always positive, poles in $1/k^+$ can be regularized by a simple cutoff which cancels in physical results, without any associated ambiguities. For transverse momentum integrals we use dimensional regularization. Developing methods for loop calculations in LCPT paves the way for a systematical, automatizable procedure for precision calculations in this framework with a transparent physical partonic interpretation. This can provide a standard framework in higher order calculations in the gluon saturation regime of QCD.</description>

      <title>On the reconstruction of kinematic distributions computed with Monte Carlo methods using orthogonal basis functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstruction of one-dimensional kinematic distributions from calculations based on high-dimensional Monte-Carlo integration is a standard problem in high-energy physics. Traditionally, this is done by collecting randomly-generated events in histograms. In this article, we explore an alternative approach, whose main idea is to approximate the target distribution by a weighted sum of orthogonal basis functions whose coefficients are calculated using the Monte-Carlo integration. This method has the advantage of directly yielding smooth approximations to target distributions. Furthermore, in the context of high-order perturbative calculations with local subtractions, it eliminates the so-called bin-to-bin fluctuations, which often severely affect the quality of conventional histograms. We also demonstrate that the availability of a high-quality approximation to the target distribution, for example the leading-order result in the perturbative expansion, can be exploited to construct an optimized orthonormal basis. We compare the performance of this method to conventional histograms in both toy-model and real Monte-Carlo settings, applying it to Higgs boson production in weak boson fusion as an example.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate six singly Cabibbo-suppressed decay channels in $D^0\to VP$ ( $V$ and $P$ stand for the ground state vector and pseudoscalar mesons, respectively), i.e. $D^{0}\to \rho^{+}\pi^{-}$, $\rho^{-}\pi^{+}$, $K^{*+}K^{-}$, $K^{*-}K^{+}$, $K^{*0}\bar{K}^{0}$, and $\bar{K}^{*0}K^{0}$. These decay channels share the similar transition mechanisms involving only the direct emission (DE) and internal conversion (IC) processes. We show that a combined analysis of these channels can explicitly highlight the role played by the IC processes which contribute to the amplitudes at the same order of magnitude as the DE processes.</description>

Abstract: In this work, the massless-massive correspondence for the on-shell scattering amplitudes is constructed so the massive amplitudes could inherit advantageous techniques developed in the massless calculation. This correspondence is established by matching massless amplitudes to Minimal Helicity-Chirality (MHC) amplitudes, which arise from an expansion of massive spin-spinor amplitudes in terms of the chirality-flip $m\eta$ order by order. The primary MHC amplitude deforms into a massless amplitude of the same helicity; if a vector boson is involved, it may instead vanish due to the associated conserved current. In cases where the primary amplitude vanishes, the leading contributions originate from descendant MHC amplitudes, each corresponding to a distinct massless amplitude in the ultraviolet theory containing either a transverse gauge boson or a Goldstone boson. We propose a systematic amplitude deformation procedure for three-point massless-massive matching based on helicity-chirality unification and the scaling properties of $m\eta$. Sub-leading MHC amplitudes are matched to massless amplitudes with additional on-shell Higgs splitting, a process known as on-shell Higgsing. In this work, we extend and reinterpret on-shell Higgsing as a transversality flip between different MHC states, and obtain all the 3-point massless-massive matching results in the spontaneous broken standard model.</description>

      <title>Massless-Massive Amplitude Correspondence II: Constructive Massive Amplitudes in Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the minimal helicity-chirality formalism, we systematically construct higher-point massive amplitudes from the fundamental building blocks: the contact three-point and four-point massive amplitudes. The inclusion of four-point contact amplitudes is essential to maintain gauge invariance in the spontaneously broken Standard Model. We construct all the standard model massive contact amplitudes and identify the physical light-cone gauge nature of massive amplitudes. Then only using the contact minimal helicity-chirality amplitudes at the leading order, we show both bootstrap techniques and on-shell recursion relations can be utilized to compute higher-point massive amplitudes. This provides a systematic framework for constructing various higher-point electroweak amplitudes, analogous to established on-shell methods for massless theories. Finally by deforming the gauge-invariant $n$-point amplitudes, we extend the massless-massive correspondence from three-and-four point contact amplitudes to general $n$-point factorized amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Medium-Induced Quarkonium Dissociation at Finite Chemical Potential and Weak Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the in-medium modification and dissociation of heavy quarkonium in a hot QCD medium at finite quark chemical potential and in the weak magnetic-field regime. Starting from the one-loop resummed gluon propagator in the imaginary-time formalism, and incorporating non-perturbative effects through a phenomenological correction to the HTL description, we compute the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric permittivity. This, in turn, leads to a complex heavy-quark potential: the real part is used to determine binding energies by solving the nonrelativistic Schr\"odinger equation, while the imaginary part generates thermal decay widths, dominated by Landau damping. Within the explored parameter range, temperature has the greatest control over Debye screening, potential modification, and quarkonium stability, whereas finite density and weak magnetic fields introduce comparatively smaller quantitative changes. As the temperature increases, binding energies decrease and thermal widths grow, giving rise to the expected hierarchy between ground and excited states and a sequential suppression pattern in the dissociation temperatures. Overall, our results indicate that while finite chemical potential and weak magnetic fields can shift quarkonium properties in a measurable way, thermal effects remain the primary driver of dissociation, with direct relevance for heavy-ion collision phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Exploring the hadronic phase with momentum and azimuthal distribution of short-lived resonances and understanding the internal structure of exotic resonances with ALICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hadronic resonances are crucial probes to understand the various phases of matter created during relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Due to their short lifetimes, the yields of these resonances can be affected by competing rescattering and regeneration mechanisms in the final hadronic phase. Rescattering can alter the momentum of the resonance decay products, limiting their reconstruction through the invariant-mass technique, while pseudo-elastic scattering can regenerate them. Final state observables such as elliptic flow, transverse momentum spectra, and measured yields of resonances could be significantly modified due to the interaction in the hadronic phase. By comparing the yields of longer-lived resonances, such as the $\phi$-meson with shorter-lived ones, such as the K$^*$(892), it is possible to obtain information about the properties and timescales of the hadronic phase. This contribution presents new Run 3 results on production yields, spectra, and flow harmonics for K$^*$(892) and $\phi$(1020) in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.36 TeV obtained by the ALICE Collaboration. The results are compared with state-of-the-art models to interpret the underlying mechanism that can describe the experimental observations. In addition to probe hadronic phase, the study of resonances also offers valuable insights into the non-perturbative regime of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Resonances such as the f$_0$(980) and f$_1$(1285) challenge the traditional quark model. Their structure is yet unknown as they could potentially be tetraquark states or meson-meson molecules. This contribution presents new measurements of exotic resonances such as f$_0$(980), f$_1$(1285), and the glueball candidates to get more insight into their internal structure.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Description of Critical Bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-order phase transitions occur through the nucleation of critical bubbles of the stable phase within the metastable phase. Using holography, we present a fully microscopic description of these bubbles in a strongly coupled, four-dimensional gauge theory at finite temperature. In the gravitational dual, these bubbles correspond to static, inhomogeneous and unstable black-brane solutions with a localized deformation on the horizon. We construct these solutions across the entire metastable branch and compute the surface tension and the nucleation rate. We then compare these microscopic results with those obtained from a two-derivative effective action for the order parameter in two different scenarios. When the effective action is derived from the microscopic theory via holography, we find remarkable agreement. However, when the effective action is constrained only by the equation of state and dimensional analysis, significant discrepancies emerge. These discrepancies can be resolved if an additional constraint related to the surface tension is imposed.</description>

      <title>The collectivity of transverse momentum fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the observable $v_0(p_T)$, which quantifies the relative change of $p_T$ spectra induced by event-by-event density fluctuations in the medium created in heavy-ion collisions. This quantity provides a direct measure of radial flow and serves as a probe of collectivity, complementing anisotropic flow coefficients. Using hydrodynamic model calculations, we predict the behavior of $v_0(p_T)$ and show that the scaled quantity $v_0(p_T)/v_0$ exhibits very little dependence on centrality and transport coefficients. We further find that the apparent influence of transport coefficients$-$particularly bulk viscosity$-$ on $v_0(p_T)$ largely originates from modifications of the event-averaged mean transverse momentum, $\langle p_T \rangle$. By expressing $v_0(p_T)/v_0$ as a function of $p_T/\langle p_T \rangle$, the genuine sensitivity of $v_0(p_T)$ to transport coefficients can be isolated. Moreover, since $v_0(p_T)$ is the $p_T$-differential measure of event-by-event $[p_T]$ fluctuations, it naturally explains the observed $p_T$-cut dependence of $\sigma_{p_T}$ measured by ATLAS collaboration.</description>

      <title>Minimally Truncated SU(3) Lattice Gauge Theory and String Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study SU(3) gauge theory on small lattices in the minimal (qutrit) electric field truncation retaining only the ${\bf 1}, {\bf 3}, {\bf \overline{3}}$ representations for the link variables. Explicit expressions are given for the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian for the square plaquette chain and the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice. Our formalism can be easily extended to the minimally truncated general SU($N_c$) gauge theory. The addition of (static) quarks is discussed. We present results for the energy spectrum of the gauge field on these lattices by exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian and analyze its statistical properties. We also compute the SU(3) string tension and discuss how it is modified by vacuum fluctuations. Finally, we calculate the potential energies of a static quark-antiquark pair and three static quarks and study their screening at finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Rapid post-merger signal of circularly polarized gravitational wave from magnetic black hole superradiance: novel approach to detect magnetic monopole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analytic framework demonstrating that a spinning black hole endowed with a net magnetic charge exhibits a dramatically amplified superradiant instability against charged scalar fields, enhanced by several orders of magnitude compared with the neutral Kerr case. The amplification arises from a monopole induced reduction of the centrifugal barrier. This shift deepens the gravitational bound-state potential well and produces a parametrically larger instability growth rate. This resulting rapid growth yields a macroscopic boson cloud that acts as a coherent source of near monochromatic continuous gravitational waves (GWs). We find an enhanced GW power. Monopole harmonic selection rules restrict the emission from the north (south) clouds corresponding to opposite helicities. Their superposition generates an (approximately) circularly polarized continuous GWs at a fixed sky location within even parity general relativity, distinct from the generic elliptical polarization of the Kerr case. In light of these new findings, we propose a potential smoking-gun search strategy for magnetic monopole and ultralight boson: the rapid post-merger follow-up GW signals from binary-black-hole merger remnants through ground-based and space-based GW experiments. In contrast to the Kerr case, where the signal turn-on can be delayed to decades-centuries, a magnetic remnant can form a cloud and emit a stronger, circularly polarized continuous GWs within weeks to months. Taking the magnetic supermassive remnants as an example, we demonstrate that the rapid follow-up GW signal in the mHz band appears just in few weeks after binary black hole mergers. Moreover, future polarization (ellipticity) measurements can distinguish the magnetic scenario from Kerr while providing a parity-even mechanism for circularly polarized GWs in general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Energy Correlators as probes of strongly-coupled nearly-conformal field theories within their holographically dual descriptions, focusing on the important features that appear in realistic theories going beyond the standard model. In particular, we study warped geometries which asymptote to $\text{AdS}_5$, as well as IR-truncations dual to a 4D gap. Our correlators are computed by in-in type Witten perturbative diagrams, corresponding to a large-N expansion of the strong dynamics. We describe how this sets the stage for phenomenological applications for collider searches beyond the standard model as well as for new theoretical explorations in Lorentzian holography.</description>

      <title>The Effective Theory of Muon-to-Electron Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We summarize recent work to develop an effective theory of muon-to-electron conversion, based on a complete set of low-energy effective operators that are developed from a systematic expansion in velocities and momenta. The expansion effectively factors rates into sums of particle physics and nuclear physics terms, where the former are expressed as bilinears in the LECs (the low-energy constants of the effective theory) and the latter are the associated nuclear responses. One can view the nuclear responses as ``dials" that can be adjusted -- for example, by selection of targets with specific properties -- in order to isolate the former. We show that an important dial, in the case of Mu2e and COMET, will be inelastic transitions to certain low-energy nuclear states that are resolvable in 27Al. If these transitions are exploited, the experiments have the potential not only to discover charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV), but to determine the operators responsible for the CLFV. We also discuss how such low-energy results can be ``ported" to higher energies through a tower of matched EFTs, so they can be combined with other experimental limits to further constrain CLFV</description>

      <title>Electroweak phase transition with the confinement scale of the strong sector or dilaton in the minimal composite Higgs model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02972v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The minimal Composite Higgs model (MCHM) provides an effective trigger for the Baryogenesis scenario through the confinement scale of the strong sector ($f$) or dilaton ($\chi$). $f$ is a parameter with mass dimension, which stores the resonances of particles at high energies and has a suitable value of about $800$ GeV. But when $300$ GeV $\le f \le 400$ GeV, the effective Higgs potential has a first-order electroweak phase transition. Therefore, although $f$ cannot be a perfect trigger, it does suggest an effective approach that accommodates the resonances of particles. Thus the investigation of the electroweak phase transition according to $f$ has confirmed that the inclusion of the dilaton in the effective potential is reasonable. Accordingly, we derive a dilaton potential with appropriate parameter domains and $f=800$ GeV; the mass of the dilaton ranges from $300$ GeV to $700$ GeV, which will give an electroweak phase transition strength greater than $1$ and less than $3$, enough for a first-order phase transition. This is a direct and clear evidence of the triggers for the first-order EWPT in the MCHM.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative determination of the sphaleron rate for first-order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many extensions of the Standard Model electroweak phase transitions at high temperatures can be described in a minimal dimensionally reduced effective theory with SU(2) gauge field and fundamental Higgs scalar. In this effective theory, all thermodynamic information is governed by two dimensionless ratios $x \equiv \lambda_3/g^2_3$ and $y\equiv m^2_3/g^4_3$, where $\lambda_3$, $m^2_3$ and $g_3$ are the effective thermal scalar self-interaction coupling, the thermal mass and the effective gauge-coupling, respectively. By using non-perturbative lattice simulations to determine the rate of sphaleron transitions in the entire $(x,y)$-plane corresponding to the Higgs phase, and by applying previous lattice results for the bubble nucleation, we find a condition $x(T_c) \lesssim 0.025$ to guarantee preservation of the baryon asymmetry, which translates to $v/T_c \equiv \sqrt{2 \Delta \langle \phi^\dagger \phi \rangle}/T_c \gtrsim 1.33$ for the (gauge-invariant) discontinuity in Higgs condensate. This indicates that viability of the electroweak baryogenesis requires the phase transition to be slightly stronger than previously anticipated. Finally, we present a general template for analysing such viability in a wide class of beyond the Standard Model theories, in which new fields are heavy enough to be integrated out at high temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lepton flavor universality is a key prediction of the Standard Model of particle physics and any violation of it immediately indicates the existence of new physics. Given the recent more than $4\sigma$ discrepancy in charged current semileptonic B meson decays and the absence of evident signals at the large hadron collider, independent cross-checks become invaluable. In this context, $b \to c$ semileptonic sum rules based on heavy quark symmetry are interesting since they allow us to check the consistency of experimental results. In this paper, we report newly found sum rules among angular observables of mesonic and baryonic $b\to c l \overline{\nu}$ decays holding exactly in the large mass limit of heavy quarks. Moreover, we investigate corrections to the sum rule in realistic situations and discuss phenomenological implications.</description>

Abstract: In the $SO(5) \times U(1) \times SU(3)$ gauge-Higgs unification in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) warped space neutrino oscillations and the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix in the $W$ couplings originate from Majorana mass terms on the ultraviolet brane in the RS space. Tiny neutrino masses are generated by an inverse seesaw mechanism. The PMNS matrix in the normal ordering with $\delta_{CP}=\pi$ naturally arises consistently with the NuFit-6.0 analysis of neutrino oscillation data.</description>

      <title>Scalar-induced Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay in $SU(5)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the role of heavy scalar fields in mediating neutrinoless double beta decay $(0\nu\beta\beta)$ within the $SU(5)$ Grand Unified Theory framework, extended suitably to include neutrino mass. In such a minimal realistic $SU(5)$ setup for fermion masses, the scalar contributions to $0\nu\beta\beta$ are extremely suppressed as a consequence of the proton decay bound. We circumvent this problem by imposing a discrete ${\cal Z}_3$ symmetry. However, the scalar contributions to $0\nu\beta\beta$ remain suppressed in this $SU(5) \times {\cal Z}_3$ model due to the neutrino mass constraint. We find that the $0\nu\beta\beta$ contribution can be enhanced by extending the scalar sector with an additional $\mathbf{15}$-dimensional scalar representation with suitable ${\cal Z}_3$ charge. Such an extension not only yields realistic fermion mass spectra but also leads to experimentally testable predictions in upcoming ton-scale $0\nu\beta\beta$ searches, which can be used as a sensitive probe of the new scalars across a broad range, from LHC-accessible scales up to $\sim 10^{10}\,\text{GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Pushing the hybrid approach to low beam energies with dynamic initial conditions from hadronic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While hybrid approaches of relativistic hydrodynamics+transport have been well established for the dynamical description of heavy-ion collisions at high beam energies, moving to lower beam energies is challenging. In this work, we propose dynamic initial conditions for the viscous hydrodynamic evolution in heavy-ion collisions at low to intermediate beam energies. They are comprised of core hadrons based on the local energy density during the pre-equilibrium hadronic evolution. The SMASH-vHLLE hybrid approach is then applied to lower beam energies, achieving good agreement with measured bulk observables between $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 3$ and $9.1\ \mathrm{GeV}$, thus providing guidance for measurements in STAR-BES and CBM at FAIR.</description>

      <title>$b \to c$ semileptonic sum rule: Current status and prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $b \to c$ semileptonic sum rules provide relations between the decay rates of $B \to D^{(*)} \tau\bar\nu$ and $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c \tau\bar\nu$. Starting from the heavy quark and zero-recoil limits, we revisit the derivation of the sum rule for total decay rates. We then examine deviations from the limits and investigate corrections arising from realistic hadron masses and higher-order contributions to form factors, taking account of uncertainties. We show that these corrections are negligible compared to current experimental uncertainties, indicating that the sum rule is useful for cross-checking experimental consistency and testing the validity of the Standard Model predictions. In future, precise determinations of the form factors particularly for the tensor operator will be necessary to compare the sum rule predictions with $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c \tau\bar\nu$ data from the LHCb experiment and the Tera-Z projects.</description>

      <title>Constructing heavy-quark sum rule for $b \to c$ meson and baryon decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study heavy-hadron semileptonic decays proceeding via $b \to c$ transition, such as $B \to D^{(*)}\tau\bar{\nu}_\tau$ and $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c\tau\bar{\nu}_\tau$. In the heavy-quark limit, where the heavy-quark symmetry holds, we provide a fundamental framework for heavy-quark sum rules among these decays based on the spin decomposition picture. The relation holds directly for the squared amplitudes without requiring phase-space integration. We then apply this relation to reproduce the sum rule among $B \to D^{(*)}\tau\bar{\nu}_\tau$ and $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c\tau\bar{\nu}_\tau$. Furthermore, we derive new sum rules for $\Omega_b \to \Omega_c^{(*)}$ transitions and those involving excited states, such as $B \to \{D_0^*,D_1^*\}$ and $B \to \{D_1,D_2^*\}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the spectra and radiative decays of the triply heavy baryons $\Omega_{ccc}$ and $\Omega_{bbb}$ within a quark-diquark framework using a relativistic screened potential model. The analysis is carried out by solving a relativized Hamiltonian for a two-body bound system: the diquark masses are first determined, after which each baryon is treated as a composite of the diquark and the third quark. Employing the obtained wave functions, we calculate electromagnetic transitions using the E1 and M1 operators. We report complete $N_{d} L_{d} n_{q} l_{q}$ spectra together with E1/M1 decay widths for radially and orbitally excited states, and systematically compare our results with those from other theoretical approaches.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic tomography of spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ hidden-charm strange pentaquarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26893v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how quarks are spatially arranged inside exotic pentaquarks remains one of the key open problems in contemporary hadron spectroscopy. The electromagnetic multipole moments of hadrons provide a direct probe of their internal quark--gluon geometry and spatial charge distributions. Motivated by this, we employ QCD light-cone sum rules to compute the magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole, and magnetic octupole moments of the $J^P = 3/2^-$ pentaquark with strangeness $S = -1$. Five distinct diquark--diquark--antiquark interpolating currents are constructed to explore possible internal configurations. The resulting electromagnetic moments exhibit pronounced sensitivity to the underlying quark arrangement: magnetic dipole moments range from $-2.28\mu_N$ to $+3.36\mu_N$, establishing this observable as a key discriminator among configurations with identical quantum numbers. Nonzero electric quadrupole and magnetic octupole moments indicate clear deviations from spherical symmetry, while a detailed decomposition shows that light quarks dominate the magnetic response and the charm quark drives quadrupole deformation. These findings position electromagnetic multipole moments as quantitative and discriminating probes of exotic hadron structure, providing concrete benchmarks for forthcoming LHCb, Belle II, and lattice QCD studies.</description>

Abstract: We study the $\gamma\gamma \to \tau^+\tau^-$ process including full $\tau^+ \tau^-$ spin information in Pb--Pb ultraperipheral collision and at lepton colliders. We present the predictions for the corresponding cross sections and spin correlations at NLO electroweak precision, and find that the NLO electroweak contributions are numerically small for the observables considered. Additionally, we use the spin correlations obtained in this paper to analyze the quantum entanglement in the $\tau^+\tau^-$ system of the $\gamma\gamma \to \tau^+\tau^-$ process. Our results show that there is a genuine entangled configuration near the $\tau^+\tau^-$ invariant mass threshold. This work is helpful for studying the $\tau$-pair production induced by photon-photon collision at high energy colliders.</description>

Abstract: I construct and analyze a dark matter sector that is neutral under the unbroken Standard Model gauge group and couples only to the broken $\text{SU}(5)$ gauge directions, the leptoquark vectors $X,Y$. An exact $\mathbb Z_2$ renders the dark matter stable. I give a gauge-covariant definition of projectors onto the unbroken Standard Model and broken ($X,Y$) subspaces, demonstrate that the covariant derivative of dark matter selects only $X,Y$, and integrate out $X,Y$ at tree level to obtain the leading effective operators. I also derive the loop-induced $\chi^2\,G^a_{\mu\nu}G^{a\mu\nu}$ coupling to gluons, prove color neutrality, and show consistency with cold dark matter phenomenology. Cosmological production proceeds via UV freeze-in or even more suppressed channels in.</description>

      <title>Three-loop jet function for boosted top quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the calculation of the inclusive jet function for highly energetic heavy quarks at order $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ using boosted Heavy-Quark Effective Theory (bHQET). This jet function describes the effect of collinear radiation emitted by energetic heavy quarks on observables dependent on the jet invariant mass $M$. In particular, we focus on the regime $M^2 - m^2 \ll m^2$, which is relevant for boosted top quark production at high-energy colliders in the resonance region. Our results are consistent with non-Abelian exponentiation and reproduce the known cusp and non-cusp anomalous dimensions up to three loops. We also verify that the $n_\ell^2 \alpha_s^3$ contribution, with $n_\ell$ denoting the number of light quark flavors, agrees with predictions from renormalon calculus. This calculation completes the list of ingredients required for the N$^3$LL$^\prime$ resummed (self-normalized) thrust distribution, an essential component for calibrating the top quark mass parameter in parton-shower Monte Carlo generators. It likewise contributes to the invariant-mass distribution of reconstructed top quarks, enabling precise mass determinations at future lepton colliders. Finally, we determine the relation between the pole and two short-distance jet-mass schemes at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ and provide an estimate of the non-logarithmic part of the four-loop jet function based on renormalon dominance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I review the standard instanton framework for determining the $\theta$-dependence of instanton-dominated correlation functions in QCD. I then contrast these well-established semiclassical results with the recent assertion of [1,2], that $\theta$-phases are absent and that strong interactions preserve CP for all values of $\theta$. In all scenarios considered, the $\theta$-dependence is shown to be intrinsically non-trivial, being governed either by instantons in the weak-coupling regime or by alternative, non-perturbative considerations when the theory is strongly coupled.</description>

      <title>An Excited Dark Matter Solution to the MeV Galactic Center Excesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent COMPTEL data analysis reveals a $\sim$ 2 MeV continuum excess whose spatial distribution closely matches the long-standing 511 keV line observed by INTEGRAL/SPI, indicating a common population of low-energy positrons that is difficult to reconcile with known astrophysical sources or standard thermal dark matter (DM). We show that a minimal Excited Dark Matter (XDM) model naturally explains these features. In this scenario a DM particle $\chi$ is inelastically upscattered into an excited state $\chi^*$, followed by de-excitation $\chi^*\to\chi e^+ e^-$ producing $\sim$2 MeV positrons that reproduce the 511 keV line morphology and the COMPTEL MeV continuum. Using a full cosmic-ray (CR) propagation treatment, we obtain an excellent fit for $m_\chi\simeq$ 1.5 TeV DM particle with mass-splitting $\Delta m =m_{\chi^*}-m_\chi \simeq$ 4 MeV for an inelastic geometric scattering cross section of $\sigma_\textrm{mr}= 3-4\times 10^{-23}\,\textrm{cm}^2$. The same positrons supply a substantial, radially flat contribution to the anomalous Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) ionization rate. This is the first unified treatment of XDM-induced positrons across all three observables, yielding correlated MeV signatures testable by upcoming missions targeting the Galactic MeV band.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the concept of partonic entropy of the proton within the Dokshitzer--Gribov--Lipatov--Altarelli--Parisi (DGLAP) evolution scheme of collinear parton distributions. We show that such entropy increases monotonically with the evolution scale. The mechanism underlying this growth is illustrated using a simplified model of DGLAP evolution, highlighting the importance of including saturation effects at small x in the evolution of parton distributions, which tame the otherwise unbounded growth of partonic entropy. Based on existing literature, we present two simplified models of parton saturation at small x. In one of these models, partonic entropy is identified with entanglement entropy and proposed as an experimentally testable observable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive threshold resummation of semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS), by building upon previous results by some of us for the resummation of the Drell-Yan process at fixed rapidity, which is related to SIDIS by crossing. We consider both a double-soft limit, in which both the Bjorken and the fragmentation scaling variables tend to their threshold value, and single soft limits in which either of them does. We show that in the former limit only soft radiation contributes, and in the latter limit only collinear radiation, and we derive resummed expressions for the coefficient functions in all cases. We determine explictly resummation coefficients in the nonsinglet channel up to next-to-next-to-leading log by comparing to recent fixed next-to-next-to-leading order results. Expanding out the single-soft resummation we reproduce recent next-to-leading power results.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We firstly carry out a systematic analysis on the spin $\frac{1}{2}^{+}\rightarrow\frac{3}{2}^{+}$ weak transition process in the framework of three-point QCD sum rules, where the initial and final states are doubly and singly charmed baryons. In the phenomenological side, all possible couplings of interpolating current to hadronic states are considered. In doing operator production expansion at QCD side, the contributions of the perturbative part, vacuum condensate terms of $\langle{\bar qq}\rangle$, $\langle g_{s}^{2}GG\rangle$, $\langle \bar q g_{s}\sigma Gq\rangle$ and $g_{s}^{2}\langle{\bar qq}\rangle^{2}$ are all considered. After the form factors in space-like region ($Q^2&gt;0$) are obtained, the numerical results are extrapolated into time-like region ($Q^2&lt;0$) by a fitting function. Using the predicted form factors, we finally analyze the semileptonic decays of $\Xi_{cc}^{++}\rightarrow \Sigma_{c}^{*+}l^{+}\nu_{l}$, $\Xi_{cc}^{++}\rightarrow \Xi_{c}^{\prime*+}l^{+}\nu_{l}$, $\Omega_{cc}^{+}\rightarrow\Xi_{c}^{\prime*0}l^{+}\nu_{l}$ and $\Omega_{cc}^{+}\rightarrow \Omega_{c}^{*0}l^{+}\nu_{l}$ with $l=e,\mu$. The predictions in this work can deepen our understanding of the dynamics in the decay processes of doubly heavy baryons and provide useful information to explore the possibility of new physics in heavy baryonic decay channels.</description>

Abstract: Noether's first and second theorems both imply conserved currents that can be identified as an energy-momentum tensor (EMT). The first theorem identifies the EMT as the conserved current associated with global spacetime translations, while the second theorem identifies it as a conserved current associated with local spacetime translations. This work obtains an EMT for quantum electrodynamics and quantum chromodynamics through the second theorem, which is automatically symmetric in its indices and invariant under the expected symmetries (e.g., BRST invariance) without the need for introducing an ad hoc improvement procedure.</description>

      <title>Unified Origin of Curvature Perturbation and Baryon Asymmetry of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07694v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a unified framework that describes both the curvaton mechanism for generating primordial density fluctuations and the Affleck-Dine (AD) mechanism for baryogenesis. By introducing a complex scalar field (AD field) carrying a baryon/lepton number and its potential consisting of quadratic and quartic terms with a small baryon/lepton-number-violating mass term, we investigate the evolution of the scalar field during the radiation-dominated era following inflation. We set the initial conditions such that the quartic term dominates the scalar potential, and the angular component of the AD field is non-zero. We focus on a scenario where the AD field sufficiently dominates the energy density of the universe before its decay. We show that the radial component of the AD field can be identified with the curvaton to solely produce the Planck normalized scalar power spectrum while the evolution of the angular component is crucial for generating the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe. Additionally, we find that the amplitude of scalar bispectrum $f_{NL}$ is negative, which is consistent with the current Planck data and testable in future observations such as CMB-S4, LiteBIRD, LSS, and 21-cm experiments. In our estimation of the scalar power spectrum and bispectrum, we develop a novel analytical scheme for computing scalar fluctuations based on the $\delta N$ formalism, which allows us to deal with the evolution of curvaton with polynomial potential more accurately in comparison to the existing analytical methods.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave Signatures of Nonstandard Neutrino Properties in Collapsing Stellar Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel multi-messenger approach for probing nonstandard neutrino properties through the detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from collapsing stellar cores and associated supernova explosions. We show that neutrino flavor conversion inside the proto-neutron star (PNS), motivated by physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), can significantly boost PNS convection. This effect leads to large-amplitude GW emission over a wide frequency range during an otherwise relatively quiescent GW phase shortly after core bounce. Such a signal provides a promising new avenue for exploring nonstandard neutrino phenomena and other BSM physics impacting PNS convection.</description>

      <title>Probing Spin-2 Ultralight Dark Matter with Space-based Gravitational Wave Detectors in the mHz Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin-2 ultralight dark matter (ULDM) is a viable dark matter candidate and it can be constrained using gravitational wave (GW) observations. In this paper, we investigate the detectability of spin-2 ULDM by space-based GW interferometers. By considering a direct coupling between spin-2 ULDM and ordinary matter, we derive the corresponding response functions and sensitivity curves for various time-delay interferometry channels and calculate the optimal sensitivity curves for future millihertz GW detectors. Our results demonstrate that the space-based detectors can place stringent constraints on the coupling constant of spin-2 ULDM, reaching $\alpha \sim 10^{-10}$ around a mass of $m \sim 10^{-17} \rm eV$, surpassing current limits from ground-based detectors and pulsar timing arrays. Thus, the space-based GW detectors can serve as powerful tools not only for detecting GWs but also for probing fundamental properties of ultralight dark matter.</description>

      <title>Detectability of dark matter subhalo impacts in Milky Way stellar streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07781v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar streams are a promising way to probe the gravitational effects of low-mass dark matter (DM) subhalos. In recent years, there has been a remarkable explosion in the number of stellar streams detected in the Milky Way, and hundreds more may be discovered with future surveys such as LSST. Studies of DM subhalo impacts on streams have so far focused on a few of the thinnest and brightest streams, and it is not known how much information can be gained from the others. In this work, we develop a method to quickly estimate the minimum detectable DM subhalo mass of a given stream, depending on its width, length, distance, and stellar density. We use an analytic model for the impacts and apply a test statistic to determine whether they are detectable. We consider several observational scenarios, based on current and future surveys including Gaia, DESI, Via, and LSST. We find that at 95% confidence level, a stream like GD-1 has a minimum detectable subhalo mass of $\sim 6\times 10^6~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ in Gaia data and $\sim 8\times 10^5~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ with LSST 10 year sensitivity. Applying our results to confirmed Milky Way streams, we rank order them by their sensitivity to DM subhalos and identify promising ones for further study.</description>

      <title>Accessing proton number fluctuations in limited regions of phase space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In heavy ion collisions particle distributions fluctuate from event to event. It is interesting to study local fluctuations of a specific particle specie, e.g. baryons, in the transverse plane. Fluctuations of the harmonic flow provide an integrated measure of such fluctuations. An alternative approach is to study proton number fluctuations measured in a relatively narrow azimuthal angle window. Due to the transverse flow, particles registered in a narrow azimuthal angle window are emitted predominantly from a region of the fireball located at the same azimuthal angle. Similarly, it is informative to measure the covariance of the number of protons emitted in two opposite windows of azimuthal angles. The main difficulty lies in distinguishing effects of local baryon density fluctuations in the transverse plane from global particle density and collective flow fluctuations. These global volume and flow fluctuations can be estimated using some reference particles, e.g. charged mesons. Reliable estimates of such fluctuations can be constructed both for the second factorial cumulant of the proton number in an azimuthal angle window and for the covariance between two such windows. The simultaneous measurement of both quantities provides a sensitive probe of local baryon number fluctuations superimposed on top of a fluctuating fireball background density.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Constraints on Neutrino Masses in a Second-Order CPL Dark Energy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent DESI results indicate a strong preference for dynamical dark energy (DE) when baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements are combined with supernovae (SNe) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data using the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization. We analyze the exponential (EXP) parameterization, which introduces a second-order correction to CPL. We determine and compare the 95% upper bounds on the sum of neutrino masses for three dark energy (DE) models -- $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and EXP -- across four neutrino mass hierarchies (1 massive/2 massless, degenerate, normal, inverted) and multiple dataset combinations (CMB$+$BAO, CMB$+$BAO$+$PantheonPlus, CMB$+$BAO$+$DESY5), employing both Bayesian and frequentist frameworks with physical lower limits from oscillation experiments (0.059 eV and 0.11 eV). Our results show that CPL yields tighter ($\lesssim10$%) bounds compared to EXP. We further confirm earlier findings that neutrino mass constraints are only mildly sensitive to the assumed hierarchy and that the frequentist bounds are tighter than Bayesian ones. Furthermore, the imposed oscillation lower limits, the datasets used and the DE parameterizations play a crucial role in the inferred cosmological neutrino mass bounds. For the datasets, hierarchies, and DE parameterizations considered, we find no statistically significant evidence for nonzero neutrino mass consistent with oscillation lower limits.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Kerr black hole: Tsallis-Cirto composition law and entropy quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00748v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The processes of splitting and merging of black holes obey the composition law generated by the Tsallis-Cirto $\delta=2$ statistics. The same composition law expresses the full entropy of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole via the entropies of its outer and inner horizons. He we apply this composition law to the entropy of the Kerr black hole. As distinct from Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, where the full entropy depends only on mass $M$ and does not depend on its charge $Q$, the entropy of Kerr black hole is the sum of contributions from its mass $M$ and angular momentum $J$, i.e. $S(M,J)=S(M,0) + 4\pi \sqrt{J(J+1)}$. Here $S(M,0)$ is the entropy of the Schwarzschild black hole. This demonstrates that when the Kerr black hole with $J\gg 1$ absorbs or emits a massless particle with spin $s_z=\pm 1/2$, its entropy changes by $|\Delta S| = 2\pi$. We also considered the quantization of entropy suggested by the toy model, in which the black hole thermodynamics is represented by the ensemble of the Planck-scale black holes -- Planckons. The Tsallis-Cirto composition law is also extended to the entropy of Kerr-Newman black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose quantum-mechanical systems in which the number of spatial dimensions is promoted to a dynamical quantum variable, making the effective dimension state-dependent. Interestingly, systems of this form can exhibit enhanced symmetries compared to their fixed-dimensional counterparts. As an explicit example, we analyze a two-state system for which the number of spatial dimensions is represented by a quantum operator. By evaluating the corresponding partition function, we uncover a temperature-dependent effective dimension. Our framework opens a new avenue for constructing physical systems, from gravity to condensed matter, where the very notion of dimensionality becomes quantum.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-based Unfolding for Cross Section Measurements in the Presence of Nuisance Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistically correcting measured cross sections for detector effects is an important step across many applications. In particle physics, this inverse problem is known as unfolding. In cases with complex instruments, the distortions they introduce are often known only implicitly through simulations of the detector. Modern machine learning has enabled efficient simulation-based approaches for unfolding high-dimensional data. Among these, one of the first methods successfully deployed on experimental data is the OmniFold algorithm, a classifier-based Expectation-Maximization procedure. In practice, however, the forward model is only approximately specified, and the corresponding uncertainty is encoded through nuisance parameters. Building on the well-studied OmniFold algorithm, we show how to extend machine learning-based unfolding to incorporate nuisance parameters. Our new algorithm, called Profile OmniFold, is demonstrated using a Gaussian example as well as a particle physics case study using simulated data from the CMS Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider.</description>

      <title>Correlators are simpler than wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several recent works have revealed a simplicity in equal-time correlators that is absent in their wavefunction counterparts. In this letter, we show that this arises from the simple fact that the correlator is obtained by integrating Feynman propagators over the full spacetime, as opposed to the half-space for the wavefunction. Several striking new properties of correlators for any graph are made obvious from this picture. Certain patterns of poles that appear in the wavefunction do not appear in the correlator. The correlator also enjoys several remarkable factorization properties in various limits. Most strikingly, the correlator admits a systematic Laurent expansion in the neighborhood of every pole, with the first subleading term vanishing for every pole. There is an especially simple understanding of the expansion around the total energy pole up to second order, given by a differential operator acting on the amplitude. Finally, we show how these results extend beyond single graphs to the full correlator in Tr $\phi^3$ theory.</description>

      <title>Towards a unified quantum field theory of dark energy and inflation: unstable de Sitter vacuum and running vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inflation is a necessary cosmic mechanism to cure basic inconsistencies of the standard model of cosmology. These problems are usually `fixed' by postulating the existence of a scalar field (called the ``inflaton''). However, other less ad hoc options are possible. In the running vacuum model (RVM) framework, the vacuum energy density (VED) is a function of the Hubble rate $H$ and its time derivatives: $\rho_{\rm vac}=\rho_{\rm vac}(H, \dot{H},\ddot{H},\dots)$. In this context, the VED is dynamical (there is no rigid cosmological constant $\Lambda$). In the FLRW epoch, $\rho_{\rm vac}$ evolves very slowly with expansion, as befits the observed $\Lambda\simeq$const. behavior. In contrast, in the very early universe the vacuum fluctuations induce higher powers $H^N$ capable of unleashing fast inflation in a short period in which $H\simeq$ const. We call this mechanism `RVM-inflation'. It does not require an inflaton field since inflation is brought about by pure quantum field theory (QFT) effects on the dynamical background. It is different from Starobinsky's inflation, in which $H$ is never constant. In this work, we study a closely related scenario: the decay of the exact de Sitter vacuum into FLRW spacetime in its radiation epoch and the subsequent impact on the current universe, and compare with the RVM. We find that in both cases inflation is driven by $H^4$ powers together with subleading contributions of order $H^2$ that ease a graceful-exit transition into the radiation-dominated epoch, where the FLRW regime starts and ultimately develops a mildly evolving VED in the late universe: $\delta\rho_{\rm vac}\sim {\cal O}(m_{\rm Pl} ^2 H^2)$. The net outcome is an unified QFT approach to inflation and dark energy (conceived as dynamical vacuum energy) with potentially measurable phenomenological consequences in the present universe which can help cure the cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>Bogomol'nyi Equations in Two-Species Born--Infeld Theories Governing Vortices and Antivortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive several new Bogomol'nyi (self-dual) equations in two-species $U(1)\times U(1)$ gauge theories governed by the Born--Infeld nonlinear electrodynamics. By identifying appropriate Born--Infeld type Higgs potentials, we show that the highly nonlinear energy functionals admit exact topological lower bounds saturated by coupled first-order equations. The resulting models accommodate both vortex-vortex and vortex-antivortex configurations and generalize previously known single-species Born--Infeld systems to interacting multi-component settings.
  Beyond the derivation of the Bogomol'nyi equations, we develop an exact thermodynamic theory for pinned multivortex configurations in both the full plane and compact doubly periodic domains. Owing to the linear dependence of the Bogomol'nyi energy spectrum on topological charges, we obtain closed-form expressions for the canonical partition function, internal energy, heat capacity, and magnetization. In compact domains, the Bradlow type geometric bounds constrain admissible vortex numbers and lead to qualitatively new high-temperature behavior. In particular, vortex-only systems exhibit spontaneous magnetization, while vortex-antivortex systems do not, reflecting the underlying symmetry between opposite topological charges. These results provide a rare analytically solvable framework for studying thermodynamics in nonlinear multi-component gauge theories regulated by the Born--Infeld electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Constraining axion-like dark matter with a radio-frequency atomic magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on a broadband search for axion-like-particle (ALP) interactions using a radio-frequency-operated $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atomic magnetometer. The instrument provides wide spectral coverage and sensitivity to an oscillating pseudomagnetic field that may be generated by the gradient coupling of the ALP field to the constituent fermions of atoms. We search for an ALP-gradient signature in the mass range $2.40\times10^{-10}\,\mathrm{eV}/c^{2}$--$2.11\times10^{-9}\,\mathrm{eV}/c^{2}$. No statistically significant signatures of an oscillating magnetic field are observed, and we derive upper limits on the corresponding ALP-proton, -neutron and -electron couplings, $g_{\alpha pp}$, $g_{\alpha nn}$ and $g_{\alpha ee}$, respectively. The result on $g_{\alpha pp}$ improves over previous laboratory searches, while the limits on $g_{\alpha nn}$ and $g_{\alpha ee}$ complement earlier laboratory searches and astrophysical bounds. The work extends searches for ALP-fermion interactions into a mass region largely unexplored in a dark-matter context, demonstrating the potential of our method for broadband axion-like particle searches targeting the Galactic dark-matter halo.</description>
