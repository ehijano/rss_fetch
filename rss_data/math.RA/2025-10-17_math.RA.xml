      <title>Higher power polyadic group rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces and systematically develops the theory of polyadic group rings, a higher arity generalization of classical group rings $\mathcal{R}[\mathsf{G}]$. We construct the fundamental operations of these structures, defining the $\mathbf{m}_{r}$-ary addition and $\mathbf{n}_{r} $-ary multiplication for a polyadic group ring $\mathrm{R}^{[\mathbf{m} _{r},\mathbf{n}_{r}]}=\mathcal{R}^{[m_{r},n_{r}]}[\mathsf{G}^{[n_{g}]}]$ built from an $(m_{r},n_{r})$-ring and an $n_{g}$-ary group. A central result is the derivation of the "quantization" conditions that interrelate these arities, governed by the arity freedom principle, which also extends to operations with higher polyadic powers. We establish key algebraic properties, including conditions for total associativity and the existence of a zero element and identity. The concepts of the polyadic augmentation map and augmentation ideal are generalized, providing a bridge to the classical theory. The framework is illustrated with explicit examples, solidifying the theoretical constructions. This work establishes a new foundation in ring theory with potential applications in cryptography and coding theory, as evidenced by recent schemes utilizing polyadic structures.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Twilled Lie Pseudolgebras and Their Deformation Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a unified framework for studying cohomology theories of various operators in the context of pseudoalgebras. The central tool in our approach is the notion of a quasi-twilled Lie pseudoalgebra. We introduce two types of deformation maps. Type I unifies modified $r$ matrices, crossed homomorphisms, derivations, and homomorphisms; and Type II provides a uniform treatment of relative Rota-Baxter operators, twisted Rota-Baxter operators, Reynolds operators, and deformation maps of matched pairs of Lie conformal algebras. We construct the corresponding controlling algebras and define cohomology theories for both types of deformation maps. These results recover existing cohomological results for known operators and yield new results, including the cohomology theory for modified $r$-matrices and deformation maps of matched pairs of Lie pseudoalgebras.</description>

      <title>Modules With Descending Chain Conditions on Endoimages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate endoartinian modules, which satisfy the descending chain condition on endoimages, and establish new characterizations that unify classical and generalized chain conditions. Over commutative rings, endoartinianity coincides with rings satisfying the strongly ACCR* with dim(R) = 0 and strongly DCCR* conditions. For principally injective rings, the endoartinian and endonoetherian rings are equivalent. Addressing a question of Facchini and Nazemian, we provide a condition under which isoartinian and Noetherian rings coincide, and we classify semiprime endoartinian rings as finite products of matrix rings over a division ring. We further show that endoartinianity is equivalent to the Kothe rings over principal ideal rings with central idempotents, and characterize such rings as finite products of artinian uniserial rings.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many left-symmetric structures on nilpotent Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dekimpe and Ongenae constructed infinitely many pairwise non-isomorphic complete left-symmetric structures on $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n\geq 6$. In this paper, we construct a family of complete left-symmetric structures on the cotangent Lie algebra $T^*\mathfrak{g}$ of a certain $n$-dimensional almost abelian nilpotent Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and give a condition under which two left-symmetric structures in this family are isomorphic. As a consequence of this result, we obtain infinitely many pairwise non-isomorphic left-symmetric structures on $T^{*}\mathfrak{g}$. As an application of this construction, we also obtain infinitely many symplectic structures on $T^{*}\mathfrak{g}$ which are pairwise non-symplectomorphic up to homothety.</description>

      <title>The algebraic square of an irreducible complex spinor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize, in every dimension and signature, the algebraic squares of an irreducible complex spinor as a pair of exterior forms satisfying a prescribed system of algebraic relations that we present in terms of the geometric product of the underlying quadratic vector space. As a result, we obtain a general correspondence between irreducible complex spinors and algebraically constrained exterior forms, which clarifies the subtle relationship between spinors and exterior forms and contributes towards the understanding of spinors as the square root of geometry. We use this formalism to construct the squares of an irreducible complex spinor in Euclidean dimensions up to six, and also to construct the squares of a generic, possibly non-pure and non-unit, irreducible complex chiral spinor in eight Euclidean dimensions. Elaborating on this result, we consider a natural notion of spinorial instanton that we study for connections on a principal bundle with a complex structure group as well as for curvings of a $\mathbb{C}^{\ast}$-bundle gerbe defined on a Lorentzian six-manifold.</description>

      <title>Hopf--Galois structures of cyclic type on parallel extensions of prime power degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $L/K$ be any finite separable extension with normal closure $\widetilde{L}/K$. An extension $L'/K$ is said to be $\textit{parallel to $L/K$}$ if $L'$ is an intermediate field of $\widetilde{L}/K$ with $[L':K]=[L:K]$. We study the following question -- Given that $L/K$ admits a Hopf--Galois structure of type $N$, does it imply that every extension parallel to $L/K$ also admits a Hopf--Galois structure of type $N$? We completely solve this problem when the degree $[L:K]$ is a prime power and the type $N$ is cyclic. Our approach is group-theoretic and uses the work of Greither--Pareigis and Byott.</description>

      <title>On compatibility of Koszul- and higher preprojective gradings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13283v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate compatibility of gradings for an almost Koszul or Koszul algebra $R$ that is also the higher preprojective algebra $\Pi_{n+1}(A)$ of an $n$-hereditary algebra $A$. For an $n$-representation finite algebra $A$, we show that $A$ must be Koszul if $\Pi_{n+1}(A)$ can be endowed with an almost Koszul grading. For an acyclic basic $n$-representation infinite algebra $A$, we show that $A$ must be Koszul if $\Pi_{n+1}(A)$ can be endowed with a Koszul grading. From this we deduce that a higher preprojective grading of an (almost) Koszul algebra $R = \Pi_{n+1}(A)$ is, in both cases, isomorphic to a cut of the (almost) Koszul grading. Up to a further assumption on the tops of the degree $0$ subalgebras for the different gradings, we also show a similar result without the basic assumption in the $n$-representation infinite case. As an application, we show that $n$-APR tilting preserves the property of being Koszul for $n$-representation infinite algebras.</description>

      <title>On Milnor $K$-theory in the imperfect residue case and applications to period-index problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a $(0,p)$-mixed characteristic complete discrete valued field $\mathcal{K}$ we define a class of finite field extensions called \emph{pseudo-perfect} extensions such that the natural restriction map on the mod-$p$ Milnor $K$-groups is trivial for all $p\neq 2$. This implies that pseudo-perfect extensions split every element in $H^i(\mathcal{K},\mu_p^{\otimes i-1})$ yielding period-index bounds for Brauer classes as well as higher cohomology classes of $\mathcal{K}$. As a corollary, we prove a conjecture of Bhaskhar-Haase that the Brauer $p$-dimension of $\mathcal{K}$ is upper bounded by $n+1$ where $n$ is the $p$-rank of the residue field. When $\mathcal{K}$ is the fraction field of a complete regular ring, we show that any $p$-torsion element in $Br(\mathcal{K})$ that is nicely ramified is split by a pseudo-perfect extension yielding a bound on its index. We then use patching techniques of Harbater, Hartmann and Krashen to show that the Brauer $p$-dimension of semi-global fields of residual characteristic $p$ is at most $n+2$ and also give uniform $p$-bounds for higher cohomologies. These bounds are sharper than previously known in the work of Parimala-Suresh</description>
