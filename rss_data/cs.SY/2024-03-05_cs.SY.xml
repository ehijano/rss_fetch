      <title>PowerFlowMultiNet: Multigraph Neural Networks for Unbalanced Three-Phase Distribution Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently solving unbalanced three-phase power flow in distribution grids is pivotal for grid analysis and simulation. There is a pressing need for scalable algorithms capable of handling large-scale unbalanced power grids that can provide accurate and fast solutions. To address this, deep learning techniques, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have emerged. However, existing literature primarily focuses on balanced networks, leaving a critical gap in supporting unbalanced three-phase power grids. This letter introduces PowerFlowMultiNet, a novel multigraph GNN framework explicitly designed for unbalanced three-phase power grids. The proposed approach models each phase separately in a multigraph representation, effectively capturing the inherent asymmetry in unbalanced grids. A graph embedding mechanism utilizing message passing is introduced to capture spatial dependencies within the power system network. PowerFlowMultiNet outperforms traditional methods and other deep learning approaches in terms of accuracy and computational speed. Rigorous testing reveals significantly lower error rates and a notable hundredfold increase in computational speed for large power networks compared to model-based methods.</description>

      <title>Policy Optimization for PDE Control with a Warm Start</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimensionality reduction is crucial for controlling nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) through a "reduce-then-design" strategy, which identifies a reduced-order model and then implements model-based control solutions. However, inaccuracies in the reduced-order modeling can substantially degrade controller performance, especially in PDEs with chaotic behavior. To address this issue, we augment the reduce-then-design procedure with a policy optimization (PO) step. The PO step fine-tunes the model-based controller to compensate for the modeling error from dimensionality reduction. This augmentation shifts the overall strategy into reduce-then-design-then-adapt, where the model-based controller serves as a warm start for PO. Specifically, we study the state-feedback tracking control of PDEs that aims to align the PDE state with a specific constant target subject to a linear-quadratic cost. Through extensive experiments, we show that a few iterations of PO can significantly improve the model-based controller performance. Our approach offers a cost-effective alternative to PDE control using end-to-end reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>A Holistic Power Optimization Approach for Microgrid Control Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global energy landscape is undergoing a transformation towards decarbonization, sustainability, and cost-efficiency. In this transition, microgrid systems integrated with renewable energy sources (RES) and energy storage systems (ESS) have emerged as a crucial component. However, optimizing the operational control of such an integrated energy system lacks a holistic view of multiple environmental, infrastructural and economic considerations, not to mention the need to factor in the uncertainties from both the supply and demand. This paper presents a holistic datadriven power optimization approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for microgrid control considering the multiple needs of decarbonization, sustainability and cost-efficiency. First, two data-driven control schemes, namely the prediction-based (PB) and prediction-free (PF) schemes, are devised to formulate the control problem within a Markov decision process (MDP). Second, a multivariate objective (reward) function is designed to account for the market profits, carbon emissions, peak load, and battery degradation of the microgrid system. Third, we develop a Double Dueling Deep Q Network (D3QN) architecture to optimize the power flows for real-time energy management and determine charging/discharging strategies of ESS. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach through a comparative analysis. The results and analysis also suggest the respective circumstances for using the two control schemes in practical implementations with uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Potential for Building Sector Retrofits to Mitigate ERCOT Electricity Shortfalls During Winter Storm Uri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This analysis investigates energy performance of the residential and commercial building sectors in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) during Winter Storm Uri. ERCOT electricity demand was modeled for the ERCOT baseline building stock as well as for the baseline building stock retrofitted with an efficiency upgrade package, an electrification upgrade package, and an efficiency + electrification upgrade package. The electrification scenario that retrofitted buildings with air-source heat pumps (ASHPs) would have lowered ERCOT daily peak electricity demand relative to the baseline scenario for every day of the year, except during the week of Winter Storm Uri. As the mean outdoor temperature dropped below -5{\deg}C (23{\deg}F), diminishing ASHP efficiency would have resulted in electrification scenario demand exceeding the two distinct baseline scenario daily demand peaks on February 15th and 16th (87.3 GW and 88.7 GW) to hit 111.8 GW and 117.5 GW. The efficiency package would have lowered daily peak demand on these days to 67.0 GW and 68.0 GW. The efficiency + electrification package would have lowered peak demand on these days to 81.5 GW and 85.6 GW. When electricity shortfall profiles were produced by comparing modeled electricity demand to actual ERCOT electricity generation during the storm, the results indicate that the electrification scenario electricity shortfall (1741 GWh) would have been larger than for the baseline scenario (1225 GWh) and the electricity shortfalls for the efficiency scenario (347 GWh) and efficiency + electrification scenario (704 GWh) would have been lower than the baseline. The efficiency, electrification, and efficiency + electrification scenarios would all have lowered summer daily peak demand due to improvements in building cooling efficiency and would have lowered annual electricity consumption by 5.9%, 6.8%, and 11.9%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Distribution-Free Guarantees for Systems with Decision-Dependent Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many real-world dynamical systems, obtaining precise models of system uncertainty remains a challenge. It may be difficult to estimate noise distributions or robustness bounds, especially when the distributions/robustness bounds vary with different control inputs in unknown ways. Addressing this challenge, this paper presents a novel iterative method tailored for systems with decision-dependent noise without prior knowledge of the distributions. Our approach finds the open-loop control law that minimizes the worst-case loss, given that the noise induced by this control lies in its $(1 - p)$-confidence set for a predetermined $p$. At each iteration, we use a quantile method inspired by conformal prediction to empirically estimate the confidence set shaped by the preceding control law. These derived confidence sets offer distribution-free guarantees on the system's noise, guiding a robust control formulation that targets worst-case loss minimization. Under specific regularity conditions, our method is shown to converge to a near-optimal open-loop control. While our focus is on open-loop controls, the adaptive, data-driven nature of our approach suggests its potential applicability across diverse scenarios and extensions.</description>

      <title>Real-time hybrid controls of energy storage and load shedding for integrated power and energy systems of ships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an original energy management methodology to enhance the resilience of ship power systems. The integration of various energy storage systems (ESS), including battery energy storage systems (BESS) and super-capacitor energy storage systems (SCESS), in modern ship power systems poses challenges in designing an efficient energy management system (EMS). The EMS proposed in this paper aims to achieve multiple objectives. The primary objective is to minimize shed loads, while the secondary objective is to effectively manage different types of ESS. Considering the diverse ramp-rate characteristics of generators, SCESS, and BESS, the proposed EMS exploits these differences to determine an optimal long-term schedule for minimizing shed loads. Furthermore, the proposed EMS balances the state-of-charge (SoC) of ESS and prioritizes the SCESS's SoC levels to ensure the efficient operation of BESS and SCESS. For better computational efficiency, we introduce the receding horizon optimization method, enabling real-time EMS implementation. A comparison with the fixed horizon optimization (FHO) validates its effectiveness. Simulation studies and results demonstrate that the proposed EMS efficiently manages generators, BESS, and SCESS, ensuring system resilience under generation shortages. Additionally, the proposed methodology significantly reduces the computational burden compared to the FHO technique while maintaining acceptable resilience performance.</description>

      <title>Resilient Mobile Energy Storage Resources Based Distribution Network Restoration in Interdependent Power-Transportation-Information Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interactions between power, transportation, and information networks (PTIN), are becoming more profound with the advent of smart city technologies. Existing mobile energy storage resource (MESR)-based power distribution network (PDN) restoration schemes often neglect the interdependencies among PTIN, thus, efficient PDN restoration cannot be achieved. This paper outlines the interacting factors of power supply demand, traffic operation efficiency, communication coverage, electric vehicle (EV) deployment capability, and PDN controllability among PTIN and further develops a PTIN-interacting model to reflect the chained recovery effect of the MESR-based restoration process. On this basis, a two-stage PDN restoration scheme is proposed that utilizes three emergency resources, including EVs, mobile energy storage systems (MESSs), and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), to restore the power supply and communication of PDNs. This scheme first improves the distribution automation function, EV deployment capability, and traffic operation efficiency by prioritizing the recovery of communication network (CN) and urban traffic network (UTN) loads. Then, EVs and MESSs are further scheduled to achieve a better PDN restoration effect with the support of the restored CNs and UTNs. Case studies on a PDN, CN, and UTN integrated test system are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The results show that the prioritized load recovery operation for CN and UTN facilities in this scheme greatly improves the PDN restoration effect.</description>

      <title>Strategic SDN-based Microgrid Formation for Managing Communication Failures in Distribution System Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grid modernization has increased the reliance of power networks on cyber networks within distribution systems (DSs), heightening their vulnerability to disasters. Communication network failures significantly impede DS load recovery by diminishing observation and control. Prior research has largely ignored the need for integrated recovery of DS power and cyber networks' centralized control. Indeed, communication network restoration is critical for speedy load recovery through DS automation based microgrid formation. This paper exploits the data routing capabilities of software-defined networking (SDN) to enhance centralized control recovery in DS communication networks, incorporating it into a comprehensive DS restoration model. This model, tailored to the control requirements of load restoration, strategically allocates limited communication resources to re-establish connections between the operation center and terminal devices. Subsequently, DS automation is employed to orchestrate DS microgrid formation for power resupply. Additionally, we introduce a cyclic algorithm designed to optimize the load recovery via a multi-step, cooperative process. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated on IEEE 33-node and IEEE 123-node test feeders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distribution system (DS) communication failures following extreme events often degrade monitoring and control functions, thus preventing the acquisition of complete global DS component state information, on which existing post-disaster DS restoration methods are based. This letter proposes methods of inferring the states of DS components in the case of incomplete component state information. By using the known DS information, the operating states of unobservable DS branches and buses can be inferred, providing complete information for DS performance restoration before full communication recovery</description>

      <title>Secure and Scalable Network Slicing with Plug-and-Play Support for Power Distribution System Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of power distribution systems (PDSs), the number of terminal devices and the types of delivered services involved are constantly growing. These trends make the operations of PDSs highly dependent on the support of advanced communication networks, which face two related challenges. The first is to provide sufficient flexibility, resilience, and security to meet varying demands and ensure the proper operation of gradually diversifying network services. The second is to realize the automatic identification of terminal devices, thus reducing the network maintenance burden. To solve these problems, this paper presents a novel multiservice network integration and device authentication slice-based network slicing scheme. In this scheme, the integration of PDS communication networks enables network resource sharing, and recovery from communication interruption is achieved through network slicing in the integrated network. Authentication servers periodically poll terminal devices, adjusting network slice ranges based on authentication results, thereby facilitating dynamic network slicing. Additionally, secure plug-and-play support for PDS terminal devices and network protection are achieved through device identification and dynamic adjustment of network slices. On this basis, a network optimization and upgrading methodology for load balancing and robustness enhancement is further proposed. This approach is designed to improve the performance of PDS communication networks, adapting to ongoing PDS development and the evolution of PDS services. The simulation results show that the proposed schemes endow a PDS communication network with favorable resource utilization, fault recovery, terminal device plug-and-play support, load balancing, and improved network robustness.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Maximum Actuator Degradation for a Given $H_2/H_{\infty}$ Performance with Full-State Feedback Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the issue of quantifying maximum actuator degradation in linear time-invariant dynamical systems. We present a new unified framework for computing the state-feedback controller gain that meets a user-defined closed-loop performance criterion while also maximizing actuator degradation. This degradation is modeled as a first-order filter with additive noise. Our approach involves two novel convex optimization formulations that concurrently determine the controller gain, maximize actuator degradation, and maintain the desired closed-loop performance in both the $H_2$ and $H_{\infty}$ system norms. The results are limited to open-loop stable systems. We demonstrate the application of our results through the design of a full-state feedback controller for a model representing the longitudinal motion of the F-16 aircraft.</description>

      <title>Implementation of Linear Parameter Varying System to Investigate the Impact of Varying Flow Rate on the Lithium-ion Batteries Thermal Management System Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Battery thermal management system is an indispensable part of the electric vehicles working with Lithium-ion batteries. Accordingly, lithium-ion batteries modeling, battery heat generation, and thermal management are the main focus of researchers and car manufacturers. To fulfill the need of manufacturers in the design process, a faster model than time-consuming Computational Fluid Dynamics models (CFD) is required. Reduced Order Models (ROM) address this requirement to maintain the accuracy of CFD models while could be compiled faster. Linear Time Invariant (LTI) reduced order model has been used in the literature; however, due to the limitation of LTI system, considering the constant flow rate for the cooling fluid, a Linear Parameter Varying system with three scheduling parameters was developed in this study. It is shown that LPV system results could fit accurately to CFD results in conditions that LTI system cannot maintain accuracy. Moreover, it is shown that applying varying water flow rates could result in a smoother temperature profile.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the decline of fossil fuel reserves and the escalating global average temperature, the quest for environmentally friendly and renewable energy sources has gained significant momentum. Focus has turned to wind and photovoltaic energy, but their variable inputs necessitate energy storage for reliable power. Economic viability of hybrid renewable power requires meticulous optimization of generating units to ensure uninterrupted and efficient energy production. This paper presents an optimal sizing approach for a Wind-Photovoltaic-Biogas-Battery system using a single objective optimization (SOO) method. A comprehensive comparative analysis is conducted, evaluating the convergence speed and objective mean (for minimization) of seven metaheuristic optimizers: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Aquila Optimizer (AO), Pelican Optimization Algorithm (POA), Dandelion Optimizing Algorithm (DOA), Gazelle Optimization Algorithm (GOA), Zebra Optimization Algorithm (ZOA), and Osprey Optimization Algorithm (OOA). The results demonstrate that the Pelican Optimization Algorithm (POA) outperforms other existing algorithms, exhibiting faster convergence and lower objective mean.</description>

      <title>Real-time optimization of thermoelectric coolers' performance based on energy and exergy analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New strategy is presented to optimize the performance of Thermoelectric (TE) coolers. This approach breaks optimizing TE coolers free from traditional methods of controlling temperature or engineering materials and the structural properties of the junctions. We introduced a dimensionless figure, {\gamma}, that shows the ratio of the unavailable cooling capacity to the available cooling capacity. This parameter relates the TE coolers' coefficient of performance (COP) to the COP of the reversible cycle (second law of thermodynamics efficiency) for a given electrical current. The theoretical description of the model is presented, and it is shown that controlling {\gamma} during the TE performance minimizes entropy generation and energy loss, which leads to the maximum pumped heat. We validated this model against a designed TE cooler. In this cooler, contrary to conventional TE coolers, where the temperature of the cold space is generally controlled at a specific temperature, and the performance of the cooler overlooked, the entropy generation and heat loss are engineered, and the electrical current is tuned to minimize {\gamma} by the controller so that the TE cooler works near to its optimum performance at any time.</description>

      <title>Cooperative and Interaction-aware Driver Model for Lane Change Maneuver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To achieve complete autonomous vehicles, it is crucial for autonomous vehicles to communicate and interact with their surrounding vehicles. Especially, since the lane change scenarios do not have traffic signals and traffic rules, the interactions between vehicles need to be considered for the autonomous vehicles. To address this issue, we propose a cooperative and interaction-aware decision-making algorithm for autonomous vehicles that stochastically considers the future behavior of surrounding vehicles based on actual driving data. The algorithm is designed for both lane changing and lane keeping vehicles, and effectively considers interaction by using an interaction model based on relative information between vehicles with fewer states. To design the decision-making, the interaction model is defined as Markov decision process, and stochastic dynamic programming is used to solve the Markov decision process. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in lane change scenarios that require interaction. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm enables cooperative and interaction-aware decision-making while accommodating various driving styles. Additionally, by comparing it with other methods, such as the intelligent driver model and game theory-based decision-making, we validate the safety and comfortable decision-making of our proposed algorithm. Furthermore, through driving with a human-driven vehicle, it is confirmed that the proposed decision-making enables to cooperatively and effectively drive with humans.</description>

      <title>Canonical Form of Datatic Description in Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of feedback controllers is undergoing a paradigm shift from modelic (i.e., model-driven) control to datatic (i.e., data-driven) control. Canonical form of state space model is an important concept in modelic control systems, exemplified by Jordan form, controllable form and observable form, whose purpose is to facilitate system analysis and controller synthesis. In the realm of datatic control, there is a notable absence in the standardization of data-based system representation. This paper for the first time introduces the concept of canonical data form for the purpose of achieving more effective design of datatic controllers. In a control system, the data sample in canonical form consists of a transition component and an attribute component. The former encapsulates the plant dynamics at the sampling time independently, which is a tuple containing three elements: a state, an action and their corresponding next state. The latter describes one or some artificial characteristics of the current sample, whose calculation must be performed in an online manner. The attribute of each sample must adhere to two requirements: (1) causality, ensuring independence from any future samples; and (2) locality, allowing dependence on historical samples but constrained to a finite neighboring set. The purpose of adding attribute is to offer some kinds of benefits for controller design in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. To provide a more close-up illustration, we present two canonical data forms: temporal form and spatial form, and demonstrate their advantages in reducing instability and enhancing training efficiency in two datatic control systems.</description>

      <title>Tuning and Testing an Online Feedback Optimization Controller to Provide Curative Distribution Grid Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to more volatile generation, flexibility will become more important in transmission grids. One potential source of this flexibility can be distribution grids. A flexibility request from the transmission grid to a distribution grid then needs to be split up onto the different flexibility providing units (FPU) in the distribution grid. One potential way to do this is Online Feedback Optimization (OFO). OFO is a new control method that steers power systems to the optimal solution of an optimization problem using minimal model information and computation power. This paper will show how to choose the optimization problem and how to tune the OFO controller. Afterward, we test the resulting controller on a real distribution grid laboratory and show its performance, its interaction with other controllers in the grid, and how it copes with disturbances. Overall, the paper makes a clear recommendation on how to phrase the optimization problem and tune the OFO controller. Furthermore, it experimentally verifies that an OFO controller is a powerful tool to disaggregate flexibility requests onto FPUs while satisfying operational constraints inside the flexibility providing distribution grid.</description>

      <title>Progressive Smoothing for Motion Planning in Real-Time NMPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is a popular strategy for solving motion planning problems, including obstacle avoidance constraints, in autonomous driving applications. Non-smooth obstacle shapes, such as rectangles, introduce additional local minima in the underlying optimization problem. Smooth over-approximations, e.g., ellipsoidal shapes, limit the performance due to their conservativeness. We propose to vary the smoothness and the related over-approximation by a homotopy. Instead of varying the smoothness in consecutive sequential quadratic programming iterations, we use formulations that decrease the smooth over-approximation from the end towards the beginning of the prediction horizon. Thus, the real-time iterations algorithm is applicable to the proposed NMPC formulation. Different formulations are compared in simulation experiments and shown to successfully improve performance indicators without increasing the computation time.</description>

      <title>A Frequency-Domain Approach for Enhanced Performance and Task Flexibility in Finite-Time ILC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iterative learning control (ILC) is capable of improving the tracking performance of repetitive control systems by utilizing data from past iterations. The aim of this paper is to achieve both task flexibility, which is often achieved by ILC with basis functions, and the performance of frequency-domain ILC, with an intuitive design procedure. The cost function of norm-optimal ILC is determined that recovers frequency-domain ILC, and consequently, the feedforward signal is parameterized in terms of basis functions and frequency-domain ILC. The resulting method has the performance and design procedure of frequency-domain ILC and the task flexibility of basis functions ILC, and are complimentary to each other. Validation on a benchmark example confirms the capabilities of the framework.</description>

      <title>Time-Reversal of Stochastic Maximum Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic maximum principle (SMP) specifies a necessary condition for the solution of a stochastic optimal control problem. The condition involves a coupled system of forward and backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDE) for the state and the adjoint processes. Numerical solution of the FBSDE is challenging because the boundary condition of the adjoint process is specified at the terminal time, while the solution should be adaptable to the forward in time filtration of a Wiener process. In this paper, a "time-reversal" of the FBSDE system is proposed that involves integration with respect to a backward in time Wiener process. The time-reversal is used to propose an iterative Monte-Carlo procedure to solves the FBSDE system and its time-reversal simultaneously. The procedure involves approximating the {F\"ollmer's drift} and solving a regression problem between the state and its adjoint at each time. The procedure is illustrated for the linear quadratic (LQ) optimal control problem with a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Nussbaum Function Based Approach for Tracking Control of Robot Manipulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Nussbaum function-based PID control for robotic manipulators. The integration of the Nussbaum function into the PID framework provides a solution with a simple structure that effectively tackles the challenge of unknown control directions. Stability is achieved through a combination of neural network-based estimation and Lyapunov analysis, facilitating automatic gain adjustment without the need for system dynamics. Our approach offers a gain determination with minimum parameter requirements, significantly reducing the complexity and enhancing the efficiency of robotic manipulator control. The paper guarantees that all signals within the closed-loop system remain bounded. Lastly, numerical simulations validate the theoretical framework, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy in enhancing robotic manipulator control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial optimal transport has been proven useful as a mathematical formulation to model resource allocation problems to maximize the efficiency of transportation with an adversary, who modifies the data. It is often the case, however, that only the adversary knows which nodes are malicious and which are not. In this paper we formulate the problem of seeking adversarial optimal transport into Bayesian games. We construct the concept of Bayesian equilibrium and design a distributed algorithm that achieve those equilibria, making our model applicable to large-scale networks.

      <title>Composite Distributed Learning and Synchronization of Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems with Complete Uncertain Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenging problem of composite synchronization and learning control in a network of multi-agent robotic manipulator systems operating under heterogeneous nonlinear uncertainties within a leader-follower framework. A novel two-layer distributed adaptive learning control strategy is introduced, comprising a first-layer distributed cooperative estimator and a second-layer decentralized deterministic learning controller. The primary objective of the first layer is to facilitate each robotic agent's estimation of the leader's information. The second layer is responsible for both enabling individual robot agents to track desired reference trajectories and accurately identifying and learning their nonlinear uncertain dynamics. The proposed distributed learning control scheme represents an advancement in the existing literature due to its ability to manage robotic agents with completely uncertain dynamics including uncertain mass matrices. This framework allows the robotic control to be environment-independent which can be used in various settings, from underwater to space where identifying system dynamics parameters is challenging. The stability and parameter convergence of the closed-loop system are rigorously analyzed using the Lyapunov method. Numerical simulations conducted on multi-agent robot manipulators validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The identified nonlinear dynamics can be saved and reused whenever the system restarts.</description>

      <title>Error Analysis of a Simple Quaternion Estimator: the Gaussian Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reference [1] introduces a novel closed-form quaternion estimator from two vector observations. The simplicity of the estimator enables clear physical insights and a closed-form expression for the bias as a function of the quaternion error covariance matrix. The latter could be approximated up to second order with respect to the underlying measurement noise assuming arbitrary probability distribution. The current note relaxes the second-order assumption and provides an expression for the error covariance that is exact to the fourth order, under the assumption of Gaussian distribution. This not only provides increased accuracy but also alleviates issues related to singularity. This technical note presents a comprehensive derivation of the individual components of the quaternion additive error covariance matrix.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Algorithms Applied to Ship Trajectory Planning and Behavior Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithms are popular for sampling-based planning for nonholonomic vehicles in unstructured environments. However, we argue that previous work does not illuminate the challenges when employing such algorithms. Thus, in this article, we do a first comparison study of the performance of the following previously proposed RRT algorithm variants; Potential-Quick RRT* (PQ-RRT*), Informed RRT* (IRRT*), RRT* and RRT, for single-query nonholonomic motion planning over several cases in the unstructured maritime environment. The practicalities of employing such algorithms in the maritime domain are also discussed. On the side, we contend that these algorithms offer value not only for Collision Avoidance Systems (CAS) trajectory planning, but also for the verification of CAS through vessel behavior generation.
  Naturally, optimal RRT variants yield more distance-optimal paths at the cost of increased computational time due to the tree wiring process with nearest neighbor consideration. PQ-RRT* achieves marginally better results than IRRT* and RRT*, at the cost of higher tuning complexity and increased wiring time. Based on the results, we argue that for time-critical applications the considered RRT algorithms are, as stand-alone planners, more suitable for use in smaller problems or problems with low obstacle congestion ratio. This is attributed to the curse of dimensionality, and trade-off with available memory and computational resources.</description>

Abstract: The ability to differentiate through optimization problems has unlocked numerous applications, from optimization-based layers in machine learning models to complex design problems formulated as bilevel programs. It has been shown that exploiting problem structure can yield significant computation gains for optimization and, in some cases, enable distributed computation. One should expect that this structure can be similarly exploited for gradient computation. In this work, we discuss a decentralized framework for computing gradients of constraint-coupled optimization problems. First, we show that this framework results in significant computational gains, especially for large systems, and provide sufficient conditions for its validity. Second, we leverage exponential decay of sensitivities in graph-structured problems towards building a fully distributed algorithm with convergence guarantees. Finally, we use the methodology to rigorously estimate marginal emissions rates in power systems models. Specifically, we demonstrate how the distributed scheme allows for accurate and efficient estimation of these important emissions metrics on large dynamic power system models.</description>

      <title>Smooth Computation without Input Delay: Robust Tube-Based Model Predictive Control for Robot Manipulator Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) has exhibited remarkable capabilities in optimizing objectives and meeting constraints. However, the substantial computational burden associated with solving the Optimal Control Problem (OCP) at each triggering instant introduces significant delays between state sampling and control application. These delays limit the practicality of MPC in resource-constrained systems when engaging in complex tasks. The intuition to address this issue in this paper is that by predicting the successor state, the controller can solve the OCP one time step ahead of time thus avoiding the delay of the next action. To this end, we compute deviations between real and nominal system states, predicting forthcoming real states as initial conditions for the imminent OCP solution. Anticipatory computation stores optimal control based on current nominal states, thus mitigating the delay effects. Additionally, we establish an upper bound for linearization error, effectively linearizing the nonlinear system, reducing OCP complexity, and enhancing response speed. We provide empirical validation through two numerical simulations and corresponding real-world robot tasks, demonstrating significant performance improvements and augmented response speed (up to $90\%$) resulting from the seamless integration of our proposed approach compared to conventional time-triggered MPC strategies.</description>

Abstract: This is a summary paper of a use case of a Robotdog dedicated to guide visually impaired people in complex environment like a smart intersection. In such scenarios, the Robotdog has to autonomously decide whether it is safe to cross the intersection or not in order to further guide the human. We leverage data sharing and collaboration between the Robotdog and other autonomous systems operating in the same environment. We propose a system architecture for autonomous systems through a separation of a collaborative decision layer, to enable collective decision making processes, where data about the environment, relevant to the Robotdog decision, together with evidences for trustworthiness about other systems and the environment are shared.</description>

      <title>Distributed Least-Squares Optimization Solvers with Differential Privacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the distributed least-squares optimization problem with differential privacy requirement of local cost functions, for which two differentially private distributed solvers are proposed. The first is established on the distributed gradient tracking algorithm, by appropriately perturbing the initial values and parameters that contain the privacy-sensitive data with Gaussian and truncated Laplacian noises, respectively. Rigorous proofs are established to show the achievable trade-off between the ({\epsilon}, {\delta})-differential privacy and the computation accuracy. The second solver is established on the combination of the distributed shuffling mechanism and the average consensus algorithm, which enables each agent to obtain a noisy version of parameters characterizing the global gradient. As a result, the least-squares optimization problem can be eventually solved by each agent locally in such a way that any given ({\epsilon}, {\delta})-differential privacy requirement can be preserved while the solution may be computed with the accuracy independent of the network size, which makes the latter more suitable for large-scale distributed least-squares problems. Numerical simulations are presented to show the effectiveness of both solvers.</description>

      <title>Distributed Discrete-time Dynamic Outer Approximation of the Intersection of Ellipsoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the first discrete-time distributed algorithm to track the tightest ellipsoids that outer approximates the global dynamic intersection of ellipsoids. The ellipsoids are defined as time-varying positive definite matrices. On the other hand, given an undirected network, each node is equipped with one of these ellipsoids. The solution is based on a novel distributed reformulation of the original centralized semi-definite outer L\"owner-John program, characterized by a non-separable objective function and global constraints. We prove finite-time convergence to the global minima of the centralized problem in the static case and finite-time bounded tracking error in the dynamic case. Moreover, we prove boundedness of estimation in the tracking of the global optimum and robustness in the estimation against time-varying inputs. As a by-product, the proposed algorithm extends min/max dynamic consensus algorithms to positive definite matrices. We illustrate the properties of the algorithm with different simulated examples, including a distributed estimation showcase where our proposal is integrated into a distributed Kalman filter to surpass the state-of-the-art in mean square error performance.</description>

      <title>Deep Incremental Model Based Reinforcement Learning: A One-Step Lookback Approach for Continuous Robotics Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) attempts to use an available or a learned model to improve the data efficiency of reinforcement learning. This work proposes a one-step lookback approach that jointly learns the latent-space model and the policy to realize the sample-efficient continuous robotic control, wherein the control-theoretical knowledge is utilized to decrease the model learning difficulty. Specifically, the so-called one-step backward data is utilized to facilitate the incremental evolution model, an alternative structured representation of the robotics evolution model in the MBRL field. The incremental evolution model accurately predicts the robotics movement but with low sample complexity. This is because the formulated incremental evolution model degrades the model learning difficulty into a parametric matrix learning problem, which is especially favourable to high-dimensional robotics applications. The imagined data from the learned incremental evolution model is used to supplement training data to enhance the sample efficiency. Comparative numerical simulations on benchmark continuous robotics control problems are conducted to validate the efficiency of our proposed one-step lookback approach.</description>

Abstract: Optimal decision-making for trajectory tracking in partially observable, stochastic environments where the number of active localization updates -- the process by which the agent obtains its true state information from the sensors -- are limited, presents a significant challenge. Traditional methods often struggle to balance resource conservation, accurate state estimation and precise tracking, resulting in suboptimal performance. This problem is particularly pronounced in environments with large action spaces, where the need for frequent, accurate state data is paramount, yet the capacity for active localization updates is restricted by external limitations. This paper introduces ComTraQ-MPC, a novel framework that combines Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) to optimize trajectory tracking with constrained active localization updates. The meta-trained DQN ensures adaptive active localization scheduling, while the MPC leverages available state information to improve tracking. The central contribution of this work is their reciprocal interaction: DQN's update decisions inform MPC's control strategy, and MPC's outcomes refine DQN's learning, creating a cohesive, adaptive system. Empirical evaluations in simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that ComTraQ-MPC significantly enhances operational efficiency and accuracy, providing a generalizable and approximately optimal solution for trajectory tracking in complex partially observable environments.</description>

      <title>Blue and Green-Mode Energy-Efficient Chemiresistive Sensor Array Realized by Rapid Ensemble Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) necessitates the development of optimized Chemiresistive Sensor (CRS) arrays that are both energy-efficient and capable. This study introduces a novel optimization strategy that employs a rapid ensemble learning-based model committee approach to achieve these goals. Utilizing machine learning models such as Elastic Net Regression, Random Forests, and XGBoost, among others, the strategy identifies the most impactful sensors in a CRS array for accurate classification: A weighted voting mechanism is introduced to aggregate the models' opinions in sensor selection, thereby setting up wo distinct working modes, termed "Blue" and "Green". The Blue mode operates with all sensors for maximum detection capability, while the Green mode selectively activates only key sensors, significantly reducing energy consumption without compromising detection accuracy. The strategy is validated through theoretical calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness and accuracy. The proposed optimization strategy not only elevates the detection capability of CRS arrays but also brings it closer to theoretical limits, promising significant implications for the development of low-cost, easily fabricable next-generation IoT sensor terminals.</description>

      <title>Generalized pair-wise logit dynamic and its connection to a mean field game: theoretical and computational investigations focusing on resource management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Logit dynamics are evolution equations that describe transitions to equilibria of actions among many players. We formulate a pair-wise logit dynamic in a continuous action space with a generalized exponential function, which we call a generalized pair-wise logit dynamic, depicted by a new evolution equation nonlocal in space. We prove the well-posedness and approximability of the generalized pair-wise logit dynamic to show that it is computationally implementable. We also show that this dynamic has an explicit connection to a mean field game of a controlled pure-jump process, with which the two different mathematical models can be understood in a unified way. Particularly, we show that the generalized pair-wise logit dynamic is derived as a myopic version of the corresponding mean field game, and that the conditions to guarantee the existence of unique solutions are different from each other. The key in this procedure is to find the objective function to be optimized in the mean field game based on the logit function. The monotonicity of the utility is unnecessary for the generalized pair-wise logit dynamic but crucial for the mean field game. Finally, we present applications of the two approaches to fisheries management problems with collected data.</description>

      <title>Quantifying and Predicting Residential Building Flexibility Using Machine Learning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Residential buildings account for a significant portion (35\%) of the total electricity consumption in the U.S. as of 2022. As more distributed energy resources are installed in buildings, their potential to provide flexibility to the grid increases. To tap into that flexibility provided by buildings, aggregators or system operators need to quantify and forecast flexibility. Previous works in this area primarily focused on commercial buildings, with little work on residential buildings. To address the gap, this paper first proposes two complementary flexibility metrics (i.e., power and energy flexibility) and then investigates several mainstream machine learning-based models for predicting the time-variant and sporadic flexibility of residential buildings at four-hour and 24-hour forecast horizons. The long-short-term-memory (LSTM) model achieves the best performance and can predict power flexibility for up to 24 hours ahead with the average error around 0.7 kW. However, for energy flexibility, the LSTM model is only successful for loads with consistent operational patterns throughout the year and faces challenges when predicting energy flexibility associated with HVAC systems.</description>

      <title>DECOR: Enhancing Logic Locking Against Machine Learning-Based Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Logic locking (LL) has gained attention as a promising intellectual property protection measure for integrated circuits. However, recent attacks, facilitated by machine learning (ML), have shown the potential to predict the correct key in multiple LL schemes by exploiting the correlation of the correct key value with the circuit structure. This paper presents a generic LL enhancement method based on a randomized algorithm that can significantly decrease the correlation between locked circuit netlist and correct key values in an LL scheme. Numerical results show that the proposed method can efficiently degrade the accuracy of state-of-the-art ML-based attacks down to around 50%, resulting in negligible advantage versus random guessing.</description>

Abstract: Shannon entropy regularization is widely adopted in optimal control due to its ability to promote exploration and enhance robustness, e.g., maximum entropy reinforcement learning known as Soft Actor-Critic. In this paper, Tsallis entropy, which is a one-parameter extension of Shannon entropy, is used for the regularization of linearly solvable MDP and linear quadratic regulators. We derive the solution for these problems and demonstrate its usefulness in balancing between exploration and sparsity of the obtained control law.</description>

Abstract: Electromagnetic relays and solenoid actuators are commonly used for their bistable behavior, which allows for switching between two states in electrical, pneumatic, or hydraulic circuits, among other applications. Although there has been extensive research on modeling, estimation, and control of these electromechanical systems, a gap remains in the analysis area. This paper addresses this gap by presenting an equilibrium and stability analysis to gain deeper insight into their bistability. This analysis leverages a hybrid dynamical model to obtain analytical expressions that relate the physical parameters to the switching conditions. These expressions are useful, e.g., for fundamental understanding, quick analyses, or design optimization. The results are discussed in depth and potential practical applications are explored. Finally, the analysis is validated with experimental results from a real device.</description>

      <title>Solving Differential-Algebraic Equations in Power System Dynamic Analysis with Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09597v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power system dynamics are generally modeled by high dimensional nonlinear differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) given a large number of components forming the network. These DAEs' complexity can grow exponentially due to the increasing penetration of distributed energy resources, whereas their computation time becomes sensitive due to the increasing interconnection of the power grid with other energy systems. This paper demonstrates the use of quantum computing algorithms to solve DAEs for power system dynamic analysis. We leverage a symbolic programming framework to equivalently convert the power system's DAEs into ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using index reduction methods and then encode their data into qubits using amplitude encoding. The system nonlinearity is captured by Hamiltonian simulation with truncated Taylor expansion so that state variables can be updated by a quantum linear equation solver. Our results show that quantum computing can solve the power system's DAEs accurately with a computational complexity polynomial in the logarithm of the system dimension. We also illustrate the use of recent advanced tools in scientific machine learning for implementing complex computing concepts, i.e. Taylor expansion, DAEs/ODEs transformation, and quantum computing solver with abstract representation for power engineering applications.</description>

Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots enable increased flexibility of manufacturing systems. The design and operating strategy of such a fleet of robots requires careful consideration of both fixed and operational costs. In this paper, a Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based metaheuristic is developed that guides a Branch &amp; Bound (B&amp;B) algorithm to find the globally optimal solution to the Fleet Size and Mix Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (FSMVRPTW).The metaheuristic and exact algorithms are implemented in a parallel hybrid optimization algorithm where the metaheuristic rapidly finds feasible solutions that provide candidate upper bounds for the B&amp;B algorithm. The MCTS additionally provides a candidate fleet composition to initiate the B&amp;B search. Experiments show that the proposed approach results in significant improvements in computation time and convergence to the optimal solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10921v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a design methodology of distributed controllers for multi-agent systems on a class of directed interaction networks by extending the gradient-flow method. Although the gradient-flow method is a common design tool for distributed controllers, it is inapplicable to directed networks. First, we demonstrate how to construct a distributed controller for systems over a class of time-invariant directed graphs. Subsequently, we establish better convergence properties and performance enhancement than the conventional gradient-flow method. To illustrate its application in time-varying networks, we address the dynamic matching problem of two distinct groups of agents with different sensing ranges. This problem is a novel coordination task that involves pairing agents from two distinct groups to achieve a convergence of the paired agents' states to the same value. Accordingly, we apply the proposed method to this problem and provide sufficient conditions for successful matching. Lastly, numerical examples for systems on both time-invariant and time-varying networks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Feedback for Affine Nonlinear Systems with Application to Global Obstacle Avoidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04104v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the design of hybrid feedback for a class of affine nonlinear systems with topological constraints that prevent global asymptotic stability. A new hybrid control strategy is introduced, which differs conceptually from the commonly used synergistic hybrid approaches. The key idea involves the construction of a generalized synergistic Lyapunov function whose switching variable can either remain constant or dynamically change between jumps. Based on this new hybrid mechanism, a generalized synergistic hybrid feedback control scheme, endowed with global asymptotic stability guarantees, is proposed. This hybrid control scheme is then improved through a smoothing mechanism that eliminates discontinuities in the feedback term. Moreover, the smooth hybrid feedback is further extended to a larger class of systems through the integrator backstepping approach. The proposed hybrid feedback schemes are applied to solve the global obstacle avoidance problem using a new concept of synergistic navigation functions. Finally, numerical simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed hybrid controllers.</description>

      <title>Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle Energy Management with Clutch Engagement Control via Continuous-Discrete Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy management strategy (EMS) is a key technology for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). The energy management of certain series-parallel PHEVs involves the control of continuous variables, such as engine torque, and discrete variables, such as clutch engagement/disengagement. We establish a control-oriented model for a series-parallel plug-in hybrid system with clutch engagement control from the perspective of mixed-integer programming. Subsequently, we design an EMS based on continuous-discrete reinforcement learning (CDRL), which enables simultaneous output of continuous and discrete variables. During training, we introduce state-of-charge (SOC) randomization to ensure that the hybrid system exhibits optimal energy-saving performance in both high and low SOC. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed CDRL strategy is verified by comparing EMS based on charge-depleting charge-sustaining (CD-CS) with rule-based clutch engagement control, and Dynamic Programming (DP). The simulation results show that, under a high SOC, the CDRL strategy proposed in this paper can improve energy efficiency by 8.3% compared to CD-CS, and the energy consumption is just 6.6% higher than the global optimum based on DP, while under a low SOC, the numbers are 4.1% and 3.9%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Timely Target Tracking: Distributed Updating in Cognitive Radar Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12936v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cognitive radar networks (CRNs) are capable of optimizing operating parameters in order to provide actionable information to an operator or secondary system. CRNs have been proposed to answer the need for low-cost devices tracking potentially large numbers of targets in geographically diverse regions. Networks of small-scale devices have also been shown to outperform legacy, large scale, high price, single-device installations. In this work, we consider a CRN tracking multiple targets with a goal of providing information which is both fresh and accurate to a measurement fusion center (FC). We show that under a constraint on the update rate of each radar node, the network is able to utilize Age of Information (AoI) metrics to maximize the resource utilization and minimize error per track. Since information freshness is critical to decision-making, this structure enables a CRN to provide the highest-quality information possible to a downstream system or operator. We discuss centralized and distributed approaches to solving this problem, taking into account the quality of node observations, the maneuverability of each target, and a limit on the rate at which any node may provide updates to the FC. We present a centralized AoI-inspired node selection metric, where a FC requests updates from specific nodes. We compare this against several alternative techniques. Further, we provide a distributed approach which utilizes the Age of Incorrect Information (AoII) metric, allowing each independent node to provide updates according to the targets it can observe. We provide mathematical analysis of the rate limits defined for the centralized and distributed approaches, showing that they are equivalent. We conclude with numerical simulations demonstrating that the performance of the algorithms exceeds that of alternative approaches, both in resource utilization and in tracking performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Remote operation is a crucial solution to problems encountered in agricultural machinery operations. However, traditional video streaming control methods fall short in overcoming the challenges of single perspective views and the inability to obtain 3D information. In light of these issues, our research proposes a large-scale digital map reconstruction and immersive human-machine remote control framework for agricultural scenarios. In our methodology, a DJI unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV) was utilized for data collection, and a novel video segmentation approach based on feature points was introduced. To tackle texture richness variability, an enhanced Structure from Motion (SfM) using superpixel segmentation was implemented. This method integrates the open Multiple View Geometry (openMVG) framework along with Local Features from Transformers (LoFTR). The enhanced SfM results in a point cloud map, which is further processed through Multi-View Stereo (MVS) to generate a complete map model. For control, a closed-loop system utilizing TCP for VR control and positioning of agricultural machinery was introduced. Our system offers a fully visual-based immersive control method, where upon connection to the local area network, operators can utilize VR for immersive remote control. The proposed method enhances both the robustness and convenience of the reconstruction process, thereby significantly facilitating operators in acquiring more comprehensive on-site information and engaging in immersive remote control operations.

      <description>arXiv:2309.00517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a method to analyze the small-signal L2 gain of control-affine nonlinear systems on compact sets via iterative semi-definite programs. First, a continuous piecewise affine storage function and the corresponding upper bound on the L2 gain are found on a bounded, compact set's triangulation. Then, to ensure that the state does not escape this set, a barrier function is found that is robust to small-signal inputs. Small-signal L2 stability then holds inside each sublevel set of the barrier function inside the set where the storage function was found. The bound on the inputs is also found while searching for a barrier function. The method's effectiveness is shown in a numerical example.</description>

Abstract: We derive a sufficient condition for $k$-contraction in a generalized Lurie system (GLS), that is, the feedback connection of a nonlinear dynamical system and a memoryless nonlinear function. For $k=1$, this reduces to a sufficient condition for standard contraction. For $k=2$, this condition implies that every bounded solution of the GLS converges to an equilibrium, which is not necessarily unique. We demonstrate the theoretical results by analyzing $k$-contraction in a biochemical control circuit with nonlinear dissipation terms.</description>

Abstract: With technological advances, mobility has been moving from a product (i.e., traditional modes and vehicles), to a service (i.e., Mobility as a Service, MaaS). However, as observed in other fields (e.g. cloud computing resource management) we argue that mobility will evolve from a service to a resource (i.e., Mobility as a Resource, MaaR). Further, due to increasing scarcity of shared mobility spaces across traditional and emerging modes, the transition must be viewed within the critical need for ethical and equitable solutions for the traveling public (i.e., research is needed to avoid hyper-market driven outcomes for society). The evolution of mobility into a resource requires novel conceptual frameworks, technologies, processes and perspectives of analysis. A key component of the future MaaR system is the technological capacity to observe, allocate and manage (in real-time) the smallest envisionable units of mobility (i.e., atomic units of mobility capacity) while providing prioritized attention to human movement and ethical metrics related to access, consumption and impact. To facilitate research into the envisioned future system, this paper proposes initial frameworks which synthesize and advance methodologies relating to highly dynamic capacity reservation systems. Future research requires synthesis across transport network management, demand behavior, mixed-mode usage, and equitable mobility.</description>

      <title>Goal-oriented Estimation of Multiple Markov Sources in Resource-constrained Systems</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates goal-oriented communication for remote estimation of multiple Markov sources in resource-constrained networks. An agent decides the updating times of the sources and transmits the packet to a remote destination over an unreliable channel with delay. The destination is tasked with source reconstruction for actuation. We utilize the metric \textit{cost of actuation error} (CAE) to capture the state-dependent actuation costs. We aim for a sampling policy that minimizes the long-term average CAE subject to an average resource constraint. We formulate this problem as an average-cost constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) and relax it into an unconstrained problem by utilizing \textit{Lyapunov drift} techniques. Then, we propose a low-complexity \textit{drift-plus-penalty} (DPP) policy for systems with known source/channel statistics and a Lyapunov optimization-based deep reinforcement learning (LO-DRL) policy for unknown environments. Our policies significantly reduce the number of uninformative transmissions by exploiting the timing of the important information.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Transmission Expansion: An Offshore Wind Power Integration Case Study</title>

Abstract: Despite ambitious offshore wind targets in the U.S. and globally, offshore grid planning guidance remains notably scarce, contrasting with well-established frameworks for onshore grids. This gap, alongside the increasing penetration of offshore wind and other clean-energy resources in onshore grids, highlights the urgent need for a coordinated planning framework. Our paper describes a multi-objective, multistage generation, storage and transmission expansion planning model to facilitate efficient and resilient large-scale adoption of offshore wind power. Recognizing regulatory emphasis, in some cases, requirements to consider externalities, this model explicitly accounts for negative externalities: greenhouse gas emissions and local emission-induced air pollution. Utilizing an 8-zone ISO-NE test system and a 9-zone PJM test system, we explore grid expansion sensitivities, onshore and offshore, due to offshore wind integration, including impacts of optimizing Points of Interconnection (POIs) versus fixed POIs, negative externalities, and consideration of extreme operational scenarios. Our results indicate that accounting for negative externalities necessitates greater upfront investment in clean generation and storage (balanced by lower expected operational costs) and less offshore investment. Optimizing POIs could significantly reshape offshore topology or POIs and lower total cost, albeit requiring more onshore transmission. Extreme operational scenarios typically result in greater operational costs and onshore line investment.</description>

      <title>Dual-Loop Robust Control of Biased Koopman Operator Model by Noisy Data of Nonlinear Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Koopman operator approach for data-driven control design of a nonlinear system is on the rise because of its capability to capture the behaviours of global dynamics. However, the measurement noises of inputs and outputs will bias the Koopman model identification and cause model mismatch from the actual nonlinear dynamics. The current work evaluates the bounds of the noise-induced model bias of the Koopman operator model and proposes a data-driven robust dual-loop control framework (Koopman based robust control-KROC) for the biased model. First, the model mismatch is found bounded under radial basis functions (RBF) and the bounded noises, and the bound of model mismatch is assessed. Second, the pitfalls of linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control based on the biased Koopman model of Van Der Pol oscillator are shown. Motivated from the pitfalls, the dual-loop control is proposed, which consist of an observer-based state-feedback control based on the nominal Koopman model and an additional robust loop to compensate model mismatch. A linear matrix inequality (LMI) is derived, which can guarantee robust stability and performance under bounded noises for the finite-dimensional Koopman operator model. Finally, the proposed framework is implemented to a nonlinear Van Der Pol oscillator to demonstrate enhanced control performance by the dual-loop robust control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an enhanced direct-method-based approach for the real-time solution of optimal control problems to handle path constraints, such as obstacles. The principal contributions of this work are twofold: first, the existing methods for constructing reachability sets in the literature are extended to derive the envelope of these sets, which determines the region swept by all feasible trajectories between adjacent sample points. Second, we propose a novel method to guarantee constraint violation-free between discrete states in two dimensions through mesh refinement approach. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, numerical simulations are conducted on real-time path planning for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles.</description>

      <title>The Fragile Nature of Road Transportation Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Major cities worldwide experience problems with the performance of their road transportation systems. The continuous increase in traffic demand presents a substantial challenge to the optimal operation of urban road networks and the efficiency of traffic control strategies. Although robust and resilient transportation systems have been extensively researched over the past decades, their performance under an ever-growing traffic demand can still be questionable. The operation of transportation systems is widely believed to display fragile property, i.e., the loss in performance increases exponentially with the linearly increasing magnitude of disruptions, which undermines their continuous operation. The risk engineering community is now embracing the novel concept of (anti-)fragility, which enables systems to learn from historical disruptions and exhibit improved performance as disruption levels reach unprecedented magnitudes. In this study, we demonstrate the fragile nature of road transportation systems when faced with either demand or supply disruptions. First, we conducted a rigorous mathematical analysis to theoretically establish the fragile nature of the systems. Subsequently, by taking into account real-world stochasticity, we implemented a numerical simulation with realistic network data to bridge the gap between the theoretical proof and the real-world operations, to study the impact of uncertainty on the fragile property of the systems. This work aims to help researchers better comprehend the necessity to explicitly consider antifragile design toward the application of future traffic control strategies, coping with constantly growing traffic demand and subsequent traffic accidents.</description>

      <title>Settling the Sample Complexity of Model-Based Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.05275v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with offline reinforcement learning (RL), which learns using pre-collected data without further exploration. Effective offline RL would be able to accommodate distribution shift and limited data coverage. However, prior algorithms or analyses either suffer from suboptimal sample complexities or incur high burn-in cost to reach sample optimality, thus posing an impediment to efficient offline RL in sample-starved applications.
  We demonstrate that the model-based (or "plug-in") approach achieves minimax-optimal sample complexity without burn-in cost for tabular Markov decision processes (MDPs). Concretely, consider a finite-horizon (resp. $\gamma$-discounted infinite-horizon) MDP with $S$ states and horizon $H$ (resp. effective horizon $\frac{1}{1-\gamma}$), and suppose the distribution shift of data is reflected by some single-policy clipped concentrability coefficient $C^{\star}_{\text{clipped}}$. We prove that model-based offline RL yields $\varepsilon$-accuracy with a sample complexity of \[ \begin{cases} \frac{H^{4}SC_{\text{clipped}}^{\star}}{\varepsilon^{2}} &amp; (\text{finite-horizon MDPs}) \frac{SC_{\text{clipped}}^{\star}}{(1-\gamma)^{3}\varepsilon^{2}} &amp; (\text{infinite-horizon MDPs}) \end{cases} \] up to log factor, which is minimax optimal for the entire $\varepsilon$-range. The proposed algorithms are ``pessimistic'' variants of value iteration with Bernstein-style penalties, and do not require sophisticated variance reduction. Our analysis framework is established upon delicate leave-one-out decoupling arguments in conjunction with careful self-bounding techniques tailored to MDPs.</description>

      <title>(Rectified Version) Push-LSVRG-UP: Distributed Stochastic Optimization over Unbalanced Directed Networks with Uncoordinated Triggered Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09181v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed stochastic optimization, arising in the crossing and integration of traditional stochastic optimization, distributed computing and storage, and network science, has advantages of high efficiency and a low per-iteration computational complexity in resolving large-scale optimization problems. This paper concentrates on resolving a large-scale convex finite-sum optimization problem in a multi-agent system over unbalanced directed networks. To tackle this problem in an efficient way, a distributed consensus optimization algorithm, adopting the push-sum technique and a distributed loopless stochastic variance-reduced gradient (LSVRG) method with uncoordinated triggered probabilities, is developed and named Push-LSVRG-UP. Each agent under this algorithmic framework performs only local computation and communicates only with its neighbors without leaking their private information. The convergence analysis of Push-LSVRG-UP is relied on analyzing the contraction relationships between four error terms associated with the multi-agent system. Theoretical results provide an explicit feasible range of the constant step-size, a linear convergence rate, and an iteration complexity of Push-LSVRG-UP when achieving the globally optimal solution. It is shown that Push-LSVRG-UP achieves the superior characteristics of accelerated linear convergence, fewer storage costs, and a lower per-iteration computational complexity than most existing works. Meanwhile, the introduction of an uncoordinated probabilistic triggered mechanism allows Push-LSVRG-UP to facilitate the independence and flexibility of agents in computing local batch gradients. In simulations, the practicability and improved performance of Push-LSVRG-UP are manifested via resolving two distributed learning problems based on real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Logical Zonotopes: A Set Representation for Reachability Analysis of Logical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a set representation called polynomial logical zonotopes for performing exact and computationally efficient reachability analysis on logical systems. Polynomial logical zonotopes are a generalization of logical zonotopes, which are able to represent up to 2^n binary vectors using only n generators. Due to their construction, logical zonotopes are only able to support exact computations of some logical operations (XOR, NOT, XNOR), while other operations (AND, NAND, OR, NOR) result in over-approximations in the reduced space, i.e., generator space. In order to perform all fundamental logical operations exactly, we formulate a generalization of logical zonotopes that is constructed by dependent generators and exponent matrices. We prove that through this polynomial-like construction, we are able to perform all of the fundamental logical operations (XOR, NOT, XNOR, AND, NAND, OR, NOR) exactly in the generator space. While we are able to perform all of the logical operations exactly, this comes with a slight increase in computational complexity compared to logical zonotopes. We show that we can use polynomial logical zonotopes to perform exact reachability analysis while retaining a low computational complexity. To illustrate and showcase the computational benefits of polynomial logical zonotopes, we present the results of performing reachability analysis on two use cases: (1) safety verification of an intersection crossing protocol and (2) reachability analysis on a high-dimensional Boolean function. Moreover, to highlight the extensibility of logical zonotopes, we include an additional use case where we perform a computationally tractable exhaustive search for the key of a linear feedback shift register.</description>

      <title>Power Transfer between Two Antenna Arrays in the Near Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16446v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present numerical results with a focus on power transfer between two standard linear antenna arrays placed in the near field, where a much smaller active multi-antenna feeder (AMAF) space feeds a far larger passive array referred to as a reflective intelligent surface (RIS). The interest is in the regime of focal length to diameter ($F/D$) ratio less than unity. We address the question of center feed vs. end feed for array-fed array antenna architectures and present the following novel findings and contributions: 1. In the regime of $F/D$ ratio less than one, AMAF-RIS power transfer deviates from the classical inverse square law. Furthermore, the behavior of the power transmission coefficient is more sensitive to the $F/D$ ratio than to a particular RIS size. 2. For an end-feed, non-eigenmodes provide better beam shapes than the eigenmodes, which are still inferior to beam shapes from the center-feed eigenmodes. 3. The center feed provides several dB more power gain than an end feed. This clearly illustrates that the center feed configuration should be used for array fed arrays, in contrast to the classical parabolic geometry.</description>

Abstract: Perception modules are integral in many modern autonomous systems, but their accuracy can be subject to the vagaries of the environment. In this paper, we propose a learning-based approach that can automatically characterize the error of a perception module from data and use this for safe control. The proposed approach constructs an inverse perception contract (IPC) which generates a set that contains the ground-truth value that is being estimated by the perception module, with high probability. We apply the proposed approach to study a vision pipeline deployed on a quadcopter. With the proposed approach, we successfully constructed an IPC for the vision pipeline. We then designed a control algorithm that utilizes the learned IPC, with the goal of landing the quadcopter safely on a landing pad. Experiments show that with the learned IPC, the control algorithm safely landed the quadcopter despite the error from the perception module, while the baseline algorithm without using the learned IPC failed to do so.</description>

      <title>Q-Learning for Stochastic Control under General Information Structures and Non-Markovian Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a primary contribution, we present a convergence theorem for stochastic iterations, and in particular, Q-learning iterates, under a general, possibly non-Markovian, stochastic environment. Our conditions for convergence involve an ergodicity and a positivity criterion. We provide a precise characterization on the limit of the iterates and conditions on the environment and initializations for convergence. As our second contribution, we discuss the implications and applications of this theorem to a variety of stochastic control problems with non-Markovian environments involving (i) quantized approximations of fully observed Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with continuous spaces (where quantization break down the Markovian structure), (ii) quantized approximations of belief-MDP reduced partially observable MDPS (POMDPs) with weak Feller continuity and a mild version of filter stability (which requires the knowledge of the model by the controller), (iii) finite window approximations of POMDPs under a uniform controlled filter stability (which does not require the knowledge of the model), and (iv) for multi-agent models where convergence of learning dynamics to a new class of equilibria, subjective Q-learning equilibria, will be studied. In addition to the convergence theorem, some implications of the theorem above are new to the literature and others are interpreted as applications of the convergence theorem. Some open problems are noted.</description>

      <title>Efficient Computation of Invariance Proximity: Closed-Form Error Bounds for Finite-Dimensional Koopman-Based Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13033v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A popular way to approximate the Koopman operator's action on a finite-dimensional subspace of functions is via orthogonal projections. The quality of the projected model directly depends on the selected subspace, specifically on how close it is to being invariant under the Koopman operator. The notion of invariance proximity provides a tight upper bound on the worst-case relative prediction error of the finite-dimensional model. However, its direct calculation is computationally challenging. This paper leverages the geometric structure behind the definition of invariance proximity to provide a closed-form expression in terms of Jordan principal angles on general inner product spaces. Unveiling this connection allows us to exploit specific isomorphisms to circumvent the computational challenges associated with spaces of functions and enables the use of existing efficient numerical routines to compute invariance proximity.</description>

      <title>T-PRIME: Transformer-based Protocol Identification for Machine-learning at the Edge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectrum sharing allows different protocols of the same standard (e.g., 802.11 family) or different standards (e.g., LTE and DVB) to coexist in overlapping frequency bands. As this paradigm continues to spread, wireless systems must also evolve to identify active transmitters and unauthorized waveforms in real time under intentional distortion of preambles, extremely low signal-to-noise ratios and challenging channel conditions. We overcome limitations of correlation-based preamble matching methods in such conditions through the design of T-PRIME: a Transformer-based machine learning approach. T-PRIME learns the structural design of transmitted frames through its attention mechanism, looking at sequence patterns that go beyond the preamble alone. The paper makes three contributions: First, it compares Transformer models and demonstrates their superiority over traditional methods and state-of-the-art neural networks. Second, it rigorously analyzes T-PRIME's real-time feasibility on DeepWave's AIR-T platform. Third, it utilizes an extensive 66 GB dataset of over-the-air (OTA) WiFi transmissions for training, which is released along with the code for community use. Results reveal nearly perfect (i.e. $&gt;98\%$) classification accuracy under simulated scenarios, showing $100\%$ detection improvement over legacy methods in low SNR ranges, $97\%$ classification accuracy for OTA single-protocol transmissions and up to $75\%$ double-protocol classification accuracy in interference scenarios.</description>

Abstract: The quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (QCRB) as the ultimate lower bound for precision in quantum parameter estimation is only known to be saturable in the multiparameter setting in special cases and under conditions such as full or average commutavity of the symmetric logarithmic derivatives (SLDs) associated with the parameters. Moreover, for general mixed states, collective measurements over infinitely many identical copies of the quantum state are generally required to attain the QCRB. In the important and experimentally relevant single-copy scenario, a necessary condition for saturating the QCRB in the multiparameter setting for general mixed states is the so-called partial commutativity condition on the SLDs. However, it is not known if this condition is also sufficient. This paper derives new necessary conditions that imply partial commutativity and are almost sufficient. It is shown that together with another condition they become sufficient for saturability of the QCRB in the multiparameter single-copy case. Moreover, when the sufficient conditions are satisfied an optimal measurement saturating the QCRB can be chosen to be projective and explicitly characterized. An example is developed to illustrate the case of a multiparameter quantum state where the conditions derived herein are satisfied and can be explicitly verified.</description>

      <title>How to Evaluate Human-likeness of Interaction-aware Driver Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18775</link>

Abstract: This study proposes a method for qualitatively evaluating and designing human-like driver models for autonomous vehicles. While most existing research on human-likeness has been focused on quantitative evaluation, it is crucial to consider qualitative measures to accurately capture human perception. To this end, we conducted surveys utilizing both video study and human experience-based study. The findings of this research can significantly contribute to the development of naturalistic and human-like driver models for autonomous vehicles, enabling them to safely and efficiently coexist with human-driven vehicles in diverse driving scenarios.</description>

      <title>Conjectural Online Learning with First-order Beliefs in Asymmetric Information Stochastic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asymmetric information stochastic games (\textsc{aisg}s) arise in many complex socio-technical systems, such as cyber-physical systems and IT infrastructures. Existing computational methods for \textsc{aisg}s are primarily offline and can not adapt to equilibrium deviations. Further, current methods are limited to special classes of \textsc{aisg}s to avoid belief hierarchies. To address these limitations, we propose conjectural online learning (\textsc{col}), an online method for generic \textsc{aisg}s. \textsc{col} uses a forecaster-actor-critic (\textsc{fac}) architecture where subjective forecasts is used to conjecture the opponents' strategies and break belief hierarchies (forecaster), online rollout is used to adapt strategies to nonstationary environments (actor), Monte-Carlo simulation is used to estimate costs (critic), and Bayesian learning is used to calibrate conjectures. We prove that the conjectures produced by \textsc{col} are asymptotically consistent with the information feedback in the sense of a relaxed Bayesian consistency. We also prove that the empirical strategy profile induced by \textsc{col} converges to the Berk-Nash equilibrium, a solution concept characterizing rationality under subjectivity. Experimental results from an intrusion response use case demonstrate \textsc{col}'s superiority over state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods against nonstationary attacks.</description>
