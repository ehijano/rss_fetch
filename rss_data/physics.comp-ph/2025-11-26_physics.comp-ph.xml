      <title>Effect of cohesion on the gravity-driven evacuation of metal powder through Triply-Periodic Minimal Surface structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evacuating the powder trapped inside the complex cavities of Triply Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS) structures remains a major challenge in metal-powder-based additive manufacturing. The Discrete Element Method offers valuable insights into this evacuation process, enabling the design of effective de-powdering strategies. In this study, we simulate gravity-driven evacuation of trapped powders from inside unit cells of various TPMS structures. We systematically investigate the role of cohesive energy density in shaping the discharge profile. Overall, we conclude that the Schwarz-P and Gyroid topologies enable the most efficient powder evacuation, remaining resilient to cohesion-induced flow hindrance. Furthermore, for the two unit cells, we analyse detailed kinematics and interpret the results in relation to particle overlaps and contact force distributions.</description>

      <title>An ALE approach to reduce spurious numerical mixing through variational minimizers: application to internal waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spurious numerical mixing is a frequent phenomenon in ocean models. In the present paper, we present an efficient and robust methodology that defines the vertical grid motion so that this mixing is reduced. This motion is defined through the solution of an optimization problem that -using the ideas of the calculus of variations- results in an elliptic equation. This framework is generally applicable to any ocean model that uses an ALE vertical coordinate and can be tuned to fit the modeler's specific needs based on the guidelines presented herein. The method is applied to the nonhydrostatic solver presented by the authors in [Alexandris-Galanopoulos et al., 2024] and its applicability in fully nonlinear internal waves is investigated for the demanding test cases of wave breaking and overturning. These numerical benchmarks show the ability of the method to reduce spurious mixing, while attaining the physical relevancy of the results.</description>

      <title>Attosecond momentum-resolved resonant inelastic x-ray scattering for imaging coupled electron-hole dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving our understanding of electron dynamics is essential for advancing energy transfer, optoelectronics, light harvesting systems and quantum computing. Recent developments in attosecond x-ray sources provide the fundamental possibility of observing these dynamics with atomic-scale resolution. However, connecting a time-resolved signal to dynamics is challenging due to the broad bandwidth of an attosecond probe pulse. This makes exploring the capabilities of different attosecond imaging techniques crucial. Here, we propose attosecond momentum-resolved resonant inelastic x-ray scattering as a prominent technique for tracking ultrafast dynamics. We demonstrate that the scattering signal contains an information about the instantaneous distribution of charge density across the scattering atoms. To illustrate this, we consider scattering from an $\alpha$-sexithiophene molecule, in which coupled electron-hole dynamics are excited.</description>

      <title>Active learning with physics-informed neural networks for optimal sensor placement in deep tunneling through transversely isotropic elastic rocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a deep learning strategy to simultaneously solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and back-calculate their parameters in the context of deep tunnel excavation. A Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) model is trained with synthetic data that emulates in situ displacement measurements in the host rock and at the cavity wall, obtained from extensometers and convergence monitoring. As acquiring field observations can be costly, a sequential training approach based on active learning is implemented to determine the most informative locations for new sensors. In particular, Monte Carlo dropout is used to quantify epistemic uncertainty and query measurements in regions where the model is least confident. This approach reduces the amount of required field data and optimizes sensor placement. The PINN is tested to reconstruct the displacement field around a deep tunnel of circular section excavated in transversely isotropic elastic rock and to determine rock constitutive and stress-field parameters. Results demonstrate excellent performance on small, scattered, and noisy datasets, achieving high precision for the Young's moduli, shear modulus, horizontal-to-vertical far-field stress ratio, and the orientation of the bedding planes. The proposed framework shall ultimately support decision-making for optimal subsurface monitoring and for adaptive tunnel design and control.</description>

      <title>A Cartesian Encoding Graph Neural Network for Crystal Structures Property Prediction: Application to Thermal Ellipsoid Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In diffraction-based crystal structure analysis, thermal ellipsoids, quantified via Anisotropic Displacement Parameters (ADPs), are critical yet challenging to determine. ADPs capture atomic vibrations, reflecting thermal and structural properties, but traditional computation is often expensive. This paper introduces CartNet, a novel graph neural network (GNN) for efficiently predicting crystal properties by encoding atomic geometry into Cartesian coordinates alongside the crystal temperature. CartNet integrates a neighbour equalization technique to emphasize covalent and contact interactions, and a Cholesky-based head to ensure valid ADP predictions. We also propose a rotational SO(3) data augmentation strategy during training to handle unseen orientations. An ADP dataset with over 200,000 experimental crystal structures from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) was curated to validate the approach. CartNet significantly reduces computational costs and outperforms existing methods in ADP prediction by 10.87%, while delivering a 34.77% improvement over theoretical approaches. We further evaluated CartNet on other datasets covering formation energy, band gap, total energy, energy above the convex hull, bulk moduli, and shear moduli, achieving 7.71% better results on the Jarvis Dataset and 13.16% on the Materials Project Dataset. These gains establish CartNet as a state-of-the-art solution for diverse crystal property predictions. Project website and online demo: https://www.ee.ub.edu/cartnet</description>

      <title>Metastable Multi-centered Polarons in BiVO$_{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarons, quasiparticles formed through interactions between lattice and charge carriers (electrons and holes), strongly influence the electronic and optical properties of functional materials. In nanostructured BiVO$_{4}$, polaron formation and dynamics govern photocatalytic efficiency and charge transport, yet the microscopic nature remains not fully resolved. Here, using first-principles calculations, we report the formation of multi-centered polarons, in contrast to the more common single-centered states. Moreover, electron polarons exhibit pronounced anisotropy compared to the isotropic hole counterpart, reflecting a distinct character in charge-lattice coupling. These theoretical insights offer a direct interpretation of optical and spectroscopic experiments, providing strong evidence of anisotropic multi-centered polaronic behavior in BiVO$_{4}$. The presence of multiple in-gap states, especially from multi-centered polarons, introduces new channels for charge transport and recombination, possibly offering opportunities to control carrier dynamics in nanoscale photocatalytic and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving Coupling and Decoupling of Port-Hamiltonian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The port-Hamiltonian framework is a structure-preserving modeling approach that preserves key physical properties such as energy conservation and dissipation. When subsystems are modeled as port-Hamiltonian systems (pHS) with linearly related inputs and outputs, their interconnection remains port-Hamiltonian. This paper introduces a systematic method for transforming coupled port Hamiltonian ordinary differential equations systems (pHODE) into a single monolithic formulation, and for decomposing a monolithic system into weakly coupled subsystems. The monolithic representation ensures stability and structural integrity, whereas the decoupled form enables efficient distributed simulation via operator splitting or dynamic iteration.</description>

      <title>High-pressure melting and elastic behavior of vanadium and niobium based on ab initio and machine learning molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under high pressure, the group-VB transition metals vanadium (V) and niobium (Nb) exhibit simple crystal structures but complex physical behaviors, such as anomalous compression-induced softening and heating-induced hardening (CISHIH). Meanwhile, the impact of lattice thermal expansion-induced softening at elevated temperatures on HIH is yet to be investigated. Therefore, this study utilized ab initio (AIMD) and machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) to investigate the melting and abnormal mechanical softening-hardening behaviors of V and Nb under high pressure. Simulations reveal that the high-temperature Pnma phase of Nb reported in previous experimental studies is highly susceptible to mechanical instability and reverts to the body-centered cubic (BCC) phase. This discovery prompted a revised determination of the high-pressure melting line of Nb. The melting temperature of Nb significantly exceeds the existing theoretical and experimental estimate compared with that of V. AIMD simulations demonstrate that atomic thermal displacements have a greater influence on the HIH of V and Nb than pure electron temperature effects. In addition, the temperature-dependent anomalous elastic properties of V and Nb were investigated within a pressure range of 0-250 GPa using MLMD. The mechanical properties of V and Nb transitioned from HIH to heating-induced softening, elucidating the competition between thermal-expansion-induced softening and HIH. This study advances fundamental understanding of V and Nb physics, providing crucial theoretical foundations for establishing accurate equations of state and constitutive models for these metals.</description>

      <title>Structure Matters: A Scale-Resolved Numerical Operando Approach for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lithium-Sulfur batteries (LSBs) are believed to have a high potential for aerospace applications due to their high gravimetric energy density. However, despite decades of research and advances, they still suffer from poor rate capability and low power output, eventually preventing their practical implementation. One particular aspect we want to shed light on is the influence of the porous cathode structure on the rate performance during discharge. Therefore, we present a scale-resolved simulation methodology that aims to provide structural insights into the electrochemical cell behavior that are experimentally hardly accessible even for modern operando methods. Our numerical operando approach employs high-performance computing (HPC) and is based on a coarse-grained continuum model. The latter is spatially discretized with a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method and advanced in time by an adaptive controller. The models and methods as well as HPC aspects of our toolbox will be critically discussed, finally showcasing the capabilities of our workflow to improve LSBs.</description>

      <title>Optical excitation of bulk plasmons in n-doped InAsSb thin films : investigating the second viscosity in electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that including the second viscosity of an electron gas in the hydrodynamic model allows for highly accurate modeling of the optical response of heavily doped semiconductors. In our setup, which improves resonance visibility compared to previous approaches, plasmon resonances become more distinct, allowing for a detailed analysis of the underlying physics. With advanced fitting techniques based on a physics-informed cost function and a tailored optimization algorithm, we obtain a close agreement between simulations and experimental data across different sample thicknesses. This enhanced resonance visibility, combined with our integrated approach, shows that key parameters such as doping level and effective electron mass, as well as the second viscosity of the electron gas, can be retrieved from a single optical measurement. The spatial dispersion taken into account in the hydrodynamic framework is essential for accurately describing the optical response of plasmonic materials in this frequency range and is likely to become a standard modeling approach.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum dynamics in two-dimensional lattices with tensor network influence functional belief propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07344v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Describing nonequilibrium quantum dynamics remains a significant computational challenge due to the growth of spatial entanglement. The tensor network influence functional (TN-IF) approach mitigates this problem for computing the time evolution of local observables by encoding the subsystem's influence functional path integral as a matrix product state (MPS), thereby shifting the resource governing computational cost from spatial entanglement to temporal entanglement. We extend the applicability of the TN-IF method to two-dimensional lattices by demonstrating its construction on tree lattices and proposing a belief propagation (BP) algorithm for the TN-IF, termed influence functional BP (IF-BP), to simulate local observable dynamics on arbitrary graphs. Even though the BP algorithm introduces uncontrolled approximation errors on arbitrary graphs, it provides an accurate description for locally tree-like lattices. Numerical simulations of the kicked Ising model on a heavy-hex lattice, motivated by a recent quantum experiment, highlight the effectiveness of the IF-BP method, which demonstrates superior performance in capturing long-time dynamics where traditional tensor network state-based methods struggle. Our results further reveal that the temporal entanglement entropy (TEE) only grows logarithmically with time for this model, resulting in a polynomial computational cost for the whole method. We further construct a cluster expansion of IF-BP to introduce loop correlations beyond the BP approximation, providing a systematic correction to the IF-BP estimate. We demonstrate the power of the cluster expansion of the IF-BP in simulating the quantum quench dynamics of the 2D transverse field Ising model, obtaining numerical results that improve on the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>FunDiff: Diffusion Models over Function Spaces for Physics-Informed Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling -- particularly diffusion models and flow matching -- have achieved remarkable success in synthesizing discrete data such as images and videos. However, adapting these models to physical applications remains challenging, as the quantities of interest are continuous functions governed by complex physical laws. Here, we introduce $\textbf{FunDiff}$, a novel framework for generative modeling in function spaces. FunDiff combines a latent diffusion process with a function autoencoder architecture to handle input functions with varying discretizations, generate continuous functions evaluable at arbitrary locations, and seamlessly incorporate physical priors. These priors are enforced through architectural constraints or physics-informed loss functions, ensuring that generated samples satisfy fundamental physical laws. We theoretically establish minimax optimality guarantees for density estimation in function spaces, showing that diffusion-based estimators achieve optimal convergence rates under suitable regularity conditions. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of FunDiff across diverse applications in fluid dynamics and solid mechanics. Empirical results show that our method generates physically consistent samples with high fidelity to the target distribution and exhibits robustness to noisy and low-resolution data.

      <title>Semi-Deterministic Quantum Dot Placement in Heteroepitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08432v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving deterministic placement of self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) during epitaxial growth is essential for the reliable and efficient fabrication of high-quality single-photon sources and solid-state cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) systems, yet it remains a significant challenge due to the inherent stochasticity of QD nucleation processes. In this work, we theoretically and numerically demonstrate that deterministic QD nucleation within a pristine growth region, e.g., InAs on a (001)-oriented GaAs substrate, can be achieved by engineering the boundary geometry of that region. During epitaxial growth, adatoms initially move toward the boundary and promote the formation of primary QDs along the boundary, driven by curvature and diffusion anisotropy. The resulting primary QDs distribution will generate many-body interactions that dynamically reshape the chemical potential landscape for subsequently deposited adatoms, enabling the formation of secondary QDs within the pristine growth region. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for reliable patterning of high optical-quality QDs, with potential applications in next-generation quantum photonic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing eigenvalues is a computationally intensive task central to numerous applications in the natural sciences. Toward this end, we investigate the quantum block Krylov subspace projector (QBKSP) algorithm - a multireference quantum Lanczos method designed to accurately compute low-lying eigenenergies, including degenerate ones, of quantum systems. We present three compact quantum circuits tailored to different problem settings for evaluating the required expectation values. To assess the impact of the number and fidelity of initial reference states, as well as time evolution duration, we perform error-free and limited-precision numerical simulations and quantum circuit simulations. Our results show that using multiple reference states significantly enhances convergence, particularly in precision-limited scenarios and in cases where a single reference state fails to capture all target eigenvalues. Additionally, the QBKSP algorithm allows for the determination of degenerate eigenstates and their multiplicities through appropriate convergence conditions.</description>

      <title>Mechanically and electrically switchable triferroic altermagnet in a pentagonal FeO2 monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional multiferroics promise low-power, multifunctional devices, yet the intrinsic coexistence and mutual control of three coupled ferroic orders in a single layer remains elusive. Here, we identify pentagonal monolayer FeO$_2$ as an intrinsic triferroic altermagnet where ferroelectric (FE), ferroelastic (FA), and altermagnetic (AM) orders coexist and are tightly coupled, accompanied by a competing antiferroelectric (AFE) phase using first-principles calculations. The sole presence of glide mirror $M_x$ symmetry in a FeO$_2$ sublayer, with the breaking of four-fold rotation $C_{4z}$ symmetry, induces in-plane vector ferroelectricity and twin-related ferroelastic strains. Both FE and AFE phases break combined parity - time symmetry and display sizable altermagnetic spin splitting with N\'eel temperatures over 200~K. Electric-field-induced rotation of the FE polarization reverses the sign of the spin splitting, while in-plane uniaxial strain triggers ferroelastic switching that simultaneously rotates the FE polarization vector by $90^\circ$ and reverses the AM state. These electric-field- and strain-mediated pathways interlink six distinct polarization states that can be selected purely by electric fields and/or mechanical strain. This work extends intrinsic triferroicity to pentagonal monolayers and outlines a symmetry-based route toward mechanically and electrically configurable altermagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>A HHO formulation for variable density incompressible flows where the density is purely advected</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a Hybrid High-Order (HHO) formulation of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with variable density that provides exact conservation of volume and, accordingly, pure advection of the density variable. The spatial discretization relies on hybrid velocity-density-pressure spaces and the temporal discretization is based on Explicit Singly Diagonal Implicit Runge-Kutta (ESDIRK) methods. The formulation possesses some attractive features that can be fruitfully exploited for the simulation of mixtures of immiscible incompressible fluids, namely: pressure-robustness, conservation of volume enforced cell-by-cell up to machine precision, robustness in the convection dominated regime thanks to upwind stabilizations, weak imposition of boundary conditions, implicit high-order accurate time stepping encompassing unsteady boundary conditions, reduced memory footprint thanks to static condensation, possibility to exploit inherited $p$-multilevel solution strategies to improve performance of iterative solvers. Numerical validation is performed showcasing convergence rates, pressure-robustness and pure advection of the density, thus we tackle the Rayleigh-Taylor instability at Reynolds $1~000$ and $5~000$.</description>

      <title>Extrapolation to infinite model space of no-core shell model calculations using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An ensemble of neural networks is employed to extrapolate no-core shell model (NCSM) results to infinite model space for light nuclei. We present a review of our neural network extrapolations of the NCSM results obtained with the Daejeon16 NN interaction in different model spaces and with different values of the NCSM basis parameter $\hbar\Omega$ for energies of nuclear states and root-mean-square (rms) radii of proton, neutron and matter distributions in light nuclei. The method yields convergent predictions with quantifiable uncertainties. Ground-state energies for $^{6}$Li, $^{6}$He, and the unbound $^{6}$Be, as well as the excited $(3^{+},0)$ and $(0^{+},1)$ states of $^{6}$Li, are obtained within a few hundred keV of experiment. The extrapolated radii of bound states converge well. In contrast, radii of unbound states in $^{6}$Be and $^{6}$Li do not stabilize.</description>

      <title>Addressing the gravitational collapse of a massless scalar field with Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational collapse of a massless scalar field remains a demanding benchmark for numerical methods in numerical relativity, as it exhibits critical behavior at the boundary between dispersion and black hole formation. In this work we revisit this problem by relying on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as flexible solvers for partial differential equations, thereby providing a comparative assessment of several recent neural architectures. Building on the Einstein-massless-Klein-Gordon formulation in polar-areal coordinates, we consider four initial-value problems encompassing subcritical, critical, and supercritical regimes and use high-resolution finite-difference simulations as reference solutions. Our study is primarily comparative: we evaluate several state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, including vanilla and high-precision PINNs, sinusoidal-feature and quadratic-residual variants, and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, all trained under a common loss design that encodes the field equations, boundary conditions, and causal time-space enforcement, together with a novel adaptive spacetime sampling. Within this framework we also introduce ModPINN, a modest modification of standard PINNs that augments standard multilayer perceptrons with coordinate embeddings, quadratic layers, and other common ingredients in recent literature. This study shows that deep-learning-based methods can reproduce finite-difference solutions for the scalar field and the spacetime metric with competitive accuracy using significantly fewer collocation points than more traditional methodologies. While no single architecture dominates in all regimes, ModPINN achieves particularly stable and accurate solutions near criticality, indicating that suitably designed embeddings and adaptive sampling can enhance the robustness of PINNs for challenging gravitational-collapse scenarios.</description>
