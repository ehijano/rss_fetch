      <title>Lie symmetries, closed-form solutions, and conservation laws of a constitutive equation modeling stress in elastic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lie-point symmetry method is used to find some closed-form solutions for a constitutive equation modeling stress in elastic materials. The partial differential equation (PDE), which involves a power law with arbitrary exponent n, was investigated by Mason and his collaborators (Magan et al., Wave Motion, 77, 156-185, 2018). The Lie algebra for the model is five-dimensional for the shearing exponent n &gt; 0, and it includes translations in time, space, and displacement, as well as time-dependent changes in displacement and a scaling symmetry. Several reductions and closed-form solutions for the model are established by utilizing different combinations of Lie symmetries, both for general n and for the specific case where n = 1. Furthermore, it is shown that for general n &gt; 0 the model has interesting conservation laws which are computed with symbolic software using the scaling symmetry of the given PDE.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable stochastic spectator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic formalism of inflation allows us to describe the scalar-field dynamics in a non-perturbative way. The correspondence between the diffusion and Schr\"{o}dinger equations makes it possible to exhaustively construct analytical solutions in stochastic inflation. Those exact statistical quantities such as distribution and correlation functions have one-to-one correspondence to the exactly solvable solutions in non-relativistic quantum mechanics in terms of classical orthogonal polynomials. A class of such solutions is presented by means of isospectral Hamiltonians with an underlying symmetry called shape invariance.</description>

      <title>Kahan-Hirota-Kimura maps preserving original cubic hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the set of cubic Hamiltonian vector fields for which their associated Kahan-Hirota-Kimura maps preserve the original Hamiltonian function. We analyze these fields in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^4$. We also study a family of fields in $\mathbb{R}^6$. Additionally, we explore several properties like the existence of additional first integrals of specific type, the possibility that the initial Hamiltonian vector field is a Lie symmetry of the corresponding map, or the symplecticity of the considered maps.</description>

      <title>The deformed Inozemtsev spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13066v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Inozemtsev chain is an exactly solvable interpolation between the short-range Heisenberg and long-range Haldane-Shastry (HS) chains. In order to unlock its potential to study spin interactions with tunable interaction range using the powerful tools of integrability, the model's mathematical properties require better understanding. As a major step in this direction, we present a new generalisation of the Inozemtsev chain with spin symmetry reduced to U(1), interpolating between a Heisenberg xxz chain and the xxz-type HS chain, and integrable throughout. Underlying it is a new quantum many-body system that extends the elliptic Ruijsenaars system by including spins, contains the trigonometric spin-Ruijsenaars-Macdonald system as a special case, and yields our spin chain by 'freezing'. Our models have potential applications from condensed-matter to high-energy theory, and provide a crucial step towards a general theory for long-range integrability.</description>

      <title>Bethe ansatz inside Calogero-Sutherland models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the trigonometric quantum spin-Calogero-Sutherland model, and the Haldane-Shastry spin chain as a special case, using a Bethe-ansatz analysis. We harness the model's Yangian symmetry to import the standard tools of integrability for Heisenberg spin chains into the world of integrable long-range models with spins. From the transfer matrix with a diagonal twist we construct Heisenberg-style symmetries (Bethe algebra) that refine the usual hierarchy of commuting Hamiltonians (quantum determinant) of the spin-Calogero-Sutherland model. We compute the first few of these new conserved charges explicitly, and diagonalise them by Bethe ansatz inside each irreducible Yangian representation. This yields a new eigenbasis for the spin-Calogero-Sutherland model that generalises the Yangian Gelfand-Tsetlin basis of Takemura and Uglov. The Bethe-ansatz analysis involves non-generic values of the inhomogeneities. Our review of the inhomogeneous Heisenberg XXX chain, with special attention to how the Bethe ansatz works in the presence of fusion, may be of independent interest.</description>
