      <title>Temporal coherences of atomic chaotic light sources: the Siegert relation and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light is characterized by its electric field, yet quantum optics has revealed the importance of monitoring photon-photon correlations at all orders. We here present a comparative study of two experimental setups, composed of cold and warm Rubidium atoms, respectively, which allow us to probe and compare photon correlations up to the fourth order. The former operates in the quantum regime where spontaneous emission dominates, whereas the latter exhibits a temperature-limited coherence time. While both setups present almost-chaotic light statistics, we discuss how the access to different orders of photon correlations allows one to better characterize the mechanisms responsible for deviations from those statistics.</description>

      <title>Laser mode-hopping assisted all-optical single beam pulsed atomic magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate an all-optical single beam pulsed atomic magnetometer assisted by laser mode-hopping in a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) laser. We implement a temporal sequence of the laser current; sinusoidal current modulation including the laser mode-hop current for synchronous optical pumping and the following constant current for paramagnetic Faraday rotation measurements to probe the free induction decay (FID) of transverse $^{87}$Rb spin polarization. Repetitive sudden frequency shifts of 20 GHz around the pressure-broadened $^{87}$Rb spectra originating from laser mode-hopping enables discontinuous optical pumping modulation with a large depth which enhances transverse spin polarization. We achieve a sensitivity of 3.77 pT/Hz$^{1/2}$ in a magnetic field of 14 $\mu$T, limited by the performance of the frequency counter. The Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the sensitivity due to the non-magnetic noise such as photon shot-noise is 191 fT/Hz$^{1/2}$. Our approach based on laser mode-hopping can be applied to miniaturization of all-optical atomic magnetometers with sub-pT/Hz$^{1/2}$ sensitivities.</description>

      <title>Individual-Ion Addressing and Readout in a Penning Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement individual addressing and readout of ions in a rigidly rotating planar crystal in a compact, permanent magnet Penning trap. The crystal of $^{40}$Ca$^+$ is trapped and stabilized without defects via a rotating triangular potential. The trapped ion fluorescence is detected in the rotating frame for parallel readout. The qubit is encoded in the metastable D$_{5/2}$ manifold enabling the use of high-power near-infrared laser systems for qubit operations. Addressed $\sigma_z$ operations are realized with a focused AC Stark shifting laser beam. We demonstrate addressing of ions near the center of the crystal and at large radii. Simulations show that the current addressing operation fidelity is limited to $\sim 97\%$ by the ion's thermal extent for the in-plane modes near the Doppler limit, but this could be improved to infidelities $&lt;10^{-3}$ with sub-Doppler cooling. The techniques demonstrated in this paper complete the set of operations for quantum simulation with the platform.</description>

      <title>Shaped-pulse optimisation of coherent soft-x-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation is one of the most extreme nonlinear-optical processes observed to date. By focusing an intense laser pulse into a gas, the light-atom interaction that occurs during the process of ionising the atoms results in the generation of harmonics of the driving laser frequency, that extend up to order ~300 (corresponding to photon energies from 4 to &gt;500eV). Because this technique is simple to implement and generates coherent, laser-like, soft-x-ray beams, it is currently being developed for applications in science and technology including probing of dynamics in chemical and materials systems and for imaging. In this work we demonstrate that by carefully controlling the shape of intense light pulses of 6-8 optical cycles, we can control the interaction of light with an atom as it is being ionised, in a way that improves the efficiency of x-ray generation by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is possible to control the spectral characteristics of the emitted radiation and to channel the interaction between different- order nonlinear processes. The result is an increased utility of harmonic generation as a light source, as well as the first demonstration of optical pulse-shaping techniques to control high-order nonlinear processes.</description>

      <title>Phase matching of high harmonic generation in the soft and hard X-ray regions of the spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how bright, fully coherent, hard x-ray beams can be generated through nonlinear upconversion of femtosecond laser light. By using longer-wavelength mid-infrared driving lasers of moderate peak intensity, full phase matching of the high harmonic generation process can extend, in theory, into the hard x-ray region of the spectrum. We identify the dominant phase matching mechanism for long wavelength driving lasers, and verify our predictions experimentally by demonstrating phase-matched up-conversion into the soft x-ray region of the spectrum around 330 eV using an extended, high-pressure, gas medium that is weakly ionized by the laser. Scaling of the overall conversion efficiency is surprisingly favorable as the wavelength of the driving laser is increased, making useful, fully coherent, multi-keV x-ray sources feasible. Finally, we show that the rapidly decreasing microscopic single-atom yield at longer driving wavelengths is compensated macroscopically by an increasing optimal pressure for phase matching and a rapidly decreasing reabsorption of the generated light at higher photon energies.</description>

      <title>Efficient configuration-interaction models for photoionization of molecular dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present R-matrix calculations of photoionization of molecular monomers and dimers, focusing on ammonia (NH3) and formic acid (HCOOH), utilizing configuration-interaction models including the Occupation-Restricted Multiple Active Space (ORMAS) approach. We show that ORMAS is a highly efficient choice for calculating photoionization observables, yielding results that are in excellent agreement with those obtained using the much more demanding configuration-interaction method, Complete Active Space (CAS). We demonstrate that models incorporating single and double (SD) excitations with respect to the Hartree-Fock configuration provide good agreement with experimental data. The approach developed here can be readily applied to study photoionization in complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>High-precision measurement of the atomic mass of $^{84}$Sr and implications to isotope shift studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The absolute mass of $^{84}$Sr was determined using the phase-imaging ion-cyclotron-resonance technique with the JYFLTRAP double Penning trap mass spectrometer. A more precise value for the mass of $^{84}$Sr is essential for providing potential indications of physics beyond the Standard Model through high-precision isotope shift measurements of Sr atomic transition frequencies. The mass excess of $^{84}$Sr was refined to be -80649.229(37) keV/c$^2$ from high-precision cyclotron-frequency-ratio measurements with a relative precision of 4.8$\times$10$^{-10}$. The obtained mass-excess value is in agreement with the adopted value in the Atomic Mass Evaluation 2020, but is 30 times more precise. With this new value, we confirm the previously observed nonlinearity in the study of the isotope shift of strontium. Moreover, the double-beta ($2\beta^{+}$) decay $Q$ value of $^{84}$Sr was directly determined to be 1790.115(37) keV, and the precision was improved by a factor of 30.</description>

      <title>Atomic magnetometry using a metasurface polarizing beamsplitter in silicon on sapphire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate atomic magnetometry using a metasurface polarizing beamsplitter fabricated on a silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) platform. The metasurface splits a beam that is near-resonant with the rubidium atoms (795 nm) into orthogonal linear polarizations, enabling measurement of magnetically sensitive circular birefringence in a rubidium vapor through balanced polarimetry. We incorporated the metasurface into an atomic magnetometer based on nonlinear magneto-optical rotation and measured sub-nanotesla sensitivity, which is limited by low-frequency technical noise and transmission loss through the metasurface. To our knowledge, this work represents the first demonstration of SOS nanophotonics for atom-based sensing and paves the way for highly integrated, miniaturized atomic sensors with enhanced sensitivity and portability.</description>

      <title>The Four-Boson First-Excited State Near Two-Body Unitarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near two-body unitarity, the three-boson system is characterized by an approximate discrete scale invariance manifest in a geometric tower of bound states (the Efimov effect). In the absence of a strong four-body force, the four-boson system has two states associated with each Efimov state, one very nearly unstable, the other several times deeper. We study correlations between the excited- and ground-state properties, such as binding energies and radii, up to next-to-leading order in an effective field theory for short-range forces. We obtain the parameters in these correlations from similar correlations arising from existing precise calculations based on short-range potentials. We also derive correlations among excited-state properties that emerge from the proximity of the state to the break-up threshold into a boson and a three-boson bound state, using an effective field theory for "halo" states.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Transition Energy Measurements of Neonlike Fe XVII Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We improve by a factor of 4-20 the energy accuracy of the strongest soft X-ray transitions of Fe XVII ions by resonantly exciting them in an electron beam ion trap with a monochromatic beam at the P04 beamline of the PETRA III synchrotron facility. By simultaneously tracking instantaneous photon-energy fluctuations with a high-resolution photoelectron spectrometer, we minimize systematic uncertainties down to 10-15 meV, or velocity-equivalent +/- ~5 km/s in their rest energies, substantially improving our knowledge of this key astrophysical ion. Our large-scale configuration-interaction computations include more than four million relativistic configurations and agree with the experiment at a level without precedent for a ten-electron system. Thereby, theoretical uncertainties for interelectronic correlations become far smaller than those of quantum electrodynamics (QED) corrections. The present QED benchmark strengthens our trust in future calculations of many other complex atomic ions of interest to astrophysics, plasma physics, and for the development of optical clocks with highly charged ions.</description>

      <title>Long-range dipole-dipole exchange-induced atomic grating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical scheme for dipole exchange-induced grating (DEIG) based on a hybrid system consisting of ultra-cold Rubidium ($^{87}$Rb) atomic ensemble and movable Rydberg spin atoms. The optical response of the grating appears as a superposition of three- and four-level configurations, similar to the cooperative optical nonlinear effect caused by the dipole blockade effect. However, such Rydberg atomic grating uniquely responds to the spatial positions of spin atoms, offering a novel approach to dynamically control electromagnetically induced gratings (EIG) except for input probe intensity.</description>
