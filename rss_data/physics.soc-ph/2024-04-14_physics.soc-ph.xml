      <title>Opinion dynamics on signed graphs and graphons: Beyond the piece-wise constant case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we make use of graphon theory to study opinion dynamics on large networks. The opinion dynamics models that we take into consideration allow for negative interactions between the individual, i.e. competing entities whose opinions can grow apart. We consider both the repelling model and the opposing model that are studied in the literature. We define the repelling and the opposing dynamics on graphons and we show that their initial value problem's solutions exist and are unique. We then show that the graphon dynamics well approximate the dynamics on large graphs that converge to a graphon. This result applies to large random graphs that are sampled according to a graphon. All these facts are illustrated in an extended numerical example.</description>

      <title>Functional reducibility of higher-order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical complex systems are widely assumed to be characterized not only by pairwise interactions, but also by higher-order (group) interactions that affect collective phenomena, from metabolic reactions to epidemics. Nevertheless, higher-order networks' superior descriptive power -- compared to classical pairwise networks -- comes with a much increased model complexity and computational cost. Consequently, it is of paramount importance to establish a quantitative method to determine when such a modeling framework is advantageous with respect to pairwise models, and to which extent it provides a parsimonious description of empirical systems. Here, we propose a principled method, based on information compression, to analyze the reducibility of higher-order networks to lower-order interactions, by identifying redundancies in diffusion processes while preserving the relevant functional information. The analysis of a broad spectrum of empirical systems shows that, although some networks contain non-compressible group interactions, others can be effectively approximated by lower-order interactions -- some technological and biological systems even just by pairwise interactions. More generally, our findings mark a significant step towards minimizing the dimensionality of models for complex systems</description>

      <title>The Impact of School and Family Networks on COVID-19 Infections Among Dutch Students: A Study Using Population-Level Registry Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the impact of different social interactions is key to improving epidemic models. Here, we use extensive registry data -- including PCR test results and population-level networks -- to investigate the impact of school, family, and other social contacts on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the Netherlands (June 2020--October 2021). We isolate and compare different contexts of potential SARS-CoV-2 transmission by matching pairs of students based on their attendance at the same or different primary school (in 2020) and secondary school (in 2021) and their geographic proximity. We then calculated the probability of temporally associated infections -- i.e. the probability of both students testing positive within a 14-day period.
  Our results highlight the relative importance of household and family transmission in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 compared to school settings. The probability of temporally associated infections for siblings and parent-child pairs living in the same household was 22.6--23.2\%, and 4.7--7.9\% for family members living in different household. In contrast, the probability of temporally associated infections was 0.52\% for pairs of students living nearby but not attending the same primary or secondary school, 0.66\% for pairs attending different secondary schools but having attended the same primary school, and 1.65\% for pairs attending the same secondary school. Finally, we used multilevel regression analyses to examine how individual, school, and geographic factors contribute to transmission risk. We found that the largest differences in transmission probabilities were due to unobserved individual (60\%) and school-level (34\%) factors. Only a small proportion (3\%) could be attributed to geographic proximity of students or to school size, denomination, or the median income of the school area.</description>

      <title>Effects of clustering heterogeneity on the spectral density of sparse networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive exact equations for the spectral density of sparse networks with an arbitrary distribution of the number of single edges and triangles per node. These equations enable a systematic investigation of the effect of clustering on the spectral properties of the network adjacency matrix. In the case of heterogeneous networks, we demonstrate that the spectral density becomes more symmetric as the fluctuations in the triangle-degree sequence increase. This phenomenon is explained by the small clustering coefficient of networks with a large variance of the triangle-degree distribution. In the homogeneous case of regular clustered networks, we find that both perturbative and non-perturbative approximations fail to predict the spectral density in the high-connectivity limit. This suggests that traditional large-degree approximations may be ineffective in studying the spectral properties of networks with more complex motifs. Our theoretical results are fully confirmed by numerical diagonalizations of finite adjacency matrices.</description>

      <title>Clustering Analysis of US COVID-19 Rates, Vaccine Participation, and Socioeconomic Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges worldwide, with its impact varying significantly across different geographic and socioeconomic contexts. This study employs a clustering analysis to examine the diversity of responses to the pandemic within the United States, aiming to provide nuanced insights into the effectiveness of various strategies. We utilize an unsupervised machine learning approach, specifically K-Means clustering, to analyze county-level data that includes variables such as infection rates, death rates, demographic profiles, and socio-economic factors. Our analysis identifies distinct clusters of counties based on their pandemic responses and outcomes, facilitating a detailed examination of "high-performing" and "lower-performing" groups. These classifications are informed by a combination of COVID-specific datasets and broader socio-economic data, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the factors that contribute to differing levels of pandemic impact. The findings underscore the importance of tailored public health responses that consider local conditions and capabilities. Additionally, this study introduces an innovative visualization tool that aids in hypothesis testing and further research, enhancing the ability of policymakers and public health officials to deploy more effective and targeted interventions in future health crises.</description>

      <title>SIR-RL: Reinforcement Learning for Optimized Policy Control during Epidemiological Outbreaks in Emerging Market and Developing Economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The outbreak of COVID-19 has highlighted the intricate interplay between public health and economic stability on a global scale. This study proposes a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to optimize health and economic outcomes during pandemics. The framework leverages the SIR model, integrating both lockdown measures (via a stringency index) and vaccination strategies to simulate disease dynamics. The stringency index, indicative of the severity of lockdown measures, influences both the spread of the disease and the economic health of a country. Developing nations, which bear a disproportionate economic burden under stringent lockdowns, are the primary focus of our study. By implementing reinforcement learning, we aim to optimize governmental responses and strike a balance between the competing costs associated with public health and economic stability. This approach also enhances transparency in governmental decision-making by establishing a well-defined reward function for the reinforcement learning agent. In essence, this study introduces an innovative and ethical strategy to navigate the challenge of balancing public health and economic stability amidst infectious disease outbreaks.</description>

      <title>Strategic Interactions between Large Language Models-based Agents in Beauty Contests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing adoption of large language models (LLMs) presents substantial potential for deeper understanding of human behaviours within game theory frameworks through simulations. Leveraging on the diverse pool of LLM types and addressing the gap in research on competitive games, this paper examines the strategic interactions among multiple types of LLM-based agents in a classical game of beauty contest. Drawing parallels to experiments involving human subjects, LLM-based agents are assessed similarly in terms of strategic levels. They demonstrate varying depth of reasoning that falls within a range of level-0 and 1, and show convergence in actions in repeated settings. Furthermore, I also explore how variations in group composition of agent types influence strategic behaviours, where I found higher proportion of fixed-strategy opponents enhances convergence for LLM-based agents, and having a mixed environment with agents of differing relative strategic levels accelerates convergence for all agents. There could also be higher average payoffs for the more intelligent agents, albeit at the expense of the less intelligent agents. These results not only provide insights into outcomes for simulated agents under specified scenarios, it also offer valuable implications for understanding strategic interactions between algorithms.</description>

      <title>Chapter: Vulnerability of Quantum Information Systems to Collective Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:1901.08873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The highly specialist terms `quantum computing' and `quantum information', together with the broader term `quantum technologies', now appear regularly in the mainstream media. While this is undoubtedly highly exciting for physicists and investors alike, a key question for society concerns such systems' vulnerabilities -- and in particular, their vulnerability to collective manipulation. Here we present and discuss a new form of vulnerability in such systems, that we have identified based on detailed many-body quantum mechanical calculations. The impact of this new vulnerability is that groups of adversaries can maximally disrupt these systems' global quantum state which will then jeopardize their quantum functionality. It will be almost impossible to detect these attacks since they do not change the Hamiltonian and the purity remains the same; they do not entail any real-time communication between the attackers; and they can last less than a second. We also argue that there can be an implicit amplification of such attacks because of the statistical character of modern non-state actor groups. A countermeasure could be to embed future quantum technologies within redundant classical networks. We purposely structure the discussion in this chapter so that the first sections are self-contained and can be read by non-specialists.</description>
