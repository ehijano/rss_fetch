      <title>Dynamically generated concatenated codes and their phase diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate code concatenation as the action of a unitary quantum circuit on an expanding tree geometry and find that for certain classes of gates, applied identically at each node, a binary tree circuit encodes a single logical qubit with code distance that grows exponentially in the depth of the tree. When there is noise in the bulk or at the end of this encoding circuit, the system undergoes a phase transition between a coding phase, where an optimal decoder can successfully recover logical information, and non-coding phase. Leveraging the tree structure, we combine the formalism of "tensor enumerators" from quantum coding theory with standard recursive techniques for classical spin models on the Bethe lattice to explore these phases. In the presence of bulk errors, the coding phase is a type of spin glass, characterized by a distribution of failure probabilities. When the errors are heralded, the recursion relation is exactly solvable, giving us an analytic handle on the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Force field optimization by end-to-end differentiable atomistic simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accuracy of atomistic simulations depends on the precision of force fields. Traditional numerical methods often struggle to optimize the empirical force field parameters for reproducing target properties. Recent approaches rely on training these force fields based on forces and energies from first-principle simulations. However, it is unclear whether these approaches will enable capturing complex material responses such as vibrational, or elastic properties. To this extent, we introduce a framework, employing inner loop simulations and outer loop optimization, that exploits automatic differentiation for both property prediction and force-field optimization by computing gradients of the simulation analytically. We demonstrate the approach by optimizing classical Stillinger-Weber and EDIP potentials for silicon systems to reproduce the elastic constants, vibrational density of states, and phonon dispersion. We also demonstrate how a machine-learned potential can be fine-tuned using automatic differentiation to reproduce any target property such as radial distribution functions. Interestingly, the resulting force field exhibits improved accuracy and generalizability to unseen temperatures than those fine-tuned on energies and forces. Finally, we demonstrate the extension of the approach to optimize the force fields towards multiple target properties. Altogether, differentiable simulations, through the analytical computation of their gradients, offer a powerful tool for both theoretical exploration and practical applications toward understanding physical systems and materials.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional learning of narrow neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have been marked with the fast-pace diversification and increasing ubiquity of machine learning applications. Yet, a firm theoretical understanding of the surprising efficiency of neural networks to learn from high-dimensional data still proves largely elusive. In this endeavour, analyses inspired by statistical physics have proven instrumental, enabling the tight asymptotic characterization of the learning of neural networks in high dimensions, for a broad class of solvable models. This manuscript reviews the tools and ideas underlying recent progress in this line of work. We introduce a generic model -- the sequence multi-index model -- which encompasses numerous previously studied models as special instances. This unified framework covers a broad class of machine learning architectures with a finite number of hidden units, including multi-layer perceptrons, autoencoders, attention mechanisms; and tasks, including (un)supervised learning, denoising, contrastive learning, in the limit of large data dimension, and comparably large number of samples. We explicate in full detail the analysis of the learning of sequence multi-index models, using statistical physics techniques such as the replica method and approximate message-passing algorithms. This manuscript thus provides a unified presentation of analyses reported in several previous works, and a detailed overview of central techniques in the field of statistical physics of machine learning. This review should be a useful primer for machine learning theoreticians curious of statistical physics approaches; it should also be of value to statistical physicists interested in the transfer of such ideas to the study of neural networks.</description>

      <title>The route of random process to ultraslow aging phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Logarithmic aging phenomena are prevalent in various systems, including electronic materials and biological structures. This study utilizes a generalized continuous time random walk (CTRW) framework to investigate the mechanisms behind the logarithmic aging phenomena. By incorporating non-Markovian jump processes with significant memory effects, we modify traditional diffusion models to exhibit logarithmic decay in both survival and return probabilities. In addition, we analyze the impact of aging on autocorrelation functions, illustrating how long-term memory behaviors affect the temporal evolution of physical properties. These results connect microscopic models to macroscopic manifestations in real-world systems, advancing the understanding of ultraslow dynamics in disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Slowly Quenched, High Pressure Glassy B$_2$O$_3$ at DFT Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling inorganic glasses requires an accurate representation of interatomic interactions, large system sizes to allow for intermediate-range structural order, and slow quenching rates to eliminate kinetically trapped structural motifs. Neither first principles- nor force field-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations satisfy these three criteria unequivocally. Herein, we report the development of a machine learning potential (MLP) for a classic glass, B$_2$O$_3$, which meets these goals well. The MLP is trained on condensed phase configurations whose energies and forces on the atoms are obtained using periodic quantum density functional theory. Deep potential MD (DPMD) simulations based on this MLP accurately predict the equation of state and the densification of the glass with slower quenching from the melt. At ambient conditions, quenching rates larger than 10$^{11}$ K/s are shown to lead to artifacts in the structure. Pressure-dependent X-ray and neutron structure factors from the simulations compare excellently with experimental data. High-pressure simulations of the glass show varied coordination geometries of boron and oxygen, which concur with experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Center vortices and localized Dirac modes in the deconfined phase of 2+1 dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the deconfinement transition in 2+1 dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory both as a percolation transition of center vortices and as a localization transition for the low-lying Dirac modes. We study in detail the critical properties of the Anderson transition in the Dirac spectrum in the deconfined phase, showing that it is of BKT type; and the critical properties of the center-vortex percolation transition, showing that they differ from those of ordinary two-dimensional percolation. We then study the relation between localized modes and center vortices in the deconfined phase, identifying the simple center-vortex structures that mainly support the localized Dirac modes. As the system transitions to the confined phase, center vortices merge together into an infinite cluster, causing the low Dirac modes to delocalize.</description>

      <title>Probing multi-mobility edges in quasiperiodic mosaic lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mobility edge (ME) is a crucial concept in understanding localization physics, marking the critical transition between extended and localized states in the energy spectrum. Anderson localization scaling theory predicts the absence of ME in lower dimensional systems. Hence, the search for exact MEs, particularly for single particles in lower dimensions, has recently garnered significant interest in both theoretical and experimental studies, resulting in notable progress. However, several open questions remain, including the possibility of a single system exhibiting multiple MEs and the continual existence of extended states, even within the strong disorder domain. Here, we provide experimental evidence to address these questions by utilizing a quasiperiodic mosaic lattice with meticulously designed nanophotonic circuits. Our observations demonstrate the coexistence of both extended and localized states in lattices with broken duality symmetry and varying modulation periods. By single site injection and scanning the disorder level, we could approximately probe the ME of the modulated lattice. These results corroborate recent theoretical predictions, introduce a new avenue for investigating ME physics, and offer inspiration for further exploration of ME physics in the quantum regime using hybrid integrated photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Nematic Phase of the n-Component Cubic-Spin Spin Glass in d=3: Liquid-Crystal Phase in a Dirty Magnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A nematic phase, previously seen in the d=3 classical Heisenberg spin-glass system, occurs in the n-component cubic-spin spin-glass system, between the low-temperature spin-glass phase and the high temperature disordered phase, for number of components n &gt;= 3, in spatial dimension d=3, thus constituting a liquid-crystal phase in a dirty (quenched-disordered) magnet. This result is obtained from renormalization-group calculations that are exact on the hierarchical lattice and, equivalently, approximate on the cubic spatial lattice. The nematic phase completely intervenes between the spin-glass phase and the disordered phase. The Lyapunov exponents of the spin-glass chaos are calculated from n=1 up to n=12 and show odd-even oscillations with respect to n.</description>

      <title>Axial, Planar-Diagonal, Body-Diagonal Fields on the Cubic-Spin Spin Glass in d=3: A Plethora of Ordered Phases under Finite Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A nematic phase, previously seen in the d=3 classical Heisenberg spin-glass system, occurs in the n-component cubic-spin spin-glass system, between the low-temperature spin-glass phase and the high-temperature disordered phase, for number of spin components n \geq 3, in spatial dimension d=3, thus constituting a liquid-crystal phase in a dirty (quenched-disordered) magnet. Furthermore, under application of a variety of uniform magnetic fields, a veritable plethora of phases are found. Under uniform magnetic fields, 17 different phases and two spin-glass phase diagram topologies (meaning the occurrences and relative positions of the many phases), qualitatively different from the conventional spin-glass phase diagram topology, are seen. The chaotic rescaling behaviors and their Lyapunov exponents are calculated in each of these spin-glass phase diagram topologies. These results are obtained from renormalization-group calculations that are exact on the d=3 hierarchical lattice and, equivalently, approximate on the cubic spatial lattice. Axial, planar-diagonal, or body-diagonal finite-strength uniform fields are applied to n=2 and 3 component cubic-spin spin-glass systems in d=3.</description>

      <title>Hybrid scaling properties of localization transition in a non-Hermitian disorder Aubry-Andr\'{e} model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the critical behaviors in the non-Hermitian disorder Aubry-Andr\'{e} (DAA) model, and we assume the non-Hermiticity is introduced by nonreciprocal hopping. We employ the localization length $\xi$, the inverse participation ratio ($\rm IPR$), and the energy gap $\Delta E$ as the characteristic quantities to describe the critical properties of the localization transition. By performing scaling analysis, the critical exponents of the non-Hermitian Anderson model and the non-Hermitian DAA model are obtained, and these critical exponents are different from their Hermitian counterparts, indicating that the Hermitian and non-Hermitian Anderson and DAA models belong to different universality classes. The critical exponents of the non-Hermitian DAA model are remarkably different from both the pure non-Hermitian AA model and the non-Hermitian Anderson model, showing that disorder is an independent relevant direction at the non-Hermitian AA model critical point. We further propose a hybrid scaling law to describe the critical behavior in the overlapping critical region constituted by the critical regions of the non-Hermitian DAA model and the non-Hermitian Anderson localization.</description>

      <title>Exact Diagonalization Study on Avalanches in Many-Body Localized Constrained Spin Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Avalanches are believed to be the mechanism behind the transition from many-body localization to the thermal phase. We utilize spin chains with constraints to study the physics of quantum avalanches by exact diagonalization of disordered systems coupled to a thermal bath. Single-spin observables are used to characterize localization and quantify the influence of the thermal bath on disordered spin chains. Constraints on the Hilbert space confine the dynamics to a subspace, effectively reducing the Hilbert space dimension and enabling the study of larger systems with limited computational resources. We study the PXP model, and in addition, we construct spin chains with constraints by searching for constraints with a genetic algorithm to reach larger system sizes. We define quantities to measure the strength of avalanches and use these to compare different models. We find that avalanches are more pronounced in models with constraints compared to those without constraints. Results from exact diagonalization are compared with those from studying the master equation. We also identify models that exhibit no thermal phases and find stable ergodicity breaking.</description>

      <title>On the topology of solutions to random continuous constraint satisfaction problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the set of solutions to $M$ random polynomial equations whose $N$ variables are restricted to the $(N-1)$-sphere. Each equation has independent Gaussian coefficients and a target value $V_0$. When solutions exist, they form a manifold. We compute the average Euler characteristic of this manifold in the limit of large $N$, and find different behavior depending on the target value $V_0$, the ratio $\alpha=M/N$, and the variances of the coefficients. We divide this behavior into five phases with different implications for the topology of the solution manifold. When $M=1$ there is a correspondence between this problem and level sets of the energy in the spherical spin glasses. We conjecture that the transition energy dividing two of the topological phases corresponds to the energy asymptotically reached by gradient descent from a random initial condition, possibly resolving an open problem in out-of-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.10952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Behavioral homogeneity is often critical for the functioning of network systems of interacting entities. In power grids, whose stable operation requires generator frequencies to be synchronized--and thus homogeneous--across the network, previous work suggests that the stability of synchronous states can be improved by making the generators homogeneous. Here, we show that a substantial additional improvement is possible by instead making the generators suitably heterogeneous. We develop a general method for attributing this counterintuitive effect to converse symmetry breaking, a recently established phenomenon in which the system must be asymmetric to maintain a stable symmetric state. These findings constitute the first demonstration of converse symmetry breaking in real-world systems, and our method promises to enable identification of this phenomenon in other networks whose functions rely on behavioral homogeneity.</description>

      <title>Floquet second-order topological Anderson insulator hosting corner localized modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of random disorder in a metallic system accounts for the localization of extended states in general. On the contrary, the presence of disorder can induce topological phases hosting metallic boundary states out of a non-topological system, giving birth to the topological Anderson insulator phase. In this context, we theoretically investigate the generation of an out of equilibrium higher-order topological Anderson phase in the presence of disorder potential in a time-periodic dynamical background. In particular, the time-dependent drive and the disorder potential concomitantly render the generation of Floquet higher-order topological Anderson insulator~(FHOTAI) phase, while the clean, undriven system is topologically trivial. We showcase the generation of FHOTAI hosting both $0$- and $\pi$-modes. Most importantly, we develop the real space topological invariant -- a winding number based on chiral symmetry to characterize the Floquet $0$- and $\pi$-modes distinctly. This chiral winding number serves the purpose of the indicator for the topological phase transition in the presence of drive as well as disorder and appropriately characterizes the FHOTAI.</description>

Abstract: We provide an analytical study of the evolution of the Hessian during gradient descent dynamics, and relate a transition in its spectral properties to the ability of finding good minima. We focus on the phase retrieval problem as a case study for complex loss landscapes. We first characterize the high-dimensional limit where both the number $M$ and the dimension $N$ of the data are going to infinity at fixed signal-to-noise ratio $\alpha = M/N$. For small $\alpha$, the Hessian is uninformative with respect to the signal. For $\alpha$ larger than a critical value, the Hessian displays at short-times a downward direction pointing towards good minima. While descending, a transition in the spectrum takes place: the direction is lost and the system gets trapped in bad minima. Hence, the local landscape is benign and informative at first, before gradient descent brings the system into a uninformative maze. Through both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we show that this dynamical transition plays a crucial role for finite (even very large) $N$: it allows the system to recover the signal well before the algorithmic threshold corresponding to the $N\rightarrow\infty$ limit. Our analysis sheds light on this new mechanism that facilitates gradient descent dynamics in finite dimensions, and highlights the importance of a good initialization based on spectral properties for optimization in complex high-dimensional landscapes.</description>
