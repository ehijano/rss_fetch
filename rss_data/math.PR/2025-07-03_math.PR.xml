      <title>Local laws and spectral properties of deformed sparse random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider deformed sparse random matrices of the form $H= W+ \lambda V$, where $W$ is a real symmetric sparse random matrix, $V$ is a random or deterministic, real, diagonal matrix whose entries are independent of $W$, and $\lambda = O(1) $ is a coupling constant. Under mild assumptions on the matrix entries of $W$ and $V$, we prove local laws for $H$ that compares the empirical spectral measure of it with a refined version of the deformed semicircle law. By applying the local laws, we also prove several spectral properties of $H$, including the rigidity of the eigenvalues and the asymptotic normality of the extremal eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Random dynamical systems for McKean--Vlasov SDEs via rough path theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of random dynamical systems for McKean--Vlasov SDEs is established. This is approached by considering the joint dynamics of the corresponding nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation governing the law of the system and the underlying stochastic differential equation (SDE) as a dynamical system on the product space $\RR^d \times \mathcal{P}(\RR^d)$.
  The proof relies on two main ingredients: At the level of the SDE, a pathwise rough path-based solution theory for SDEs with time-dependent coefficients is implemented, while at the level of the PDE a well-posedness theory is developed, for measurable solutions and allowing for degenerate diffusion coefficients.
  The results apply in particular to the so-called ensemble Kalman sampler (EKS), proving the existence of an associated RDS under some assumptions on the posterior, as well as to the Lagrangian formulation of the Landau equation with Maxwell molecules. As a by-product of the main results, the uniqueness of solutions non-linear Fokker--Planck equations associated to the EKS is shown.</description>

      <title>An Improved Lower Bound for the Critical Parameter of the Stavskaya's Process via a Generalized Recurrent Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stavskaya's process, a discrete-time version of the contact process on $\Z$, is known to exhibit a phase transition at a critical parameter $\alpc$ whose exact value remains an open problem. Recent work by Ramos et al. established a lower bound by linking the process's survival to the non-percolation of a dual contour. The probability of this contour was estimated using a recurrent method on a state space of weighted random walks with short-term memory. In this paper, we generalize and extend this method by systematically increasing the walk's memory and enriching the set of forbidden path sequences. By increasing the memory up to a length of 20 steps (corresponding to our parameter $n=7$), we formulate the problem with a one-step transition matrix and numerically optimize its spectral radius. We thus establish the new lower bound $\alpc &gt; 0.1370721$.</description>

      <title>Exponential Ergodicity in Relative Entropy and $L^2$-Wasserstein Distance for non-equilibrium partially dissipative Kinetic SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive exponential ergodicity in relative entropy for general kinetic SDEs under a partially dissipative condition. It covers non-equilibrium situations where the forces are not of gradient type and the invariant measure does not have an explicit density, extending previous results set in the equilibrium case. The key argument is to establish the hypercontractivity of the associated semigroup, which follows from its hyperboundedness and its $L^2$-exponential ergodicity. Moreover, we obtain exponential ergodicity in the $L^2$-Wasserstein distance by combining Talagrand's inequality with a log-Harnack inequality. These results are further extended to the McKean-Vlasov setting and to the associated mean-field interacting particle systems, with convergence rates that are uniform in the number of particles in the latter case, under small nonlinear perturbations.</description>

      <title>The Triangle Friendship Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the generalised friendship paradox, focussing on the number of triangles at a vertex as the relevant attribute. We show that, contrary to the setting where the attribute is the number of edges at a vertex or the number of wedges at a vertex, the average friendship-bias of the number of triangles at a vertex is not always non-negative. We identify classes of finite deterministic graphs for which the bias is non-negative, and provide examples of finite deterministic graphs for which it is not. For certain classes of sparse and dense random graphs, we compute the scaling of the bias in the limit as the number of vertices tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Restricted Quasiconvexity Isometry Property for Symmetric $\alpha$-Stable Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a generalization of the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) referred to as the Restricted Quasiconvexity Isometry Property (RQIP) for alpha stable random projections with $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$. A lower bound on the number of rows for RQIP to hold for random matrices whose entries are drawn from a symmetric $\alpha$-stable ($S\alpha S$) distribution is derived. The proof leverages two key components: a concentration inequality for empirical fractional moments of $S\alpha S$ variables and a covering number bound for sparse $\ell_\alpha$ balls. The resulting sample complexity reflects the polynomial tail behavior of the concentration and reinforces an observation made in the literature that the RIP framework may have to be replaced with other sparse recovery formulations in practice, such as those based on the null space property.</description>

      <title>On Loops in critical high-dimensional percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the following type of results about critical Bernoulli percolation in high dimensions: The collection of clusters that do contain large (self-avoiding) loops in a large box is tight. The collection of these large loops has scaling limits that one will be able to relate to Brownian loop-soups (each of these atypical loop-containing clusters does in some sense only contain one large self-avoiding loop in the sense that any two such loops will be very close). This feature contrasts with the known proliferation of "typical" percolation clusters (i.e., among the many large clusters in a given box, only a handful will contain a loop of size comparable to the box).</description>

      <title>Splitting algorithm and normed convergence for drawing the random Loewner curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Schramm-Loewner evolution have driven increasing interest in non-standard Loewner flows. In this work, we propose a novel splitting algorithm to simulate random Loewner curves with rigorous convergence analysis in sup-norm and $L^p$. The algorithm is further extended to explore fractional SLE, driven by fractional Brownian motion, and noise-reinforced SLE, incorporating the effect on long-term memory. These exploratory and numerical extensions enable theoretical predictions on fractal dimensions and other statistical phenomena, providing new insights into such dynamics and opening directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Random Flights and Anomalous Diffusion: A Non-Markovian Take on Lorentz Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Lorentz processes in two different settings. Both cases are characterized by infinite expectation of the free-flight times, contrary to what happens in the classical Gallavotti-Spohn models. Under a suitable Boltzmann-Grad type scaling limit, they converge to non-Markovian random-flight processes with superdiffusive behavior. A further scaling limit yields another non Markovian process, i.e., a superdiffusion obtained by a suitable time-change of Brownian motion. Furthermore, we obtain the governing equations for our random flights and anomalous diffusion, which represent a non-local counterpart for the linear-Boltzmann and diffusion equations arising in the classical theory. It turns out that these equations have the form of fractional kinetic equations in both time and space. To prove these results, we develop a technique based on mixtures of Feller semigroups.</description>

      <title>Comparing Bitcoin and Ethereum tail behavior via Q-Q analysis of cryptocurrency returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cryptocurrency market presents both significant investment opportunities and higher risks relative to traditional financial assets. This study examines the tail behavior of daily returns for two leading cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, using seven-parameter estimates from prior research, which applied the Generalized Tempered Stable (GTS) distribution. Quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots against the Normal distribution reveal that both assets exhibit heavy-tailed return distributions. However, Ethereum consistently shows a greater frequency of extreme values than would be expected under its Bitcoin-modeled counterpart, indicating more pronounced tail risk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new microeconomic model of horizontal differentiation that unifies and extends previous developments inspired by the seminal work of Hotelling (1929). Our framework incorporates boundedly rational consumers, an unlimited number of firms, and arbitrary differentiation spaces with Riemannian manifolds. We argue that Riemannian geometry provides a natural and powerful tool for analyzing such models, offering fresh insights into firm behavior and market structure with complex products.</description>

      <title>Currents Beneath Stability: A Stochastic Framework for Exchange Rate Instability Using Kramers Moyal Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the stochastic behavior of currency exchange rates is critical for assessing financial stability and anticipating market transitions. In this study, we investigate the empirical dynamics of the USD exchange rate in three economies, including Iran, Turkey, and Sri Lanka, through the lens of the Kramers-Moyal expansion and Fokker-Planck formalism. Using log-return data, we confirm the Markovian nature of the exchange rate fluctuations, enabling us to model the system with a second-order Fokker-Planck equation. The inferred Langevin coefficients reveal a stabilizing linear drift and a nonlinear, return-dependent diffusion term, reflecting both regulatory effects and underlying volatility. A rolling-window estimation of these coefficients, paired with structural breakpoint detection, uncovers regime shifts that align with major political and economic events, offering insight into the hidden dynamics of currency instability. This framework provides a robust foundation for detecting latent transitions and modeling risk in complex financial systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider islamic Profit and Loss (PL) sharing contract, possibly combined with an agency contract, and introduce the notion of {\em $c$-fair} profit sharing ratios ($c = (c_1, \ldots,c_d) \in (\mathbb R^{\star})^d$, where $d$ is the number of partners) which aims to determining both the profit sharing ratios and the induced expected maturity payoffs of each partner $\ell$ according to its contribution, determined by the rate component $c_{\ell}$ of the vector $c$, to the global success of the project. We show several new results that elucidate the relation between these profit sharing ratios and various important economic factors as the investment risk, the labor and the capital, giving accordingly a way of choosing them in connection with the real economy. The design of our approach allows the use of all the range of econometrics models or more general stochastic diffusion models to compute or approximate the quantities of interest.</description>

      <title>Two-Sample Covariance Inference in High-Dimensional Elliptical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a two-sample test for large-dimensional covariance matrices in generalized elliptical models. The test statistic is based on a U-statistic estimator of the squared Frobenius norm of the difference between the two population covariance matrices. This statistic was originally introduced by Li and Chen (2012, AoS) for the independent component model. As a key theoretical contribution, we establish a new central limit theorem for the U-statistics under elliptical data, valid under both the null and alternative hypotheses. This result enables asymptotic control of the test level and facilitates a power analysis. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed test is the first such method to be supported by theoretical guarantees for elliptical data. Our approach imposes only mild assumptions on the covariance matrices and does neither require sparsity nor explicit growth conditions on the dimension-to-sample-size ratio. We illustrate our theoretical findings through applications to both synthetic and real-world data.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider the variational setting for SPDE on a Gelfand triple $(V, H, V^*)$. Under the standard conditions on a linear coercive pair $(A,B)$, and a symmetry condition on $A$ we manage to extrapolate the classical $L^2$-estimates in time to $L^p$-estimates for some $p&gt;2$ without any further conditions on $(A,B)$. As a consequence we obtain several other a priori regularity results of the paths of the solution.
  Under the assumption that $V$ embeds compactly into $H$, we derive a universal compactness result quantifying over all $(A,B)$. As an application of the compactness result we prove global existence of weak solutions to a system of second order quasi-linear equations.</description>

      <title>Sina\u{i} excursions: An analogue of Sparre Andersen's formula for the area process of a random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12941v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sina\u{i} initiated the study of random walks with persistently positive area processes, motivated by shock waves in solutions to the inviscid Burgers' equation. We find the precise asymptotic probability that the area process of a random walk bridge is an excursion. A key ingredient is an analogue of Sparre Andersen's classical formula. The asymptotics are related to von Sterneck's subset counting formulas from additive number theory. Our results sharpen bounds by Aurzada, Dereich and Lifshits and respond to a question of Caravenna and Deuschel, which arose in their study of the wetting model. In this context, Sina\u{\i} excursions are a class of random polymer chains exhibiting entropic repulsion.</description>

      <title>Hardness of sampling solutions from the Symmetric Binary Perceptron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that two related classes of algorithms, stable algorithms and Boolean circuits with bounded depth, cannot produce an approximate sample from the uniform measure over the set of solutions to the symmetric binary perceptron model at any constraint-to-variable density. This result is in contrast to the question of finding \emph{a} solution to the same problem, where efficient (and stable) algorithms are known to succeed at sufficiently low density. This result suggests that the solutions found efficiently -- whenever this task is possible -- must be highly atypical, and therefore provides an example of a problem where search is efficiently possible but approximate sampling from the set of solutions is not, at least within these two classes of algorithms.</description>

      <title>A switching identity for cable-graph loop soups and Gaussian free fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06754v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a "switching identity" that can be stated for critical Brownian loop-soups or for the Gaussian free field on a cable graph: It basically says that at the level of cluster configurations and at the more general level of the occupation time fields, conditioning two points on the cable-graph to belong to the same cluster of Brownian loops (or equivalently to the same sign-cluster of the GFF) amounts to adding a random odd number of independent Brownian excursions between these points to an otherwise unconditioned configuration. This explicit simple description of the conditional law of the clusters when a connection occurs has various direct consequences, in particular about the large scale behaviour of these sign-clusters on infinite graphs.</description>

      <title>Nash equilibria for dividend distribution with competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07703v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct Nash equilibria in feedback form for a class of two-person stochastic games of singular control with absorption, arising from a stylized model for corporate finance. More precisely, the paper focusses on a strategic dynamic game in which two financially-constrained firms operate in the same market. The firms distribute dividends and are faced with default risk. The strategic interaction arises from the fact that if one firm defaults, the other one becomes a monopolist and increases its profitability. The firms choose their dividend distribution policies from a class of randomised strategies and we identify two types of equilibria, depending on the firms' initial endowments. In both situations the optimal strategies and the equilibrium payoffs are found explicitly.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic consequence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates logical consequence defined in terms of probability distributions, for a classical propositional language using a standard notion of probability. We examine three distinct probabilistic consequence notions, which we call material consequence, preservation consequence, and symmetric consequence. While material consequence is fully classical for any threshold, preservation consequence and symmetric consequence are subclassical, with only symmetric consequence gradually approaching classical logic at the limit threshold equal to 1. Our results extend earlier results obtained by J. Paris in a SET-FMLA setting to the SET-SET setting, and consider open thresholds beside closed ones. In the SET-SET setting, in particular, they reveal that probability 1 preservation does not yield classical logic, but supervaluationism, and conversely positive probability preservation yields subvaluationism.</description>

      <title>An approximation theory for Markov chain compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for the compression of reversible Markov chains with rigorous error control. Given a subset of selected states, we construct reduced dynamics that can be lifted to an approximation of the full dynamics, and we prove simple spectral and nuclear norm bounds on the recovery error in terms of a suitably interpreted Nystr\"{o}m approximation error. We introduce two compression schemes: a projective compression based on committor functions and a structure-preserving compression defined in terms of an induced Markov chain over the selected states. The Nystr\"{o}m error appearing in our bounds can be controlled using recent results on column subset selection by nuclear maximization. Numerical experiments validate our theory and demonstrate the scalability of our approach.</description>
