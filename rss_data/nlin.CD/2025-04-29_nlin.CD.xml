      <title>Boundary crisis and long transients of the Atlantic overturning circulation mediated by an edge state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a large-scale ocean current and vital climate component, could transition to a substantially weakened flow state. Despite severe associated impacts, it remains difficult to reliably estimate the proximity to potential critical thresholds and predict the AMOC's fate under global warming. To advance our understanding of Earth system stability, a global view on the dynamics is needed beyond the local stability analysis underlying, e.g., standard early warning signs. Here we explore the phase space of an intermediate-complexity climate model featuring a metastable AMOC. For two atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) levels, we explicitly compute the edge state (also called Melancholia state), a chaotic saddle embedded in the basin boundary that separates the strong and weak AMOC attractors found in the model. While being unstable, the edge state can govern the transient climate for centuries. Its dynamics exhibits strong centennial AMOC oscillations driven by atmosphere-ice-ocean interactions in the North Atlantic. We demonstrate that at CO$_2$ levels projected to be reached in the next decades, the simulated AMOC undergoes a boundary crisis where the current AMOC attractor collides with the edge state. Near but beyond the crisis, long chaotic transients occur due to a resulting ghost state, causing a splitting of ensemble trajectories under time-dependent forcing. Rooted in dynamical systems theory, our results offer an interpretation of large ensemble variances and a so-called stochastic bifurcation observed in earth system models under intermediate forcing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Robust Wave Splitters Based on Scattering Singularities in Complex non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent perfect absorption (CPA) is well-known as a phenomenon where all the energy of a specific injected wavefront is completely absorbed by losses in a system, independent of details. This has applications in wavefront shaping, communication, filtering, wireless power transfer, etc. We have discovered an application of coherent perfect absorption enabling conditions as a tunable splitter that is robust to any change in relative amplitude or phase of an arbitrary injected waveform. We show experimentally that the fixed splitting ratios and output phases at CPA enabling conditions are robust to 100 dB of relative power and 2$\pi$ phase changes of the input waves to a complex non-Hermitian two-port system. We also demonstrate that the splitting power ratio can be tuned by multiple orders of magnitude and the CPA enabling conditions can be tuned to any desired frequency with suitable tunable perturbations embedded in the system. Although this phenomenon is realized in two-port systems, tunable robust splitting can be achieved between any two ports of multiport systems. These results are general to all wave scattering phenomena and hold in generic complex scattering systems.</description>

      <title>DIRESA, a distance-preserving nonlinear dimension reduction technique based on regularized autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In meteorology, finding similar weather patterns or analogs in historical datasets can be useful for data assimilation, forecasting, and postprocessing. In climate science, analogs in historical and climate projection data are used for attribution and impact studies. However, most of the time, those large weather and climate datasets are nearline. This means that they must be downloaded, which takes a lot of bandwidth and disk space, before the computationally expensive search can be executed. We propose a dimension reduction technique based on autoencoder (AE) neural networks to compress the datasets and perform the search in an interpretable, compressed latent space. A distance-regularized Siamese twin autoencoder (DIRESA) architecture is designed to preserve distance in latent space while capturing the nonlinearities in the datasets. Using conceptual climate models of different complexities, we show that the latent components thus obtained provide physical insight into the dominant modes of variability in the system. Compressing datasets with DIRESA reduces the online storage and keeps the latent components uncorrelated, while the distance (ordering) preservation and reconstruction fidelity robustly outperform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and other dimension reduction techniques such as UMAP or variational autoencoders.</description>
