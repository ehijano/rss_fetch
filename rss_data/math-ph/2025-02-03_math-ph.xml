      <title>Quantitative Derivation of the Two-Component Gross-Pitaevskii Equation with Uniform-in-Time Convergence Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the time-dependent two-component Gross-Pitaevskii equation as an effective description of the dynamics of a dilute two-component Bose gas near its ground state, which exhibits a two-component mixture Bose-Einstein condensate, in the Gross-Pitaevskii limit regime. Our main result establishes a uniform-in-time bound on the convergence rate between the many-body dynamics and the effective description, explicitly quantified in terms of the particle number $N$. This improves upon the works of Michelangeli and Olgliati [73, 85] by providing a sharper, $N$-dependent, time-independent convergence rate. Our approach also extends the framework of Benedikter, de Oliveira, and Schlein [10] to the multi-component Bose gas setting. More specifically, we develop the necessary Bogoliubov theory to analyze the dynamics of multi-component Bose gases in the Gross-Pitaevskii regime.</description>

      <title>Modular covariant torus partition functions of dense $A_1^{(1)}$ and dilute $A_2^{(2)}$ loop models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Yang-Baxter integrable dense $A_1^{(1)}$ and dilute $A_2^{(2)}$ loop models are considered on the torus in their simplest physical regimes. A combination of boundary conditions $(h,v)$ is applied in the horizontal and vertical directions with $h,v=0$ and $1$ for periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions respectively. The fugacities of non-contractible and contractible loops are denoted by $\alpha$ and $\beta$ respectively where $\beta$ is simply related to the crossing parameter $\lambda$. At roots of unity, when $\lambda/\pi\in\mathbb Q$, these models are the dense ${\cal LM}(p,p')$ and dilute ${\cal DLM}(p,p')$ logarithmic minimal models with $p,p'$ coprime integers. We conjecture the scaling limits of the transfer matrix traces in the standard modules with $d$ defects and deduce the conformal partition functions ${\cal Z}_{\textrm{dense}}^{(h,v)}(\alpha)$ and ${\cal Z}_{\textrm{dilute}}^{(h,v)}(\alpha)$ using Markov traces. These are expressed in terms of functions ${\cal Z}_{m,m'}(g)$ known from the Coulomb gas arguments of Di Francesco, Saleur and Zuber and subsequently as sesquilinear forms in Verma characters. Crucially, we find that the partition functions are identical for the dense and dilute models. The coincidence of these conformal partition functions provides compelling evidence that, for given $(p,p')$, these dense and dilute theories lie in the same universality class. In root of unity cases with $\alpha=2$, the $(h,v)$ modular covariant partition functions are also expressed as sesquilinear forms in affine $u(1)$ characters involving generalized Bezout conjugates. These also give the modular covariant partition functions for the 6-vertex and Izergin-Korepin 19-vertex models in the corresponding regimes.</description>

      <title>On the Ising Phase Transition in the Infrared-Divergent Spin Boson Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove absence of ground states in the infrared-divergent spin boson model at large coupling. Our key argument reduces the proof to verifying long range order in the dual one-dimensional continuum Ising model, i.e., to showing that the respective two point function is lower bounded by a strictly positive constant. We can then use known results from percolation theory to establish long range order at large coupling. Combined with the known existence of ground states at small coupling, our result proves that the spin boson model undergoes a phase transition with respect to the coupling strength. We also present an expansion for the vacuum overlap of the spin boson ground state in terms of the Ising $n$-point functions, which implies that the phase transition is unique, i.e., that there is a critical coupling constant below which a ground state exists and above which none can exist.</description>

      <title>The Gibbs state of the mean-field Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the homogeneous mean-field Bose gas at temperatures proportional to the critical temperature of its Bose--Einstein condensation phase transition. Our main result is a trace-norm approximation of the grand canonical Gibbs state in terms of a reference state, which is given by a convex combination of products of coherent states and Gibbs states associated with certain temperature-dependent Bogoliubov Hamiltonians. The convex combination is expressed as an integral over a Gibbs distribution of a one-mode $\Phi^4$-theory describing the condensate. We interpret this result as a justification of Bogoliubov theory at positive temperature. Further results derived from the norm approximation include various limiting distributions for the number of particles in the condensate, as well as precise formulas for the one- and two-particle density matrices of the Gibbs state. Key ingredients of our proof, which are of independent interest, include two novel abstract correlation inequalities. The proof of one of them is based on an application of an infinite-dimensional version of Stahl's theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the homogeneous mean-field Bose gas at positive temperature. We show that spontaneous $U(1)$ symmetry breaking occurs if and only if the system displays Bose-Einstein condensation in the sense that the one-particle density matrix of the Gibbs state has a macroscopic eigenvalue.</description>

      <title>Periodicity and absolute zeta functions of multi-state Grover walks on cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum walks, the quantum counterpart of classical random walks, are extensively studied for their applications in mathematics, quantum physics, and quantum information science. This study explores the periods and absolute zeta functions of Grover walks on cycle graphs. Specifically, we investigate Grover walks with an odd number of states and determine their periods for cycles with any number of vertices greater than or equal to two. In addition, we compute the absolute zeta functions of M-type Grover walks with finite periods. These results advance the understanding of the properties of Grover walks and their connection to absolute zeta functions.</description>

      <title>Complex network approaches to nonlinear time series analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last decade, there has been a growing body of literature addressing the utilization of complex network methods for the characterization of dynamical systems based on time series. While both nonlinear time series analysis and complex network theory are widely considered to be established fields of complex systems sciences with strong links to nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics, the thorough combination of both approaches has become an active field of nonlinear time series analysis, which has allowed addressing fundamental questions regarding the structural organization of nonlinear dynamics as well as the successful treatment of a variety of applications from a broad range of disciplines. In this report, we provide an in-depth review of existing approaches of time series networks, covering their methodological foundations, interpretation and practical considerations with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the state-of-the-art of nonlinear time series analysis and the theory of complex networks, we focus on three main network approaches, namely, phase space based recurrence networks, visibility graphs and Markov chain based transition networks, all of which have made their way from abstract concepts to widely used methodologies. These three concepts, as well as several variants thereof will be discussed in great detail regarding their specific properties, potentials and limitations. More importantly, we emphasize which fundamental new insights complex network approaches bring into the field of nonlinear time series analysis. In addition, we summarize examples from the wide range of recent applications of these methods, covering rather diverse fields like climatology, fluid dynamics, neurophysiology, engineering and economics, and demonstrating the great potentials of time series networks for tackling real-world contemporary scientific problems.</description>

      <title>A deterministic particle method for the porous media equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the deterministic particle method for the equation of porous media (with p = 2). We establish a convergence rate in the Wasserstein-2 distance between the approximate solution of the associated nonlinear transport equation and the solution of the original one. This seems to be the first quantitative rate for diffusion-velocity particle methods solving diffusive equations and is achieved using a novel commutator estimate for the Wasserstein transport map.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy and Cauchy-Hadamard Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note presents a purely geometric construction of the so-called twist-field correlation functions in Conformal Field Theory (CFT), derived from conical singularities. This approach provides a purely mathematical interpretation of the seminal results in physics by Cardy and Calabrese on the entanglement entropy of quantum systems. Specifically, we begin by defining CFT partition functions on surfaces with conical singularities, using a ``Cauchy-Hadamard renormalization'' of the Polyakov anomaly integral. Next, we demonstrate that for a branched cover $f:\Sigma_d\to \Sigma$ with $d$ sheets, where the cover inherits the pullback of a smooth metric from the base, a specific ratio of partition functions on the cover to the base transforms under conformal changes of the base metric in the same way as a correlation function of CFT primary fields with specific conformal weights. We also provide a discussion of the physical background and motivation for entanglement entropy, focusing on path integrals and the replica trick, which serves as an introduction to these ideas for a mathematical audience.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the steady state classification problem of the Allee effect system for multiple tribes. First, we reduce the high-dimensional model into several two-dimensional and three-dimensional algebraic systems such that we can prove a comprehensive formula of the border polynomial for arbitrary dimension. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm for classifying the generic parameters according to the number of steady states, and we successfully complete the computation for up to the seven-dimensional Allee effect system.</description>

      <title>New perspectives on the d'Alembertian from general relativity. An invitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This survey has multiple objectives. First, we motivate and review a new distributional notion of the d'Alembertian from mathematical relativity, more precisely, a nonlinear $p$-version thereof, where $p$ is a nonzero number less than one. This operator comes from natural Lagrangian actions introduced relatively recently. Unlike its classical linear yet hyperbolic counterpart, it is nonlinear yet has elliptic characteristics. Second, we describe recent comparison estimates for the $p$-d'Alembertian of Lorentz distance functions (notably a point or a spacelike hypersurface). Their new contribution implied by prior works on optimal transport through spacetime is a control of the timelike cut locus. Third, we illustrate exact representation formulas for these $p$-d'Alembertians employing methods from convex geometry. Fourth, several applications and open problems are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that a semiclassical Rabi model with parity-time (PT) symmetry has a hidden $sl(2)$ symmetry and hence possesses quasi-exact solutions. These are located precisely at the exceptional points of the spectrum, the boundaries of the PT-symmetric phase. The corresponding constraints on the model parameters can be interpreted as a resonance relationship between the constant and periodic driving terms.</description>

Abstract: In the present work, we study the geometric structures of the Rotating Shallow Water Magnetohydrodynamics (RSW-MHD) equations through a Lie group invariant Euler-Poincar\'e variational principle. In this geometric framework, we derive new, structure-preserving stochastic RSW-MHD models by introducing stochastic perturbations to the Lie-Poisson structure of the deterministic RSW-MHD equations. The resulting stochastic RSW-MHD equations provide new capabilities for potential application to uncertainty quantification and data assimilation, for example, in space plasma (space weather) and solar physics, particularly in solar tachocline dynamics.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and Stabilizer entropies of random bipartite pure quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between non-stabilizerness and entanglement in random states is a very rich arena of study for the understanding of quantum advantage and complexity. In this work, we tackle the problem of such interplay in random pure quantum states. We show that while there is a strong dependence between entanglement and magic, they are, surprisingly, perfectly uncorrelated. We compute the expectation value of non-stabilizerness given the Schmidt spectrum (and thus entanglement). At a first approximation, entanglement determines the average magic on the Schmidt orbit. However, there is a finer structure in the average magic distinguishing different orbits where the flatness of entanglement spectrum is involved.</description>

      <title>Top eigenvalue statistics of diluted Wishart matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the replica method, we compute analytically the average largest eigenvalue of diluted covariance matrices of the form $\mathbf{J} = \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X}$, where $\mathbf{X}$ is a $N\times M$ sparse data matrix, in the limit of large $N,M$ with fixed ratio. We allow for random non-zero weights, provided they lead to an isolated largest eigenvalue. By formulating the problem as the optimisation of a quadratic Hamiltonian constrained to the $N$-sphere at low temperatures, we derive a set of recursive distributional equations for auxiliary probability density functions, which can be efficiently solved using a population dynamics algorithm. The average largest eigenvalue is identified with a Lagrange parameter that governs the convergence of the algorithm. We find excellent agreement between our analytical results and numerical results obtained from direct diagonalisation.</description>

Abstract: We discuss two distinct operator-theoretic settings useful for describing (or defining) propagators associated with a scalar Klein-Gordon field on a Lorentzian manifold $M$. Typically, we assume that $M$ is globally hyperbolic. Here, the term propagator refers to any Green function or bisolution of the Klein-Gordon equation pertinent to Quantum Field Theory. The "off-shell" setting is based on the Hilbert space $L^2(M)$. It leads to the definition of the operator-theoretic Feynman and anti-Feynman propagators, which often coincide with the so-called out-in Feynman and in-out anti-Feynman propagator. On some special spacetimes, the sum of the operator-theoretic Feynman and anti-Feynman propagator equals the sum of the forward and backward propagator. This is always true on static stable spacetimes and, curiously, in some other cases as well. The "on-shell" setting is based on the Krein space $\mathcal{W}_{\rm KG}$ of solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation. It allows us to define 2-point functions associated to two, possibly distinct Fock states as the Klein-Gordon kernels of projectors onto maximal uniformly positive subspaces of $\mathcal{W}_{\rm KG}$.
  After a general discussion, we review a number of examples. We start with static and asymptotically static spacetimes, which are especially well-suited for Quantum Field Theory. Then we discuss FLRW spacetimes, reducible by a mode decomposition to 1-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators. We compare various approaches to de Sitter space where, curiously, the off-shell approach gives non-physical propagators. Finally, we discuss anti-de Sitter spaces, both proper and their universal cover, where the on-shell approach may require boundary conditions, unlike the off-shell approach.</description>

Abstract: The `lake equation' on a planar domain D with bathymetry b(x,y) is given by $ \partial_t u + (u \cdot {\rm grad}) u= -{\rm grad}\, p \,, \,\,{\rm div} (b u) = 0 \,,\, \text{with}\,\, u \parallel \partial D.$ % \, \,\, \,\,\, \text{),}$$ We focus on Geometric Mechanics aspects, glossing over hard analysis issues. % related to the desingularization. Motivating example is a `rip current' produced by vortex pairs near a beach shore. For uniform slope beach there is a perfect analogy with \ Thomson's vortex rings. The stream function produced by a vortex is defined as the Green function of the operator $- {\rm div} ( {\rm grad} \psi/b)$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions. As in elasticity, the lake equations give rise to pseudoanalytical functions and quasiconformal mappings. Uniformly elliptic equations on closed Riemann surfaces could be called `planet equations'.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Liouville models of multiphase flows with randomly forced inertial particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eulerian-Lagrangian models of particle-laden (multiphase) flows describe fluid flow and particle dynamics in the Eulerian and Lagrangian frameworks respectively. Regardless of whether the flow is turbulent or laminar, the particle dynamics is stochastic because the suspended particles are subjected to random forces. We use a polynomial chaos expansion (PCE), rather than a postulated constitutive law, to capture structural and parametric uncertainties in the particles' forcing. The stochastic particle dynamics is described by a joint probability density function (PDF) of a particle's position and velocity and random coefficients in the PCE. We deploy the method of distributions (MoD) to derive a deterministic (Liouville-type) partial-differential equation for this PDF. We reformulate this PDF equation in a Lagrangian form, obtaining PDF flow maps and tracing events and their probability in the phase space. That is accomplished via a new high-order spectral scheme, which traces, marginalizes and computes moments of the high-dimensional joint PDF and comports with high-order carrier-phase solvers. Our approach has lower computational cost than either high-order Eulerian solvers or Monte Carlo methods, is not subjected to a CFL condition, does not suffer from Gibbs oscillations and does not require (order-reducing) filtering and regularization techniques. These features are demonstrated on several test cases.</description>

      <title>On the optimal relaxation rate for the Metropolis algorithm in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the relaxation of the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm corresponding to a single particle trapped in a one-dimensional confining potential, with even jump distributions that ensure that the dynamics verifies detailed balance. Previous work suggested that, for smooth jump distributions, the fastest relaxation rate is obtained as a result of the competition between diffusive and rejection-dominated dynamics. In this work, we show that a new regime comes into play for two-peaked jump distributions, where the relaxation dynamics is neither dominated by diffusion nor rejection: the eigenmodes adopt an oscillatory form, reminiscent of charge density waves (CDW) -- thus we term this new regime the CDW regime. Using a combination of numerical and analytical techniques, the parameter regions corresponding to diffusion, rejection, and CDW are characterised, as well as the transition lines between them -- i.e. a phase diagram is built. The optimal relaxation rate is located at the triple point of phase coexistence, where the transition lines (diffusive-rejection, diffusive-CDW, and CDW-rejection) intersect. Our theoretical framework is checked versus the numerical diagonalisation of the master equation. We also briefly discuss more sophisticated attempts at optimising the relaxation rate to equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Differential geometry and general relativity with algebraifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is often noted that many of the basic concepts of differential geometry, such as the definition of connection, are purely algebraic in nature. Here, we review and extend existing work on fully algebraic formulations of differential geometry which eliminate the need for an underlying manifold. While the literature contains various independent approaches to this, we focus on one particular approach that we argue to be the most natural one based on the definition of "algebraifold", by which we mean a commutative algebra $\mathcal{A}$ for which the module of derivations of $\mathcal{A}$ is finitely generated projective. Over $\mathbb{R}$ as the base ring, this class of algebras includes the algebra $C^\infty(M)$ of smooth functions on a manifold $M$, and similarly for analytic functions. An importantly different example is the Colombeau algebra of generalized functions on $M$, which makes distributional differential geometry an instance of our formalism. Another instance is a fibred version of smooth differential geometry, since any smooth submersion $M \to N$ makes $C^\infty(M)$ into an algebraifold with $C^\infty(N)$ as the base ring. Over any field $k$ of characteristic zero, examples include the algebra of regular functions on a smooth affine variety as well as any function field.
  Our development of differential geometry in terms of algebraifolds comprises tensors, connections, curvature, geodesics and we briefly consider general relativity.</description>

      <title>Hidden zero modes and topology of multiband non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a finite one-dimensional non-Hermitian system, the number of zero modes does not necessarily reflect the topology of the system. This is known as the breakdown of the bulk-boundary correspondence and has led to misconceptions about the topological protection of edge modes in such systems. Here we show why this breakdown does occur and that it typically results in hidden zero modes, extremely long-lived zero energy excitations, which are only revealed when considering the singular value instead of the eigenvalue spectrum. We point out, furthermore, that in a finite multiband non-Hermitian system with Hamiltonian $H$, one needs to consider also the reflected Hamiltonian $\tilde H$, which is in general distinct from the adjoint $H^\dagger$, to properly relate the number of protected zeroes to the winding number of $H$.</description>

Abstract: Quantum spheres are among the most studied examples of compact quantum spaces, described by C*-algebras which are Cuntz-Krieger algebras of a directed graph, as proved by Hong and Szyma\'nski in 2002. About five years earlier, in 1997, Sheu proved that the C*-algebra of a quantum sphere is a groupoid C*-algebra. Here we show that the path groupoid of the directed graph of Hong and Szyma\'nski is isomorphic to the groupoid discovered by Sheu.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By the introduction of locally constant prefactorization algebras at a fixed scale, we show a mathematical incarnation of the fact that observables at a given scale of a topological field theory propagate to every scale over euclidean spaces. The key is that these prefactorization algebras over $\mathbb{R}^n$ are equivalent to algebras over the little $n$-disc operad. For topological field theories with defects, we get analogous results by replacing $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the spaces modelling corners $\mathbb{R}^p\times\mathbb{R}^{q}_{\geq 0}$. As a toy example in $1d$, we quantize, once more, constant Poisson structures.</description>

      <title>Gravitational reheating formulas and bounds in oscillating backgrounds II: Constraints on the spectral index and gravitational dark matter production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06190v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reheating temperature plays a crucial role in the early universe's evolution, marking the transition from inflation to the radiation-dominated era. It directly impacts the number of $e$-folds and, consequently, the observable parameters of inflation, such as the spectral index of scalar perturbations. By establishing a relationship between the gravitational reheating temperature and the spectral index, we can derive constraints on inflationary models. Specifically, the range of viable reheating temperatures imposes bounds on the spectral index, which can then be compared with observational data, such as those from the Planck satellite, to test the consistency of various models with cosmological observations. Additionally, in the context of dark matter production, we demonstrate that gravitational reheating provides a viable mechanism when there is a relationship between the mass of the dark matter particles and the mass of the particles responsible for reheating. This connection offers a pathway to link dark matter genesis with inflationary and reheating parameters, allowing for a unified perspective on early universe dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We study stationary solutions of McKean-Vlasov equation on a high-dimensional sphere and other compact Riemannian manifolds. We extend the equivalence of the energetic problem formulation to the manifold setting and characterize critical points of the corresponding free energy functional. On a sphere, we employ the properties of spherical convolution to study the bifurcation branches around the uniform state. We also give a sufficient condition for an existence of a discontinuous transition point in terms of the interaction kernel and compare it to the Euclidean setting. We illustrate our results on a range of system, including the particle system arising from the transformer models and the Onsager model of liquid crystals.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional permutons: theory and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19730v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Permutons, which are probability measures on the unit square $[0, 1]^2$ with uniform marginals, are the natural scaling limits for sequences of (random) permutations.
  We introduce a $d$-dimensional generalization of these measures for all $d \ge 2$, which we call $d$-dimensional permutons, and extend -- from the two-dimensional setting -- the theory to prove convergence of sequences of (random) $d$-dimensional permutations to (random) $d$-dimensional permutons.
  Building on this new theory, we determine the random high-dimensional permuton limits for two natural families of high-dimensional permutations. First, we determine the $3$-dimensional permuton limit for Schnyder wood permutations, which bijectively encode planar triangulations decorated by triples of spanning trees known as Schnyder woods. Second, we identify the $d$-dimensional permuton limit for $d$-separable permutations, a pattern-avoiding class of $d$-dimensional permutations generalizing ordinary separable permutations.
  Both high-dimensional permuton limits are random and connected to previously studied universal 2-dimensional permutons, such as the Brownian separable permutons and the skew Brownian permutons, and share interesting connections with objects arising from random geometry, including the continuum random tree, Schramm--Loewner evolutions, and Liouville quantum gravity surfaces.</description>

      <title>Physics on manifolds with exotic differential structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A given topological manifold can sometimes be endowed with inequivalent differential structures. Physically this means that what is meant by a differentiable function (smooth) is simply different for observers using inequivalent differential structures. Specifically, that means that one observer will say that this is a smooth function while the other observer will say it is not smooth. On the other hand, the notion of a continuous function is the same for both, defined by the common topology. In this paper, we examine the import of inequivalent differential structures on the physics of fields obeying the Dirac equation on the 7-sphere. The 7-sphere was the first, celebrated example, found by Milnor, of a topological manifold that can be endowed with a finite number, 28, of inequivalent differential structures. We find that the spectra of these operators are dependent on the choice of differential structure and hence the identical topological manifolds have different physical laws.</description>

Abstract: This survey provides a concise yet comprehensive overview on enhanced dissipation phenomena, transitioning seamlessly from the physical principles underlying the interplay between advection and diffusion to their rigorous mathematical formulation and analysis.

Abstract: We show that quadratic Hamiltonians in involution coming from a St\"ackel system are quantizable, in the sense that one can construct commutative self-adjoint operators whose symbols are the quadratic Hamiltonians. Moreover, they allow multiplicative separation of variables. This proves a conjecture explicitly formulated in [3].</description>
