      <title>A Toffoli Gadget for Magnetic Tunnel Junctions Boltzmann Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) are of great interest for non-conventional computing applications. The Toffoli gate is a universal reversible logic gate, enabling the construction of arbitrary boolean circuits. Here, we present a proof-of-concept construction of a gadget which encodes the Toffoli gate's truth table into the ground state of coupled uniaxial nanomagnets that could form the free layers of perpendicularly magnetized MTJs. This construction has three input bits, three output bits, and one ancilla bit. We numerically simulate the seven macrospins evolving under the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (s-LLG) equation. We investigate the effect of the anisotropy-to-exchange-coupling strength ratio $H_A/H_\text{ex}$ on the working of the gadget. We find that for $H_A/H_\text{ex} \lesssim 0.93$, the spins evolve to the Toffoli gate truth table configurations under LLG dynamics alone, while higher $H_A/H_\text{ex}$ ratios require thermal annealing due to suboptimal metastable states. Under our chosen annealing procedure, the s-LLG simulation with thermal annealing achieves a 100% success rate up to $H_A/H_\text{ex}\simeq3.0$. The feasibility of constructing MTJ-free-layer-based Toffoli gates highlights their potential in designing new types of MTJ-based circuits.</description>

      <title>From Flip FET to Flip 3D Integration (F3D): Maximizing the Scaling Potential of Wafer Both Sides Beyond Conventional 3D Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we proposed a new 3D integration technology: the Flip 3D integration (F3D), consisting of the 3D transistor stacking, the 3D dual-sided interconnects, the 3D die-to-die stacking and the dual-sided Monolithic 3D (M3D). Based on a 32-bit FFET RISCV core, besides the scaling benefits of the Flip FET (FFET), the dual-sided signal routing shows even more routing flexibility with 6.8% area reduction and 5.9% EDP improvement. Novel concepts of Multi-Flipping processes (Double Flips and Triple Flips) were proposed to relax the thermal budget constraints in the F3D and thus support the dual-sided M3D in the F3D. The core's EDP and frequency are improved by up to 3.2% and 2.3% respectively, after BEOL optimizations based on the Triple Flips compared with unoptimized ones.</description>

      <title>Topological Orbital Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbital Hall effect (OHE) is attracting recent interest due to its fundamental science implications and potential applications in orbitronics and spintronics. Unlike the spin Hall effect, the connection between the OHE and band topology is not well understood. Here we present a novel approach for understanding the OHE based on analyzing the projected orbital angular momentum (POAM) spectrum. By considering monolayers of group IV elements, we demonstrate that the Wannier charge centers of the POAM spectrum display topologically nontrivial windings. The orbital Hall conductivity is found to form a plateau within the band gap as a direct consequence of the Chern number carried by the POAM spectrum. The topological orbital Hall phase is shown to yield a new form of bulk-boundary correspondence, which features gapless states in the POAM spectrum and induces nonzero orbital textures at the boundaries that should be amenable to experimental verification through ARPES measurements. Our study presents a systematic method for investigating the topological OHE and provides a pathway for its broader exploration in two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}$-classified topological crystalline insulator under space-time inversion symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a large family of one-dimensional (1D) topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) classified by $\mathbb{Z}$ invariants under space-time inversion symmetry. This finding stands in marked contrast to the conventional classification of 1D band topology protected by inversion symmetry and characterized by $\mathbb{Z}_2$-quantized polarization (Berry-Zak phase). By considering the nontrivial relative polarization among sublattices (orbitals), we introduce the inversion winding number as a topological invariant for characterizing and categorizing band topology. The inversion winding number reliably captures a novel bulk-edge correspondence, where gapped edge states are related to the inversion winding number of the sandwiching bands. Leveraging real-space analysis, we discover disorder-induced topological Anderson insulators and propose to experimentally discern band topology through relative polarization of edge states or bulk states. Our comprehensive findings present a paradigmatic illustration for the ongoing investigation and classification of band topology in TCIs.</description>

      <title>In-situ Self-optimization of Quantum Dot Emission for Lasers by Machine-Learning Assisted Epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional methods for optimizing light source emissions rely on a time-consuming trial-and-error approach. While in-situ optimization of light source gain media emission during growth is ideal, it has yet to be realized. In this work, we integrate in-situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) with machine learning (ML) to correlate the surface reconstruction with the photoluminescence (PL) of InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs), which serve as the active region of lasers. A lightweight ResNet-GLAM model is employed for the real-time processing of RHEED data as input, enabling effective identification of optical performance. This approach guides the dynamic optimization of growth parameters, allowing real-time feedback control to adjust the QDs emission for lasers. We successfully optimized InAs QDs on GaAs substrates, with a 3.2-fold increase in PL intensity and a reduction in full width at half maximum (FWHM) from 36.69 meV to 28.17 meV under initially suboptimal growth conditions. Our automated, in-situ self-optimized lasers with 5-layer InAs QDs achieved electrically pumped continuous-wave operation at 1240 nm with a low threshold current of 150 A/cm2 at room temperature, an excellent performance comparable to samples grown through traditional manual multi-parameter optimization methods. These results mark a significant step toward intelligent, low-cost, and reproductive light emitters production.</description>

      <title>Orbital Edelstein effect of electronic itinerant orbital motion at edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of orbital angular momentum (OAM), the focus has been predominantly on the intra-atomic contribution. However, recent research has begun to shift towards exploring the inter-atomic contribution to OAM dynamics. In this paper, we investigate the orbital Edelstein effect (OEE) arising from the inter-atomic OAM at the edges. We explore the OAM texture within edge states and unveil the OAM accumulation at the edges using several lattice models based on the $s$ orbital. By comparing slabs with differently shaped edges, we not only clarify the role of electron wiggling motion in shaping OAM texture but also highlight the absence of bulk-boundary correspondence in the accumulation process. The topological insulator and higher-order topological insulator models further confirm these findings and provide evidence for the relationship between the higher-order topology and the OEE. Our study advances the comprehension of orbital physics and extends its scope to higher-order topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Exciton localization in two-dimensional semiconductors through modification of the dielectric environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer semiconductors, given their thickness at the atomic scale, present unique electrostatic environments due to the sharp interfaces between the semiconductor film and surrounding materials. These interfaces significantly impact both the quasiparticle band structure and the electrostatic interactions between charge carriers. Akey area of interest in these materials is the behavior of bound electron-hole pairs (excitons) within the ultra-thin layer, which plays a crucial role in its optoelectronic properties. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of generating potential traps that completely confine excitons in the thin semiconductor by engineering the surrounding dielectric environment. By evaluating the simultaneous effects on bandgap renormalization and modifications to the strength of the electron-hole Coulomb-interaction, both associated to the modulation of the screening by the materials sandwiching the monolayer, we anticipate the existence of low-energy regions in which the localization of the exciton center of mass may be achieved. Our results suggest that for certain dielectric configurations, it is possible to generate complete discretization of exciton eigenenergies in the order of tens of meV. Such quantization of energy levels of two-dimensional excitons could be harnessed for applications in new-generation optoelectronic devices, which are necessary for the advancement of technologies like quantum computing and quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian effects in long-range polariton-mediated energy transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intramolecular energy transfer driven by near-field effects plays an important role in applications ranging from biophysics and chemistry to nano-optics and quantum communications. Advances in strong light-matter coupling in molecular systems have opened new possibilities to control energy transfer. In particular, long-distance energy transfer between molecules has been reported as the result of their mutual coupling to cavity photon modes, and the formation of hybrid polariton states. In addition to strong coupling to light, molecular systems also show strong interactions between electronic and vibrational modes. The latter can act as a reservoir for energy to facilitate off-resonant transitions, and thus energy relaxation between polaritonic states at different energies. However, the non-Markovian nature of those modes makes it challenging to accurately simulate these effects. Here we capture them via process tensor matrix product operator (PT-MPO) methods, to describe exactly the vibrational environment of the molecules combined with a mean-field treatment of the light-matter interaction. In particular, we study the emission dynamics of a system consisting of two spatially separated layers of different species of molecules coupled to a common photon mode, and show that the strength of coupling to the vibrational bath plays a crucial role in governing the dynamics of the energy of the emitted light; at strong vibrational coupling this dynamics shows strongly non-Markovian effects, eventually leading to polaron formation. Our results shed light on polaritonic long-range energy transfer, and provide further understanding of the role of vibrational modes of relevance to the growing field of molecular polaritonics.</description>

      <title>Spin orbit torque-driven motion of quasi-Bloch domain wall in perpendicularly magnetized W/CoFeB/MgO structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motion of chiral magnetic domain walls (DWs) driven by spin-orbit torque (SOT) has been extensively studied in heavy metal/ferromagnet heterostructures with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. This study specifically focuses on SOT-driven DWs in near Bloch-states, which we refer to as ``quasi-Bloch DWs". These quasi-Bloch DWs exhibit slower motion compared to Neel-type DWs, offering potential for achieving highly controllable DW positions. Here, we investigate the characteristics of SOT-driven motion of quasi-Bloch DWs in perpendicularly magnetized ultra-thin films consisting of W/CoFeB/MgO. For analyzing the DW motion, we employ a one-dimensional model incorporating parameters derived from experimental data obtained from our samples. Our model successfully reproduces the experimental results, which reveal variations in the direction and threshold current density of DW motion among different samples. Through theoretical analysis, we unveil that the DW remains in quasi-Bloch states during motion, with SOT serving as the primary driving force rather than spin transfer torque (STT). The direction of motion is determined not only by the sign combination of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and spin Hall angle but also by the strength of DMI, STT, and extrinsic DW pinning. Furthermore, we provide analytical expressions for the threshold current density required for SOT-driven quasi-Bloch DW motion. These findings provide valuable insights for the design of future DW devices with specific film structures.</description>

      <title>Electronic states bound by repulsive potentials in graphene irradiated by a circularly polarized electromagnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of the Floquet theory of periodically driven quantum systems, it is demonstrated that irradiation of graphene by a circularly polarized electromagnetic field induces an attractive area in the core of repulsive potentials. Consequently, the quasi-stationary electron states bound by the repulsive potentials appear. The difference between such field-induced states in graphene and usual systems with the parabolic dispersion of electrons is discussed and possible manifestations of these states in electronic transport and optical spectra of graphene are considered.</description>

      <title>Multi-tunneling effect of nonreciprocal Landau-Zener tunneling: Insights from DC field responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in laser technology have spurred growing interest in nonlinear and nonequilibrium phenomena. Here, we investigate the geometric aspects of quantum tunneling and the nonreciprocal response, particularly focusing on the shift vector, in noncentrosymmetric insulators under a strong DC electric field. In insulators under a strong electric field, electrons undergoing Bloch oscillations interfere with each other by passing through different paths via Landau-Zener tunneling. We found that the interference effect due to multi-tunneling causes the oscillating nonreciprocal response that is significantly amplified with increasing electric field intensity. We also clarified the role of the shift vector in the interference conditions through an analysis of the nonequilibrium steady state. These results will contribute significantly to advancing a systematic understanding of quantum geometric effects in the nonperturbative regime.</description>

      <title>Problem of nonlinear conductivity within relaxation time approximation in noncentrosymmetric insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the recent advancements in laser technology, there has been increasing interest in nonlinear and nonperturbative phenomena such as nonreciprocal transport, the nonlinear Hall effect, and nonlinear optical responses. When analyzing the nonequilibrium steady state, the relaxation time approximation (RTA) in the quantum kinetic equation has been widely used. However, recent studies have highlighted problems with the use of RTA that require careful consideration. In a study published in Phys. Rev. B, $\textbf{109}$, L180302 (2024), we revealed that the RTA has a flaw in predicting finite linear conductivity even for insulators under weak electric fields, and improved the RTA based on the Redfield equation. In this paper, we further extend our approach to nonlinear responses. This approach provides a simple alternative to RTA and is expected to be useful for the study of nonlinear and nonequilibrium phenomena.</description>

      <title>Detection of Majorana zero modes bound to Josephson vortices in planar S-TI-S junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study signatures of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) bound to Josephson vortices in superconductor-three-dimensional topological insulator-superconductor (S-TI-S) Josephson junctions placed in a perpendicular magnetic field. First, using semiclassical analytical as well as numerical techniques, we calculate the spatially resolved supercurrent density carried by the low-energy Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) states in the junction. Motivated by a recent experiment [Yue et al., Phys. Rev. B 109, 094511 (2024)], we discuss if and how the presence of vortex MZMs is reflected in supercurrent measurements, showing that Fraunhofer signatures alone are not suitable to reliably detect vortex MZMs. Next, we propose two ways in which we believe supercurrent measurements could be complemented to further verify that the junction does indeed host MZMs. Explicitly, we discuss how additional Majorana signatures could be obtained by (1) mapping out the local density of states in the junction via scanning tunneling microscopy techniques, and (2) microwave spectroscopy of the spectrum of low-energy CdGM states in the junction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we employed lateral force microscopy, a specialized technique within atomic force microscopy, to explore the nanoscale frictional properties of 2D SnSe and SnSe$_2$ layers, and we compared these findings with graphene, a commonly used solid lubricant. Our results revealed that SnSe and SnSe2 layers exhibited superior lubricative performance compared to graphene with similar thickness, with SnSe$_2$ demonstrating friction levels up to three times lower. This lower friction observed in SnSe$_2$, as compared to SnSe, was further substantiated by extensive Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, confirming the intrinsic material properties contributing to their enhanced lubricative behavior.</description>

      <title>Quantum chemical study of the influence of torsional deformation on the properties of chiral WXY (X, Y = S, Se) Janus-nanotubes</title>

Abstract: This work sheds light on the electronic band properties of chiral WSSe Janus nanotubes from the quantum mechanical perspective. Line groups theory developed by Damnjanovich was used to model mechanical torsion of chiral nanotubes with different symmetries. Known natural torsion in chiral nanotubes was observed. It was shown that mechanical stress can be used as a tool to tune electronic properties of the nanotubes including the change of the nature of the electron transition. On the DFT-level of the theory the stability of WS2, WSe2 and Janus WSSe nanotubes was estimated. Applicability of stable Janus-nanotubes to photocatalytic water-splitting was suggested based on the calculated electronic properties</description>

      <title>Pair Approximating the Action For Molecular Rotations in Path Integral Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Typical path integral Monte Carlo approaches use the primitive approximation to compute the probability density for a given path. In this work, we develop the pair Discrete Variable Representation (pair-DVR) approach to study molecular rotations. The pair propagator, which was initially introduced to study superfluidity in condensed Helium, is naturally well-suited for systems interacting with a pair-wise potential. Consequently, paths sampled using the pair action tend to be closer to the exact paths (compared to primitive Trotter paths) for such systems leading to convergence with less imaginary time steps. Therefore, our approach relies on using the pair factorization approach in conjunction with a discretized Path Integral Ground State (PIGS) paradigm to study a chain of planar rotors interacting with a pair-wise dipole interaction. We first use the Wigner-Kirkwood density expansion to analyze the asymptotics of the pair propagator in imaginary time. Then, we exhibit the utility of the pair factorization scheme via convergence studies comparing the pair and primitive propagators. Finally, we compute energetic and structural properties of this system including the correlation function and Binder ratio as functions of the coupling strength to examine the behaviour of the pair-DVR method near criticality. Density Matrix Renormalization Group results are used for benchmarking throughout.</description>

      <title>Quantum linear algebra for disordered electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe how to use quantum linear algebra to simulate a physically realistic model of disordered non-interacting electrons on exponentially many lattice sites. The physics of disordered electrons outside of one dimension challenges classical computation due to the critical nature of the Anderson localization transition or exponential localization lengths, while the atypical distribution of the local density of states limits the power of disorder averaged approaches. We overcome this by simulating an exponentially large disorder instance using a block-encoded hopping matrix of physical form where disorder is introduced by pseudorandom functions. Key physical quantities, including the reduced density matrix, Green's function, and local density of states, as well as bulk-averaged observables such as the linear conductivity, can then be computed using quantum singular value transformation, quantum amplitude estimation, and trace estimation.</description>

      <title>Transmission of mobility via cooperative mechanisms in soft active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When supercooled, liquids viscosity increases dramatically as the glass transition temperature is approached. While the physical origin of this behavior is still not understood, it is now well established that the addition of a few activated particles is able to reverse that increase in viscosity. Here we further raise the question of a limit in that fluidization process and of the differences between the fluidized liquid and its viscous counterpart. Results show that a few percent active molecules are enough to trigger a phase transition leading to diffusion coefficients typical of liquids while the medium retains cooperative properties of the viscous phase. The similarity between cooperative properties of the active and non active molecules suggests that the mobility of active molecules is transmitted to inactive ones via the medium cooperative mechanisms, a result in agreement with facilitation theories. This result is then confirmed by the compared behavior of the distinct van hove correlation functions of most mobile active and non active molecules. Interestingly enough, in our simulations the cooperative mechanisms are not induced or related to a decrease of the excitation concentration.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional MnBX monolayer as promising anode with record-high capacity and fast diffusion for Na-ion battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the group structure search method of first principles, MnB, MnB2, and MnB6 monolayer two-dimensional systems were designed and their structure, stability, electronic properties, as well as performance as anodes for sodium-ion batteries were examined. The findings indicate that the MnB, MnB2, and MnB6 monolayer two-dimensional systems possess high thermal stability, mechanical stability, dynamic stability, and distinctive metallic properties. When utilized in sodium-ion batteries, these MnB, MnB2, and MnB6 monolayers demonstrate high storage capacity, low diffusion barriers, and moderate open-circuit voltage. Due to its unique structure, the MnB monolayer presents a negative Poisson's ratio and a very low diffusion barrier. The theoretical capacitance of the MnB2 monolayer, when acting as an anode for sodium-ion batteries, exceeds that of the MnB and MnB6 monolayers. The research results reveal that boron-rich two-dimensional electrode materials pave a new way for energy applications. Particularly, MnB2 and MnB6 monolayer two-dimensional systems, as anode materials, incorporate the advantages of both planar and corrugated monolayer structures.</description>

      <title>Characterizing topological pumping of charges in exactly solvable Rice-Mele chains of the non-Hermitian variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the nature of the Thouless charge-pumping for a non-Hermitian (NH) generalization of the one-dimensional (1d) Rice-Mele model, considering a variety which allows closed-form analytical solutions for the eigensystems. The two-band system is subjected to an ``adiabatic'' time-periodic drive, which effectively gives us a closed two-dimensional (2d) manifold in the momentum-frequency space, mimicking a 2d Brillouin zone (BZ) for periodic boundary conditions. For open boundary conditions, we formulate the non-Bloch generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ). All these allow us to compute the Chern numbers of the 2d manifolds emerging for various parameter values, using the BZ or GBZ, which are well-defined integers in the gapped regions of the spectra. If Thouless pumping still holds for NH situations, the expectation values of the net displacement for the particles occupying a given band within a cycle, calculated using the right and left eigenvectors of a biorthogonal basis for the complex Hamiltonians, would coincide with the Chern numbers. However, we find that there are deviations from the expected quantized values whenever the spectra exhibit strongly-fluctuating magnitudes of the imaginary parts of the (generically) complex eigenvalues. This implies that we need to address the question of how to meaningfully define time-evolution, as well as adiabaticity, in the context of NH systems.</description>

      <title>The effect of formation temperature and flexo-chemical strains on the electrophysical properties of the molybdenum-disulfide-oxide nanoflakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We synthesized the powder of molybdenum-disulfide-oxide nanoflowers consisting of self-assembled 10-20 nm thin nanoflakes by reaction of (NH4)6Mo7O24 with thiourea in aqueous solution at temperatures from 130oC to 180oC in hydrothermal conditions. The detailed analysis of the XPS, EDX and Raman spectroscopy results reveal the significant amount of the molybdenum oxides, sulfides and sulfates in the molybdenum disulfide nanoflakes, which allows to consider the "effective" formulae MoSxOy for their chemical composition. The MoSxOy nanoflakes reveal unusual electric transport features interesting for material science and promising for applications. The chemical composition and microstructure of the nanoflakes, which are determined by the temperature of synthesis, is shown to be responsible for the electro-conduction mechanism. Namely, the current-voltage characteristics (I-V curves) grow monotonically with the applied voltage for the samples, synthesized at the temperatures T_s&lt;&lt;150oC and T_s&gt;&gt;150oC, being non-ohmic and hysteretic at lower voltages and becoming close to the ohmic at higher voltages. The I-V curves acquire N-like shape with a strongly pronounced negative differential resistivity part at T_s=150oC. Both with and without N-shape, the I-V curves manifest hysteretic behavior with the difference between increasing and decreasing voltage sweeps, and the hysteresis loop parameters are determined by the temperature of synthesis. Important, that the studied nanoflakes manifest very long living deep charging and discharging after the voltage switching "on" and "off".Considering that the presence of oxygen non-stoichiometry and bending can create strong flexo-chemical strains in the nanoflakes, we proposed the flexo-chemical model of the polar and electro-transport properties of the pressed MoSxOy nanoflakes, which describes the observed I-V curves.</description>

      <title>Protected Weyl semimetals within 2D chiral classes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals in three dimensions can exist independently of any symmetry apart from translations. In contrast, in two dimensions, Weyl semimetals require additional symmetries, including crystalline symmetries, to exist. Previous research, based on K-theory classification, suggested that chiral symmetry can protect Weyl nodes in two dimensions. According to K-theory, stable Weyl nodes can exist in four chiral classes-AIII, BDI, CII, and DIII-and are classified by $\mathbb{Z}$ (AIII, BDI, DIII) and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ (CII) invariants. However, it was later found that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and trivial indices predicted by K-theory do not reliably indicate the presence or absence of Weyl nodes in two dimensions. In this study, we demonstrate that stable Weyl nodes exist in each of the five chiral classes and can be characterized by a $\mathbb{Z}$ winding number in two dimensions. Our conclusion is supported by the explicit solution of the most general Hamiltonian consistent with the symmetry class. We also discuss protected Fermi arc edge states, which always connect the projections of Weyl nodes with opposite topological charges. Unlike the surface states in three-dimensional Weyl semimetals, the edge states in two-dimensional Weyl semimetals within chiral classes are completely dispersionless and remain at zero energy due to the protecting chiral symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful and innovative tool for discerning spin excitations and spin-spin interactions within atoms and molecules adsorbed on surfaces. However, the origin of the STM-ESR signal and the underlying mechanisms that govern the essential features of the measured spectra have remained elusive, thereby significantly impeding the future development of the STM-ESR approach. Here, we construct a model to carry out precise numerical simulations of STM-ESR spectra for a single hydrogenated Ti adatom and a hydrogenated Ti dimer, achieving excellent agreement with experimental observations. We further develop an analytic theory that elucidates the fundamental origin of the signal as well as the essential features in the measured spectra. These new theoretical developments establish a solid foundation for the on-demand detection and manipulation of atomic-scale spin states, with promising implications for cutting-edge applications in spin sensing, quantum information, and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Room Temperature Magnetic Skyrmions in Gradient-Composition Engineered CoPt Single Layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09632v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topologically protected magnetic skyrmions in magnetic materials are stabilized by interfacial or bulk Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). Interfacial DMI decays with increase of the magnetic layer thickness in just a few nanometers and bulk DMI typically stabilizes magnetic skyrmions at low temperatures. Consequently, more flexibility in manipulation of DMI is required for utilizing nanoscale skyrmions in energy efficient memory and logic devices at room temperature (RT). Here, we demonstrate the observation of RT skyrmions stabilized by gradient DMI (g-DMI) in composition gradient engineered CoPt single layer films by employing topological Hall effect, magnetic force microscopy, and nitrogen vacancy scanning magnetometry. Skyrmions remain stable at a wide range of applied magnetic fields and are confirmed to be nearly Bloch-type from micromagnetic simulation and analytical magnetization reconstruction. Furthermore, we observe skyrmion pairs which may be explained by skyrmion-antiskyrmion interactions. Our findings expand the family of magnetic materials hosting RT magnetic skyrmions by tuning g-DMI via gradient polarity and choice of magnetic elements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the time evolution of a topological system when the system undergoes a sudden quantum quench within the same nontrivial phase. Using Haldane's honeycomb model as an example, we show that equilibrium states in a topological phase can be distinguished by geometrical features, such as the characteristic momentum at which the half-occupied edge modes cross, the associated edge-mode velocity, and the winding vector about which the normalized pseudospin magnetic field winds along a great circle on the Bloch sphere. We generalize these geometrical quantities for non-equilibrium states and use them to visualize the quench dynamics of the topological system. In general, we find the pre-quench equilibrium state relaxes to the post-quench equilibrium state in an oscillatory fashion, whose amplitude decay as $t^{1/2}$. In the process, however, the characteristic winding vector of the non-equilibrium system can evolve to regimes that are not reachable with equilibrium states.</description>

Abstract: We study the optical effect of chiral topological superconductors in two dimensions. The linear optical response from chiral Bogoliubov edge modes in clean superconductors has in-gap resonances, which is originated from the transitions within the edge particle-hole pair bands. Interestingly, the number of resonance peaks is determined by the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Chern number of topological superconductors. Such a sharply distinctive feature in optical absorption offers a simple way to distinguish topological superconductors with different Chern numbers. We further demonstrate that linear optical effect could probe different topological phases in quantum anomalous Hall insulator-superconductor junction devices. This finding provides an applicable method to detect chiral Bogoliubov edge states and is distinguishable from collective modes in superconductors and possible trivial explanations.</description>

Abstract: One of the most intriguing properties of magnonic systems is their reconfigurability, where an external magnetic field alters the static magnetic configuration to influence magnetization dynamics. In this paper, we present an alternative approach to tunable magnonic systems. We studied theoretically and numerically a magnonic crystal induced within a uniform magnetic layer by a periodic magnetic field pattern created by the sequence of superconducting strips. We showed that the spin-wave spectrum can be tuned by the inhomogeneous stray field of the superconductor in response to a small uniform external magnetic field. Additionally, we demonstrated that modifying the width of superconducting strips and separation between them leads to the changes in the internal field which are unprecedented in conventional magnonic structures. The paper presents the results of semi-analytical calculations for realistic structures, which are verified by finite-element method computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the injection, transport and detection of magnon spins in the van der Waals antiferromagnet chromium thiophosphate (CrPS4). We electrically and thermally inject magnon spins by platinum contacts and examine the non-local resistance as a function of in-plane magnetic field up to 12 Tesla. We observe a large non-local resistance from both the electrically and thermally excited magnon modes above the spin-flip field where CrPS4 is in the collinear state. At 25 K for an in-plane field of ranging 5 - 12 T, we extract the magnon relaxation length ranging $200-800$ nm and a typical magnon conductivity of 1e4 Sm-1, which is one order of magnitude smaller than in yttrium iron garnet (YIG) films at room temperature. Moreover, we find that the magnon conductivity is almost zero for CrPS4 in the non-collinear state. Our results open up the way to understanding the role of the antiferromagnetic magnon modes on spin injection into antiferromagnets and implementation of two-dimensional magnets for scalable magnonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Semi-Dirac Fermions in a Topological Metal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological semimetals with massless Dirac and Weyl fermions represent the forefront of quantum materials research. In two dimensions (2D), a peculiar class of fermions that are massless in one direction and massive in the perpendicular direction was predicted sixteen years ago. These highly exotic quasiparticles - the semi-Dirac fermions - ignited intense theoretical and experimental interest but remain undetected. Using magneto-optical spectroscopy, we demonstrate the defining feature of semi-Dirac fermions - $B^{2/3}$ scaling of Landau levels - in a prototypical nodal-line metal ZrSiS. In topological metals, including ZrSiS, nodal-lines extend the band degeneracies from isolated points to lines, loops or even chains in the momentum space. With $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations and theoretical modeling, we pinpoint the observed semi-Dirac spectrum to the crossing points of nodal-lines in ZrSiS. Crossing nodal-lines exhibit a continuum absorption spectrum but with singularities that scale as $B^{2/3}$ at the crossing. Our work sheds light on the hidden quasiparticles emerging from the intricate topology of crossing nodal-lines and highlights the potential to explore quantum geometry with linear optical responses.</description>

      <title>Scaling of the Integrated Quantum Metric in Disordered Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a study of a disorder-dependent real-space representation of the quantum geometry in topological systems. Thanks to the development of an efficient linear-scaling numerical methodology based on the kernel polynomial method, we can explore nontrivial behavior of the integrated quantum metric and Chern number in disordered systems with sizes reaching the experimental scale. We illustrate this approach in the disordered Haldane model, examining the impact of Anderson disorder and vacancies on the trivial and topological phases captured by this model.</description>

      <title>High-throughput search for topological magnon materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological magnons give rise to possibilities for engineering novel spintronics devices with critical applications in quantum information and computation, due to its symmetry-protected robustness and low dissipation. However, to make reliable and systematic predictions about material realization of topological magnons has been a major challenge, due to the lack of neutron scattering data for most materials. In this work, we significantly advance the symmetry-based approach for identifying topological magnons through developing a fully automated algorithm, utilizing the theory of symmetry indicators, that enables a highly efficient and large-scale search for candidate materials hosting field-induced topological magnons. This progress not only streamlines the discovery process but also expands the scope of materials exploration beyond previous manual or traditional methods, offering a powerful tool for uncovering novel topological phases in magnetic systems. Performing a large-scale search over all 1649 magnetic materials in Bilbao Crystallographic Server with a commensurate magnetic order, we discover 387 candidate materials for topological magnons, significantly expanding the pool of topological magnon materials. We further discuss examples and experimental accessibility of the candidate materials, shedding light on future experimental realizations of topological magnons in magnetic materials.</description>
