      <title>Deep Mapper: Efficient Visualization of Plausible Conformational Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19177v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Acquiring plausible pathways on high-dimensional structural distributions is beneficial in several domains. For example, in the drug discovery field, a protein conformational pathway, i.e. a highly probable sequence of protein structural changes, is useful to analyze interactions between the protein and the ligands, helping to create new drugs. Recently, a state-of-the-art method in drug discovery was presented, which efficiently computes protein pathways using latent variables obtained from an isometric auto-encoding of the space of 3D density maps associated to protein conformations. However, our preliminary experiments show that there is room to significantly reduce the computing time. In this study, we use the Mapper algorithm, which is a Topological Data Analysis method, and present a novel variant to extract plausible conformational pathways from the isometric latent space with comparatively short running time. The extracted pathways are visualized as paths on the resulting Mapper graph. The methodological novelties are described as follows: firstly, the filter function of the Mapper algorithm is optimized so as to extract the pathways via minimization of an energy loss defined on the Mapper graph itself, while filter functions taken in the classical Mapper algorithm are fixed beforehand. The optimization is with respect to parameters of a deep neural network in the filter. Secondly, the clustering method, which defines the vertices and edges of the Mapper graph, of our algorithm, is designed by incorporating domain prior knowledge to assist the extraction. In our numerical experiments, based on an isometric latent space built on the common 50S-ribosomal dataset, the resulting Mapper graph successfully includes all the well-recognized plausible pathways. Moreover, our running time is much shorter than the above state-of-the-art counterpart.</description>

      <title>Fast and Functional Structured Data Generators Rooted in Out-of-Equilibrium Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we address the challenge of using energy-based models to produce high-quality, label-specific data in complex structured datasets, such as population genetics, RNA or protein sequences data. Traditional training methods encounter difficulties due to inefficient Markov chain Monte Carlo mixing, which affects the diversity of synthetic data and increases generation times. To address these issues, we use a novel training algorithm that exploits non-equilibrium effects. This approach, applied on the Restricted Boltzmann Machine, improves the model's ability to correctly classify samples and generate high-quality synthetic data in only a few sampling steps. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by its successful application to four different types of data: handwritten digits, mutations of human genomes classified by continental origin, functionally characterized sequences of an enzyme protein family, and homologous RNA sequences from specific taxonomies.</description>

      <title>Medication Recommendation via Dual Molecular Modalities and Multi-Step Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20358v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing works based on molecular knowledge neglect the 3D geometric structure of molecules and fail to learn the high-dimensional information of medications, leading to structural confusion. Additionally, it does not extract key substructures from a single patient visit, resulting in the failure to identify medication molecules suitable for the current patient visit. To address the above limitations, we propose a bimodal molecular recommendation framework named BiMoRec, which introduces 3D molecular structures to obtain atomic 3D coordinates and edge indices, overcoming the inherent lack of high-dimensional molecular information in 2D molecular structures. To retain the fast training and prediction efficiency of the recommendation system, we use bimodal graph contrastive pretraining to maximize the mutual information between the two molecular modalities, achieving the fusion of 2D and 3D molecular graphs. Additionally, we designed a molecular multi-step enhancement mechanism to re-calibrate the molecular weights. Specifically, we employ a pre-training method that captures both 2D and 3D molecular structure representations, along with substructure representations, and leverages contrastive learning to extract mutual information. We then use the pre-trained encoder to generate molecular representations, enhancing them through a three-step process: intra-visit, molecular per-visit, and latest-visit. Finally, we apply temporal information aggregation to generate the final medication combinations. Our implementation on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>
