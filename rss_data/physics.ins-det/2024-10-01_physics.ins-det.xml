      <title>Initial performance assessment and calibration techniques of the production monolithic silicon pixel detector ASIC for the detection of electromagnetic showers of TeV energy in the FASER experiment at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FASER experiment at the LHC aims to detect new, long-lived fundamental particles. A tungsten-silicon (W-Si) preshower detector is being developed to enhance the experiment's ability to distinguish between closely spaced photon pairs with energies on the order of TeV and separations as small as 200 \textmu m. This detector will use a monolithic silicon pixel sensor fabricated with 130 nm SiGe BiCMOS technology. Initial tests were conducted on the production ASIC, after evaluating the performance of the preproduction one. The first tests on the production ASIC indicate that the essential components of the monolithic silicon pixel detector are operating as expected. Two calibration methods were developed to reconstruct the charge of the FASER preshower detector, from the ASICs' ADC values.</description>

      <title>Signal processing and spectral modeling for the BeEST experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Beryllium Electron capture in Superconducting Tunnel junctions (BeEST) experiment searches for evidence of heavy neutrino mass eigenstates in the nuclear electron capture decay of $^7$Be by precisely measuring the recoil energy of the $^7$Li daughter. In Phase-III, the BeEST experiment has been scaled from a single superconducting tunnel junction (STJ) sensor to a 36-pixel array to increase sensitivity and mitigate gamma-induced backgrounds. Phase-III also uses a new continuous data acquisition system that greatly increases the flexibility for signal processing and data cleaning. We have developed procedures for signal processing and spectral fitting that are sufficiently robust to be automated for large data sets. This article presents the optimized procedures before unblinding the majority of the Phase-III data set to search for physics beyond the standard model.</description>

      <title>Athermal phonon collection efficiency in diamond crystals for low mass dark matter detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explored the efficacy of lab-grown diamonds as potential target materials for the direct detection of sub-GeV dark matter~(DM) using metallic magnetic calorimeters~(MMCs). Diamond, with its excellent phononic properties and the low atomic mass of the constituent carbon, can play a crucial role in detecting low-mass dark matter particles. The relatively long electron-hole pair lifetime inside the crystal may provide discrimination power between the DM-induced nuclear recoil events and the background-induced electron recoil events. Utilizing the the fast response times of the MMCs and their unique geometric versatility, we deployed a novel methodology for quantifying phonon dynamics inside diamond crystals. We demonstrated that lab-grown diamond crystals fabricated via the chemical vapor deposition~(CVD) technique can satisfy the stringent quality requirements for sub-GeV dark matter searches. The high-quality polycrystalline CVD diamond showed a superior athermal phonon collection efficiency compared to that of the reference sapphire crystal, and achieved energy resolution 62.7~eV at the 8.05~keV copper fluorescence line. With this energy resolution, we explored the low-energy range below 100~eV and confirmed the existence of so-called low-energy excess~(LEE) reported by multiple cryogenic experiments.</description>

      <title>Mapping of the Transient Electric Field Created by the Charge Spreading on the Resistive Strip of Micromegas used in the ATLAS New Small Wheels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resistive strips Micromegas are employed in the ATLAS New Small Wheel project. They have been already installed and operate in the experimental cavern of the ATLAS experiment at CERN. This work attempts to describe the mechanism of the surface electric charge spread on a resistive strip of the Micromegas detector and the created transient electric field. Moreover, an approach utilising the Telegraph partial differential equation, used in transmission lines, is discussed assuming a 2-layer geometry approximation. Finally, the transient electric field formation leading to the strong suppression of the sparks in the amplification region is calculated by using the accurate 3-layer geometry for the particular parameters of the Micromegas configuration. The spatial mapping of this field versus time is presented for the time slice of interest.</description>

      <title>The optimal structure of the MRPC detector for 0.511 MeV gamma based on Monte Carlo simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detailed detector simulations can not only optimize the structure of the detector by analyzing the performance, but also provide strong support for the experimental design. To obtain the optimal structure of Multi-gap Resistive Plate Chambers (MRPCs) for 0.511 MeV gammas, a complete simulation framework for gamma detection by the MRPCs based on Geant4 and Magboltz software is described in this paper. The simulation shows how gamma interacts with MRPCs and the process of gas ionization, avalanche multiplication, and signal formation. The simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental results. By analyzing the time resolution and detection efficiency, the optimal structure of MRPCs for 0.511 MeV gammas is proposed.</description>

      <title>CEPC-on-Gaussino: an application of Gaussino simulation framework for CEPC experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) is a future Higgs factory to measure the Higgs boson properties. Like the other future experiments, the simulation software plays a crucial role in CEPC for detector designs, algorithm optimization and physics studies. Due to similar requirements, the software stack from the Key4hep project has been adopted by CEPC. As the initial application of Key4hep, a simulation framework has been developed for CEPC based on DD4hep, EDM4hep and k4FWCore since 2020. However, the current simulation framework for CEPC lacks support for the parallel computing. To benefit from the multi-threading techniques, the Gaussino project from the LHCb experiment has been chosen as the next simulation framework in Key4hep. This contribution presents the application of Gaussino for CEPC. The development of the CEPC-on-Gaussino prototype will be shown and the simulation of a tracker detector will be demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Calibration and Performance of the Upgraded ALICE Inner Tracking System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ALICE Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) underwent a major upgrade during the Long Shutdown 2. Several subsystems have been improved, including the ALICE Inner Tracking System (ITS), which has been entirely replaced. The new pixel-only tracker (ITS2) consists of 7 layers of Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) featuring a pixel size of 27x29 $\mu$m$^2$, with an intrinsic spatial resolution of 5 $\mu$m. With 24120 sensors and 12.5 billion pixels, this detector covers an active area of about 10 m$^2$ and represents the largest application of the MAPS technology in a high-energy physics experiment to date. The most significant improvements introduced by the ITS2 to the ALICE experiment include a reduction in the impact parameter resolution to approximately 30 $\mu$m in both the r$\varphi$ and z coordinates at a transverse momentum of 1 GeV/c. This is a factor of 3 improvement over the previous detector. Additionally, the standard ITS readout rate has been increased from 1 kHz to 67 kHz in Pb-Pb collisions and to 202 kHz in proton-proton collisions. To ensure stable operations and maintain high data quality a regular calibration is performed, which consists in establishing the charge threshold and the noisy channels of the detector. The ITS2 has been successfully commissioned for LHC Run3, and already operated during proton-proton and Pb-Pb collisions at LHC with excellent performance. This contribution gives an overview of the operational procedures required to maintain an optimal data quality, along with results obtained from calibration and the performance achieved during the LHC Run 3.</description>

      <title>electronCT -- An Imaging Technique Using Very-high Energy Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronCT technique is an imaging method based on the multiple Coulomb scattering of relativistic electrons and has potential applications in medical and industrial imaging. It utilizes a pencil beam of electrons in the very high energy electron (VHEE, 50-250 MeV) range and a single detection layer for the determination of the beam profile. The technique constitutes a projectional, two-dimensional imaging method and thus also qualifies for the tomographic reconstruction of samples. Given the simplicity of the technical setup and its location behind the sample, the electronCT technique has potential synergies with VHEE radiotherapy, making use of the same electron source for both treatment and diagnostics and thus being a candidate for in-situ imaging and patient localization. At the same time, several technical challenges arise from the measurement technique when applied for the imaging of living beings. Measurements performed at the ARES linear particle accelerator at an electron energy of 155 MeV using a mouse phantom and a Timepix3 silicon pixel detector assembly demonstrate the feasibility of this technique. Both projectional and tomographic reconstructions are presented and the potential and limits of the technology are discussed.</description>

      <title>Laboratory and beam-test performance study of a 55$~\mu$m pitch iLGAD sensor bonded to a Timepix3 readout chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This contribution reports on characterisation results of a large-area (2$~\mathrm{cm}^2$) small pitch (55$~\mu$m) inverse Low-Gain Avalanche Detector (iLGAD), bonded to a Timepix3 readout chip. The ilGAD sensors were produced by Micron Semiconductor Ltd with the goal to obtain good gain uniformity and maximise the fill-factor -- an issue present with standard small-pitch LGAD designs. We have conducted detailed performance evaluations using both X-ray calibrations and beam tests. An X-ray fluorescence setup has been used to obtain energy calibration and to identify the optimal operating settings of the new devices, whereas the extensive beam tests allowed for a detailed evaluation of the detector performance. The beam-tests were performed at the CERN SPS North Area H6 beamline, using a 120 GeV/c pion beam. The reference tracking and time-stamping is achieved by a Timepix3-based beam telescope setup.
  The results show a gain of around 5 with very good uniformity, measured across the whole gain area, as well as a hit time resolution down to 1.3 ns without correcting for the time-walk effects. Furthermore, it is shown that the gain opens the possibility of a good X-ray energy resolution down to 4.5 keV.</description>

      <title>Nuclear fuel imaging using position-sensitive detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are evaluating the performance of a Passive Gamma Emission Tomography (PGET) device equipped with 3D position-sensitive cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) gamma-ray detectors when used for inspecting spent nuclear fuel assemblies (SFAs). Recent advancements in imaging detector technology may offer a method to extend the capabilities of such devices beyond standard safeguards applications, allowing an efficient non-invasive way to accurately characterise the properties of nuclear fuel assemblies. The efficiency of the currently used small CZT detectors is restricted by the limited likelihood of full gamma-ray absorption, which is needed for optimal imaging information. Employing larger CZT detectors would increase the probability of capturing the full energy of gamma rays, thereby enhancing the sensitivity of the PGET device and the quality of the reconstructed images. Large CZT detectors need to be position-sensitive to determine through which collimator slit a gamma ray travelled. Position sensitivity results from the pixelated readout of the CZT crystals. Pixelation potentially increases the spatial resolution of the system, which is currently determined by the collimator used. Pixelation allows resolving the position of arrival up to (readout pitch)/$\sqrt{12}$. We are additionally exploring the potential of utilising Compton imaging to provide information on the origin of gamma rays along the SFA. A simulation is created using Geant4 to compare the full photon absorption efficiency of large and current, small, crystals. Gamma rays of energy 661.7 keV and 1274 keV are targeted to the model describing the approved apparatus now equipped with 22 mm x 22 mm x 10 mm crystals of CZT. It is observed that the efficiency for photon absorption in this case is greatly increased when compared to the existing detectors.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal structure optimization for the high density electromagnetic calorimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High density electromagnetic sandwich calorimeters with high readout granularity are considered for many future collider and fix-target experiments. Optimization of the calorimeter structure from the point of view of the electromagnetic shower energy, position and direction measurement is one of the key aspects of the design. However, mostly uniform sampling structures were considered so far. We developed a semi-analytical approach to study calorimeter performance based on the detailed Geant 4 simulation, which also allows to compare the expected performance for different non-uniform longitudinal readout structures. For multi-objective optimization, procedure based on the genetic algorithm is complemented with non dominated sorting algorithm. This methodology opens new prospects for calorimeter design optimization directly addressing specific measurement scenarios or optimization goals.</description>

      <title>The TOTEM nT2 detector: architecture, operation and performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The TOTEM experiment at the LHC has produced a large set of measurements on diffractive processes and pp cross sections. A new detector, called nT2, has been designed to measure the inelastic scattering rate during the LHC special run of 2023. Due to the high radiation environment, the detector had to be installed in 10-20 minutes at most, then commissioned and operated after only few days. The detector, based on plastic scintillators read out by matrices of SiPMs, was designed with such constraints in mind. The front-end, DAQ and control electronics was developed with a fault tolerant architecture, moving as many functionalities as possible on a radiation tolerant SoC FPGA, hosting an integrated ARM controller. Here we will describe the nT2 detector and its read-out and control electronics. The detector was successfully operated during the special run: we will report the preliminary results on the detector performance.</description>

      <title>Phase projection errors in rf-driven optically pumped magnetometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phase between the oscillating (rf) excitation field and the detected (light) power modulation in scalar rf-driven optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs), in particular in the $M_x$ configuration. While the static dependence of the demodulation phase on the direction of the external static magnetic field vector can be largely overcome by aligning the oscillating rf field along the light propagation direction, we show that a dynamic (transient) phase response can appear under tilts of the magnetic field. We analytically solve the corresponding modified Bloch equation and obtain agreement with experimental observations in an $M_x$ magnetometer setup using a paraffin-coated Cs vapor cell. The results reveal fundamental limitations of $M_x$ magnetometers in terms of response time and accuracy, in particular when operated with active electronic feedback, e.g., using a phase-locked loop. Thus, the work is highly relevant in important magnetometry applications, where the direction of the quasi-static magnetic field of interest is not known \textit{a priori} and/or not constant over time, or in measurements, in which a large detection bandwidth is paramount. Such conditions are encountered, e.g., in geomagnetic surveying, in particular with mobile platforms.</description>

      <title>Nanosecond hardware regression trees in FPGA at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a generic parallel implementation of the decision tree-based machine learning (ML) method in hardware description language (HDL) on field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). A regression problem in high energy physics at the Large Hadron Collider is considered: the estimation of the magnitude of missing transverse momentum using boosted decision trees (BDT). A forest of twenty decision trees each with a maximum depth of ten using eight input variables of 16-bit precision is executed with a latency of less than 10 ns using O(0.1%) resources on Xilinx UltraScale+ VU9P -- approximately ten times faster and five times smaller compared to similar designs using high level synthesis (HLS) -- without the use of digital signal processors (DSP) while eliminating the use of block RAM (BRAM). We also demonstrate a potential application in the estimation of muon momentum for ATLAS RPC at HL-LHC.</description>

      <title>Radiopurity of NaI(Tl) crystals for PICOLON dark matter experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dark matter observation claim by the DAMA/LIBRA collaboration has been a long-standing puzzle within the particle physics community. Efforts of other research groups to verify the claim have been insufficient by significant radioactivity of present NaI(Tl) crystals. PICOLON (Pure Inorganic Crystal Observatory for LOw-energy Neut(ra)lino) experiment conducts independent search for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) using NaI(Tl) crystals. Our NaI(Tl) crystal manufactured in 2020 (Ingot #85) reached the same purity level as DAMA/LIBRA crystals. In this report, we describe the radiopurity of the new Ingot #94 crystal produced using the same purification technique as Ingot #85. The $\alpha$-ray events were selected by pulse-shape discrimination method. The impurities in the Ingot #94, $^{232}$Th, $^{226}$Ra and $^{210}$Po radioactivity were $4.6\pm 1.2~\mathrm{\mu Bq/kg}$, $7.9\pm 4.4~\mathrm{\mu Bq/kg}$, and $19\pm 6~\mathrm{\mu Bq/kg}$, which are equivalent to those of the DAMA/LIBRA crystals. The background rate in the energy region of 2-6 keV , was 2-5 events/d/kg/keV without applying a veto trigger.</description>

      <title>Photon radiation calorimetry for anomalous heat generation in NiCu multilayer thin film during hydrogen gas desorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to investigate the anomalous heat effect (AHE) in NiCu multilayer thin film, photon radiation calorimetry has been developed. Three types of photon detectors are employed to cover a wide range of wavelengths from 0.3 um to 5.5 um, i.e., photon energies from 0.2 to 1.8 eV. In the present work, the usefullness of the calorimetry is demonstrated for excess heat measurements with samples of Ni pure, NiCu composite layers, and Cu layer deposited on the Ni substrate. Direct comparisons of photon radiation spectra with and without H2 easily showed sample-specific differences in excess heat power. The samples of NiCu composite layer produced larger excess heat. By incorporating the measured radiant power into a heat flow model, the excess heat was deduced to be 4 - 6 W. The energy generated in 80 hours reached to 460 +/- 120 kJ: the generated energy per hydrogen was at least 410 +/- 108 keV/H atom. This is definitely not a chemical reaction, but producing energy at the level of nuclear reactions.</description>

      <title>A Kalman Filter for track reconstruction in very large time projection chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a Kalman Filter tailored for homogeneous gas Time Projection Chambers (TPCs), adapted from the algorithm utilized by the ALICE experiment. In order to describe semi-circular paths in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field, we introduce a novel mirror rotation technique into the Kalman Filter algorithm, enabling effective tracking of trajectories of varying lengths, including those with multiple circular paths within the detector, also known as "loopers". Demonstrated relative improvements of up to 80% in electron momentum resolution and up to 50% in muon and pion momentum resolution underscore the significance of this enhancement. Significant improvements in the reconstruction efficiency for relatively short low momentum "looper" tracks are also shown. Such advancements hold promise not only for the future of the ALICE TPC but also for neutrino high-pressure gas TPCs, where loopers become significant owing to the randomness of production points and their relatively low energies in neutrino interactions. In particular, an improvement in low energy electron reconstruction, for which the production of "looping" tracks is likely and the impact of the new algorithm is directly demonstrated, could significantly impact the quality of flux determination, which in accelerator neutrino experiments relies on the measurement of $\nu_e$ electron scatterings.</description>

Abstract: In this work a set of simulations that aim at the optimization of gaseous detectors for applications in X-ray fluorescence imaging in the energy range of 3 -- 30keV is presented. By studying the statistical distribution of the radiation interactions with gases, the energy resolution limits after charge multiplication for 6keV X-ray photons in Ar/CO$_2$(70/30) and Kr/CO$_2$(90/10) were calculated, obtaining energy resolutions of 15.4(4)% and 14.6(2)% respectively. The detector design was also studied to reduce the presence of escape peaks and complement a model to evaluate the inevitable X-ray fluorescence of copper generated by the conductive materials inside the detector.</description>

      <title>Unveiling secondary particle generation in a SONTRAC detector through GEANT4 simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SOlar Neutron TRACking (SONTRAC) is a detector concept based on a bundle of plastic scintillators by aiming at tracking the solar neutrons through the generation of the secondary particles such as protons from the (n, np) and (n, p) processes. In this study, in addition to the particle population, the energy spectra of the secondary particles including protons, gamma rays, electrons, alphas, and ions that are produced either due to the interaction between the fast neutrons and a SONTRAC detector or through the interplay between the secondary particles and the detector components are determined by means of GEANT4 simulations. The detector geometry in the present study consists of 34$\times$34 Kuraray Y11-200(M) fibers, and the current fiber bundle is irradiated with a planar vertical neutron beam of 0.2$\times$0.2 cm$^{2}$ by using an energy list composed of 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 MeV where the number of incident neutrons is $10^5$. First, It is revealed that a non-negligible number of secondary protons are generated by the fast neutron bombardment; however, the population of these secondary protons is still low compared to the incident beam, i.e. in the order of $10^3$. Secondly, it is also observed that the energy spectrum of secondary protons exhibits a decreasing trend that is limited by the kinetic energy of incident neutrons. Additionally, the range of the secondary protons along with the deposited energy is computed, and it is demonstrated that a significant portion of the generated protons lose their entire energy and stop within the present SONTRAC detector. Finally, a 34$\times$34 pixel grid detector is introduced on each side of the fiber bundle to collect the optical photons produced from the energy deposition in the scintillation fibers, and the trajectory of the secondary protons on the pixel grid is shown by using a fast neutron beam of 100 MeV.</description>

      <title>Effect of hydrogen on albedo neutrons in lunar surface: A computational investigation by means of GEANT4 simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the interaction of the cosmic ray protons with the lunar surface in the absence and presence of hydrogen, a series of GEANT4 simulations are employed in the current study to unveil the influence of hydrogen on the energy spectrum of the albedo neutrons that escape from the lunar surface. Initially, a discrete 69-bin proton energy spectrum between 0.4 and 115 GeV based on the PAMELA spectrometer is implemented into GEANT4. Subsequently, a single-volume lunar surface of 2-m thickness is constructed where it is assumed that a single layer of either 1.6 or 1.93 g/cm$^{3}$ constitutes the lunar regolith. The material composition in the present study includes 43.7 wt.$\%$ oxygen, 0.3 wt.$\%$ sodium, 5.6 wt.$\%$ magnesium, 9 wt.$\%$ aluminum, 21.1 wt.$\%$ silicon, 8.5 wt.$\%$ calcium, 1.5 wt.$\%$ titanium, 0.1 wt.$\%$ manganese, and 10.2 wt.$\%$ iron in accordance with another study. Then, 0.1 wt.$\%$ hydrogen is introduced by replacing oxygen in order to assess the impact of hydrogen on the secondary neutrons. In the wake of irradiating a lunar surface of 3$\times$2$\times$3 m$^{3}$ with a planar vertical PAMELA proton beam of 20$\times$20 cm$^{2}$, the depth profile of the generated neutrons as well as the corresponding initial energy spectrum is primarily obtained in the absence and presence of 0.1 wt.$\%$ hydrogen by voxelizing the entire geometry with 100 cells of 2-cm thickness. Next, a surface detector is placed at the top of the lunar surface in order to collect the albedo neutrons in both cases, and the energy spectra of the albedo neutrons are acquired in terms of thermal, epithermal, and fast neutrons. From the GEANT4 simulations in this study, it is shown that the presence of 0.1 wt.$\%$ hydrogen is observable in each energy regime of the albedo neutrons at the lunar surface, thereby providing an indication about the elemental variation of the lunar soil.</description>

Abstract: The DArk Matter In CCDs at Modane (DAMIC-M) experiment is designed to search for light dark matter (m$_{\chi}$&lt;10\,GeV/c$^2$) at the Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane (LSM) in France. DAMIC-M will use skipper charge-coupled devices (CCDs) as a kg-scale active detector target. Its single-electron resolution will enable eV-scale energy thresholds and thus world-leading sensitivity to a range of hidden sector dark matter candidates. A DAMIC-M prototype, the Low Background Chamber (LBC), has been taking data at LSM since 2022. The LBC provides a low-background environment, which has been used to characterize skipper CCDs, study dark current, and measure radiopurity of materials planned for DAMIC-M. It also allows testing of various subsystems like readout electronics, data acquisition software, and slow control. This paper describes the technical design and performance of the LBC.</description>

      <title>Constraining non-unitary neutrino mixing using matter effects in atmospheric neutrinos at INO-ICAL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mass-induced neutrino oscillation is a well established phenomenon that is based on the unitary mixing among three light active neutrinos. Remarkable precision on neutrino mixing parameters over the last decade or so has opened up the prospects for testing the possible non-unitarity of the standard 3$\nu$ mixing matrix, which may arise in the seesaw extensions of the Standard Model due to the admixture of three light active neutrinos with heavy isosinglet neutrinos. Because of this non-unitary neutrino mixing (NUNM), the oscillation probabilities among the three active neutrinos would be altered as compared to the probabilities obtained assuming a unitary 3$\nu$ mixing matrix. In such a NUNM scenario, neutrinos can experience an additional matter effect due to the neutral current interactions with the ambient neutrons. Atmospheric neutrinos having access to a wide range of energies and baselines can experience a significant modifications in Earth's matter effect due to NUNM. In this paper, we study in detail how the NUNM parameter $\alpha_{32}$ affects the muon neutrino and antineutrino survival probabilities in a different way. Then, we place a comparable and complementary constraint on $\alpha_{32}$ in a model independent fashion using the proposed 50 kt magnetized Iron Calorimeter (ICAL) detector under the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) project, which can efficiently detect the atmospheric $\nu_\mu$ and $\bar\nu_\mu$ separately in the multi-GeV energy range. Further, we discuss the advantage of charge identification capability of ICAL and the impact of uncertainties in oscillation parameters while constraining $\alpha_{32}$. We also compare the $\alpha_{32}$ sensitivity of ICAL with that of future long-baseline experiments DUNE and T2HK in isolation and combination.</description>

      <title>Data Reduction for Low Energy Nuclear Physics Experiments Using Data Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low energy nuclear physics experiments are transitioning towards fully digital data acquisition systems. Realizing the gains in flexibility afforded by these systems relies on equally flexible data reduction techniques. In this paper, methods utilizing data frames and in-memory techniques to work with data, including data from self-triggering, digital data acquisition systems, are discussed within the context of a Python package, \texttt{sauce}. It is shown that data frame operations can encompass common analysis needs and allow interactive data analysis. Two event building techniques, dubbed referenced and referenceless event building, are shown to provide a means to transform raw list mode data into correlated multi-detector events. These techniques are demonstrated in the analysis of two example data sets.</description>

      <title>First results on new helium based eco-gas mixtures for the Extreme Energy Events Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Extreme Energy Events (EEE) Project, a joint project of the Centro Fermi (Museo Storico della Fisica e Centro Studi e Ricerche "E.Fermi") and INFN, has a dual purpose: a scientific research program on cosmic rays at ground level and an intense outreach and educational program. The project consists in a network of about 60 tracking detectors, called telescopes, mostly hosted in Italian High Schools. Each telescope is made by three Multigap Resistive Plate Chambers, operated so far with a gas mixture composed by 98% C$_2$H$_2$F$_4$ and 2% SF$_6$. Due to its high Global Warming Potential, a few years ago the EEE collaboration has started an extensive R&amp;D on alternative mixtures environmentally sustainable and compatible with the current experimental setup and operational environment. Among other gas mixtures, the one with helium and hydrofluoroolefin R1234ze gave the best result during the preliminary tests performed with two of the network telescopes. The detector has proved to reach performance levels comparable to those obtained with previous mixtures, without any modification of the hardware. We will discuss the first results obtained with the new mixture, tested with different percentages of the two components.</description>
