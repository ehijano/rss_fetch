      <title>Inter-event time statistics of earthquakes as a gauge of volcano activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The probability distribution of inter-event time (IET) between two consecutive earthquakes is a measure for the uncertainty in the occurrence time of earthquakes in a region of interest. It is well known that the IET distribution for regular earthquakes is commonly characterized by a power law with the exponent of 0.3. However, less is known about other classes of earthquakes, such as volcanic earthquakes, which do not manifest mainshock-aftershocks sequences. Since volcanic earthquakes are caused by the movement of magmas, their IET distribution may be closely related to the volcanic activities and therefore of particular interest. Nevertheless, the general form of IET distribution for volcanic earthquakes and its dependence on volcanic activity are still unknown. Here we show that the power-law exponent characterizing the IET distribution exhibits a few common values depending on the stage of volcanic activity. Volcanoes with steady seismicity exhibit the lowest exponent ranging from 0.6 to 0.7. During the burst period, when the earthquake rate is highest, the exponent reaches its peak at approximately 1.3. In the preburst phase, the exponent takes on the intermediate value of 1.0. These values are common to several different volcanoes. Since the preburst phase is characterized by the distinct exponent value, it may serve as an indicator of imminent volcanic activity that is accompanied by a surge in seismic events.</description>

      <title>Supershear-subshear-supershear rupture associated with the 2025 Mandalay Earthquake in Myanmar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the complex rupture dynamics of the 2025 Mandalay Earthquake (Mw 7.7), which occurred along the Sagaing Fault in Myanmar on March 28, 2025, at 06:20 UTC. The earthquake involved a near-vertical strike-slip rupture of approximately 400 km, with 2 to 6 meters of shallow slip. A unique video recording of surface rupture, captured 124 km south of the epicenter, provided crucial near-fault data that would have otherwise been unavailable.
  Analysis of the video and other data revealed that the rupture initially propagated at supershear velocities ($\sim6$ km/s) near the hypocenter. However, the video indicates a deceleration to subshear speeds ($\sim3$ km/s) before reaching the camera location. This deceleration is supported by observed fault-normal acceleration patterns. Satellite imagery further indicated a local minimum in slip (2--3 m) around 50 km south of the epicenter, suggesting a region of reduced stress drop, which likely caused the temporary deceleration. Beyond this point, the rupture appears to have re-established supershear propagation. This research underscores the value of direct video observations for understanding complex earthquake rupture processes.</description>

      <title>Enhancing semi-resolved CFD-DEM for dilute to dense particle-fluid systems: A point cloud based, two-step mapping strategy via coarse graining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method (CFD-DEM) coupling is an efficient and powerful tool to simulate particle-fluid systems. However, current volume-averaged CFD-DEM relying on direct grid-based mapping between the fluid and particle phases can exhibit a strong dependence on the fluid grid resolution, becoming unstable as particles move across fluid grids, and can fail to capture pore fluid pressure effects in very dense granular systems. Here we propose a two-step mapping CFD-DEM which uses a point-based coarse graining technique for intermediate smoothing to overcome these limitations. The discrete particles are first converted into smooth, coarse-grained continuum fields via a multi-layer Fibonacci point cloud, independent of the fluid grids. Then, accurate coupling is achieved between the coarse-grained, point cloud fields and the fluid grid-based variables. The algorithm is validated in various configurations, including weight allocation of a static particle on one-dimensional grids and a falling particle on two-dimensional grids, sedimentation of a sphere in a viscous fluid, size-bidisperse fluidized beds, Ergun's pressure drop test, and immersed granular column collapse. The proposed CFD-DEM represents a novel strategy to accurately simulate fluid-particle interactions for a wide range of grid-to-particle size ratios and solid concentrations, which is of potential use in many industrial and geophysical applications.</description>

      <title>Universal path decomposition of transfer and scattering matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04822v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a universal identity: any entry of a one-dimensional transfer or scattering matrix comprising N layers equals a coherent sum of 2**(N-1) directed paths representing wave patterns with pre-defined amplitude and phase evolutions. Treating those paths as analytic building blocks, we derive closed-form results for arbitrary stratified media - optical, acoustic, elastic, or electronic - without resorting to matrix products or recursion. The combinatorial construction of paths turns layered system design into rule-based path engineering, illustrated with a design example that offers a reinterpretation of the quarter-wavelength principle. We also quantify the computational speed-up of the path method over classical transfer-matrix chaining and showcase two more cross-disciplinary applications (site-response seismology and quantum superlattices). This paradigm replaces numerical sweeps that employ the transfer matrix method with physically-transparent path-construction rules; its applicability spans across physical disciplines and scales: from nanometer optical coatings to kilometer-scale seismic strata.</description>

      <title>TS-PIELM: Time-Stepping Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machine Facilitates Soil Consolidation Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accuracy and efficiency of the conventional physics-informed neural network (PINN) need to be improved before it can be a competitive alternative for soil consolidation analyses. This paper aims to overcome these limitations by proposing a highly accurate and efficient physics-informed machine learning (PIML) approach, termed time-stepping physics-informed extreme learning machine (TS-PIELM). In the TS-PIELM framework the consolidation process is divided into numerous time intervals, which helps overcome the limitation of PIELM in solving differential equations with sharp gradients. To accelerate network training, the solution is approximated by a single-layer feedforward extreme learning machine (ELM), rather than using a fully connected neural network in PINN. The input layer weights of the ELM network are generated randomly and fixed during the training process. Subsequently, the output layer weights are directly computed by solving a system of linear equations, which significantly enhances the training efficiency compared to the time-consuming gradient descent method in PINN. Finally, the superior performance of TS-PIELM is demonstrated by solving three typical Terzaghi consolidation problems. Compared to PINN, results show that the computational efficiency and accuracy of the novel TS-PIELM framework are improved by more than 1000 times and 100 times for one-dimensional cases, respectively. This paper provides compelling evidence that PIML can be a powerful tool for computational geotechnics.</description>

      <title>The QTF-Backbone: Proposal for a Nationwide Optical Fibre Backbone in Germany for Quantum Technology and Time and Frequency Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent breakthroughs in the distribution of quantum information and high-precision time and frequency (T&amp;F) signals over long-haul optical fibre networks have transformative potential for physically secure communications, resilience of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and fundamental physics. However, so far these capabilities remain confined to isolated testbeds, with quantum and T&amp;F signals accessible, for example in Germany, to only a few institutions.
  We propose the QTF-Backbone: a dedicated national fibre-optic infrastructure in Germany for the networked distribution of quantum and T&amp;F signals using dark fibres and specialized hardware. The QTF-Backbone is planned as a four-phase deployment over ten years to ensure scalable, sustainable access for research institutions and industry. The concept builds on successful demonstrations of high-TRL time and frequency distribution across Europe, including PTB-MPQ links in Germany, REFIMEVE in France, and the Italian LIFT network. The QTF-Backbone will enable transformative R&amp;D, support a nationwide QTF ecosystem, and ensure the transition from innovation to deployment. As a national and European hub, it will position Germany and Europe at the forefront of quantum networking, as well as time and frequency transfer.</description>
