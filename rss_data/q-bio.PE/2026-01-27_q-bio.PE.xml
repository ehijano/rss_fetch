      <title>How Information Evolves: Stability-Driven Assembly and the Emergence of a Natural Genetic Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information can evolve as a physical consequence of non-equilibrium dynamics, even in the absence of genes, replication, or predefined fitness functions. We present Stability-Driven Assembly (SDA), a framework in which stochastic assembly combined with differential persistence biases populations toward longer-lived motifs. Assemblies that persist longer become more frequent and are therefore more likely to participate in subsequent interactions, generating feedback that reshapes the population distribution and implements fitness-proportional sampling, realizing evolution as a natural, emergent genetic algorithm (SDA/GA) driven solely by stability. We apply SDA/GA to chemical symbol space using SMILES fragments with recombination, mutation, and a heuristic stability function. Simulations show hallmark features of evolutionary search, including scaffold-level dominance, sustained novelty, and entropy reduction, yielding open-ended dynamics absent from equilibrium models with fixed transition rates. These results motivate an evolutionary ladder hypothesis where persistence-driven selection precedes genetic replication.</description>

      <title>$\beta$-diversity and Graph Sheaf Laplacians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest a new approach to $\beta$-diversity in ecological systems, based on the energy of the graph sheaf Laplacian associated with the sample data. This scalar quantity is easily computable using methods of linear algebra. We show using simple examples that the energy is much more informative than the generally accepted definitions of $\beta$-diversity</description>

      <title>Travelling Waves in Wolbachia Spread Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wolbachia, a maternally transmitted endosymbiont, offers a powerful biological control strategy for mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue, Zika, and malaria. We develop an integro-difference equation (IDE) model that integrates Wolbachia's nonlinear growth with spatially explicit mosquito dispersal kernels to study invasion dynamics in heterogeneous landscapes. Analytical results establish the existence and uniqueness of monotone traveling waves and provide explicit estimates of invasion speeds as functions of dispersal and growth parameters. Four kernels: Gaussian, Laplace, exponential square-root, and Cauchy, represent a continuum from short- to long-range movement. Fat-tailed kernels generate faster, broader wavefronts, while compact ones limit spread. We also identify a critical bubble, the minimal localized profile required for sustained invasion. Numerical simulations in one- and two-dimensional domains confirm theoretical predictions and reveal parameter regimes governing invasion success. This framework quantifies how dispersal mechanisms shape Wolbachia's spread, thus informing targeted and efficient vector-control strategies.</description>

      <title>Tracking dynamics of superspreading through contacts, exposures, and transmissions in edge-based network epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infectious disease superspreading caused by heterogeneity in contact behavior has been observed to be an important determinant of epidemic dynamics and size in both empirical and theoretical settings. However, it has also been observed that the importance of this type of superspreading changes throughout an epidemic, generally in a decreasing manner as infections cascade from individuals with many contacts to those with fewer contacts. We provide an exact mathematical formulation of this phenomenon in strongly-immunizing (SIR) epidemics on static contact networks. Building on the edge-based modeling framework, we construct three metrics to track how superspreading changes through the course of an epidemic, respectively measuring infected nodes' contacts, exposures, and transmissions: (1) the mean degree of infected nodes, (2) the mean number of susceptible neighbors of infected nodes, and (3) the mean number of secondary cases that will be caused by newly infected nodes. We prove results about the behaviors of these metrics, highlighting the fact that their peak times all occur at less than half the time it takes for population-level infection prevalence to peak. This suggests that the importance of superspreading will be low when an epidemic is already near its peak, so contact-based control strategies are best employed as early in an outbreak as possible. We discuss implications for accurately measuring epidemiological parameters from incidence, mobility, contact tracing, and transmission data.</description>

      <title>A model for a population of trees structured by phenological traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of global warming, tree populations rely on two primary mechanisms of adaptation: phenotypic plasticity, which enables individuals to adjust their behavior in response to environmental stress, and genetic evolution, driven by natural selection and genetic diversity within the population. Understanding the interplay between these mechanisms is crucial for assessing the impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems and for informing sustainable management strategies. In this manuscript, we focus on a specific phenological adaptation: the ability of trees to enter summer dormancy once a critical temperature threshold is exceeded. Individuals are characterized by this threshold temperature and by their seed production capacity. We first establish a detailed mathematical model describing the population dynamics under these traits, and progressively reduce it to a system of two coupled ordinary differential equations. This simpler macroscopic model is then analyzed numerically, to investigate how the population reacts to a shift in its environment: an temperature increase, a drop in precipitation levels, or a combination of the two. Our results highlight contrasting effects of water stress and temperature stress on population dynamics, as well as the ambivalent effect of the plasticity.</description>

      <title>Chemotaxis-inspired PDE models of airborne infectious disease transmission: epidemiologically-motivated mathematical and numerical analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE) models for infectious diseases, while less common than their ordinary differential equation (ODE) counterparts, have found successful applications for many years. Such models are typically of reaction-diffusion type, and model spatial propagation as a diffusive process. However, given the complex nature of human mobility, such models are limited in their ability to describe airborne infectious diseases in human populations. Recent work has advocated for the inclusion of an additional chemotaxis-type term as an alternative; spatial propagation of infection fronts is assumed additionally to flow from low-to-high concentrations of susceptible populations. The present work extends the study of such models by providing an epidemiologically interpretable analysis, directly connecting model behavior to information readily available to policymakers. In particular, we derive a spatially-aware basic reproduction number, which accounts for spatial heterogeneity in population density. Furthermore, we discuss several important aspects concerning the numerical solution of the model, including the introduction of a stabilization scheme. Finally, we perform a series of simulation studies in the Italian region of Lombardy (severely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020) and in the US state of Georgia, in which we demonstrate the model's potential to better capture important spatiotemporal dynamics observed in real-world data compared to pure reaction-diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Global population crisis scenarios predicted by the most general dynamic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19063v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a simple nonlinear differential equation (originally studied in the physics of disordered systems) is able to mathematically describe the global population growth over the past 12000 years. Different regimes of population growth since the early Neolithic until today are shown to be all solutions to the same nonlinear differential equation in its various limits. These also include the well-known Malthus (exponential) and Verhulst (logistic) growth regimes, as well as von Foerster's ``doomsday'' formula. All these limits correspond to neglecting higher-order terms in a more general nonlinear dynamic model described by the proposed nonlinear differential equation. While the older models may provide valid fittings to limited time intervals in the global population growth curve in time, their clearly approximate nature prevents them from being predictive over longer periods of time. The proposed comprehensive solution of the proposed model is instead well suited to provide predictions for future scenarios. These include halving of the global population as early as 2064 due to resource depletion, if the effect of the Earth's limited carrying capacity were to set in today.</description>

      <title>A height-based metaconcept for rooted tree balance and its implications for the $B_1$ index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tree balance has received considerable attention in recent years, both in phylogenetics and in other areas. Numerous (im)balance indices have been proposed to quantify the (im)balance of rooted trees. A recent comprehensive survey summarized this literature and showed that many existing indices are based on similar underlying principles. To unify these approaches, three general metaconcepts were introduced, providing a framework to classify, analyze, and extend imbalance indices. In this context, a metaconcept is a function $\Phi_f$ that depends on another function $f$ capturing some aspect of tree shape. In this manuscript, we extend this line of research by introducing a new metaconcept based on the heights of the pending subtrees of all inner vertices. We provide a thorough analysis of this metaconcept and use it to answer open questions concerning the well-known $B_1$ balance index. In particular, we characterize the tree shapes that maximize the $B_1$ index in two cases: (i) arbitrary rooted trees and (ii) binary rooted trees. For both cases, we also determine the corresponding maximum values of the index.
  Finally, while the $B_1$ index is induced by a so-called third-order metaconcept, we explicitly introduce three new (im)balance indices derived from the first- and second-order height metaconcepts, respectively, thereby demonstrating that pending subtree heights give rise to a variety of novel (im)balance indices.</description>

      <title>Crossing the Functional Desert: Cascade-Driven Assembly and Feasibility Transitions in Early Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06272v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of life poses a problem of combinatorial feasibility: How can temporally supported functional organization arise in exponentially branching assembly spaces when unguided exploration behaves as a memoryless random walk? We show that nonlinear threshold-cascade dynamics in connected interaction networks provide a minimal, substrate-agnostic mechanism that can soften this obstruction. Below a critical connectivity threshold, cascades die out locally and structured input-output response mappings remain sparse and transient-a "functional desert" in which accumulation is dynamically unsupported. Near the critical percolation threshold, system-spanning cascades emerge, enabling discriminative functional responses. We illustrate this transition using a minimal toy model and generalize the argument to arbitrary networked systems. Also near criticality, cascades introduce finite-timescale structural and functional coherence, directional bias, and weak dynamical path-dependence into otherwise memoryless exploration, allowing biased accumulation. This connectivity-driven transition-functional percolation-requires only generic ingredients: interacting units, nonlinear thresholds, influence transmission, and non-zero coherence times. The mechanism does not explain specific biochemical pathways, but it identifies a necessary dynamical regime in which structured functional organization can emerge and be temporarily supported, providing a physical foundation for how combinatorial feasibility barriers can be crossed through network dynamics alone.</description>
