      <title>Impact of Atomic Substitution on Core-Hole Relaxation Dynamics: A Study of Br$_2$ and IBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding inner-shell decay processes in heavy-element molecules is essential for unraveling x-ray-induced photodynamics and advancing molecular imaging techniques. In this study, we investigate the influence of atomic substitution on core-hole relaxation dynamics and molecular fragmentation in Br2 and IBr, initiated by x-ray absorption at the Br K-edge. Using a combination of X-ray/ion coincidence measurements and Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulations, we track charge distribution and the kinetic energy release (KER) of fragment ions with a total charge from 2+ to 8+. For both molecules, the simulated KER values show good agreement with experiment across different fragmentation channels. Our comparison reveals that substituting Br with the heavier I atom in IBr has minimal impact on the inner-shell electronic decay process, but significantly influences nuclear motion, leading to slower dissociation, thereby a KER close to the Coulomb limit, an effect attributed to the atomic mass. These findings highlight the interplay between electronic and nuclear effects in molecular fragmentation, particularly in heavy-element species, and provide new insights into medical therapies, structural biology, and astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Observation of Self-Bound Droplets of Ultracold Dipolar Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultracold gases of dipolar molecules have long been envisioned as a platform for the realization of novel quantum phases. Recent advances in collisional shielding, protecting molecules from inelastic losses, have enabled the creation of degenerate Fermi gases and, more recently, Bose-Einstein condensation of dipolar molecules. However, the observation of quantum phases in ultracold molecular gases that are driven by dipole-dipole interactions has so far remained elusive. In this work, we report the formation of self-bound droplets and droplet arrays in an ultracold gas of strongly dipolar sodium-cesium molecules. Starting from a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), microwave dressing fields are used to induce dipole-dipole interactions with controllable strength and anisotropy. By varying the speed at which interactions are induced, covering a dynamic range of four orders of magnitude, we prepare droplets under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions, observing a transition from robust one-dimensional (1D) arrays to fluctuating two-dimensional (2D) structures. The droplets exhibit densities up to 100 times higher than the initial BEC, reaching the strongly interacting regime, and suggesting the possibility of a quantum-liquid or crystalline state. This work establishes ultracold molecules as a system for the exploration of strongly dipolar quantum matter and opens the door to the realization of self-organized crystal phases and dipolar spin liquids in optical lattices.</description>
