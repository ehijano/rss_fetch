      <title>Semantic Ranking for Automated Adversarial Technique Annotation in Security Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new method for extracting structured threat behaviors from threat intelligence text. Our method is based on a multi-stage ranking architecture that allows jointly optimizing for efficiency and effectiveness. Therefore, we believe this problem formulation better aligns with the real-world nature of the task considering the large number of adversary techniques and the extensive body of threat intelligence created by security analysts. Our findings show that the proposed system yields state-of-the-art performance results for this task. Results show that our method has a top-3 recall performance of 81\% in identifying the relevant technique among 193 top-level techniques. Our tests also demonstrate that our system performs significantly better (+40\%) than the widely used large language models when tested under a zero-shot setting.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Blockchain technology has drawn growing attention in the literature and in practice. Blockchain technology generates considerable amounts of data and has thus been a topic of interest for Machine Learning (ML).
  Objective: The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the state of the art on machine learning applied to blockchain data. This work aims to systematically identify, analyze, and classify the literature on ML applied to blockchain data. This will allow us to discover the fields where more effort should be placed in future research.
  Method: A systematic mapping study has been conducted to identify the relevant literature. Ultimately, 159 articles were selected and classified according to various dimensions, specifically, the domain use case, the blockchain, the data, and the machine learning models.
  Results: The majority of the papers (49.7%) fall within the Anomaly use case. Bitcoin (47.2%) was the blockchain that drew the most attention. A dataset consisting of more than 1.000.000 data points was used by 31.4% of the papers. And Classification (46.5%) was the ML task most applied to blockchain data.
  Conclusion: The results confirm that ML applied to blockchain data is a relevant and a growing topic of interest both in the literature and in practice. Nevertheless, some open challenges and gaps remain, which can lead to future research directions. Specifically, we identify novel machine learning algorithms, the lack of a standardization framework, blockchain scalability issues and cross-chain interactions as areas worth exploring in the future.</description>

      <title>CYGENT: A cybersecurity conversational agent with log summarization powered by GPT-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to the escalating cyber-attacks in the modern IT and IoT landscape, we developed CYGENT, a conversational agent framework powered by GPT-3.5 turbo model, designed to aid system administrators in ensuring optimal performance and uninterrupted resource availability. This study focuses on fine-tuning GPT-3 models for cybersecurity tasks, including conversational AI and generative AI tailored specifically for cybersecurity operations. CYGENT assists users by providing cybersecurity information, analyzing and summarizing uploaded log files, detecting specific events, and delivering essential instructions. The conversational agent was developed based on the GPT-3.5 turbo model. We fine-tuned and validated summarizer models (GPT3) using manually generated data points. Using this approach, we achieved a BERTscore of over 97%, indicating GPT-3's enhanced capability in summarizing log files into human-readable formats and providing necessary information to users. Furthermore, we conducted a comparative analysis of GPT-3 models with other Large Language Models (LLMs), including CodeT5-small, CodeT5-base, and CodeT5-base-multi-sum, with the objective of analyzing log analysis techniques. Our analysis consistently demonstrated that Davinci (GPT-3) model outperformed all other LLMs, showcasing higher performance. These findings are crucial for improving human comprehension of logs, particularly in light of the increasing numbers of IoT devices. Additionally, our research suggests that the CodeT5-base-multi-sum model exhibits comparable performance to Davinci to some extent in summarizing logs, indicating its potential as an offline model for this task.</description>

      <title>Hawk: Accurate and Fast Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning Using Secure Lookup Table Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training machine learning models on data from multiple entities without direct data sharing can unlock applications otherwise hindered by business, legal, or ethical constraints. In this work, we design and implement new privacy-preserving machine learning protocols for logistic regression and neural network models. We adopt a two-server model where data owners secret-share their data between two servers that train and evaluate the model on the joint data. A significant source of inefficiency and inaccuracy in existing methods arises from using Yao's garbled circuits to compute non-linear activation functions. We propose new methods for computing non-linear functions based on secret-shared lookup tables, offering both computational efficiency and improved accuracy.
  Beyond introducing leakage-free techniques, we initiate the exploration of relaxed security measures for privacy-preserving machine learning. Instead of claiming that the servers gain no knowledge during the computation, we contend that while some information is revealed about access patterns to lookup tables, it maintains epsilon-dX-privacy. Leveraging this relaxation significantly reduces the computational resources needed for training. We present new cryptographic protocols tailored to this relaxed security paradigm and define and analyze the leakage. Our evaluations show that our logistic regression protocol is up to 9x faster, and the neural network training is up to 688x faster than SecureML. Notably, our neural network achieves an accuracy of 96.6% on MNIST in 15 epochs, outperforming prior benchmarks that capped at 93.4% using the same architecture.</description>

      <title>Two Birds with One Stone: Differential Privacy by Low-power SRAM Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The software-based implementation of differential privacy mechanisms has been shown to be neither friendly for lightweight devices nor secure against side-channel attacks. In this work, we aim to develop a hardware-based technique to achieve differential privacy by design. In contrary to the conventional software-based noise generation and injection process, our design realizes local differential privacy (LDP) by harnessing the inherent hardware noise into controlled LDP noise when data is stored in the memory. Specifically, the noise is tamed through a novel memory design and power downscaling technique, which leads to double-faceted gains in privacy and power efficiency. A well-round study that consists of theoretical design and analysis and chip implementation and experiments is presented. The results confirm that the developed technique is differentially private, saves 88.58% system power, speeds up software-based DP mechanisms by more than 10^6 times, while only incurring 2.46% chip overhead and 7.81% estimation errors in data recovery.</description>

      <title>Don't Listen To Me: Understanding and Exploring Jailbreak Prompts of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in generative AI have enabled ubiquitous access to large language models (LLMs). Empowered by their exceptional capabilities to understand and generate human-like text, these models are being increasingly integrated into our society. At the same time, there are also concerns on the potential misuse of this powerful technology, prompting defensive measures from service providers. To overcome such protection, jailbreaking prompts have recently emerged as one of the most effective mechanisms to circumvent security restrictions and elicit harmful content originally designed to be prohibited.
  Due to the rapid development of LLMs and their ease of access via natural languages, the frontline of jailbreak prompts is largely seen in online forums and among hobbyists. To gain a better understanding of the threat landscape of semantically meaningful jailbreak prompts, we systemized existing prompts and measured their jailbreak effectiveness empirically. Further, we conducted a user study involving 92 participants with diverse backgrounds to unveil the process of manually creating jailbreak prompts. We observed that users often succeeded in jailbreak prompts generation regardless of their expertise in LLMs. Building on the insights from the user study, we also developed a system using AI as the assistant to automate the process of jailbreak prompt generation.</description>

      <title>The Privacy Policy Permission Model: A Unified View of Privacy Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organizations use privacy policies to communicate their data collection practices to their clients. A privacy policy is a set of statements that specifies how an organization gathers, uses, discloses, and maintains a client's data. However, most privacy policies lack a clear, complete explanation of how data providers' information is used. We propose a modeling methodology, called the Privacy Policy Permission Model (PPPM), that provides a uniform, easy-to-understand representation of privacy policies, which can accurately and clearly show how data is used within an organization's practice. Using this methodology, a privacy policy is captured as a diagram. The diagram is capable of highlighting inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the privacy policy. The methodology supports privacy officers in properly and clearly articulating an organization's privacy policy.</description>

      <title>Expectations Versus Reality: Evaluating Intrusion Detection Systems in Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our paper provides empirical comparisons between recent IDSs to provide an objective comparison between them to help users choose the most appropriate solution based on their requirements. Our results show that no one solution is the best, but is dependent on external variables such as the types of attacks, complexity, and network environment in the dataset. For example, BoT_IoT and Stratosphere IoT datasets both capture IoT-related attacks, but the deep neural network performed the best when tested using the BoT_IoT dataset while HELAD performed the best when tested using the Stratosphere IoT dataset. So although we found that a deep neural network solution had the highest average F1 scores on tested datasets, it is not always the best-performing one. We further discuss difficulties in using IDS from literature and project repositories, which complicated drawing definitive conclusions regarding IDS selection.</description>

      <title>FaultGuard: A Generative Approach to Resilient Fault Prediction in Smart Electrical Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting and classifying faults in electricity networks is crucial for uninterrupted provision and keeping maintenance costs at a minimum. Thanks to the advancements in the field provided by the smart grid, several data-driven approaches have been proposed in the literature to tackle fault prediction tasks. Implementing these systems brought several improvements, such as optimal energy consumption and quick restoration. Thus, they have become an essential component of the smart grid. However, the robustness and security of these systems against adversarial attacks have not yet been extensively investigated. These attacks can impair the whole grid and cause additional damage to the infrastructure, deceiving fault detection systems and disrupting restoration. In this paper, we present FaultGuard, the first framework for fault type and zone classification resilient to adversarial attacks. To ensure the security of our system, we employ an Anomaly Detection System (ADS) leveraging a novel Generative Adversarial Network training layer to identify attacks. Furthermore, we propose a low-complexity fault prediction model and an online adversarial training technique to enhance robustness. We comprehensively evaluate the framework's performance against various adversarial attacks using the IEEE13-AdvAttack dataset, which constitutes the state-of-the-art for resilient fault prediction benchmarking. Our model outclasses the state-of-the-art even without considering adversaries, with an accuracy of up to 0.958. Furthermore, our ADS shows attack detection capabilities with an accuracy of up to 1.000. Finally, we demonstrate how our novel training layers drastically increase performances across the whole framework, with a mean increase of 154% in ADS accuracy and 118% in model accuracy.</description>

      <title>Provably Secure Disambiguating Neural Linguistic Steganography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research in provably secure neural linguistic steganography has overlooked a crucial aspect: the sender must detokenize stegotexts to avoid raising suspicion from the eavesdropper. The segmentation ambiguity problem, which arises when using language models based on subwords, leads to occasional decoding failures in all neural language steganography implementations based on these models. Current solutions to this issue involve altering the probability distribution of candidate words, rendering them incompatible with provably secure steganography. We propose a novel secure disambiguation method named SyncPool, which effectively addresses the segmentation ambiguity problem. We group all tokens with prefix relationships in the candidate pool before the steganographic embedding algorithm runs to eliminate uncertainty among ambiguous tokens. To enable the receiver to synchronize the sampling process of the sender, a shared cryptographically-secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) is deployed to select a token from the ambiguity pool. SyncPool does not change the size of the candidate pool or the distribution of tokens and thus is applicable to provably secure language steganography methods. We provide theoretical proofs and experimentally demonstrate the applicability of our solution to various languages and models, showing its potential to significantly improve the reliability and security of neural linguistic steganography systems.</description>

      <title>Ransomware: Analysis and Evaluation of Live Forensic Techniques and the Impact on Linux based IoT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ransomware has been predominantly a threat to Windows systems. But, Linux systems became interesting for cybercriminals and this trend is expected to continue. This endangers IoT ecosystems, whereas many IoT systems are based on Linux (e.g. cloud infrastructure and gateways). This paper researches how currently employed forensic techniques can be applied to Linux ransomware and evaluates the maturity as well as the impact on the system. While Windows-based ransomware predominantly uses RSA and AES for key management, a variety of approaches was identified for Linux. Cybercriminals appear to be deliberately moving away from RSA and AES to make Live forensic investigations more difficult. Linux ransomware is developed for a predefined goal and does not exploit the full potential of damage. It appears in an early stage and is expected to reach a similar potential to Windows-based malware. The results generated provided an excellent basic understanding to discuss and assess implications on the IoT industry at an early stage of development.</description>

      <title>Healthcare Data Governance, Privacy, and Security - A Conceptual Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abundance of data has transformed the world in every aspect. It has become the core element in decision making, problem solving, and innovation in almost all areas of life, including business, science, healthcare, education, and many others. Despite all these advances, privacy and security remain critical concerns of the healthcare industry. It is important to note that healthcare data can also be a liability if it is not managed correctly. This data mismanagement can have severe consequences for patients and healthcare organisations, including patient safety, legal liability, damage to reputation, financial loss, and operational inefficiency. Healthcare organisations must comply with a range of regulations to protect patient data. We perform a classification of data governance elements or components in a manner that thoroughly assesses the healthcare data chain from a privacy and security standpoint. After deeply analysing the existing literature, we propose a conceptual privacy and security driven healthcare data governance framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating LLM and reinforcement learning (RL) agent effectively to achieve complementary performance is critical in high stake tasks like cybersecurity operations. In this study, we introduce SecurityBot, a LLM agent mentored by pre-trained RL agents, to support cybersecurity operations. In particularly, the LLM agent is supported with a profile module to generated behavior guidelines, a memory module to accumulate local experiences, a reflection module to re-evaluate choices, and an action module to reduce action space. Additionally, it adopts the collaboration mechanism to take suggestions from pre-trained RL agents, including a cursor for dynamic suggestion taken, an aggregator for multiple mentors' suggestions ranking and a caller for proactive suggestion asking. Building on the CybORG experiment framework, our experiences show that SecurityBot demonstrates significant performance improvement compared with LLM or RL standalone, achieving the complementary performance in the cybersecurity games.</description>

      <title>Optimization-based Prompt Injection Attack to LLM-as-a-Judge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge is a novel solution that can assess textual information with large language models (LLMs). Based on existing research studies, LLMs demonstrate remarkable performance in providing a compelling alternative to traditional human assessment. However, the robustness of these systems against prompt injection attacks remains an open question. In this work, we introduce JudgeDeceiver, a novel optimization-based prompt injection attack tailored to LLM-as-a-Judge. Our method formulates a precise optimization objective for attacking the decision-making process of LLM-as-a-Judge and utilizes an optimization algorithm to efficiently automate the generation of adversarial sequences, achieving targeted and effective manipulation of model evaluations. Compared to handcraft prompt injection attacks, our method demonstrates superior efficacy, posing a significant challenge to the current security paradigms of LLM-based judgment systems. Through extensive experiments, we showcase the capability of JudgeDeceiver in altering decision outcomes across various cases, highlighting the vulnerability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems to the optimization-based prompt injection attack.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Gradient Langevin Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ``The right to be forgotten'' ensured by laws for user data privacy becomes increasingly important. Machine unlearning aims to efficiently remove the effect of certain data points on the trained model parameters so that it can be approximately the same as if one retrains the model from scratch. This work proposes stochastic gradient Langevin unlearning, the first unlearning framework based on noisy stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with privacy guarantees for approximate unlearning problems under convexity assumption. Our results show that mini-batch gradient updates provide a superior privacy-complexity trade-off compared to the full-batch counterpart. There are numerous algorithmic benefits of our unlearning approach, including complexity saving compared to retraining, and supporting sequential and batch unlearning. To examine the privacy-utility-complexity trade-off of our method, we conduct experiments on benchmark datasets compared against prior works. Our approach achieves a similar utility under the same privacy constraint while using $2\%$ and $10\%$ of the gradient computations compared with the state-of-the-art gradient-based approximate unlearning methods for mini-batch and full-batch settings, respectively.</description>

Abstract: Textual backdoor attacks pose significant security threats. Current detection approaches, typically relying on intermediate feature representation or reconstructing potential triggers, are task-specific and less effective beyond sentence classification, struggling with tasks like question answering and named entity recognition. We introduce TABDet (Task-Agnostic Backdoor Detector), a pioneering task-agnostic method for backdoor detection. TABDet leverages final layer logits combined with an efficient pooling technique, enabling unified logit representation across three prominent NLP tasks. TABDet can jointly learn from diverse task-specific models, demonstrating superior detection efficacy over traditional task-specific methods.</description>

      <title>LOTUS: Evasive and Resilient Backdoor Attacks through Sub-Partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backdoor attack poses a significant security threat to Deep Learning applications. Existing attacks are often not evasive to established backdoor detection techniques. This susceptibility primarily stems from the fact that these attacks typically leverage a universal trigger pattern or transformation function, such that the trigger can cause misclassification for any input. In response to this, recent papers have introduced attacks using sample-specific invisible triggers crafted through special transformation functions. While these approaches manage to evade detection to some extent, they reveal vulnerability to existing backdoor mitigation techniques. To address and enhance both evasiveness and resilience, we introduce a novel backdoor attack LOTUS. Specifically, it leverages a secret function to separate samples in the victim class into a set of partitions and applies unique triggers to different partitions. Furthermore, LOTUS incorporates an effective trigger focusing mechanism, ensuring only the trigger corresponding to the partition can induce the backdoor behavior. Extensive experimental results show that LOTUS can achieve high attack success rate across 4 datasets and 7 model structures, and effectively evading 13 backdoor detection and mitigation techniques. The code is available at https://github.com/Megum1/LOTUS.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study of the Capabilities of Large Language Models for Vulnerability Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential for code generation and other software engineering tasks. Vulnerability detection is of crucial importance to maintaining the security, integrity, and trustworthiness of software systems. Precise vulnerability detection requires reasoning about the code, making it a good case study for exploring the limits of LLMs' reasoning capabilities. Although recent work has applied LLMs to vulnerability detection using generic prompting techniques, their full capabilities for this task and the types of errors they make when explaining identified vulnerabilities remain unclear.
  In this paper, we surveyed eleven LLMs that are state-of-the-art in code generation and commonly used as coding assistants, and evaluated their capabilities for vulnerability detection. We systematically searched for the best-performing prompts, incorporating techniques such as in-context learning and chain-of-thought, and proposed three of our own prompting methods. Our results show that while our prompting methods improved the models' performance, LLMs generally struggled with vulnerability detection. They reported 0.5-0.63 Balanced Accuracy and failed to distinguish between buggy and fixed versions of programs in 76% of cases on average. By comprehensively analyzing and categorizing 287 instances of model reasoning, we found that 57% of LLM responses contained errors, and the models frequently predicted incorrect locations of buggy code and misidentified bug types. LLMs only correctly localized 6 out of 27 bugs in DbgBench, and these 6 bugs were predicted correctly by 70-100% of human participants. These findings suggest that despite their potential for other tasks, LLMs may fail to properly comprehend critical code structures and security-related concepts. Our data and code are available at https://figshare.com/s/78fe02e56e09ec49300b.</description>

      <title>Measuring Compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act Over Space and Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread sharing of consumers personal information with third parties raises significant privacy concerns. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) mandates that online businesses offer consumers the option to opt out of the sale and sharing of personal information. Our study automatically tracks the presence of the opt-out link longitudinally across multiple states after the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) went into effect. We categorize websites based on whether they are subject to CCPA and investigate cases of potential non-compliance. We find a number of websites that implement the opt-out link early and across all examined states but also find a significant number of CCPA-subject websites that fail to offer any opt-out methods even when CCPA is in effect. Our findings can shed light on how websites are reacting to the CCPA and identify potential gaps in compliance and opt- out method designs that hinder consumers from exercising CCPA opt-out rights.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for moduli space of genus two curves and an application to post-quantum cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use machine learning to study the locus ${\mathcal L}_n$ of genus two curves with $(n, n)$-split Jacobian. More precisely we design a transformer model which given values for the Igusa invariants determines if the corresponding genus two curve is in the locus ${\mathcal L}_n$, for $n=2, 3, 5, 7$. Such curves are important in isogeny based cryptography.
  During this study we discover that there are no rational points ${\mathfrak p} \in {\mathcal L}_n$ with weighted moduli height $\leq 2$ in any of ${\mathcal L}_2$, ${\mathcal L}_3$, and ${\mathcal L}_5$. This extends on previous work of the authors to use machine learning methods to study the moduli space of genus 2 algebraic curves.</description>

      <title>Physical 3D Adversarial Attacks against Monocular Depth Estimation in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based monocular depth estimation (MDE), extensively applied in autonomous driving, is known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Previous physical attacks against MDE models rely on 2D adversarial patches, so they only affect a small, localized region in the MDE map but fail under various viewpoints. To address these limitations, we propose 3D Depth Fool (3D$^2$Fool), the first 3D texture-based adversarial attack against MDE models. 3D$^2$Fool is specifically optimized to generate 3D adversarial textures agnostic to model types of vehicles and to have improved robustness in bad weather conditions, such as rain and fog. Experimental results validate the superior performance of our 3D$^2$Fool across various scenarios, including vehicles, MDE models, weather conditions, and viewpoints. Real-world experiments with printed 3D textures on physical vehicle models further demonstrate that our 3D$^2$Fool can cause an MDE error of over 10 meters.</description>

Abstract: The case of the Zodiac Killer is one of the most widely known unsolved serial killer cases in history. The unidentified killer murdered five known victims and terrorized the state of California. He also communicated extensively with the press and law enforcement. Besides his murders, Zodiac was known for his use of ciphers. The first Zodiac cipher was solved within a week of its publication, while the second cipher was solved by the authors after 51 years, when it was discovered to be a transposition and homophonic substitution cipher with unusual qualities. In this paper, we detail the historical significance of this cipher and the numerous efforts which culminated in its solution.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Dependency Update Practice of NPM, PyPI and Cargo Packages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Keeping dependencies up-to-date prevents software supply chain attacks through outdated and vulnerable dependencies. Developers may use packages' dependency update practice as one of the selection criteria for choosing a package as a dependency. However, the lack of metrics characterizing packages' dependency update practice makes this assessment difficult. To measure the up-to-date characteristics of packages, we focus on the dependency management aspect and propose two update metrics: Time-Out-Of-Date (TOOD) and Post-Fix-Exposure-Time (PFET), to measure the updatedness of dependencies and updatedness of vulnerable dependencies, respectively. We design an algorithm to stabilize the dependency relationships in different time intervals and compute the proposed metrics for each package. Using our proposed metrics, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of update metrics with 2.9M packages, 66.8M package versions, and 26.8M unique package-dependency relations in NPM, PyPI, and Cargo, ranging from the year 2004 to 2023. We analyze the characteristics of the proposed metrics for capturing packages' dependency update practice in the three ecosystems. Given that the TOOD metric generates a greater volume of data than the PFET metric, we further explore the numerical relationship between these metrics to assess their potential as substitutes for vulnerability counts metrics. We find that PyPI packages update dependencies faster than NPM and Cargo. Conversely, Cargo packages update their vulnerable dependencies faster than NPM and PyPI. We also find that the general purpose update metric, TOOD, can be a proxy for the security-focused update metric, PFET.</description>

      <title>How Private is DP-SGD?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a substantial gap between the privacy guarantees of the Adaptive Batch Linear Queries (ABLQ) mechanism under different types of batch sampling: (i) Shuffling, and (ii) Poisson subsampling; the typical analysis of Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) follows by interpreting it as a post-processing of ABLQ. While shuffling based DP-SGD is more commonly used in practical implementations, it is neither analytically nor numerically amenable to easy privacy analysis. On the other hand, Poisson subsampling based DP-SGD is challenging to scalably implement, but has a well-understood privacy analysis, with multiple open-source numerically tight privacy accountants available. This has led to a common practice of using shuffling based DP-SGD in practice, but using the privacy analysis for the corresponding Poisson subsampling version. Our result shows that there can be a substantial gap between the privacy analysis when using the two types of batch sampling, and thus advises caution in reporting privacy parameters for DP-SGD.</description>

      <title>DataCook: Crafting Anti-Adversarial Examples for Healthcare Data Copyright Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of healthcare, the challenges of copyright protection and unauthorized third-party misuse are increasingly significant. Traditional methods for data copyright protection are applied prior to data distribution, implying that models trained on these data become uncontrollable. This paper introduces a novel approach, named DataCook, designed to safeguard the copyright of healthcare data during the deployment phase. DataCook operates by "cooking" the raw data before distribution, enabling the development of models that perform normally on this processed data. However, during the deployment phase, the original test data must be also "cooked" through DataCook to ensure normal model performance. This process grants copyright holders control over authorization during the deployment phase. The mechanism behind DataCook is by crafting anti-adversarial examples (AntiAdv), which are designed to enhance model confidence, as opposed to standard adversarial examples (Adv) that aim to confuse models. Similar to Adv, AntiAdv introduces imperceptible perturbations, ensuring that the data processed by DataCook remains easily understandable. We conducted extensive experiments on MedMNIST datasets, encompassing both 2D/3D data and the high-resolution variants. The outcomes indicate that DataCook effectively meets its objectives, preventing models trained on AntiAdv from analyzing unauthorized data effectively, without compromising the validity and accuracy of the data in legitimate scenarios. Code and data are available at https://github.com/MedMNIST/DataCook.</description>

      <title>Secure Aggregation is Not Private Against Membership Inference Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Secure aggregation (SecAgg) is a commonly-used privacy-enhancing mechanism in federated learning, affording the server access only to the aggregate of model updates while safeguarding the confidentiality of individual updates. Despite widespread claims regarding SecAgg's privacy-preserving capabilities, a formal analysis of its privacy is lacking, making such presumptions unjustified. In this paper, we delve into the privacy implications of SecAgg by treating it as a local differential privacy (LDP) mechanism for each local update. We design a simple attack wherein an adversarial server seeks to discern which update vector a client submitted, out of two possible ones, in a single training round of federated learning under SecAgg. By conducting privacy auditing, we assess the success probability of this attack and quantify the LDP guarantees provided by SecAgg. Our numerical results unveil that, contrary to prevailing claims, SecAgg offers weak privacy against membership inference attacks even in a single training round. Indeed, it is difficult to hide a local update by adding other independent local updates when the updates are of high dimension. Our findings underscore the imperative for additional privacy-enhancing mechanisms, such as noise injection, in federated learning.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Efficacy of Prompt-Engineered Large Multimodal Models Versus Fine-Tuned Vision Transformers in Image-Based Security Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a parallel rise in the development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), such as Gemini-pro, which have begun to transform a variety of applications. These sophisticated multimodal models are designed to interpret and analyze complex data, integrating both textual and visual information on a scale previously unattainable, opening new avenues for a range of applications. This paper investigates the applicability and effectiveness of prompt-engineered Gemini-pro LMMs versus fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) models in addressing critical security challenges. We focus on two distinct tasks: a visually evident task of detecting simple triggers, such as small squares in images, indicative of potential backdoors, and a non-visually evident task of malware classification through visual representations. Our results highlight a significant divergence in performance, with Gemini-pro falling short in accuracy and reliability when compared to fine-tuned ViT models. The ViT models, on the other hand, demonstrate exceptional accuracy, achieving near-perfect performance on both tasks. This study not only showcases the strengths and limitations of prompt-engineered LMMs in cybersecurity applications but also emphasizes the unmatched efficacy of fine-tuned ViT models for precise and dependable tasks.</description>

      <title>Brokenwire : Wireless Disruption of CCS Electric Vehicle Charging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.02104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel attack against the Combined Charging System, one of the most widely used DC rapid charging technologies for electric vehicles (EVs). Our attack, Brokenwire, interrupts necessary control communication between the vehicle and charger, causing charging sessions to abort. The attack requires only temporary physical proximity and can be conducted wirelessly from a distance, allowing individual vehicles or entire fleets to be disrupted stealthily and simultaneously. In addition, it can be mounted with off-the-shelf radio hardware and minimal technical knowledge. By exploiting CSMA/CA behavior, only a very weak signal needs to be induced into the victim to disrupt communication - exceeding the effectiveness of broadband noise jamming by three orders of magnitude. The exploited behavior is a required part of the HomePlug Green PHY, DIN 70121 &amp; ISO 15118 standards and all known implementations exhibit it. We first study the attack in a controlled testbed and then demonstrate it against eight vehicles and 20 chargers in real deployments. We find the attack to be successful in the real world, at ranges up to 47 m, for a power budget of less than 1 W. We further show that the attack can work between the floors of a building (e.g., multi-story parking), through perimeter fences, and from `drive-by' attacks. We present a heuristic model to estimate the number of vehicles that can be attacked simultaneously for a given output power. Brokenwire has immediate implications for a substantial proportion of the around 12 million battery EVs on the roads worldwide - and profound effects on the new wave of electrification for vehicle fleets, both for private enterprise and crucial public services, as well as electric buses, trucks and small ships. As such, we conducted a disclosure to the industry and discussed a range of mitigation techniques that could be deployed to limit the impact.</description>

      <title>Securing Blockchain Systems: A Novel Collaborative Learning Framework to Detect Attacks in Transactions and Smart Contracts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the escalating prevalence of malicious activities exploiting vulnerabilities in blockchain systems, there is an urgent requirement for robust attack detection mechanisms. To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel collaborative learning framework designed to detect attacks in blockchain transactions and smart contracts by analyzing transaction features. Our framework exhibits the capability to classify various types of blockchain attacks, including intricate attacks at the machine code level (e.g., injecting malicious codes to withdraw coins from users unlawfully), which typically necessitate significant time and security expertise to detect. To achieve that, the proposed framework incorporates a unique tool that transforms transaction features into visual representations, facilitating efficient analysis and classification of low-level machine codes. Furthermore, we propose a customized collaborative learning model to enable real-time detection of diverse attack types at distributed mining nodes. In order to create a comprehensive dataset, we deploy a pilot system based on a private Ethereum network and conduct multiple attack scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, our dataset is the most comprehensive and diverse collection of transactions and smart contracts synthesized in a laboratory for cyberattack detection in blockchain systems. Our framework achieves a detection accuracy of approximately 94\% through extensive simulations and real-time experiments with a throughput of over 2,150 transactions per second. These compelling results validate the efficacy of our framework and showcase its adaptability in addressing real-world cyberattack scenarios.</description>

      <title>Towards more Practical Threat Models in Artificial Intelligence Security</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works have identified a gap between research and practice in artificial intelligence security: threats studied in academia do not always reflect the practical use and security risks of AI. For example, while models are often studied in isolation, they form part of larger ML pipelines in practice. Recent works also brought forward that adversarial manipulations introduced by academic attacks are impractical. We take a first step towards describing the full extent of this disparity. To this end, we revisit the threat models of the six most studied attacks in AI security research and match them to AI usage in practice via a survey with 271 industrial practitioners. On the one hand, we find that all existing threat models are indeed applicable. On the other hand, there are significant mismatches: research is often too generous with the attacker, assuming access to information not frequently available in real-world settings. Our paper is thus a call for action to study more practical threat models in artificial intelligence security.</description>

Abstract: Data privacy is of great concern in cloud machine-learning service platforms, when sensitive data are exposed to service providers. While private computing environments (e.g., secure enclaves), and cryptographic approaches (e.g., homomorphic encryption) provide strong privacy protection, their computing performance still falls short compared to cloud GPUs. To achieve privacy protection with high computing performance, we propose Delta, a new private training and inference framework, with comparable model performance as non-private centralized training. Delta features two asymmetric data flows: the main information-sensitive flow and the residual flow. The main part flows into a small model while the residuals are offloaded to a large model. Specifically, Delta embeds the information-sensitive representations into a low-dimensional space while pushing the information-insensitive part into high-dimension residuals. To ensure privacy protection, the low-dimensional information-sensitive part is secured and fed to a small model in a private environment. On the other hand, the residual part is sent to fast cloud GPUs, and processed by a large model. To further enhance privacy and reduce the communication cost, Delta applies a random binary quantization technique along with a DP-based technique to the residuals before sharing them with the public platform. We theoretically show that Delta guarantees differential privacy in the public environment and greatly reduces the complexity in the private environment. We conduct empirical analyses on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets and ResNet-18 and ResNet-34, showing that Delta achieves strong privacy protection, fast training, and inference without significantly compromising the model utility.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Quality Attributes of AI Vision Models in Open Repositories Under Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12261</link>

Abstract: As AI models rapidly evolve, they are frequently released to open repositories, such as HuggingFace. It is essential to perform quality assurance validation on these models before integrating them into the production development lifecycle. In addition to evaluating efficiency in terms of balanced accuracy and computing costs, adversarial attacks are potential threats to the robustness and explainability of AI models. Meanwhile, XAI applies algorithms that approximate inputs to outputs post-hoc to identify the contributing features. Adversarial perturbations may also degrade the utility of XAI explanations that require further investigation. In this paper, we present an integrated process designed for downstream evaluation tasks, including validating AI model accuracy, evaluating robustness with benchmark perturbations, comparing explanation utility, and assessing overhead. We demonstrate an evaluation scenario involving six computer vision models, which include CNN-based, Transformer-based, and hybrid architectures, three types of perturbations, and five XAI methods, resulting in ninety unique combinations. The process reveals the explanation utility among the XAI methods in terms of the identified key areas responding to the adversarial perturbation. The process produces aggregated results that illustrate multiple attributes of each AI model.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study conducts a thorough examination of malware detection using machine learning techniques, focusing on the evaluation of various classification models using the Mal-API-2019 dataset. The aim is to advance cybersecurity capabilities by identifying and mitigating threats more effectively. Both ensemble and non-ensemble machine learning methods, such as Random Forest, XGBoost, K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Neural Networks, are explored. Special emphasis is placed on the importance of data pre-processing techniques, particularly TF-IDF representation and Principal Component Analysis, in improving model performance. Results indicate that ensemble methods, particularly Random Forest and XGBoost, exhibit superior accuracy, precision, and recall compared to others, highlighting their effectiveness in malware detection. The paper also discusses limitations and potential future directions, emphasizing the need for continuous adaptation to address the evolving nature of malware. This research contributes to ongoing discussions in cybersecurity and provides practical insights for developing more robust malware detection systems in the digital era.</description>

      <title>Threats, Attacks, and Defenses in Machine Unlearning: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) has gained considerable attention recently for its potential to achieve Safe AI by removing the influence of specific data from trained machine learning models. This process, known as knowledge removal, addresses AI governance concerns of training data such as quality, sensitivity, copyright restrictions, and obsolescence. This capability is also crucial for ensuring compliance with privacy regulations such as the Right To Be Forgotten. Furthermore, effective knowledge removal mitigates the risk of harmful outcomes, safeguarding against biases, misinformation, and unauthorized data exploitation, thereby enhancing the safe and responsible use of AI systems. Efforts have been made to design efficient unlearning approaches, with MU services being examined for integration with existing machine learning as a service, allowing users to submit requests to remove specific data from the training corpus. However, recent research highlights vulnerabilities in machine unlearning systems, such as information leakage and malicious unlearning requests, that can lead to significant security and privacy concerns. Moreover, extensive research indicates that unlearning methods and prevalent attacks fulfill diverse roles within MU systems. For instance, unlearning can act as a mechanism to recover models from backdoor attacks, while backdoor attacks themselves can serve as an evaluation metric for unlearning effectiveness. This underscores the intricate relationship and complex interplay among these mechanisms in maintaining system functionality and safety. This survey aims to fill the gap between the extensive number of studies on threats, attacks, and defenses in machine unlearning and the absence of a comprehensive review that categorizes their taxonomy, methods, and solutions, thus offering valuable insights for future research directions and practical implementations.</description>

      <title>Differentially private multivariate medians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.06459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical tools which satisfy rigorous privacy guarantees are necessary for modern data analysis. It is well-known that robustness against contamination is linked to differential privacy. Despite this fact, using multivariate medians for differentially private and robust multivariate location estimation has not been systematically studied. We develop novel finite-sample performance guarantees for differentially private multivariate depth-based medians, which are essentially sharp. Our results cover commonly used depth functions, such as the halfspace (or Tukey) depth, spatial depth, and the integrated dual depth. We show that under Cauchy marginals, the cost of heavy-tailed location estimation outweighs the cost of privacy. We demonstrate our results numerically using a Gaussian contamination model in dimensions up to d = 100, and compare them to a state-of-the-art private mean estimation algorithm. As a by-product of our investigation, we prove concentration inequalities for the output of the exponential mechanism about the maximizer of the population objective function. This bound applies to objective functions that satisfy a mild regularity condition.</description>

      <title>Investigating Feature and Model Importance in Android Malware Detection: An Implemented Survey and Experimental Comparison of ML-Based Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The popularity of Android means it is a common target for malware. Over the years, various studies have found that machine learning models can effectively discriminate malware from benign applications. However, as the operating system evolves, so does malware, bringing into question the findings of these previous studies, many of which report very high accuracies using small, outdated, and often imbalanced datasets. In this paper, we reimplement 18 representative past works and reevaluate them using a balanced, relevant, and up-to-date dataset comprising 124,000 applications. We also carry out new experiments designed to fill holes in existing knowledge, and use our findings to identify the most effective features and models to use for Android malware detection within a contemporary environment. We show that high detection accuracies (up to 96.8%) can be achieved using features extracted through static analysis alone, yielding a modest benefit (1%) from using far more expensive dynamic analysis. API calls and opcodes are the most productive static and TCP network traffic provide the most predictive dynamic features. Random forests are generally the most effective model, outperforming more complex deep learning approaches. Whilst directly combining static and dynamic features is generally ineffective, ensembling models separately leads to performances comparable to the best models but using less brittle features.</description>

      <title>Byzantine-resilient Federated Learning With Adaptivity to Data Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with federated learning (FL) in the presence of malicious Byzantine attacks and data heterogeneity. A novel Robust Average Gradient Algorithm (RAGA) is proposed, which leverages the geometric median for aggregation and can freely select the round number for local updating. Different from most existing resilient approaches, which perform convergence analysis based on strongly-convex loss function or homogeneously distributed dataset, we conduct convergence analysis for not only strongly-convex but also non-convex loss function over heterogeneous dataset. According to our theoretical analysis, as long as the fraction of dataset from malicious users is less than half, RAGA can achieve convergence at rate $\mathcal{O}({1}/{T^{2/3- \delta}})$ where $T$ is the iteration number and $\delta \in (0, 2/3)$ for non-convex loss function, and at linear rate for strongly-convex loss function. Moreover, stationary point or global optimal solution is proved to obtainable as data heterogeneity vanishes. Experimental results corroborate the robustness of RAGA to Byzantine attacks and verifies the advantage of RAGA over baselines on convergence performance under various intensity of Byzantine attacks, for heterogeneous dataset.</description>

      <title>Can ChatGPT Detect DeepFakes? A Study of Using Multimodal Large Language Models for Media Forensics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DeepFakes, which refer to AI-generated media content, have become an increasing concern due to their use as a means for disinformation. Detecting DeepFakes is currently solved with programmed machine learning algorithms. In this work, we investigate the capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLMs) in DeepFake detection. We conducted qualitative and quantitative experiments to demonstrate multimodal LLMs and show that they can expose AI-generated images through careful experimental design and prompt engineering. This is interesting, considering that LLMs are not inherently tailored for media forensic tasks, and the process does not require programming. We discuss the limitations of multimodal LLMs for these tasks and suggest possible improvements.</description>

      <title>Clean-image Backdoor Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To gather a significant quantity of annotated training data for high-performance image classification models, numerous companies opt to enlist third-party providers to label their unlabeled data. This practice is widely regarded as secure, even in cases where some annotated errors occur, as the impact of these minor inaccuracies on the final performance of the models is negligible and existing backdoor attacks require attacker's ability to poison the training images. Nevertheless, in this paper, we propose clean-image backdoor attacks which uncover that backdoors can still be injected via a fraction of incorrect labels without modifying the training images. Specifically, in our attacks, the attacker first seeks a trigger feature to divide the training images into two parts: those with the feature and those without it. Subsequently, the attacker falsifies the labels of the former part to a backdoor class. The backdoor will be finally implanted into the target model after it is trained on the poisoned data. During the inference phase, the attacker can activate the backdoor in two ways: slightly modifying the input image to obtain the trigger feature, or taking an image that naturally has the trigger feature as input. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our attacks. According to the experimental results, we conclude that our attacks seriously jeopardize the fairness and robustness of image classification models, and it is necessary to be vigilant about the incorrect labels in outsourced labeling.</description>
