      <title>Mitigation of extreme events in an excitable system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formulating mitigation strategies is one of the main aspect in the dynamical study of extreme events. Apart from the effective control, easy implementation of the devised tool should also be given importance. In this work, we analyze the mitigation of extreme events in a coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neuron model utilizing an easily implementable constant bias analogous to a constant DC stimulant. We report the route through which the extreme events gets mitigated in $Two$, $Three$ and $N-$coupled FHN systems. In all the three cases, extreme events in the observable $\bar{x}$ gets suppressed. We confirm our results with the probability distribution function of peaks, $d_{max}$ plot and probability plots. Here $d_{max}$ is a measure of number of standard deviations that crosses the average amplitude corresponding to $\bar{x}_{max}$. Interestingly, we found that constant bias suppresses the extreme events without changing the collective frequency of the system.</description>

      <title>Transmitted resonance in a coupled system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When two systems are coupled, one can play the role of the driver, and the other can be the driven or response system. In this scenario, the driver system can behave as an external forcing. Thus, we study its interaction when a periodic forcing drives the driver system. In the analysis a new phenomenon shows up: when the driver system is forced by a periodic forcing, it can suffer a resonance and this resonance can be transmitted through the coupling mechanism to the driven system. Moreover, in some cases the enhanced oscillations amplitude can also interplay with a previous resonance already acting in the driven system dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the higher-order smallest ring star network of Chialvo neurons under diffusive couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We put forward the dynamical study of a novel higher-order small network of Chialvo neurons arranged in a ring-star topology, with the neurons interacting via linear diffusive couplings. This model is perceived to imitate the nonlinear dynamical properties exhibited by a realistic nervous system where the neurons transfer information through higher-order multi-body interactions. We first analyze our model using the tools from nonlinear dynamics literature: fixed point analysis, Jacobian matrix, and bifurcation patterns. We observe the coexistence of chaotic attractors, and also an intriguing route to chaos starting from a fixed point, to period-doubling, to cyclic quasiperiodic closed invariant curves, to ultimately chaos. We numerically observe the existence of codimension-1 bifurcation patterns: saddle-node, period-doubling, and Neimark Sacker. We also qualitatively study the typical phase portraits of the system and numerically quantify chaos and complexity using the 0-1 test and sample entropy measure respectively. Finally, we study the collective behavior of the neurons in terms of two synchronization measures: the cross-correlation coefficient, and the Kuramoto order parameter.</description>

      <title>Dynamical properties of a small heterogeneous chain network of neurons in discrete time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel nonlinear bidirectionally coupled heterogeneous chain network whose dynamics evolve in discrete time. The backbone of the model is a pair of popular map-based neuron models, the Chialvo and the Rulkov maps. This model is assumed to proximate the intricate dynamical properties of neurons in the widely complex nervous system. The model is first realized via various nonlinear analysis techniques: fixed point analysis, phase portraits, Jacobian matrix, and bifurcation diagrams. We observe the coexistence of chaotic and period-4 attractors. Various codimension-1 and -2 patterns for example saddle-node, period-doubling, Neimark-Sacker, double Neimark-Sacker, flip- and fold-Neimark Sacker, and 1:1 and 1:2 resonance are also explored. Furthermore, the study employs two synchronization measures to quantify how the oscillators in the network behave in tandem with each other over a long number of iterations. Finally, a time series analysis of the model is performed to investigate its complexity in terms of sample entropy.</description>
