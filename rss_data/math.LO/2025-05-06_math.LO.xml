      <title>Bilateral base-extension semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilateralism is the position according to which assertion and rejection are conceptually independent speech acts. Logical bilateralism demands that systems of logic provide conditions for assertion and rejection that are not reducible to each other, which often leads to independent definitions of proof rules (for assertion) and dual proof rules, also called refutation rules (for rejection). Since it provides a critical account of what it means for something to be a proof or a refutation, bilateralism is often studied in the context of proof-theoretic semantics, an approach that aims to elucidate both the meaning of proofs (and refutations) and what kinds of semantics can be given if proofs (and refutations) are considered as basic semantic notions. The recent literature on bilateral proof-theoretic semantics has only dealt with the semantics of proofs and refutations, whereas we deal with semantics in terms of proofs and refutations. In this paper we present a bilateral version of base-extension semantics - one of the most widely studied proof-theoretic semantics - by allowing atomic bases to contain both atomic proof rules and atomic refutation rules. The semantics is shown to be sound and complete with respect to the bilateral dual intuitionistic logic 2Int. Structural similarities between atomic proofs and refutations also allow us to define duality notions for atomic rules, deductions and bases, which may then be used for the proof of bilateral semantic harmony results. Aside from enabling embeddings between different fragments of the language, bilateral semantic harmony is shown to be a restatement of the syntactic horizontal inversion principle, whose meaning-conferring character may now be interpreted as the requirement of preservation of harmony notions already present at the core of the semantics by inferences.</description>

      <title>Algebraic structures arising from the finite condensation on linear orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The finite condensation $\sim_F$ is an equivalence relation defined on a linear order $L$ by $x \sim_F y$ if and only if the set of points lying between $x$ and $y$ is finite. We define an operation $\cdot_F$ on linear orders $L$ and $M$ by $L \cdot_F M = (LM)/\!\sim_F$; that is, $L \cdot_F M$ is the lexicographic product of $L$ and $M$ modulo the finite condensation. The infinite order types $L$ such that $L / \! \sim_F\, \cong 1$ are $\omega, \omega^*,$ and $\zeta$ (where $\omega^*$ is the reverse ordering of $\omega$, and $\zeta$ is the order type of $\mathbb{Z}$). We show that under the operation $\cdot_F$, the set $R=\{1, \omega, \omega^*, \zeta\}$ forms a left rectangular band. Further, each of the ordinal elements of $R$ defines, via left or right multiplication modulo the finite condensation, a weakly order-preserving map on the class of ordinals. We describe these maps' action on the ordinals whose Cantor normal form is of finite degree.</description>

      <title>Twins: non-isomorphic models forced to be isomorphic. Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For which (first-order complete, usually countable) T do there exist non-isomorphic models of T which become isomorphic after forcing with a forcing notion P? Necessarily, P is non-trivial; i.e., it adds some new set of ordinals. It is best if we also demand that it collapses no cardinal. It is better if we demand on the one hand that the models are non-isomorphic, and even far from each other (in a suitable sense), but on the other hand, L-equivalent in some suitable logic L.
  In this part we give sufficient conditions: for theories with the independence property, we prove this when P adds no new omega-sequence. We may prove it for some P, but better would be for some specific forcing notions, or a natural family. Best would be to characterize the pairs (T,P) for which we have such models.</description>

      <title>The barrier Ramsey theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a very general finite Ramsey theorem, where both the sets being colored and the homogeneous set must satisfy some largeness notion. For the homogeneous set this has already been done using the notion of $\alpha$-largeness, where $\alpha$ is a countable ordinal equipped with a system of fundamental sequences. To extend this approach the more appropriate notion is barrier largeness. Since the complexity of barriers can be measured by countable ordinals, we define Ramsey ordinals and, using appropriate iterations of the Veblen functions, we are able to compute them.</description>

      <title>Modal logic for reasoning about uncertainty and confusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a modal logic that can formalise statements about uncertainty and beliefs such as `I think that my wallet is in the drawer rather than elsewhere' or `I am confused whether my appointment is on Monday or Tuesday'. To do that, we expand G\"{o}del modal logic $\mathbf{K}\mathsf{G}$ with the involutive negation $\sim$ defined as $v({\sim}\phi,w)=1-v(\phi,w)$. We provide semantics with the finite model property for our new logic that we call $\mathbf{K}\mathsf{G_{inv}}$ and show its equivalence to the standard semantics over $[0,1]$-valued Kripke models. Namely, we show that $\phi$ is valid in the standard semantics of $\mathbf{K}\mathsf{G_{inv}}$ iff it is valid in the new semantics. Using this new semantics, we construct a constraint tableaux calculus for $\mathbf{K}\mathsf{G_{inv}}$ that allows for an explicit extraction of countermodels from complete open branches and then employ the tableaux calculus to obtain the PSpace-completeness of the validity in $\mathbf{K}\mathsf{G_{inv}}$.</description>

      <title>Operators Max L and Min U and duals of Boolean posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When working with posets which are not necessarily lattices, one has a lack of lattice operations which causes problems in algebraic constructions. This is the reason why we use the operators Max L and Min U substituting infimum and supremum, respectively. We axiomatize these operators. Two more operators, namely the so-called symmetric difference and the Sheffer operator, are introduced and studied in complemented posets by using the operators Max L and Min U. In Boolean algebras, the symmetric difference is used to construct its dual structure, the corresponding unitary Boolean ring. By generalizing this idea, we assign to each Boolean poset a so-called dual and prove that also, conversely, a Boolean poset can be derived from its dual.</description>

      <title>Cut elimination for a non-wellfounded system for the master modality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work we provided a method for eliminating cuts in non-wellfounded proofs with a local-progress condition, these being the simplest kind of non-wellfounded proofs. The method consisted of splitting the proof into nicely behaved fragments. This paper extends our method to proofs based on simple trace conditions. The main idea is to split the system with the trace condition into infinitely many local-progress calculi that together are equivalent to the original trace-based system. This provides a cut elimination method using only basic tools of structural proof theory and corecursion, which is needed due to the non-wellfounded character of proofs. We will employ the method to obtain syntactic cut elimination for $K^+$, a system of modal logic with the master modality.</description>

      <title>Terminal Coalgebras and Non-wellfounded Sets in Homotopy Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.06696v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-wellfounded material sets have been modeled in Martin-L\"of type theory by Lindstr\"om using setoids. In this paper we construct models of non-wellfounded material sets in Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) where equality is interpreted as the identity type. The first model satisfies Scott's Anti-Foundation Axiom (SAFA) and dualises the construction of iterative sets. The second model satisfies Aczel's Anti-Foundation Axiom (AFA), and is constructed by adaption of Aczel--Mendler's terminal coalgebra theorem to type theory, which requires propositional resizing.
  In an bid to extend coalgebraic theory and anti-foundation axioms to higher type levels, we formulate generalisations of AFA and SAFA, and construct a hierarchy of models which satisfies the SAFA generalisations. These generalisations build on the framework of Univalent Material Set Theory, previously developed by two of the authors.
  Since the model constructions are based on M-types, the paper also includes a characterisation of the identity type of M-types as indexed M-types.
  Our results are formalised in the proof-assistant Agda.</description>

      <title>On the Various Translations between Classical, Intuitionistic and Linear Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several different proof translations exist between classical and intuitionistic logic (negative translations), and intuitionistic and linear logic (Girard translations). Our aims in this paper are (1) to consider extensions of intuitionistic linear logic which correspond to each of these systems, and (2) with this common logical basis, to develop an uniform approach to devising and simplifying proof translations. As we shall see, through this process of ``simplification'' we obtain most of the well-known translations in the literature.</description>

      <title>Dynamical method in algebra: Effective Nullstellens\"atze</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:1701.05794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a general method for producing various effective Null and Positivstellens\"atze, and getting new Positivstellens\"atze in algebraically closed valued fields and ordered groups. These various effective Nullstellens\"atze produce algebraic identities certifying that some geometric conditions cannot be simultaneously satisfied. We produce also constructive versions of abstract classical results of algebra based on Zorn's lemma in several cases where such constructive version did not exist. For example, the fact that a real field can be totally ordered, or the fact that a field can be embedded in an algebraically closed field. Our results are based on the concepts we develop of dynamical proofs and simultaneous collapse.</description>

      <title>Modal Fracture of Higher Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.15390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the modal aspects of higher groups in Shulman's Cohesive Homotopy Type Theory. We show that every higher group sits within a modal fracture hexagon which renders it into its discrete, infinitesimal, and contractible components. This gives an unstable and synthetic construction of Schreiber's differential cohomology hexagon. As an example of this modal fracture hexagon, we recover the character diagram characterizing ordinary differential cohomology by its relation to its underlying integral cohomology and differential form data, although there is a subtle obstruction to generalizing the usual hexagon to higher types. Assuming the existence of a long exact sequence of differential form classifiers, we construct the classifiers for circle k-gerbes with connection and describe their modal fracture hexagon.</description>

      <title>Internality of autonomous algebraic differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article is interested in internality to the constants of systems of autonomous algebraic ordinary differential equations. Roughly, this means determining when can all solutions of such a system be written as a rational function of finitely many fixed solutions (and their derivatives) and finitely many constants. If the system is a single order one equation, the answer was given in an old article of Rosenlicht. In the present work, we completely answer this question for a large class of systems. As a corollary, we obtain a necessary condition for the generic solution to be Liouvillian. We then apply these results to determine exactly when solutions to Poizat equations (a special case of Li\'enard equations) are internal, answering a question of Freitag, Jaoui, Marker and Nagloo, and to the classic Lotka-Volterra system, showing that its generic solutions are almost never Liouvillian.</description>

      <title>Abstract 3D-rotation groups and recognition of icosahedral modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an abstract notion of a 3D-rotation module for a group $G$ that does not require the module to carry a vector space structure, a priori nor a posteriori. We prove that, under an expected irreducibility-like assumption, the only finite $G$ with such a module are those already known from the classical setting: $\operatorname{Alt}(4)$, $\operatorname{Sym}(4)$, and $\operatorname{Alt}(5)$. Our main result then studies the module structure when $G = \operatorname{Alt}(5)$ and shows that, under certain natural restrictions, it is fully determined and generalizes that of the classical icosahedral module.
  We include an application to the recently introduced setting of modules with an additive dimension, a general setting allowing for simultaneous treatment of classical representation theory of finite groups as well as representations within various well-behaved model-theoretic settings such as the $o$-minimal and finite Morley rank ones. Leveraging our recognition result for icosahedral modules, we classify the faithful $\operatorname{Alt}(5)$-modules with additive dimension that are dim-connected of dimension $3$ and without $2$-torsion.</description>
