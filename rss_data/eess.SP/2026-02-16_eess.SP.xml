      <title>A Gradient Boosted Mixed-Model Machine Learning Framework for Vessel Speed in the U.S. Arctic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how environmental and operational conditions influence vessel speed is crucial for characterizing navigational conditions in the Arctic. We analyzed Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from 2010-2019 to examine vessel speed over ground (SOG). Over half of the AIS records showed zero SOG, and treating zero and positive SOG as a single continuous process can obscure important patterns. We therefore applied a two-stage machine learning framework, first modeling the probability of SOG greater than zero and then modeling SOG conditional on being positive. AIS observations were integrated with sea ice concentration, course over ground, wind, bathymetric depth, distance to coast, vessel group, and navigational status. Gradient boosted decision trees with random effects captured nonlinear environmental responses while accounting for repeated observations. The positive SOG classifier achieved strong discrimination (AUC = 0.85), while the conditional speed model explained approximately 77 percent of out-of-fold variance. SHAP values quantified covariate effects by decomposing model predictions into additive contributions from individual variables. Distance to coast and bathymetric depth were dominant determinants of both the likelihood and magnitude of vessel speed, while changes in course, vessel group, and navigational status introduced secondary variation. Wind and sea ice effects were modest. Together, these results empirically characterize Arctic vessel operating regimes relevant to speed management and corridor-level assessment.</description>

      <title>Interference-Robust Non-Coherent Over-the-Air Computation for Decentralized Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-coherent over-the-air (NCOTA) computation enables low-latency and bandwidth-efficient decentralized optimization by exploiting the average energy superposition property of wireless channels. It has recently been proposed as a powerful tool for executing consensus-based optimization algorithms in fully decentralized systems. A key advantage of NCOTA is that it enables unbiased consensus estimation without channel state information at either transmitters or receivers, requires no transmission scheduling, and scales efficiently to dense network deployments. However, NCOTA is inherently susceptible to external interference, which can bias the consensus estimate and deteriorate the convergence of the underlying decentralized optimization algorithm. In this paper, we propose a novel interference-robust (IR-)NCOTA scheme. The core idea is to apply a coordinated random rotation of the frame of reference across all nodes, and transmit a pseudo-random pilot signal, allowing to transform external interference into a circularly symmetric distribution with zero mean relative to the rotated frame. This ensures that the consensus estimates remain unbiased, preserving the convergence guarantees of the underlying optimization algorithm. Through numerical results on a classification task, it is demonstrated that IR-NCOTA exhibits superior performance over the baseline NCOTA algorithm in the presence of external interference.</description>

      <title>Practical RIS Gain without the Pain: Randomization and Opportunistic Scheduling in 5G NR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate the performance gains achieved by an in-house built reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) integrated with a real-time 5G new radio (NR) system implemented using the OpenAirInterface (OAI) framework. We first quantify the gain in throughput achievable by integrating an RIS with a 5G system. Next, we show that randomly setting the RIS phase configuration and leveraging the inherent proportional fair (PF) scheduling mechanism of 5G NR can yield near-optimal throughput, provided the throughput averaging window of the PF scheduler is chosen judiciously. This occurs because, in each time slot, the PF scheduler naturally prioritizes data transmission to the user equipment (UE) that experiences the best channel conditions, namely, the UE to which the randomly configured RIS is aligned. Subsequently, we experimentally evaluate key performance metrics, including the reference signal received power (RSRP), block error rate (BLER), modulation and coding scheme (MCS) index, and throughput, under random RIS configurations. These results confirm that even a randomly configured RIS with negligible overhead can deliver performance comparable to optimized RIS designs, in real-world 5G NR wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Task- and Metric-Specific Signal Quality Indices for Medical Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical time series such as electrocardiograms (ECGs) and photoplethysmograms (PPGs) are frequently affected by measurement artifacts due to challenging acquisition environments, such as in ambulances and during routine daily activities. Since automated algorithms for analyzing such signals increasingly inform clinically relevant decisions, identifying signal segments on which these algorithms may produce unreliable outputs is of critical importance. Signal quality indices (SQIs) are commonly used for this purpose. However, most existing SQIs are task agnostic and do not account for the specific algorithm and performance metric used downstream. In this work, we formalize signal quality as a task- and metric-dependent concept and propose a perturbation-based SQI (pSQI) that aims to detect an algorithm's performance degradation on an input signal with respect to a metric. The pSQI is defined as the worst-case value of the performance metric under an additive, colored Gaussian noise perturbation with a lower-bounded signal-to-noise ratio. We introduce formal requirements for task- and metric-specific SQIs, including monotonicity of the metric in expectation and maximal separation under thresholding. Experiments on R-peak detection and atrial fibrillation classification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed pSQI consistently outperforms existing feature- and deep learning-based SQIs in identifying unreliable inputs without requiring training.</description>

      <title>Generative Site-Specific Beamforming via Information-Maximizing Codebook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel generative site-specific beamforming (GenSSBF) framework is proposed, which integrates a site-information-maximizing (SIM) codebook with a conditional flow matching (CFM)-based beam generator. By this framework, the site-specific radio propagation environment is learned at the base station (BS), enabling the generation of high fidelity communication beams from coarse reference-signal-received-power (RSRP) feedback provided by user equipments (UEs). In the proposed design, a low-dimensional SIM probing codebook is first constructed by maximizing the mutual information between the RSRP feedback and the site-specific channel. This design not only reduces the initial beam sweeping overhead, but also enhances the amount of channel state information conveyed through UE feedback. By treating the RSRP feedback as a conditional prior, a CFM-based generative model is further developed to explicitly capture the uncertainty in beam generation. Specifically, a small set of UE-specific candidate beams is generated by inferring the learned generative model and sampling from the corresponding posterior distribution, after which the final data transmission beam is selected by the UE. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed SIM codebook and the CFM-based beam generator. The proposed GenSSBF framework achieves beamforming performance nearly identical to maximum ratio transmission while requiring only eight probing beams and eight candidate beams.</description>

      <title>GNSS Jamming Detection with Automatic Gain Control (AGC) and Carrier-to-Noise Ratio Density (CNO) Observables from a COTS receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As rail transport moves toward higher degrees of automation under initiatives like the R2DATO project [1], accurate and reliable train localization has become essential. Global Satellite Navigation System (GNSS) is considered as a main technology in enabling operational advancements including Automatic Train Operation (ATO), moving block signaling, and virtual coupling, which are the core components of the Horizon Europe 2024 rail digitalization agenda. However, GNSS signal integrity is increasingly threatened by intentional and unintentional radio frequency interference (RFI). This include jamming and spoofing, which are particularly concerning as the broadcasted signal can deliberately disrupt or manipulate the GNSS signal. - Jamming refers to an intentional form of interference that induces disturbances in the GNSS band, causing performance degradation or can even entirely block the receiver from acquiring the satellite signals. - Spoofing involves broadcasting counterfeit satellite signals to deceive the GNSS receiver, leading to inaccurate estimation of position, navigation and timing information. This concern about interference is not unique to rail applications. The aeronautical sector has long recognized the risks posed by GNSS interference, with extensive documentation on its impact on navigation, landing procedures, and surveillance systems. In recent years, awareness of these risks has expanded to other transport sectors. Within the automotive industry, particularly in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), several studies [2][3][4] have addressed the vulnerability of GNSS against interference. Similar concerns are now emerging in the rail domain [5][6][7], especially as GNSS is increasingly adopted in safety-critical applications. In literature, several levels of actions have been explored, ranging from merely the detection of a malicious signal at the initial phase to the application of advanced signal processing methods aimed at suppressing the effects of interference [8]. In alignment with the goal of the R2DATO project, we evaluated the impact of various classes of interference signals such as amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), pulsed, frequency hopping and chirp signals on the GNSS observables including Automatic Gain Control (AGC) and Carrier to Noise Ratio (CNO) as measured by a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS). However, in this work, the analysis is only limited to impact of chirp interference on GPS L1 receiver observables and detection performance.</description>

      <title>Flexible RISs: Learning-based Array Manifold Estimation and Phase-shift Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are envisioned as a key enabler for next-generation wireless networks, offering programmable control over propagation environments. While extensive research focuses on planar RIS architectures, practical deployments often involve non-planar surfaces, such as structural columns or curved facades, where standard planar beamforming models fail. Moreover, existing analytical solutions for curved RISs are often restricted to specific, pre-defined array manifold geometries. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel deep learning (DL) framework for optimizing the phase shifts of non-planar RISs. We first introduce a low-dimensional parametric model to capture arbitrary surface curvature effectively. Based on this, we design a neural network (NN) that utilizes a sparse set of received power measurements to estimate the surface geometry and derive the optimal phase configuration. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm converges fast and significantly outperforms conventional planar beamforming designs, validating its robustness against arbitrary surface curvature. We also analyze the impact of the measurement location error on the algorithm's performance.</description>

      <title>Comparison of OTFS and OFDM for RIS-aided Systems in the Presence of Phase Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the performance of RIS-aided orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems in the presence of oscillator phase noise. OFDM is known to be sensitive to phase noise, which could limit the potential gains promised by RIS systems. OTFS, on the other hand, is a compelling potential waveform for RIS-aided systems in the presence of phase noise due to it's resilience to time-varying channels. However, the effect of phase noise on OTFS has not been fully analyzed in the literature as of yet. Additionally, no existing works in the literature consider the effect of phase noise on an RIS-aided OTFS system. Hence, we propose a joint RIS channel and phase noise estimation technique using a Wiener filtering approach. Our proposed method exploits the statistical nature of both the phase noise and the Doppler spread channel in a setup with RIS. Our numerical analysis demonstrates the significant gain of RIS-aided OTFS offers compared to RIS-aided OFDM in the presence in the presence of phase noise. Additionally, our results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed estimation technique, with gains of up to 3~dB in terms of bit error rate (BER), over existing methods in the literature.</description>

      <title>HoRAMA: Holistic Reconstruction with Automated Material Assignment for Ray Tracing using NYURay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks at upper mid-band and millimeter-wave frequencies require accurate site-specific deterministic channel propagation prediction. Wireless ray tracing (RT) provides site-specific predictions but demands high-fidelity three-dimensional (3D) environment models with material properties. Manual 3D model reconstruction achieves high accuracy but requires weeks of expert effort, creating scalability bottlenecks for large environment reconstruction. Traditional vision-based 3D reconstruction methods lack RT compatibility due to geometrically defective meshes and missing material properties. This paper presents Holistic Reconstruction with Automated Material Assignment (HoRAMA) for wireless propagation prediction using NYURay. HoRAMA generates RT-compatible 3D models from RGB video readily captured using a smartphone or low-cost portable camera, by integrating MASt3R-SLAM dense point cloud generation with vision language model-assisted material assignment. The HoRAMA 3D reconstruction method is verified by comparing NYURay RT predictions, using both manually created and HoRAMA-generated 3D models, against field measurements at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz across 12 TX-RX locations in a 700 square meter factory. HoRAMA ray tracing predictions achieve a 2.28 dB RMSE for matched multipath component (MPC) power predictions, comparable to the manually created 3D model baseline (2.18 dB), while reducing 3D reconstruction time from two months to 16 hours. HoRAMA enables scalable wireless digital twin creation for RT network planning, infrastructure deployment, and beam management in 5G/6G systems, as well as eventual real-time implementation at the edge.</description>

      <title>RIS Nearfield Position and Velocity Estimation Using a Validated Propagation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) for the task of position and velocity estimation in non-LOS (NLOS) indoor scenarios, using a snapshot based multi-step estimation algorithm. We evaluate a compound RIS structure prototype composed of four RIS tiles with 1-bit phase control per RIS unit cell. Numerical simulation results taking the antenna patterns into account are presented for an 3 m x 3 m area of interest. We demonstrate that the initial grid search step using the far field assumption is not robust enough for small distances to the RIS center and propose a more robust algorithm. Furthermore, we show that the effect of the antenna pattern causes an increased position and velocity error. Our modified three-step algorithm achieves a position error of 7 mm and a velocity error of 0.12 m/s at a distance of 2 m to the RIS center under a realistic numerical propagation model.</description>

      <title>Represent Micro-Doppler Signature in Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-line-of-sight sensing of human activities in complex environments is enabled by multiple-input multiple-output through-the-wall radar (TWR). However, the distinctiveness of micro-Doppler signature between similar indoor human activities such as gun carrying and normal walking is minimal, while the large scale of input images required for effective identification utilizing time-frequency spectrograms creates challenges for model training and inference efficiency. To address this issue, the Chebyshev-time map is proposed in this paper, which is a method characterizing micro-Doppler signature using polynomial orders. The parametric kinematic models for human motion and the TWR echo model are first established. Then, a time-frequency feature representation method based on orthogonal Chebyshev polynomial decomposition is proposed. The kinematic envelopes of the torso and limbs are extracted, and the time-frequency spectrum slices are mapped into a robust Chebyshev-time coefficient space, preserving the multi-order morphological detail information of time-frequency spectrum. Numerical simulations and experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, which demonstrates the capability to characterize armed and unarmed indoor human activities while effectively compressing the scale of the time-frequency spectrum to achieve a balance between recognition accuracy and input data dimensions. The open-source code of this paper can be found in: https://github.com/JoeyBGOfficial/Represent-Micro-Doppler-Signature-in-Orders.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Beampointing with Low Exposure Regions: a Dominant Subspace Projection Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spherical nature of the wavefronts exhibited in the near-field of antenna arrays enables advanced beamforming capabilities, such as beampointing and beamnulling. In this paper, we exploit these properties to design a near-field beam pattern under a low exposure region constraint. We address the continuous region constraint through spatial discretization, which results in a large number of constraints that lead to prohibitive computational complexity. We propose a novel low-complexity algorithm that enables a computationally tractable beam pattern design. It uses a low-dimensional subspace representation of the low exposure region based on a singular value decomposition. Our approach achieves low complexity while providing a power received at a target user close to the optimal achievable power, yet with uniform power mitigation over the low exposure region.</description>

      <title>Properties of Near Field Focusing for Three-Dimensional Large Intelligent Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates near-field focusing using a three-dimensional (3D) large intelligent surface (LIS) across frequencies and polarizations. Specifically, the LIS elements are distributed in 3D space within a long corridor, rather than being confined to a single planar aperture, and the focal point is located at a prescribed position in the radiating near field. By formulating optimization problems under both local and global power constraints, we obtain the corresponding optima. For continuous apertures, the optimal current magnitude distribution matches time-reversal (TR) solution under the global constraint and conjugate-phase (CP) solution when the local constraint dominates. When both constraints are active, the solution assigns larger excitation magnitudes to elements closer to the illumination field. This behavior remains invariant with respect to frequency and polarization for a fixed-size LIS. These findings are consistent to the more practical case of using discretized apertures in the form of Hertzian dipole arrays, studied using both analytical results and full-wave simulation. In addition, with the CP method, specific polarizations lead to identical transverse and longitudinal resolution, in contrast, under the TR method, these quantities can differ across polarizations.</description>

      <title>String-Level Ground Fault Localization for TN-Earthed Three-Phase Photovoltaic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The DC-side ground fault (GF) poses significant risks to three-phase TN-earthed photovoltaic (PV) systems, as the resulting high fault current can directly damage both PV inverters and PV modules. Once a fault occurs, locating the faulty string through manual string-by-string inspection is highly time-consuming and inefficient. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of GF characteristics through fault-current analysis and a simulation-based case study covering multiple fault locations. Building on these insights, we propose an edge-AI-based GF localization approach tailored for three-phase TN-earthed PV systems. A PLECS-based simulation model that incorporates PV hysteresis effects is developed to generate diverse GF scenarios, from which correlation-based features are extracted throughout the inverter's four-stage shutdown sequence. Using the simulated dataset, a lightweight Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB)-based localization model is designed and trained, achieving over 93% localization accuracy at typical sampling rates with low computational cost, demonstrating strong potential for deployment on resource-constrained PV inverters.</description>

Abstract: Room acoustics analysis plays a central role in architectural design, audio engineering, speech intelligibility assessment, and hearing research. Despite the availability of standardized metrics such as reverberation time, clarity, and speech transmission index, accessible tools that combine rigorous signal processing with intuitive visualization remain scarce. This paper presents AcoustiVision Pro, an open-source web-based platform for comprehensive room impulse response (RIR) analysis. The system computes twelve distinct acoustic parameters from uploaded or dataset-sourced RIRs, provides interactive 3D visualizations of early reflections, generates frequency-dependent decay characteristics through waterfall plots, and checks compliance against international standards including ANSI S12.60 and ISO 3382. We introduce the accompanying RIRMega and RIRMega Speech datasets hosted on Hugging Face, containing thousands of simulated room impulse responses with full metadata. The platform supports real-time auralization through FFT-based convolution, exports detailed PDF reports suitable for engineering documentation, and provides CSV data export for further analysis. We describe the mathematical foundations underlying each acoustic metric, detail the system architecture, and present preliminary case studies demonstrating the platform's utility across diverse application domains including classroom acoustics, healthcare facility design, and recording studio evaluation.</description>

      <title>FPNet: Joint Wi-Fi Beamforming Matrix Feedback and Anomaly-Aware Indoor Positioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Channel State Information (CSI) provides a detailed description of the wireless channel and has been widely adopted for Wi-Fi sensing, particularly for high-precision indoor positioning. However, complete CSI is rarely available in real-world deployments due to hardware constraints and the high communication overhead required for feedback. Moreover, existing positioning models lack mechanisms to detect when users move outside their trained regions, leading to unreliable estimates in dynamic environments. In this paper, we present FPNet, a unified deep learning framework that jointly addresses channel feedback compression, accurate indoor positioning, and robust anomaly detection (AD). FPNet leverages the beamforming feedback matrix (BFM), a compressed CSI representation natively supported by IEEE 802.11ac/ax/be protocols, to minimize feedback overhead while preserving critical positioning features. To enhance reliability, we integrate ADBlock, a lightweight AD module trained on normal BFM samples, which identifies out-of-distribution scenarios when users exit predefined spatial regions. Experimental results using standard 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi hardware show that FPNet achieves positioning accuracy above 97% with only 100 feedback bits, boosts net throughput by up to 22.92%, and attains AD accuracy over 99% with a false alarm rate below 1.5%. These results demonstrate FPNet's ability to deliver efficient, accurate, and reliable indoor positioning on commodity Wi-Fi devices.</description>

      <title>EARL: Energy-Aware Adaptive Antenna Control with Reinforcement Learning in O-RAN Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) promises uniform high performance across the network, but also brings a high energy cost due to joint transmission from distributed radio units (RUs) and centralized processing in the cloud. Leveraging the resource-sharing capabilities of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN), we propose EARL, an energy-aware adaptive antenna control framework based on reinforcement learning. EARL dynamically configures antenna elements in RUs to minimize radio, optical fronthaul, and cloud processing power consumption while meeting user spectral efficiency demands. Numerical results show power savings of up to 81% and 50% over full-on and heuristic baselines, respectively. The RL-based approach operates within 220 ms, satisfying O-RAN's near-real-time limit, and a greedy refinement further halves power consumption at a 2 s runtime.</description>

      <title>Model-Aware Rate-Distortion Limits for Task-Oriented Source Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Task-Oriented Source Coding (TOSC) has emerged as a paradigm for efficient visual data communication in machine-centric inference systems, where bitrate, latency, and task performance must be jointly optimized under resource constraints. While recent works have proposed rate-distortion bounds for coding for machines, these results often rely on strong assumptions on task identifiability and neglect the impact of deployed task models. In this work, we revisit the fundamental limits of single-TOSC through the lens of indirect rate-distortion theory. We highlight the conditions under which existing rate-distortion bounds are achievable and show their limitations in realistic settings. We then introduce task model-aware rate-distortion bounds that account for task model suboptimality and architectural constraints. Experiments on standard classification benchmarks confirm that current learned TOSC schemes operate far from these limits, highlighting transmitter-side complexity as a key bottleneck.</description>

      <title>Quantization-Aware Collaborative Inference for Large Embodied AI Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large artificial intelligence models (LAIMs) are increasingly regarded as a core intelligence engine for embodied AI applications. However, the massive parameter scale and computational demands of LAIMs pose significant challenges for resource-limited embodied agents. To address this issue, we investigate quantization-aware collaborative inference (co-inference) for embodied AI systems. First, we develop a tractable approximation for quantization-induced inference distortion. Based on this approximation, we derive lower and upper bounds on the quantization rate-inference distortion function, characterizing its dependence on LAIM statistics, including the quantization bit-width. Next, we formulate a joint quantization bit-width and computation frequency design problem under delay and energy constraints, aiming to minimize the distortion upper bound while ensuring tightness through the corresponding lower bound. Extensive evaluations validate the proposed distortion approximation, the derived rate-distortion bounds, and the effectiveness of the proposed joint design. Particularly, simulations and real-world testbed experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed joint design in balancing inference quality, latency, and energy consumption in edge embodied AI systems.</description>

      <title>Precision yield estimation and mapping in manual strawberry harvesting with instrumented picking carts and a robust data processing pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02846v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-resolution yield maps for manually harvested crops are impractical to generate on commercial scales because yield monitors are available only for mechanical harvesters. However, precision crop management relies on accurately determining spatial and temporal yield variability. This study presents the development of an integrated system for precision yield estimation and mapping for manually harvested strawberries. Conventional strawberry picking carts were instrumented with a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and load cells to record real-time geo-tagged harvest data and cart motion. Extensive data were collected in two strawberry fields in California, USA, during a harvest season. To address the inconsistencies and errors caused by the sensors and the manual harvesting process, a robust data processing pipeline was developed by integrating supervised deep learning models with unsupervised algorithms. The pipeline was used to estimate the yield distribution and generate yield maps for season-long harvests at the desired grid resolution. The estimated yield distributions were used to calculate two metrics: the total mass harvested over specific row segments and the total mass of trays harvested. The metrics were compared to ground truth and achieved accuracies of 90.48% and 94.05%, respectively. Additionally, the accuracy of the estimated yield based on the number of trays harvested per cart for season-long harvest was better than 94%. It showed a strong correlation (Pearson r = 0.99) with the actual number of counted trays in both fields. The proposed system provides a scalable and practical solution for specialty crops, assisting in efficient yield estimation and mapping, field management, and labor management for sustainable crop production.</description>

Abstract: We address the channel estimation (CE) problem in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems by proposing a dual-structure and multi-dimensional transformations (DS-MDT) algorithm.The proposed approach leverages the dual-structure features of the channel parameters to assist users experiencing weaker channel conditions, thereby enhancing CE performance. Moreover, given that the channel parameters are distributed across multiple dimensions of the received tensor, the proposed algorithm employs multi-dimensional transformations to isolate and extract distinct parameters. The numerical results demonstrate the proposed algorithm reduces the normalized mean square error (NMSE) by up to 10 dB while maintaining lower complexity compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>EEG-FM-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for the Systematic Evaluation of EEG Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalography foundation models (EEG-FMs) have advanced brain signal analysis, but the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks impedes model comparison and scientific progress. Current evaluations rely on inconsistent protocols that render cross-model comparisons unreliable, while a lack of diagnostic analyses obscures the internal mechanisms driving transfer efficiency and scaling behaviors. To address this, we introduce \textbf{EEG-FM-Bench}, a unified system for the standardized evaluation of EEG-FMs. The benchmark integrates 14 datasets across 10 paradigms and incorporates diverse experimental settings, including multiple fine-tuning strategies, task organizations, and classifier configurations, supported by tools for gradient and representation analysis. Our experiments and analysis reveal several critical insights: (1) multi-task learning acts as a critical regularizer to mitigate overfitting in data-scarce EEG contexts; (2) pre-training efficiency is currently limited by gradient conflicts between reconstruction objectives and downstream tasks; (3) model scaling deviates from typical laws, as compact architectures with domain-specific inductive biases consistently outperform significantly larger models. This benchmark enables fair comparison and reproducible analysis, shifting the field from fragmented results to interpretable advances.

      <title>Efficient Quantization-Aware Neural Receivers: Beyond Post-Training Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13786v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As wireless communication systems advance toward Sixth Generation (6G) Radio Access Networks (RAN), Deep Learning (DL)-based neural receivers are emerging as transformative solutions for Physical Layer (PHY) processing, delivering superior Block Error Rate (BLER) performance compared to traditional model-based approaches. Practical deployment on resource-constrained hardware, however, requires efficient quantization to reduce latency, energy, and memory without sacrificing reliability. In this paper, we extend Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) by focusing on Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), which incorporates low-precision simulation during training for robustness at ultra-low bitwidths. In particular, we develop a QAT methodology for a neural receiver architecture and benchmark it against a PTQ approach across diverse 3GPP Clustered Delay Line (CDL) channel profiles under both Line-of-Sight (LoS) and Non-LoS (NLoS) conditions, with user velocities up to 40 m/s. Results show that 4-bit and 8-bit QAT models achieve BLERs comparable to FP32 models at a 10% target BLER. Moreover, QAT models succeed in NLoS scenarios where PTQ models fail to reach the 10% BLER target, while also yielding an 8x compression. These results with respect to full-precision demonstrate that QAT is a key enabler of low-complexity and latency-constrained inference at the PHY layer, facilitating real-time processing in 6G edge devices.</description>

      <title>DRL-Based Beam Positioning for LEO Satellite Constellations with Weighted Least Squares</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning based beam weighting framework that couples a policy network with an augmented weighted least squares (WLS) estimator for accurate and low-complexity positioning in multi-beam LEO constellations. Unlike conventional geometry or CSI-dependent approaches, the policy learns directly from uplink pilot responses and geometry features, enabling robust localization without explicit CSI estimation. An augmented WLS jointly estimates position and receiver clock bias, improving numerical stability under dynamic beam geometry. Across representative scenarios, the proposed method reduces the mean positioning error by 99.3% compared with the geometry-based baseline, achieving 0.395 m RMSE with near real-time inference.</description>

      <title>Is Downlink Training Necessary for User-Centric Cell-Free RSMA Systems With Mobile Users?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spectral efficiency (SE) of a ratesplitting multiple access (RSMA) enabled multi-clustered cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system. The access points (APs) in each cluster serve mobile user equipments (UEs) by employing RSMA. The UEs employ successive interference cancellation to decode their data. This work emphasizes the role of downlink (DL) pilots in realizing RSMA benefits in practical CF systems with spatially-correlated Rician channels which observe random phase shifts, pilot contamination, and channel aging due to UE mobility. We numerically show that DL pilots are required for RSMA in user-centric CF mMIMO systems with channel aging to outperform spatial division multiple access. We show that the degraded channel quality due to higher UE velocity and longer resource block lengths significantly reduces the RSMA SE. Increasing the number of clusters can compensate for the SE loss.</description>

      <title>Compressible Dynamics in Deep Overparameterized Low-Rank Learning &amp; Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04112v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While overparameterization in machine learning models offers great benefits in terms of optimization and generalization, it also leads to increased computational requirements as model sizes grow. In this work, we show that by leveraging the inherent low-dimensional structures of data and compressible dynamics within the model parameters, we can reap the benefits of overparameterization without the computational burdens. In practice, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for deep low-rank matrix completion as well as fine-tuning language models. Our approach is grounded in theoretical findings for deep overparameterized low-rank matrix recovery, where we show that the learning dynamics of each weight matrix are confined to an invariant low-dimensional subspace. Consequently, we can construct and train compact, highly compressed factorizations possessing the same benefits as their overparameterized counterparts. In the context of deep matrix completion, our technique substantially improves training efficiency while retaining the advantages of overparameterization. For language model fine-tuning, we propose a method called "Deep LoRA", which improves the existing low-rank adaptation (LoRA) technique, leading to reduced overfitting and a simplified hyperparameter setup, while maintaining comparable efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of Deep LoRA on natural language tasks, particularly when fine-tuning with limited data. Our code is available at https://github.com/cjyaras/deep-lora-transformers.</description>

Abstract: Integrating sensing and communication (ISAC) can help overcome the challenges of limited spectrum and expensive hardware, leading to improved energy and cost efficiency. While full cooperation between sensing and communication can result in significant performance gains, achieving optimal performance requires efficient designs of unified waveforms and beamformers for joint sensing and communication. Sophisticated statistical signal processing and multi-objective optimization techniques are necessary to balance the competing design requirements of joint sensing and communication tasks. As model-based approaches can be suboptimal or too complex, deep learning offers a powerful data-driven alternative, especially when optimal algorithms are unknown or impractical for real-time use. Unified waveform and beamformer design problems for ISAC fall into this category, where fundamental design trade-offs exist between sensing and communication performance metrics, and the underlying models may be inadequate or incomplete. This tutorial paper explores the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance efficiency or reduce complexity in ISAC designs. We emphasize the integration benefits through AI-driven ISAC designs, prioritizing the development of unified waveforms, constellations, and beamforming strategies for both sensing and communication. To illustrate the practical potential of AI-driven ISAC, we present three case studies on waveform, beamforming, and constellation design, demonstrating how unsupervised learning and neural network-based optimization can effectively balance performance, complexity, and implementation constraints.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Temporal Super-Resolution of Energy Data using Generative Adversarial Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10587v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue, this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling tasks by 10%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application scenario is improved by 13%.</description>

      <title>VDW-GNNs: Vector diffusion wavelets for geometric graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce vector diffusion wavelets (VDWs), a novel family of wavelets inspired by the vector diffusion maps algorithm that was introduced to analyze data lying in the tangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold. We show that these wavelets may be effectively incorporated into a family of geometric graph neural networks, which we refer to as VDW-GNNs. We demonstrate that such networks are effective on synthetic point cloud data, as well as on real-world data derived from wind-field measurements and neural activity data. Theoretically, we prove that these new wavelets have desirable frame theoretic properties, similar to traditional diffusion wavelets. Additionally, we prove that these wavelets have desirable symmetries with respect to rotations and translations.</description>

      <title>Multi-Window Temporal Analysis for Enhanced Arrhythmia Classification: Leveraging Long-Range Dependencies in Electrocardiogram Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17406v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective. Arrhythmia classification from electrocardiograms (ECGs) suffers from high false positive rates and limited cross-dataset generalization, particularly for atrial fibrillation (AF) detection where specificity ranges from 0.72 to 0.98 using conventional 30-s analysis windows. While most deep learning approaches analyze isolated 30-s ECG windows, many arrhythmias, including AF and atrial flutter, exhibit diagnostic features that emerge over extended time scales. Approach. We introduce S4ECG, a deep learning architecture based on structured state-space models (S4), designed to capture long-range temporal dependencies by jointly analyzing multiple consecutive ECG windows spanning up to 20 min. We evaluate S4ECG on four publicly available databases for multi-class arrhythmia classification and perform systematic cross-dataset evaluations to assess out-of-distribution robustness. Results. Multi-window analysis consistently outperforms single-window approaches across all datasets, improving macro-averaged AUROC by 1.0-11.6 percentage points. For AF, specificity increases from 0.718-0.979 to 0.967-0.998 at a fixed sensitivity threshold, yielding a 3-10-fold reduction in false positive rates. Significance. Compared with convolutional neural network baselines, the S4 architecture shows superior performance, and multi-window training substantially reduces cross-dataset degradation. Optimal diagnostic windows are 10-20 min, beyond which performance plateaus or degrades. These findings demonstrate that structured incorporation of extended temporal context enhances both arrhythmia classification accuracy and cross-dataset robustness. The identified optimal temporal windows provide practical guidance for ECG monitoring system design and may reflect underlying physiological timescales of arrhythmogenic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Non-Convex Over-the-Air Heterogeneous Federated Learning: A Bias-Variance Trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26722v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming \emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous} wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured, time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL baselines.</description>

      <title>Learning-based Radio Link Failure Prediction Based on Measurement Dataset in Railway Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08851v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a measurement-driven case study on early radio link failure (RLF) warning as device-side network sensing and analytics for proactive mobility management in 5G non-standalone (NSA) railway environments. Using 10~Hz metro-train measurement traces with serving- and neighbor-cell indicators, we benchmark six representative learning models, including CNN, LSTM, XGBoost, Anomaly Transformer, PatchTST, and TimesNet, under multiple observation windows and prediction horizons. Rather than proposing a new prediction architecture, this study focuses on quantifying the feasibility of early warning and the trade-offs among observation context, prediction horizon, and alarm reliability under real railway mobility. Experimental results show that learning models can anticipate RLF-related reliability degradation seconds in advance using lightweight features available on commercial devices. The presented benchmark provides practical insights for sensing-assisted communication control, such as proactive redundancy activation and adaptive handover strategies, aligning with the 6G vision of integrating sensing and analytics into mobility control.</description>
