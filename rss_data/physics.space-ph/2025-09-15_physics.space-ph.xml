      <title>Parallel and perpendicular diffusion of energetic particles in the near-Sun solar wind observed by Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate energetic particle diffusion in the inner heliosphere (approximately 0.06-0.3 AU) explored by Parker Solar Probe (PSP). Parallel (kappa_parallel) and perpendicular (kappa_perp) diffusion coefficients are calculated using second-order quasi-linear theory (SOQLT) and unified nonlinear transport (UNLT) theory, respectively. PSP's in situ measurements of magnetic turbulence spectra, including sub-Alfvenic solar wind, are decomposed into parallel and perpendicular wavenumber spectra via a composite two-component turbulence model. These spectra are then used to compute kappa_parallel and kappa_perp across energies ranging from sub-GeV to GeV. Our results reveal a strong energy and radial distance dependence in kappa_parallel. While kappa_perp remains much smaller, it can increase in regions with relatively high turbulence levels delta B / B0. To validate our results, we estimate kappa_parallel using the upstream time-intensity profile of a solar energetic particle event observed by PSP and compare it with theoretical values from different diffusion models. Our results suggest that the SOQLT-calculated parallel diffusion generally shows better agreement with SEP intensity-derived estimates than the classic QLT model. This indicates that the SOQLT framework, which incorporates resonance broadening and nonlinear corrections and does not require an ad hoc pitch-angle cutoff, may provide a more physically motivated description of energetic particle diffusion near the Sun.</description>

      <title>Magnitude of Short-Wavelength Electric Field Fluctuations in Simulations of Collisionless Plasma Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-amplitude electrostatic fluctuations are routinely observed by spacecraft upon traversal of collisionless shocks in the heliosphere. Kinetic simulations of shocks have struggled to reproduce the amplitude of such fluctuations, complicating efforts to understand their influence on energy dissipation and shock structure. In this paper, 1D particle-in-cell simulations with realistic proton-to-electron mass ratio are used to show that in cases with upstream electron temperature $T_e$ exceeding the ion temperature $T_i$, the magnitude of the fluctuations increases with the electron plasma-to-cyclotron frequency ratio $\omega_{pe}/\Omega_{ce}$, reaching realistic values at $\omega_{pe}/\Omega_{ce} \gtrsim 30$. The large-amplitude fluctuations in the simulations are shown to be associated with electrostatic solitary structures, such as ion phase-space holes. In the cases where upstream temperature ratio is reversed, the magnitude of the fluctuations remains small.</description>

      <title>Advances in aviation radiation mitigation were demonstrated during the Gannon storm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00887v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A validation strategy for aviation radiation hazard mitigation has been completed using two commercial airline flights in 2024 and 2025. We review the strategy primary elements, including the emergence of aviation radiation awareness and collaborative efforts by global aviation and radiological bodies that established mitigation standards. The article highlights biological effects of radiation exposure influenced by altitude, latitude, and geomagnetic conditions, upon aircrew, frequent flyers, and commercial space travelers. It recognizes the SWAG user needs survey report that identifies the need for continuous monitoring and predictive models to ensure long-term occupational and public health safety. The ALARA strategy validation was completed using two UAL 990 flights on B777 200 aircraft between San Francisco and Paris. Each carried the same ARMAS FM7 radiation monitoring unit. One flight occurred during the Gannon storm May 10 and 11, 2024 and one flight occurred during quiet geomagnetic conditions June 8 and 9, 2025. The flight results validated the strategy during extreme space weather, i.e., apply operational controls for shielding to reduce dose. One approach is fly lower magnetic latitudes to gain more Earth magnetic field shielding and the other is fly lower altitudes to use atmosphere depth shielding. Both ALARA shielding methods are controllable in airline operations and air traffic management. This study shows the effectiveness to deviate flight paths to lower magnetic latitude routes and lower altitudes during major geomagnetic storms. Not only does this approach mitigate HF communication outages but it also reduces risks from increased GNSS errors for takeoff and landing navigation. Magnetic field shielding is a major risk reduction factor for radiation, communication, and navigation while altitude shielding reduces radiation hazard risks.</description>

      <title>Interaction of a spatially uniform electron beam with a rotational magnetic hole in a form of a Harris current sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we use particle-in-cell (PIC) numerical simulations to study interaction of a spatially uniform electron beam with a rotational magnetic hole in a form of a Harris current sheet. We vary width of the Harris current sheet to investigate how this affects the quasi-linear relaxation, i.e. plateau formation of the bump-on-tail unstable electron beam. We find that when width of the Harris current sheet approaches and becomes smaller than the electron gyro-radius, quasi-linear relaxation becomes hampered and a positive slope in the electron velocity distribution function (VDF) persists. We explain this by the effects of non-conservation of electron magnetic moment, which, as recent works suggest, can maintain the positive slope of the VDF. In part, this can explain why some electron beams (the ones that interact with narrow magnetic holes with sharp boundaries, represented in our study by a Harris current sheet) in the solar wind travel much longer distances than predicted by the quasi-linear theory, at least in those cases when the electron beams slide along the current sheets that are abundant when the different-speed solar wind streams interact with each other.</description>
