      <title>Characterization of proton focusing from variable-sized hemispherical targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically characterize the focusing behavior of laser-driven proton beams from hemispherical targets of various diameters using mesh radiography. The proton focal location is inferred to be near the geometrical center for the smallest tested hemisphere ($\Psi=D_{hemi}/D_{Laser}=6.1$). However, larger hemispheres ($\Psi=14.6$) degrade the focusing behavior and behave more like flat foils with focal location significantly inside the hemisphere. We also infer a tight virtual focus of $9\pm3~\mu$m through a mesh transition analysis.</description>

      <title>Modelling-driven requirements for Error Field Control Coil application to initial JT-60SA plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JT-60SA is a large superconducting tokamak built in Naka, Japan. After the successful achievement of its first MA-class plasma, the installation of several additional sub-systems, including a set of non-axisymmetric Error Field Correction Coils (EFCC), is ongoing. Optimization of future JT-60SA plasma scenarios will critically depend on the correct use of EFCC, including careful fulfillment of system specifications. In addition to that, preparation and risk mitigation of early ITER operations will greatly benefit from the experience gained by early EFCC application to JT-60SA experiments, in particular to optimize error field detection and control strategies. In this work, EFCC application in JT-60SA Initial Research Phase I perspective scenarios is modeled including plasma response. Impact of (Resonant) Magnetic Perturbations on the different plasma scenarios is assessed for both core and pedestal regions by the linear resistive MHD code MARS-F. The dominant core response to EFs is discussed case by case and compared to mode locking thresholds from literature. Typical current/voltage amplitudes and wave-forms are then compared to EFCC specifications in order to assess a safe operational space.</description>

      <title>Formation of a Tungsten Co-deposition Layer with Microparticles Using Pulsed Laser Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study performed tungsten (W) co-deposition experiments using pulsed laser deposition under exposure to helium/argon plasma in a linear plasma device. Micron-sized spherical W particles formed under co-deposition conditions. It was suggested that these particles grew from nanoparticles via the electrostatic collection of W ions in the plasma plume before deposition.</description>

      <title>Magnetohydrodynamic-guiding-center-particle-in-cell Method for Multiscale Plasma Kinetic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the formulation, algorithm and numerical tests of the magnetohydrodynamic-particle-in-cell (MHD-PIC) method with particles treated under the guiding center approximation, which we term the MHD-gPIC method, and it is implemented in the Athena++ MHD code. The new MHD-gPIC model consists of thermal (cold) fluid and high-energy particles whose dynamics are integrated through guiding center equations including drift motion, with carefully evaluated source terms as particle backreaction. The code is validated with a series of tests, and it is expected to be primarily applicable to study particle acceleration and transport in systems where gyro-resonance is considered insignificant. We also present preliminary studies of particle acceleration during non-relativistic magnetic reconnection.</description>

      <title>Quantum Ornstein-Zernike Theory for Two-Temperature Two-Component Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laboratory plasma production almost always preferentially heats either the ions or electrons, leading to a two-temperature state. High-fidelity modeling of these systems can be achieved with density functional theory molecular dynamics in the two-temperature, adiabatic electron limit. Motivated by this, we construct a statistical mechanics framework for the multi-temperature system that is theoretically consistent with the ab initio calculation. We proceed to derive multi-temperature quantum Ornstein-Zernike equations for the first time. We then construct a two-temperature two-component plasma model using the average atom and compute the radial distribution function, viscosity, ion thermal conductivity, and ion self-diffusion. We verify that we recover the ionic structure and self-diffusion of density functional molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to Compute Linear Landau Damping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fully kinetic simulations of the Vlasov equation require a careful numerical treatment of phase space advections to ensure accuracy and stability in six dimensions. To test the accuracy of full Vlasov codes, we have developed a surprisingly simple, semi-analytical method for calculating the exact solution of the linearized Vlasov-Maxwell system in the time domain. In this work, we introduce the method by calculating the ion density response and the ion distribution function response to an initial ion density perturbation in an electrostatic setup without a magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Ab initio density functional theory approach to warm dense hydrogen: from density response to electronic correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the properties of warm dense hydrogen is of key importance for the modeling of compact astrophysical objects and to understand and further optimize inertial confinement fusion (ICF) applications. The work horse of warm dense matter theory is given by thermal density functional theory (DFT), which, however, suffers from two limitations: (i) its accuracy can depend on the utilized exchange--correlation (XC) functional, which has to be approximated and (ii) it is generally limited to single-electron properties such as the density distribution. Here, we present a new ansatz combining time-dependent DFT results for the dynamic structure factor $S_{ee}(\mathbf{q},\omega)$ with static DFT results for the density response. This allows us to estimate the electron--electron static structure factor $S_{ee}(\mathbf{q})$ of warm dense hydrogen with high accuracy over a broad range of densities and temperatures. In addition to its value for the study of warm dense matter, our work opens up new avenues for the future study of electronic correlations exclusively within the framework of DFT for a host of applications.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional unmagnetized Mach probe analysis and initial flow measurements in reversed-field pinch experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel matrix method of analyzing ion saturation current data from a general three-dimensional (3D) array of unmagnetized Mach probe tips is developed and used with data sets from two 3D Mach probes to make initial measurements of local plasma flow velocity in reversed-field pinch (RFP) experiments in the Madison Symmetric Torus (MST). The two 3D Mach probes are composed of regular polyhedral arrays of six and four tips, respectively, with the six-tip array composed of three orthogonal pairs of mutually opposite tips at the vertices of a regular octahedron and the four-tip array composed of non-opposite tips at the vertices of a regular tetrahedron, the analysis of which is specifically facilitated by the matrix method. Velocity measurement uncertainties for the Mach probes are derived based on uncertainties in probe machining and ion saturation current measurements, and typical relative uncertainties for the probes are estimated to be of order several percent, likely smaller than systematic uncertainties related to the Mach probe calibration constant and experimental uncertainties related to plasma and probe conditioning. Initial results for the octahedral probe show flow speeds of roughly the expected magnitudes based on previous MST measurements but with somes differences in flow direction, while those for the tetrahedron probe show similar flow directions to some previous measurements but also some larger than expected speeds. We consider possible causes for the unexpected results of these initial tests, with a focus on probe conditioning and fast electron issues.</description>

      <title>Mimetic finite difference schemes for transport operators with divergence-free advective field and applications to plasma physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In wave propagation problems, finite difference methods implemented on staggered grids are commonly used to avoid checkerboard patterns and to improve accuracy in the approximation of short-wavelength components of the solutions. In this study, we develop a mimetic finite difference (MFD) method on staggered grids for transport operators with divergence-free advective field that is proven to be energy-preserving in wave problems. This method mimics some characteristics of the summation-by-parts (SBP) operators framework, in particular it preserves the divergence theorem at the discrete level. Its design is intended to be versatile and applicable to wave problems characterized by a divergence-free velocity. As an application, we consider the electrostatic shear Alfv\'en waves (SAWs), appearing in the modeling of plasmas. These waves are solved in a magnetic field configuration recalling that of a tokamak device. The study of the generalized eigenvalue problem associated with the SAWs shows the energy conservation of the discretization scheme, demonstrating the stability of the numerical solution.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Neural Space Weather Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate space weather forecasting is crucial for protecting our increasingly digital infrastructure. Hybrid-Vlasov models, like Vlasiator, offer physical realism beyond that of current operational systems, but are too computationally expensive for real-time use. We introduce a graph-based neural emulator trained on Vlasiator data to autoregressively predict near-Earth space conditions driven by an upstream solar wind. We show how to achieve both fast deterministic forecasts and, by using a generative model, produce ensembles to capture forecast uncertainty. This work demonstrates that machine learning offers a way to add uncertainty quantification capability to existing space weather prediction systems, and make hybrid-Vlasov simulation tractable for operational use.</description>
