      <title>Turbulent Pressure Support in Galaxy Clusters -- Impact of the Hydrodynamical Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The amount of turbulent pressure in galaxy clusters is still debated, especially as for the impact of the dynamical state and the hydro-method used for simulations. We study the turbulent pressure fraction in the intra cluster medium of massive galaxy clusters. We aim to understand the impact of the hydrodynamical scheme, analysis method, and dynamical state on the final properties of galaxy clusters from cosmological simulations. We perform non-radiative simulations of a set of zoom-in regions of seven galaxy clusters with Meshless Finite Mass (MFM) and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). We use three different analysis methods based on: $(i)$ the deviation from hydrostatic equilibrium, $(ii)$ the solenoidal velocity component obtained by a Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition, and $(iii)$ the small-scale velocity obtained through a multi-scale filtering approach. We split the sample of simulated clusters into active and relaxed clusters. Our simulations predict an increased turbulent pressure fraction for active compared to relaxed clusters. This is especially visible for the velocity-based methods. For these, we also find increased turbulence for the MFM simulations compared to SPH, consistent with findings from more idealized simulations. The predicted non-thermal pressure fraction varies between a few percent for relaxed clusters and $\approx13\%$ for active ones within the cluster center and increases towards the outskirts. No clear trend with redshift is visible. Our analysis quantitatively assesses the importance played by the hydrodynamical scheme and the analysis method to determine the non-thermal/turbulent pressure fraction. While our setup is relatively simple (non-radiative runs), our simulations show agreement with previous, more idealized simulations, and make a step further toward the understanding of turbulence.</description>

      <title>Modeling and measuring the anisotropic halo 3-point correlation function: a coordinated study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ongoing spectroscopic galaxy surveys like DESI (arXiv:1611.00037, arXiv:1611.00036) and Euclid (arXiv:2405.13491) will cover unprecedented volumes with a number of objects large enough to effectively probe clustering anisotropies through higher-order statistics. In this work, we present an original and efficient implementation of both a model for the multipole moments of the anisotropic 3-point correlation function (3PCF) and for their estimator. To assess the adequacy of our model, we have predicted the anisotropic 3PCF for a set of dark matter halos at redshift $z = 1$ and compared our prediction with the 3PCF measurement obtained by applying our estimator to a suite of 298 N-body + 3000 approximate mock halo catalogs at the same redshift. The use of the anisotropic component of the 3PCF effectively breaks the degeneracy between the growth rate $f$ and the linear bias $b_1$, allowing us to obtain unbiased estimates for both parameters from a Euclid-like survey. A joint, full anisotropic, 2 and 3-point correlation analysis would also allow us to measure the clustering amplitude $\sigma_8$ along with $f$ and $b_1$ with a precision of approximately 17%, and to effectively constrain all galaxy biasing parameters of the model. However, these results largely exploit information from the isotropic part of the 3PCF signal. The addition of the anisotropic multipoles tightens parameter estimates by just 5% at most. We argue that this modest improvement likely reflects the use of a simplified cosmological model with relatively few free parameters. The 3PCF anisotropic multipoles will prove useful in reducing the impact of projection effects that affect high-dimensional cosmological analyses. To support this conjecture, we provide an example in which an additional source of anisotropy, the Alcock-Paczynski effect, is added to the system.</description>

      <title>Backreaction in Numerical Relativity: Averaging on Newtonian gauge-like hypersurfaces in Einstein Toolkit cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a spatial averaging scheme and use it to study the evolution of spatial averages in large-scale simulations of cosmological structure formation performed with the Einstein Toolkit. The averages are performed on the spatial hypersurfaces of the simulation setup which, at least initially, represent the hypersurfaces of statistical homogeneity and isotropy. We find only negligible cosmic backreaction on these hypersurfaces even on very small scales, but find significant curvature fluctuations of up to $10\%$ in $\Omega_R$ for sub-volumes with radius $\sim200$ Mpc and even larger fluctuations in smaller sub-volumes. In addition, we quantify fluid flow in and out of these sub-volumes. We find this to be significant, up to a $5\%$ change in the density between redshift $z=1$ and $z=0$ of a single sphere of radius $\sim200$ Mpc (and larger for smaller spheres). We suggest this may be important for studies basing averages on volumes co-moving with the simulation hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>Statistical properties of filaments in the cosmic web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the cosmological and constrained ELUCID simulation, this study explores the statistical characteristics of filaments within the cosmic web, focussing on aspects such as the distribution of filament lengths and their radial density profiles. Using the classification of the cosmic web environment through the Hessian matrix of the density field, our primary focus is on how cosmic structures react to the two variables $R_{\rm s}$ and $\lambda_{\rm th}$. The findings show that the volume fractions of knots, filaments, sheets, and voids are highly influenced by the threshold parameter $\lambda_{\rm th}$, with only a slight influence from the smoothing length $R_{\rm s}$. The central axis of the cylindrical filament is pinpointed using the medial-axis thinning algorithm of the COWS method. It is observed that median filament lengths tend to increase as the smoothing lengths increase. Analysis of filament length functions at different values of $R_{\rm s}$ indicates a reduction in shorter filaments and an increase in longer filaments as $R_{\rm s}$ increases, peaking around $2.5R_{\rm s}$. The study also shows that the radial density profiles of filaments are markedly affected by the parameters $R_{\rm s}$ and $\lambda_{\rm th}$, showing a valley at approximately $2R_{\rm s}$, with increases in the threshold leading to higher amplitudes of the density profile. Moreover, shorter filaments tend to have denser profiles than their longer counterparts.</description>

      <title>Redshift dependence of FRB host dispersion measures across cosmic epochs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We constrain the redshift dependence of (rest frame) host galaxy dispersion measures of localized FRBs by assuming it to vary as a simple power law ($\propto (1+z)^{\alpha}$). We simultaneously fit $\alpha$ as well as the host dispersion measure to the data of FRBs with known redshifts. We find that $\alpha\approx 0$ is preferred over higher values of $\alpha$ with either a positive or negative sign. Such constraints have implications for our understanding of galaxy formation and can be used to inform galaxy and large scale simulations.</description>

      <title>Quintessential early dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a unified model of early and late dark energy. We call it {\it quintessential early dark energy} model in which early and late dark energy are explained by a single scalar field. In other words two different energy scales are related by a single scalar field potential. To achieve this we introduce the modified steep exponential potential. This potential has a hilltop nature during the early time which consists of a flat region followed by a steep region. This nature of the potential plays a crucial role in achieving early dark energy solution. During recent time, the potential can almost mimic the cosmological constant which can result into late time acceleration. We also constrain and compare the models for steep exponential, modified steep exponential, axionlike and power law potentials by using the available background cosmological data from CMB, BAO (including DESI DR1 2024), supernovae (Pantheon$+$, DESY5 and Union3) and Hubble parameter measurements. The maximum improvement we get in the present value of Hubble parameter compared to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model is for the axionlike potential. For other potentials the constraints are similar to the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Chasing cosmic inflation: constraints for inflationary models and reheating insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of different choice of prior's range for the reheating epoch on cosmic inflation parameter inference in light of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy measurements from the Planck 2018 legacy release in combination with BICEP/Keck Array 2018 data and additional late-time cosmological observations such as uncalibrated Type Ia Supernovae from the Pantheon catalogue, baryon acoustic oscillations and redshift space distortions from SDSS/BOSS/eBOSS. Here, we explore in particular the implications for the combination of reheating and inflationary-model parameter space considering $R+R^2$ inflation and a broad class of $\alpha$-attractor and D-brane models. These inflationary models completely cover the $n_s$-$r$ parameter space allowed by Planck and BICEP/Keck data and represent good targets for future CMB and large-scale structure experiments. We perform a Bayesian model comparison of inflationary models, taking into account the reheating uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Attenuation of Cosmic Ray Electron Boosted Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a model of boosted dark matter (DM), where a fraction of DM is upscattered to relativistic energies by cosmic ray electrons. Such interactions responsible for boosting the DM also attenuate its flux at the Earth. Considering a simple model of constant interaction cross-section, we make analytical estimates of the variation of the attenuation ceiling with the DM mass and confirm it numerically. We then extend our analysis to a $Z'$-mediated leptophilic DM model. We show that the attenuation ceiling remains nearly model-independent for DM and mediator particles heavier than the electron, challenging some previous discussions on this topic. Using the XENONnT direct detection experiment, we illustrate how constraints based on energy-dependent scattering can significantly differ from those based on an assumed constant cross-section. This highlights the importance of re-evaluating these constraints in the context of specific models.</description>

      <title>A New Twist on Spinning (A)dS Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massless spinning correlators in cosmology are extremely complicated. In contrast, the scattering amplitudes of massless particles with spin are very simple. We propose that the reason for the unreasonable complexity of these correlators lies in the use of inconvenient kinematic variables. For example, in de Sitter space, consistency with unitarity and the background isometries imply that the correlators must be conformally covariant and also conserved. However, the commonly used kinematic variables for correlators do not make all of these properties manifest. In this paper, we introduce twistor space as a powerful way to satisfy all kinematic constraints. We show that conformal correlators of conserved currents can be written as twistor integrals, where the conservation condition translates into holomorphicity of the integrand. The functional form of the twistor-space correlators is very simple and easily bootstrapped. For the case of three-point functions, we verify explicitly that this reproduces known results in embedding space. We also perform a half-Fourier transform of the twistor-space correlators to obtain their counterparts in momentum space. We conclude that twistors provide a promising new avenue to study conformal correlation functions that exposes their hidden simplicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we use a sample anisotropic but spatially homogeneous metric to look at the properties of Segre type [1(11,1)] universes, that behave like vacuum energy along a spatial plane (two stresses equal to the negative density) but have distinct stress along the third spatial axis. We examine situations with simple relationships between the distinct and degenerate stresses, finding a closed form parameterizations for the case where the distinct stress is equal to zero and finding new conditions in which the case with all stresses equal has a closed form parameterization. We also use numerical methods to illustrate possible behaviors for the case where the distinct stress is the negative of the degenerate stresses.</description>

      <title>Constraining viscous-fluid models in $f(Q)$ gravity using cosmic measurements and large-scale structure data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the effects of bulk viscosity on the accelerating expansion and large-scale structure formation of a universe in which the underlying gravitational interaction is described by $f(Q)$ gravity. Various toy models of the $f(Q)$ gravity theory, including power-law ($f_{1\rm{CDM}}$), exponential ($f_{2\rm{CDM}}$), and logarithmic ($f_{3\rm{CDM}}$) are considered. To test the cosmological viability of these models, we use 57 Hubble parameter data points (OHD), 1048 supernovae distance modulus (SNIa), their combined analysis (OHD+SNIa), 14 growth rate ($f$-data), and 30 redshift-space distortions ($f\sigma_8$) datasets. We compute the best-fit values $\Omega_m, H_0$ and exponents $\{n, p, \gamma\}$ including the bulk viscosity coefficient $\zeta_0$, through a detailed statistical analysis. Moreover, we study linear cosmological perturbations and compute the density contrast \(\delta(z)\), growth factor $D(z)$, growth rate $(f(z)$, and redshift-space distortion $f\sigma_8(z)$. Based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian / Schwartz Information Criterion (BIC), a statistical comparison of the $f(Q)$ gravity models with \lcdm is made. From our statistical analysis of cosmic measurements, we found an underestimation of all models on the OHD data; therefore, statistical viability led us to weigh it in favour of SNIa data which resulted in the exponential ($f_{2\rm{CDM}}$) model without bulk viscosity being the most plausible alternative model, while on average the $f_{1\rm{CDM}}$ model performed statistically the weakest. We also found that adding bulk viscosity did not improve the fit of the models to all observational data.</description>

      <title>Reconciling Cosmological Tensions with Inelastic Dark Matter and Dark Radiation in a $\boldsymbol{U(1)_D}$ Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel and comprehensive particle physics framework that addresses multiple cosmological tensions observed in recent measurements of the Hubble parameter, $S_8$, and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data. Our model, termed `{\bf SIDR+$\boldsymbol{z_t}$}' (Self Interacting Dark Radiation with transition redshift), is based on an inelastic dark matter (IDM) scenario coupled with dark radiation, governed by a $U(1)_D$ gauge symmetry. This framework naturally incorporates cold dark matter (DM), SIDR, and the interactions between these components. The fluid-like behavior of the dark radiation component, effectively mitigates both the Hubble and $S_8$ tensions by suppressing free-streaming effects. Simultaneously, the interacting DM-DR system attenuates the matter power spectrum at small scales, potentially reconciling discrepancies in Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly-$\alpha$) observations. The inelastic nature of DM provides a distinct temperature dependence for the DM-DR interaction rate determined by the mass-splitting between the inelastic dark fermions which is crucial for resolving the Ly-$\alpha$ discrepancies. We present a cosmologically consistent analysis of the model by solving the relevant Boltzmann equations to obtain the energy density and number density evolution of different species of the model. The DR undergoes two ``steps" of increased energy density when the heavier dark species freeze out and become non-relativistic, transferring their entropy to the dark radiation and enhancing $\Delta N{\rm eff}$. The analysis showcases the model's potential to uphold the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) prediction of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ but dominantly producing additional contributions prior to recombination, while simultaneously achieving correct relic density of DM though an hybrid of freeze-in and non-thermal production.</description>

      <title>Multi-dimensional optimisation of the scanning strategy for the LiteBIRD space mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large angular scale surveys in the absence of atmosphere are essential for measuring the primordial $B$-mode power spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Since this proposed measurement is about three to four orders of magnitude fainter than the temperature anisotropies of the CMB, in-flight calibration of the instruments and active suppression of systematic effects are crucial. We investigate the effect of changing the parameters of the scanning strategy on the in-flight calibration effectiveness, the suppression of the systematic effects themselves, and the ability to distinguish systematic effects by null-tests. Next-generation missions such as LiteBIRD, modulated by a Half-Wave Plate (HWP), will be able to observe polarisation using a single detector, eliminating the need to combine several detectors to measure polarisation, as done in many previous experiments and hence avoiding the consequent systematic effects. While the HWP is expected to suppress many systematic effects, some of them will remain. We use an analytical approach to comprehensively address the mitigation of these systematic effects and identify the characteristics of scanning strategies that are the most effective for implementing a variety of calibration strategies in the multi-dimensional space of common spacecraft scan parameters. We also present Falcons, a fast spacecraft scanning simulator that we developed to investigate this scanning parameter space.</description>

      <title>21 Balmer Jump Street: The Nebular Continuum at High Redshift and Implications for the Bright Galaxy Problem, UV Continuum Slopes, and Early Stellar Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study, from both a theoretical and observational perspective, the physical origin and spectroscopic impact of extreme nebular emission in high-redshift galaxies. The nebular continuum, which can appear during extreme starbursts, is of particular importance as it tends to redden UV slopes and has a significant contribution to the UV luminosities of galaxies. Furthermore, its shape can be used to infer the gas density and temperature of the ISM. First, we provide a theoretical background, showing how different stellar populations (SPS models, IMFs, and stellar temperatures) and nebular conditions impact observed galaxy spectra. We demonstrate that, for systems with strong nebular continuum emission, 1) UV fluxes can increase by up to 0.7~magnitudes (or more in the case of hot/massive stars) above the stellar continuum, which may help reconcile the surprising abundance of bright high-redshift galaxies and the elevated UV luminosity density at $z&gt;10$, 2) at high gas densities, UV slopes can redden from $\beta\lesssim-2.5$ to $\beta\sim-1$, 3) observational measurements of $\xi_{ion}$ are grossly underestimated, and 4) UV downturns from two-photon emission can masquerade as DLAs. Second, we present a dataset of 58 galaxies observed with NIRSpec on JWST at $2.5&lt;z&lt;9.0$ that are selected to have strong nebular continuum emission via the detection of the Balmer jump. Five of the 58 spectra are consistent with being dominated by nebular emission, exhibiting both a Balmer jump and a UV downturn consistent with two-photon emission. For some galaxies, this may imply the presence of hot massive stars and a top-heavy IMF. We conclude by exploring the properties of spectroscopically confirmed $z&gt;10$ galaxies, finding that UV slopes and UV downturns are in some cases redder or steeper than expected from SPS models, which may hint at more exotic (e.g. hotter/more massive stars or AGN) ionizing sources.</description>

      <title>Event Horizon Telescope observations exclude compact objects in baseline mimetic gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mimetic gravity has gained significant appeal in cosmological contexts, but static spherically symmetric space-times within the baseline theory are highly non-trivial: the two natural solutions are a naked singularity and a black hole space-time obtained through an appropriate gluing procedure. We study the shadow properties of these two objects, finding both to be pathological. In particular, the naked singularity does not cast a shadow, whereas the black hole casts a shadow which is too small. We argue that the Event Horizon Telescope images of M87$^{\star}$ and Sgr A$^{\star}$ rule out the baseline version of mimetic gravity, preventing the theory from successfully accounting for the dark sector on cosmological scales. Our results highlight an interesting complementarity between black hole imaging observations and modified gravity theories of cosmological interest.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity of thermal state in early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our work, we perform a detailed study of the Krylov complexity of the thermal state across the entire early universe, encompassing the inflation, radiation-dominated period, and matter-dominated period, which is for the single field inflation. We utilize both the closed system's method and open system's method to achieve this goal. To accurately calculate the Krylov complexity, we purified the thermal state, resulting in a pure state with two modes. Our analysis with both methods indicates that the Krylov complexity will increase during inflation, but will saturate at constant values during the radiation-dominated and matter-dominated periods, where the generation of particles via preheating leads to this evolution. Furthermore, our findings reveal that inflation behaves as a strong dissipative system, while the radiation-dominated and matter-dominated periods act as weak dissipative systems. The chaotic feature during these periods follows a similar trend to the Krylov complexity. This research has the potential to provide new insights into the exploration of Krylov complexity in cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paradigm of the inflationary universe provides a possible explanation for several observed cosmological properties. In order for such solutions to be successful, the universe must convert the energy stored in the inflaton potential into standard model particles through a process known as reheating. In this paper, we reconsider the reheating process for the case where the inflaton potential respects an approximate (but spontaneously broken) conformal symmetry during the reheating epoch. After reviewing the Effective Field Theory of Reheating, we present solutions for the nonlinear oscillations of the inflaton field, derive the corresponding Hill's equation for the coupled reheating field, and determine the stability diagram for parametric resonance. For this class of models -- the simplest realization being a scalar field with a quartic term -- the expansion of the universe drives the coupled field toward a more unstable part of parameter space, in contrast to the standard case. We also generalize this class of models to include quadratic breaking terms in the potential during the reheating epoch and address the process of stability in that universality class of models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Slow first-order phase transitions generate large inhomogeneities that can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). We show that the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum then consists of a primary component sourced by bubble collisions and a secondary one induced by large perturbations. The latter gives the dominant peak if $\beta/H_0 &lt; 12$, impacting, in particular, the interpretation of the recent PTA data. The GW signal associated with a particular PBH population is stronger than in typical scenarios because of a negative non-Gaussianity of the perturbations and it has a distinguishable shape with two peaks.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the elastic scattering cross section between dark matter and protons using the DES Year 3 weak lensing data. This scattering induces a dark acoustic oscillation structure in the matter power spectra. To address non-linear effects at low redshift, we utilize principal component analysis alongside a limited set of $N$-body simulations, improving the reliability of our matter power spectrum prediction. We further perform a robust Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to derive the upper bounds on the DM-proton elastic scattering cross-section, assuming different velocity dependencies. Our results, presented as the first Frequentist upper limits, are compared with the ones obtained by Bayesian approach. Compared with the upper limits derived from the Planck cosmic microwave background data, our findings from DES Year 3 data exhibit improvements of up to a factor of five. In addition, we forecast the future sensitivities of the China Space Station Telescope, the upcoming capabilities of this telescope could improve the current limits by approximately one order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>A simple prediction of the nonlinear matter power spectrum in Brans-Dicke gravity from linear theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brans-Dicke (BD), one of the first proposed scalar-tensor theories of gravity, effectively makes the gravitational constant of general relativity (GR) time-dependent. Constraints on the BD parameter $\omega$ serve as a benchmark for testing GR, which is recovered in the limit $\omega \rightarrow \infty$. Current small-scale astrophysical constraints $\omega \gtrsim 10^5$ are much tighter than large-scale cosmological constraints $\omega \gtrsim 10^3$, but the two decouple if the true theory of gravity features screening. On the largest cosmological scales, BD approximates the most general second-order scalar-tensor (Horndeski) theory, so constraints here have wider implications. These constraints will improve with upcoming large-scale structure and cosmic microwave background surveys. To constrain BD with weak gravitational lensing, one needs its nonlinear matter power spectrum $P_\mathrm{BD}$. By comparing the boost $B = P_\mathrm{BD}/P_\mathrm{GR}$ from linear theory and nonlinear $N$-body simulations, we show that the nonlinear boost can simply be predicted from linear theory if the BD and GR universes are parameterized in a way that makes their early cosmological evolution and quasilinear power today similar. In particular, they need the same $H_0 / \sqrt{\smash[b]{G_{\rm eff}(a=0)}}$ and $\sigma_8$, where $G_{\rm eff}$ is the (effective) gravitational strength. Our prediction is $1\%$ accurate for $\omega \geq 100$, $z \leq 3$, and $k \leq 1\,h/\mathrm{Mpc}$; and $2\%$ up to $k \leq 5\,h/\mathrm{Mpc}$. It also holds for $G_\mathrm{BD}$ that do not match Newton's constant today, so one can study GR with different gravitational constants $G_\mathrm{GR}$ by sending $\omega \rightarrow \infty$. We provide a code that computes $B$ with the linear Einstein-Boltzmann solver hi_class and multiplies it by the nonlinear $P_\mathrm{GR}$ from EuclidEmulator2 to predict $P_\mathrm{BD}$.</description>

      <title>The Hierarchical Cosmic Web and Assembly Bias</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of galaxy distributions is paramount for cosmological analysis using galaxy redshift surveys. However, this endeavor is often hindered by the computational complexity of resolving the dark matter halos that host these galaxies. To address this challenge, we propose the development of effective assembly bias models down to small scales, i.e., going beyond the local density dependence capturing non-local cosmic evolution. We introduce a hierarchical cosmic web classification that indirectly captures up to third-order long- and short-range non-local bias terms. This classification system also enables us to maintain positive definite parametric bias expansions. Specifically, we subdivide the traditional cosmic web classification, which is based on the eigenvalues of the tidal field tensor, with an additional classification based on the Hessian matrix of the negative density contrast. We obtain the large-scale dark matter field on a mesh with $\sim3.9\,h^{-1}$ Mpc cell side resolution through Augmented Lagrangian Perturbation Theory. To assess the effectiveness of our model, we conduct tests using a reference halo catalogue extracted from the UNIT project simulation, which was run within a cubical volume of 1 $h^{-1}$ Gpc side. The resulting mock halo catalogs, generated through our approach, exhibit a high level of accuracy in terms of the one-, two- and three-point statistics. They reproduce the reference power-spectrum within better than 2 percent accuracy up to wavenumbers $k\sim0.8\,h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and provide accurate bispectra within the scales that are crucial for cosmological analysis. This effective bias approach provides a forward model appropriate for field-level cosmological inference and holds significant potential for facilitating cosmological analysis of galaxy redshift surveys, particularly in the context of projects such as DESI, EUCLID, and LSST.</description>

      <title>Obviating PBH overproduction for SIGWs generated by Pulsar Timing Arrays in loop corrected EFT of bounce</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to unravel the present situation of the PBH overproduction problem, our study emphasizes the critical role played by the equation of state (EoS) parameter $w$ within the framework of effective field theory (EFT) of non-singular bounce. Our analysis focuses on a wide range of EoS parameter values that are still optimal for explaining the latest data from the pulsar timing array (PTA). As a result of our study, the most advantageous window, $0.31 \leq w \leq 1/3$, is identified as the location of a substantial PBH abundance, $f_{\rm PBH} \in (10^{-3},1)$ with large mass PBHs, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-7}-10^{-3})M_{\odot}$, in the SIGW interpretation of the PTA signal. When confronted with PTA, we find that the overproduction avoiding circumstances are between $1\sigma-2\sigma$, while the EoS parameter lies inside the narrow window, $0.31&lt;w\leq 1/3$. We propose a regularized-renormalized-resummed (RRR) scalar power spectrum that is large enough to produce EoS dependent scalar generated gravitational waves compatible with PTA evidence, while satisfying the perturbativity, causality, and unitarity criteria, within the range of $0.88 \leq c_{s} \leq 1$.</description>

      <title>Brightest Cluster Galaxy Offsets in Cold Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00928v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The distribution of offsets between the brightest cluster galaxies of galaxy clusters and the centroid of their dark matter distributions is a promising probe of the underlying dark matter physics. In particular, since this distribution is sensitive to the shape of the potential in galaxy cluster cores, it constitutes a test of dark matter self-interaction on the largest mass scales in the universe. We examine these offsets in three suites of modern cosmological simulations; IllustrisTNG, MillenniumTNG and BAHAMAS. For clusters above $10^{14}\rm{M_\odot}$, we examine the dependence of the offset distribution on gravitational softening length, the method used to identify centroids, redshift, mass, baryonic physics, and establish the stability of our results with respect to various nuisance parameter choices. We find that offsets are overwhelmingly measured to be smaller than the minimum converged length scale in each simulation, with a median offset of $\sim1\rm{kpc}$ in the highest resolution simulation considered, TNG300-1, which uses a gravitational softening length of $1.48\rm{kpc}$. We also find that centroids identified via source extraction on smoothed dark matter and stellar particle data are consistent with the potential minimum, but that observationally relevant methods sensitive to cluster strong gravitational lensing scales, or those using gas as a tracer for the potential can overestimate offsets by factors of $\sim10$ and $\sim30$, respectively. This has the potential to reduce tensions with existing offset measurements which have served as evidence for a nonzero dark matter self-interaction cross section.</description>

      <title>Continuous Gravitational Waves: A New Window to Look for Heavy Non-annihilating Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sun-like stars can transmute into comparable mass black holes by steadily accumulating heavy non-annihilating dark matter particles over the course of their lives. If such stars form in binary systems, they could give rise to quasi-monochromatic, persistent gravitational waves, commonly known as continuous gravitational waves, as they inspiral toward one another. We demonstrate that next-generation space-based detectors, e.g., Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and Big Bang Observer (BBO), can provide novel constraints on dark matter parameters (dark matter mass and its interaction cross-section with the nucleons) by probing gravitational waves from transmuted Sun-like stars that are in close binaries. Our projected constraints depend on several astrophysical uncertainties, nevertheless, are competitive with the existing constraints obtained from cosmological measurements as well as terrestrial direct searches, demonstrating a notable science-case for these space-based gravitational wave detectors as probes of particle dark matter.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Galaxy Cluster HI Mass Recovery with CHIME at Redshifts z = 1 and 2 via the IllustrisTNG Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) is a drift-scan interferometer designed to map the entire northern sky every 24 hours. The all-sky coverage and sensitivity to neutral hydrogen flux at intermediate redshifts makes the instrument a resource for other exciting science in addition to cosmology for which it was originally designed. Characterizing the contents of CHIME's beam-smoothed maps will aid in planning novel use-cases for the instrument, particularly those pertaining to galaxy evolution studies. Here, we demonstrate its utility for the study of the HI content of stacked galaxy populations across environments. Focusing first on galaxy clusters, we use simulated data from the IllustrisTNG project to understand the relative contribution of objects that fall into CHIME's synthesized beam to the observed HI flux using stacking analyses at a couple of representative redshifts. We find that there is an appreciable difference in the estimated stacked flux when galaxy clusters or cluster member galaxies are used as tracers compared to stacking on a general galaxy catalog. Stacking on galaxy clusters, we report that it is possible to recover an average $M_\mathrm{HI}$ for clusters as a function of redshift and selection criteria.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-attractor potentials in loop quantum cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform in this work an analysis of the background dynamics for $\alpha$-attractor models in the context of loop quantum cosmology. Particular attention is given to the determination of the duration of the inflationary phase that is preceded by the quantum bounce in these models. From an analysis of the general predictions for these models, it is shown that we can be able to put constraints in the parameter $\alpha$ of the potentials and also on the quantum model itself, especially the Barbero-Immirzi parameter. In particular, the constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio and spectral tilt of the cosmological perturbations limit the $\alpha$ parameter of the potentials to values such that $\alpha_{n=0} \lesssim 10$, $\alpha_{n=1} \lesssim 17$ and $\alpha_{n=2} \lesssim 67$, for the $\alpha$ attractors T, E, and $n=2$ models, respectively. Using the constraints on the minimal amount of e-folds of expansion from the quantum bounce up to the end of inflation leads to the upper bounds for the Barbero-Immirzi parameter for the $\alpha$-attractor models studied in this work: $\gamma_{n=0} \lesssim 51.2$, $\gamma_{n=1}\lesssim 63.4$ and $\gamma_{n=2} \lesssim 64.2$, which are obtained when fixing the parameter $\alpha$ in the potential at the values saturating the upper bounds given above for each model.</description>

      <title>Transmon Qubit Constraints on Dark Matter-Nucleon Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We recently pointed out that power measurements of single quasiparticle devices can be used to detect dark matter. These devices have the lowest known energy thresholds, far surpassing standard direct detection experiments, requiring energy deposition above only about an meV. We calculate dark matter induced quasiparticle densities in transmon qubits, and use the latest transmon qubit measurements that provide one of the strongest existing lab-based bounds on dark matter-nucleon scattering below about 100 MeV. We strongly constrain sub-component dark matter, using both a dark matter population thermalized in the Earth as well as the dark matter wind from the Galactic halo. We demonstrate future potential sensitivities using devices with low quasiparticle densities.</description>

      <title>Universal properties of the evolution of the Universe in modified loop quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically study the evolution of the Universe in the framework of a modified loop quantum cosmological model (mLQC-I) with various inflationary potentials, including chaotic, Starobinsky, generalized Starobinsky, polynomials of the first and second kinds, generalized T- models and natural inflation. In all these models, the big bang singularity is represented by a quantum bounce, and the evolution of the Universe both before and after the bounce is universal and weakly depends on the inflationary potentials, as long as the evolution is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton at the bounce. In particular, the evolution in the pre-bounce region can be universally divided into three different phases: pre-bouncing, pre-transition, and pre-de Sitter. The pre-bouncing phase occurs immediately before the quantum bounce, during which the evolution of the Universe is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton. Thus, the equation of state of the inflaton is about one, w = 1. Soon, the inflation potential takes over, so w rapidly falls from one to negative one. This pre-transition phase is very short and quickly turns into the pre-de Sitter phase, whereby the effective cosmological constant with a Planck size takes over and dominates the rest of the contracting phase. In the entire pre-bounce regime, the evolution of the expansion factor and the inflaton can be approximated by analytical solutions, which are universal and independent of the inflation potentials.</description>

      <title>An indirect search for dark matter with a combined analysis of dwarf spheroidal galaxies from VERITAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the nature and identity of dark matter is a key goal in the physics community. In the case that TeV-scale dark matter particles decay or annihilate into standard model particles, very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays (greater than 100 GeV) will be present in the final state. The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) is an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope array that can indirectly detect VHE gamma rays in an energy range of 100 GeV to &gt; 30 TeV. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are ideal candidates in the search for dark matter due to their high dark matter content, high mass-to-light ratios, and their low gamma-ray fluxes from astrophysical processes. This study uses a legacy data set of 638 hours collected on 17 dSphs, built over 11 years with an observing strategy optimized according to the dark matter content of the targets. The study addresses a broad dark matter particle mass range, extending from 200 GeV to 30 PeV. In the absence of a detection, we set the upper limits on the dark matter velocity-weighted annihilation cross section.</description>
