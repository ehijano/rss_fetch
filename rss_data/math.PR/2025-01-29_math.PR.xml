      <title>Extremal eigenvectors of sparse random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of sparse random matrices, which includes the adjacency matrix of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph ${\bf G}(N,p)$. For $N^{-1+o(1)}\leq p\leq 1/2$, we show that the non-trivial edge eigenvectors are asymptotically jointly normal. The main ingredient of the proof is an algorithm that directly computes the joint eigenvector distributions, without comparisons with GOE. The method is applicable in general. As an illustration, we also use it to prove the normal fluctuation in quantum ergodicity at the edge for Wigner matrices. Another ingredient of the proof is the isotropic local law for sparse matrices, which at the same time improves several existing results.</description>

      <title>Comparison theorems for the minimum eigenvalue of a random positive-semidefinite matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a new comparison principle for the minimum eigenvalue of a sum of independent random positive-semidefinite matrices. The principle states that the minimum eigenvalue of the matrix sum is controlled by the minimum eigenvalue of a Gaussian random matrix that inherits its statistics from the summands. This methodology is powerful because of the vast arsenal of tools for treating Gaussian random matrices. As applications, the paper presents short, conceptual proofs of some old and new results in high-dimensional statistics. It also settles a long-standing open question in computational linear algebra about the injectivity properties of very sparse random matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to establish the Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund (MZ) type law of large numbers for the randomly weighted sums with weights chosen randomly, uniformly over the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We also establish a theorem that describes the rate of convergence in the law of large numbers for these weighted sums.</description>

      <title>On the subcritical self-catalytic branching Brownian motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-catalytic branching Brownian motions (SBBM) are extensions of the classical one-dimensional branching Brownian motions by incorporating pairwise branchings catalyzed by the intersection local times of the particle pairs. These processes naturally arise as the moment duals of certain reaction-diffusion equations perturbed by multiplicative space-time white noise. For the subcritical case of the catalytic branching mechanism, we construct the SBBM allowing an infinite number of initial particles. Additionally, we establish the coming down from infinity (CDI) property for these systems and characterize their CDI rates.</description>

      <title>Lambda-Fleming-Viot processes arising in logistic Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson processes with a large carrying capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a continuous-time Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson process with logistic competition in a regime of weak competition, or equivalently of a large carrying capacity. Individuals reproduce at random times independently of each other but die at a rate which increases with the population size. When individuals reproduce, they produce a random number of offspring, drawn according to some probability distribution on the natural integers. We keep track of the number of descendants of the initial individuals by adding neutral markers to the individuals, which are inherited by one's offspring. We then consider several scaling limits of the measure-valued process describing the distribution of neutral markers in the population, as well as the population size, when the competition parameter tends to zero. Three regimes emerge, depending on the tail of the offspring distribution. When the offspring distribution admits a second moment (actually a $ 2+\delta $ moment for some positive $ \delta $), the fluctuations of the population size around its carrying capacity are small and the neutral types asymptotically follow a Fleming-Viot process. When the offspring distribution has a power-law decay with exponent $ \alpha \in (1,2) $, the population size remains most of the time close to its carrying capacity with some (short-lived) fluctuations, and the neutral types evolve in the limit according to a generalised $ \Lambda $-Fleming-Viot process. When the exponent $ \alpha $ is equal to 1, the time scale of the fluctuations changes drastically, as well as the order of magnitude of the population size. In that case the limiting dynamics of the neutral markers is given by the dual of the Bolthausen-Sznitman coalescent.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions for contact processes on one-dimensional networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the survival/extinction phase transition for contact processes with quenched disorder. The disorder is given by a locally finite random graph with vertices indexed by the integers that is assumed to be invariant under index shifts and augments the nearest-neighbour lattice by additional long-range edges. We provide sufficient conditions that imply the existence of a subcritical phase and therefore the non-triviality of the phase transition. Our results apply to instances of scale-free random geometric graphs with any integrable degree distribution. The present work complements previously developed techniques to establish the existence of a subcritical phase on Poisson--Gilbert graphs and Poisson--Delaunay triangulations (M\'enard et al., Ann. Sci. \'Ec. Norm. Sup\'er., 2016), on Galton--Watson trees (Bhamidi et al., Ann. Probab., 2021) and on locally tree-like random graphs (Nam et al., Trans. Am. Math. Soc., 2022), all of which require exponential decay of the degree distribution. Two applications of our approach are particularly noteworthy: Firstly, for Gilbert graphs derived from stationary point processes on $\mathbb{R}$ marked with i.i.d. random radii, our results are sharp. We show that there is a non-trivial phase transition if and only if the graph is locally finite. Secondly, for independent Bernoulli long-range percolation on $\mathbb{Z}$, with coupling constants $J_{x,y}\asymp |x-y|^{-\delta}$, we verify a conjecture of Can (Electron. Commun. Probab., 2015) stating the non-triviality of the phase transition whenever $\delta&gt;2$. Although our approach utilises the restrictive topology of the line, we believe that the results are indicative of the behaviour of contact processes on spatial random graphs also in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>On a formulation of the central limit theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A non-classical formulation of the central limit theorem is given for sequences of independent random variables with finite second moments. Singular sequences whose members all have a degenerate or normal distribution are excluded from consideration. The condition of uniform convergence is imposed on the improper integrals defining the variances. Under the conditions of non-singularity and uniform convergence, the central limit theorem is valid if and only if the total variance increases indefinitely.</description>

      <title>Characterization of laws associated to the quadrirational Yang-Baxter maps -- the ultimate case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Sasada and Uozumi (2024) discovered an independence property that holds for independent random variables $X$ and $Y$ that follow a generalized second kind beta distribution. They showed that when a certain map $F^{(\alpha,\beta)}$, parameterized by two positive parameters $\alpha,\beta$, $\alpha\neq\beta$, is applied to the pair $(X,Y)$, it produces another pair $(U,V)$ of independent generalized second kind beta distributed random variables. Interestingly, the boundary cases of $\alpha\in\{0,\infty\}$ or $\beta\in\{0,\infty\}$ can be related to one of the Matsumoto-Yor independence properties identified by Koudou and Vallois (2012).
  To investigate these independence properties, we introduce specially designed Laplace-type transforms. First, we carefully explain the connection between the results from Sasada and Uozumi (2024) and Koudou and Vallois (2012). Next, we focus on the characterization of second kind beta and generalized second kind beta distributions through the independence preserving map $F^{(\alpha,\infty)}$. Finally, considerably extending the methodology developed for the case $(\alpha,\infty)$, we prove the characterization of generalized second kind beta distributions in case $(\alpha,\beta)\in(0,\infty)^2$, $\alpha\neq\beta$.</description>

      <title>Generative diffusion models from a PDE perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have become the de facto framework for generating new datasets. The core of these models lies in the ability to reverse a diffusion process in time. The goal of this manuscript is to explain, from a PDE perspective, how this method works and how to derive the PDE governing the reverse dynamics as well as to study its solution analytically. By linking forward and reverse dynamics, we show that the reverse process's distribution has its support contained within the original distribution. Consequently, diffusion methods, in their analytical formulation, do not inherently regularize the original distribution, and thus, there is no generalization principle. This raises a question: where does generalization arise, given that in practice it does occur? Moreover, we derive an explicit solution to the reverse process's SDE under the assumption that the starting point of the forward process is fixed. This provides a new derivation that links two popular approaches to generative diffusion models: stable diffusion (discrete dynamics) and the score-based approach (continuous dynamics). Finally, we explore the case where the original distribution consists of a finite set of data points. In this scenario, the reverse dynamics are explicit (i.e., the loss function has a clear minimizer), and solving the dynamics fails to generate new samples: the dynamics converge to the original samples. In a sense, solving the minimization problem exactly is "too good for its own good" (i.e., an overfitting regime).</description>

      <title>A New Proof for the Linear Filtering and Smoothing Equations, and Asymptotic Expansion of Nonlinear Filtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach to the linear filtering and smoothing problem and demonstrate its applicability to nonlinear filtering. For the linear case, our main theorem provides an explicit expression for the conditional distribution of the hidden process given the observations, leading to a novel derivation of the linear filtering and smoothing equations. Moreover, the theorem offers an efficient framework for computing the asymptotic expansion of nonlinear filtering.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a Kyle model under Gaussian assumptions where a risk-averse informed trader has imperfect information on the fundamental price of an asset. We show that an equilibrium can be constructed by considering an optimal transport problem that is solved under a measure that renders the utility of the informed trader martingale and a filtering problem under the historical measure.</description>

      <title>Statistical solutions to the Schr\"odinger map equation in 1D, via the randomly forced Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of statistically stationary solutions to the Schr\"odinger map equation on a one-dimensional domain, with null Neumann boundary conditions. We deal directly with the equation in its real-valued formulation, without using any transform. To approximate the Schr\"odinger map equation, we employ the stochastic Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert equation. By a limiting procedure \`a la Kuksin, we establish existence of a random initial datum, whose distribution is preserved under the dynamics of the deterministic equation. Among other properties, the corresponding statistically stationary solution is proved to exhibit non-trivial dynamics in space and time and to be genuinely random. With an analogous argument, we prove the existence of stationary solutions to a stochastic Schr\"odinger map equation. We discuss the relationship between the statistically stationary solutions to the Schr\"odinger map equation, the binormal curvature flow and the cubic non-linear Schr\"odinger equation. Additionally, we prove the existence of statistically stationary solutions to the binormal curvature flow.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Perceptrons, Number Partitioning and Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The symmetric binary perceptron ($\mathrm{SBP}_{\kappa}$) problem with parameter $\kappa : \mathbb{R}_{\geq1} \to [0,1]$ is an average-case search problem defined as follows: given a random Gaussian matrix $\mathbf{A} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)^{n \times m}$ as input where $m \geq n$, output a vector $\mathbf{x} \in \{-1,1\}^m$ such that $$|| \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} ||_{\infty} \leq \kappa(m/n) \cdot \sqrt{m}~.$$ The number partitioning problem ($\mathrm{NPP}_{\kappa}$) corresponds to the special case of setting $n=1$. There is considerable evidence that both problems exhibit large computational-statistical gaps.
  In this work, we show (nearly) tight average-case hardness for these problems, assuming the worst-case hardness of standard approximate shortest vector problems on lattices.
  For $\mathrm{SBP}$, for large $n$, the best that efficient algorithms have been able to achieve is $\kappa(x) = \Theta(1/\sqrt{x})$ (Bansal and Spencer, Random Structures and Algorithms 2020), which is a far cry from the statistical bound. The problem has been extensively studied in the TCS and statistics communities, and Gamarnik, Kizildag, Perkins and Xu (FOCS 2022) conjecture that Bansal-Spencer is tight: namely, $\kappa(x) = \widetilde{\Theta}(1/\sqrt{x})$ is the optimal value achieved by computationally efficient algorithms. We prove their conjecture assuming the worst-case hardness of approximating the shortest vector problem on lattices.
  For $\mathrm{NPP}$, Karmarkar and Karp's classical differencing algorithm achieves $\kappa(m) = 2^{-O(\log^2 m)}~.$ We prove that Karmarkar-Karp is nearly tight: namely, no polynomial-time algorithm can achieve $\kappa(m) = 2^{-\Omega(\log^3 m)}$, once again assuming the worst-case subexponential hardness of approximating the shortest vector problem on lattices to within a subexponential factor.</description>

      <title>Ancestral Inference and Learning for Branching Processes in Random Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ancestral inference for branching processes in random environments involves determining the ancestor distribution parameters using the population sizes of descendant generations. In this paper, we introduce a new methodology for ancestral inference utilizing the generalized method of moments. We demonstrate that the estimator's behavior is critically influenced by the coefficient of variation of the environment sequence. Furthermore, despite the process's evolution being heavily dependent on the offspring means of various generations, we show that the joint limiting distribution of the ancestor and offspring estimators of the mean, under appropriate centering and scaling, decouple and converge to independent Gaussian random variables when the ratio of the number of generations to the logarithm of the number of replicates converges to zero. Additionally, we provide estimators for the limiting variance and illustrate our findings through numerical experiments and data from Polymerase Chain Reaction experiments and COVID-19 data.</description>

      <title>Critical values for Intermediate and Box dimension of projections and other images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a compact set $E\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ we investigate for which values of $m$ we have that $\dim_\theta P_V(E)=m$ or $\dim_\theta P_V(E)=\dim_\theta E$ for $\gamma_{d,m}-$almost all $V\in G(d,m)$. Our result can be extended to more general functions that include orthogonal projections and fractional Brownian motion. As a particular case, letting $\theta=1$, the results are valid for the Box dimension.</description>

      <title>Hard to soft edge transition for the Muttalib-Borodin ensembles with integer parameter $\theta$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find the universal limiting correlation kernels of the Muttalib-Borodin (MB) ensembles with integer parameter $\theta \geq 2$ at $0$ in the transitive regime between the hard edge regime and the soft edge regime. This generalizes the previously studied hard edge to soft edge transition in unitarily invariant random matrix theory by Its, Kuijlaars and \"{O}stensson, which is the $\theta = 1$ special case of our MB ensemble. The derivation is based on the vector Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problems for the biorthogonal polynomials associated with the MB ensemble. In the analysis of the RH problems, we construct matrix-valued model RH problems of size $(\theta + 1) \times (\theta + 1)$, and prove the solvability of the model RH problems by a vanishing lemma. The new limiting correlation kernels are proved to be universal for a large class of potential functions, and they interpolate the Meijer G-kernels for the hard edge regime and the Airy kernel for the soft edge regime. We observe that the new limiting correlation kernels have the integrability that is not seen in previous studies in random matrix theory and determinantal point processes. In the $\theta = 2$ case, we give a detailed analysis of the Lax pair associated with the model RH problem, show that it results in the Chazy I equation, which has a Painlev\'{e} IV reduction, and find that the Lax pair is in the Drinfeld-Sokolov hierarchies.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching: Markov Kernels, Stochastic Processes and Transport Plans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among generative neural models, flow matching techniques stand out for their simple applicability and good scaling properties. Here, velocity fields of curves connecting a simple latent and a target distribution are learned. Then the corresponding ordinary differential equation can be used to sample from a target distribution, starting in samples from the latent one. This paper reviews from a mathematical point of view different techniques to learn the velocity fields of absolutely continuous curves in the Wasserstein geometry. We show how the velocity fields can be characterized and learned via i) transport plans (couplings) between latent and target distributions, ii) Markov kernels and iii) stochastic processes, where the latter two include the coupling approach, but are in general broader. Besides this main goal, we show how flow matching can be used for solving Bayesian inverse problems, where the definition of conditional Wasserstein distances plays a central role. Finally, we briefly address continuous normalizing flows and score matching techniques, which approach the learning of velocity fields of curves from other directions.</description>

      <title>Hopf-Lax approximation for value functions of L\'evy optimal control problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate stochastic versions of the Hopf-Lax formula which are based on compositions of the Hopf-Lax operator with the transition kernel of a L\'evy process taking values in a separable Banach space. We show that, depending on the order of the composition, one obtains upper and lower bounds for the value function of a stochastic optimal control problem associated to the drift controlled L\'evy dynamics. Dynamic consistency is restored by iterating the resulting operators. Moreover, the value function of the control problem is approximated both from above and below as the number of iterations tends to infinity, and we provide explicit convergence rates and guarantees for the approximation procedure.</description>

      <title>Bias-Corrected and Variance-Corrected MLE for the New Median Based Unit Weibull Distribution (MBUW)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the maximum likelihood method is the most commonly used method for parameters estimation being unbiased, consistent, efficient, and asymptotically normal, MLE is used to fit the new distribution (MBUW). But in small to moderate sample size, this MLE estimator is biased unlike the MLE estimators obtained from large sample sizes. In this paper, the Bias-corrected approach for this distribution is discussed and applied to real data analysis. The MLE estimators of MBUW obtained from some optimization techniques like derivative free Nelder Mead algorithm suffers from significant high correlation that is reflected on high covariance between the parameters. Also this association between the parameters affects the variances which may be inflated enough to approach infinity hampering construction of confidence intervals for each parameter. This problem may arise with any optimization technique which necessitates remedies trying to fix it. The author also elaborates a variance correction approach heavily relaying on re-parameterizing the negative log likelihood.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper obtains logarithmic asymptotics of moderate deviations of the stochastic process of the number of customers in a many--server queue with generally distributed interarrival and service times in the Halfin--Whitt heavy traffic regime. The deviation function is expressed in terms of the solution to a Fredholm equation of the second kind. The proof uses characterisation of large deviation relatively compact sequences of probability measures as exponentially tight ones.</description>

      <title>A note on critical intersections of classical and Schatten $p$-balls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to study the asymptotic volume of intersections of unit balls associated with two norms in $\mathbb{R}^n$ as their dimension $n$ tends to infinity. A general framework is provided and then specialized to the following cases. For classical $\ell_p^n$-balls the focus lies on the case $p=\infty$, which has previously not been studied in the literature. As far as Schatten $p$-balls are considered, we concentrate on the cases $p=2$ and $p=\infty$. In both situations we uncover an unconventional limiting behavior.</description>

      <title>Last passage percolation in a product-type random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a last passage percolation model in dimension $1+1$ with potential given by the product of a spatial i.i.d. potential with symmetric bounded distribution and an independent i.i.d. in time sequence of signs. We assume that the density of the spatial potential near the edge of its support behaves as a power, with exponent $\kappa&gt;-1$. We investigate the linear growth rate of the actions of optimal point-to-point lazy random walk paths as a function of the path slope and describe the structure of the resulting shape function. It has a corner at $0$ and, although its restriction to positive slopes cannot be linear, we prove that it has a flat edge near $0$ if $\kappa&gt;0$.
  For optimal point-to-line paths, we study their actions and locations of favorable edges that the paths tends to reach and stay at. Under an additional assumption on the time it takes for the optimal path to reach the favorable location, we prove that appropriately normalized actions converge to a limiting distribution that can be viewed as a counterpart of the Tracy-Widom law. Since the scaling exponent and the limiting distribution depend only on the parameter $\kappa$, our results provide a description of a new universality class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a multivariate version of causal transport, which we name multicausal transport, involving several filtered processes among which causality constraints are imposed. Subsequently, we consider the barycenter problem for stochastic processes with respect to causal and bicausal optimal transport, and study its connection to specific multicausal transport problems. Attainment and duality of the aforementioned problems are provided. As an application, we study a matching problem in a dynamic setting where agent types evolve over time. We link this to a causal barycenter problem and thereby show existence of equilibria.</description>

      <title>Cutoff for the logistic SIS epidemic model with self-infection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a variant of the classical Markovian logistic SIS epidemic model on a complete graph, which has the additional feature that healthy individuals can become infected without contacting an infected member of the population. This additional ``self-infection'' is used to model situations where there is an unknown source of infection or an external disease reservoir, such as an animal carrier population. In contrast to the classical logistic SIS epidemic model, the version with self-infection has a non-degenerate stationary distribution, and we derive precise asymptotics for the time to converge to stationarity (mixing time) as the population size becomes large. It turns out that the chain exhibits the cutoff phenomenon, which is a sharp transition in time from one to zero of the total variation distance to stationarity. We obtain the exact leading constant for the cutoff time, and show the window size is constant (optimal) order. While this result is interesting in its own right, an additional contribution of our work is that the proof illustrates a recently formalised methodology of Barbour, Brightwell and Luczak, which can be used to show cutoff via a combination of concentration of measure inequalities for the trajectory of the chain, and coupling techniques.</description>

      <title>Cournot's principle for measure-theoretic probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05228v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of relating the mathematics of probability theory to the empirical world of experiments has been debated for centuries. One of the oldest solutions proposed for this problem is a principle that states that an event with probability close to 1 nearly certainly occurs in a single trial of an experiment. This principle is now called $\textit{Cournot' principle}$.
  Cournot's principle was first formulated in the context of classical probability, in which the probability of any event is given, and the $\textit{product rule}$, i.e., the rule that the probability that two events occur in two separated trials is the product of their probabilities, can be deduced. On the contrary, in the modern measure-theoretic approach to probability, probability measures and experiments are separate entities that must be related in an appropriate way, and the product rule cannot be deduced.
  In this paper, a version of Cournot's principle suitable for measure-theoretic probability is proposed. Therefore, the principle is reformulated as a criterion for relating probability measures and experiments, and the product rule is explicitly stated.
  In spite of the vagueness of the notions involved, the new version is formulated in a rigorous manner and an exact result, namely, that at most one probability measure can be related to an experiment, is rigorously proven.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.09410v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a random binary picture $P_n$ of size $n$, i.e., an $n\times n$ grid filled with zeros and ones uniformly at random, when is it possible to reconstruct $P_n$ from its $k$-deck, i.e., the multiset of all its $k\times k$ subgrids? We demonstrate ``two-point concentration'' for the reconstruction threshold by showing that there is an integer $k_c(n) \sim (2 \log n)^{1/2}$ such that if $k &gt; k_c$, then $P_n$ is reconstructible from its $k$-deck with high probability, and if $k &lt; k_c$, then with high probability, it is impossible to reconstruct $P_n$ from its $k$-deck. The proof of this result uses a combination of interface-exploration arguments and entropic arguments.</description>

      <title>Random walks on Coxeter interchange graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A tournament is an orientation of a graph. Vertices are players and edges are games, directed away from the winner. Kannan, Tetali and Vempala and McShine showed that tournaments with given score sequence can be rapidly sampled, via simple random walks on the interchange graphs of Brualdi and Li. These graphs are generated by the cyclically directed triangle, in the sense that traversing an edge corresponds to the reversal of such a triangle in a tournament.
  We study Coxeter tournaments on Zaslavsky's signed graphs. These tournaments involve collaborative and solitaire games, as well as the usual competitive games. The interchange graphs are richer in complexity, as a variety of other generators are involved. We prove rapid mixing by an intricate application of Bubley and Dyer's method of path coupling, using a delicate re-weighting of the graph metric. Geometric connections with the Coxeter permutahedra introduced by Ardila, Castillo, Eur and Postnikov are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We consider systems of interacting particles which are described by a second order Langevin equation, i.e., particles experiencing inertia. We introduce an associated equation of fluctuating hydrodynamics, which can be interpreted as stochastic version of a Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. We show a dichotomy previously known for purely diffusive systems carries over to the hypoelliptic setting considered here: Solutions exist only for suitable atomic initial data, but not for smooth initial data. The class of systems covered includes several models of active matter.</description>
