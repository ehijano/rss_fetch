      <title>Analytic mappings of the unit disk which almost preserve hyperbolic area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study analytic self-maps of the unit disk which distort hyperbolic area of large hyperbolic disks by a bounded amount. We give a number of characterizations involving angular derivatives, Lipschitz extensions, M\"obius distortion, the distribution of critical points and Aleksandrov-Clark measures. We also study Lyapunov exponents of their Aleksandrov-Clark measures.</description>

      <title>Location of the zeros of quaternionic polynomials using matrix tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a variety of matrix techniques, the problem of locating the left eigenvalues of the quaternion companion matrices are investigated in this paper. In a recent paper, Dar et al. [6], proved that the zeros of a quaternionic polynomial and the left eigenvalues of corresponding companion matrix are same. In view of this, we use various newly developed matrix techniques to prove various results concerning the location of the zeros of regular polynomials of a quaternionic variable with quaternionic coefficients, which include an extension of the result of A. L. Cauchy as well.</description>

      <title>Equivariant automorphisms of the Cox construction and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we give a complete description of the group of holomorphic automorphisms of the Cox construction of a simplicial fan equivariant with respect to a large enough connected complex Lie subgroup of the large torus acting on the Cox construction. We then apply this description to find the groups of holomorphic automorphisms of rational moment-angle manifolds, including Calabi--Eckmann manifolds and Hopf manifolds. We also calculate the groups of equivariant automorphisms of complete simplicial toric varieties. This paper is the first in a series of two papers dedicated to studying the automorphism groups of toric stacks with applications to complex geometry.</description>

      <title>Complex structure that admits complete Nevanlinna-Pick spaces of Hardy type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we will characterize those sets, over which every irreducible complete Nevanlinna-Pick space enjoys that its multiplier and supremum norms coincide. Moreover, we will prove that, if there exists an irreducible complete Nevanlinna-Pick space of holomorphic functions on a reduced complex space $X$ whose multiplier algebra is isometrically equal to the algebra of bounded holomorphic functions (we will say that such a space is of Hardy type in this paper), then $X$ must be a Riemann surface.</description>

      <title>Quaternionic Mahler measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the quaternionic Mahler measure for non-commutative polynomials, extending the classical complex Mahler measure. We establish the existence of quaternionic Mahler measure for slice regular polynomials in one and two variables. We study the quaternionic Mahler measure for real and slice regular polynomials, and consider the associated Lehmer problem. Various formulas of quaternionic Mahler measures are proved.</description>

Abstract: We show that a connected, simply connected nilpotent Lie group with an integrable left-invariant complex structure on a generating and suitably complemented subbundle of the tangent bundle admits a CR embedding in complex space as the edge of a wedge in a complex domain defined by polynomials.</description>

      <title>Quasiconformal deformation of the chordal Loewner driving function and first variation of the Loewner energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the variational formula of the Loewner driving function of a simple chord under infinitesimal quasiconformal deformations with Beltrami coefficients supported away from the chord. As an application, we obtain the first variation of the Loewner energy of a Jordan curve, defined as the Dirichlet energy of the driving function of the curve. This result gives another explanation of the identity between the Loewner energy and the universal Liouville action introduced by Takhtajan and Teo, which has the same variational formula. We also deduce the variation of the total mass of SLE$_{8/3}$ loops touching the Jordan curve under quasiconformal deformations.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution in Random Polynomials and Systems of Random Holomorphic Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14631v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article addresses an equidistribution problem concerning the zeros of systems of random holomorphic sections of positive line bundles on compact K\"{a}hler manifolds and random polynomials on $\mathbb{C}^{m}$ in the setting of a compact subset. For random polynomials, we consider non-orthonormal bases and prove an equidistribution result which are more general than the previously acquired ones for non-discrete probability measures. More precisely, our result demonstrates that the equidistribution holds true even when the random coefficients in the basis representation are not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and moreover, they are not constrained to any particular probability distribution function. For random holomorphic sections, by extending the concept of a sequence of asymptotically Bernstein-Markov measures introduced by Levenberg, Bloom and Bayraktar in their recent paper to the setting of holomorphic line bundles over compact K\"{a}hler manifolds, we derive a global equidistribution theorem related to the zeros of systems of random holomorphic sections for large tensor powers of a fixed line bundle for any codimension $k$. In both settings using the variance estimation technique in another study of the author with Bojnik plays an important role.</description>

      <title>On the stochastic bifurcations regarding random iterations of polynomials of the form $z^{2} + c_{n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.06702v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider random iterations of polynomial maps $z^2 +c_n$ where $c_n$ are complex-valued independent random variables following the uniform distribution on the closed disk with center $c$ and radius $r$. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we study the (dis)connectedness of random Julia sets. Here, we reveal the relationships between the bifurcation radius and connectedness of random Julia sets. Second, we investigate the bifurcation of our random iterations and give quantitative estimates of bifurcation parameters. In particular, we prove that for the central parameter $c = -1$, almost every random Julia set is totally disconnected with much smaller radial parameters $r$ than expected. We also introduce several open questions worth discussing.</description>
