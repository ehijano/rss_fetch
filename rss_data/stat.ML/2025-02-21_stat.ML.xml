      <title>Towards a perturbation-based explanation for medical AI as differentiable programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancement in machine learning algorithms reaches a point where medical devices can be equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) models for diagnostic support and routine automation in clinical settings. In medicine and healthcare, there is a particular demand for sufficient and objective explainability of the outcome generated by AI models. However, AI models are generally considered as black boxes due to their complexity, and the computational process leading to their response is often opaque. Although several methods have been proposed to explain the behavior of models by evaluating the importance of each feature in discrimination and prediction, they may suffer from biases and opacities arising from the scale and sampling protocol of the dataset used for training or testing. To overcome the shortcomings of existing methods, we explore an alternative approach to provide an objective explanation of AI models that can be defined independently of the learning process and does not require additional data. As a preliminary study for this direction of research, this work examines a numerical availability of the Jacobian matrix of deep learning models that measures how stably a model responses against small perturbations added to the input. The indicator, if available, are calculated from a trained AI model for a given target input. This is a first step towards a perturbation-based explanation, which will assist medical practitioners in understanding and interpreting the response of the AI model in its clinical application.</description>

      <title>New Lower Bounds for Stochastic Non-Convex Optimization through Divergence Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fundamental limits of first-order stochastic optimization in a range of nonconvex settings, including L-smooth functions satisfying Quasar-Convexity (QC), Quadratic Growth (QG), and Restricted Secant Inequalities (RSI). While the convergence properties of standard algorithms are well-understood in deterministic regimes, significantly fewer results address the stochastic case, where only unbiased and noisy gradients are available. We establish new lower bounds on the number of noisy gradient queries to minimize these classes of functions, also showing that they are tight (up to a logarithmic factor) in all the relevant quantities characterizing each class. Our approach reformulates the optimization task as a function identification problem, leveraging divergence composition arguments to construct a challenging subclass that leads to sharp lower bounds. Furthermore, we present a specialized algorithm in the one-dimensional setting that achieves faster rates, suggesting that certain dimensional thresholds are intrinsic to the complexity of non-convex stochastic optimization.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction under L\'evy-Prokhorov Distribution Shifts: Robustness to Local and Global Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction provides a powerful framework for constructing prediction intervals with finite-sample guarantees, yet its robustness under distribution shifts remains a significant challenge. This paper addresses this limitation by modeling distribution shifts using L\'evy-Prokhorov (LP) ambiguity sets, which capture both local and global perturbations. We provide a self-contained overview of LP ambiguity sets and their connections to popular metrics such as Wasserstein and Total Variation. We show that the link between conformal prediction and LP ambiguity sets is a natural one: by propagating the LP ambiguity set through the scoring function, we reduce complex high-dimensional distribution shifts to manageable one-dimensional distribution shifts, enabling exact quantification of worst-case quantiles and coverage. Building on this analysis, we construct robust conformal prediction intervals that remain valid under distribution shifts, explicitly linking LP parameters to interval width and confidence levels. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization for Networked Black-Box Systems: A Path to Greener Profits and Smarter Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing modern industrial systems requires balancing several competing objectives, such as profitability, resilience, and sustainability, while accounting for complex interactions between technological, economic, and environmental factors. Multi-objective optimization (MOO) methods are commonly used to navigate these tradeoffs, but selecting the appropriate algorithm to tackle these problems is often unclear, particularly when system representations vary from fully equation-based (white-box) to entirely data-driven (black-box) models. While grey-box MOO methods attempt to bridge this gap, they typically impose rigid assumptions on system structure, requiring models to conform to the underlying structural assumptions of the solver rather than the solver adapting to the natural representation of the system of interest. In this chapter, we introduce a unifying approach to grey-box MOO by leveraging network representations, which provide a general and flexible framework for modeling interconnected systems as a series of function nodes that share various inputs and outputs. Specifically, we propose MOBONS, a novel Bayesian optimization-inspired algorithm that can efficiently optimize general function networks, including those with cyclic dependencies, enabling the modeling of feedback loops, recycle streams, and multi-scale simulations - features that existing methods fail to capture. Furthermore, MOBONS incorporates constraints, supports parallel evaluations, and preserves the sample efficiency of Bayesian optimization while leveraging network structure for improved scalability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MOBONS through two case studies, including one related to sustainable process design. By enabling efficient MOO under general graph representations, MOBONS has the potential to significantly enhance the design of more profitable, resilient, and sustainable engineering systems.</description>

      <title>Prediction-Powered Adaptive Shrinkage Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) is a powerful framework for enhancing statistical estimates by combining limited gold-standard data with machine learning (ML) predictions. While prior work has demonstrated PPI's benefits for individual statistical tasks, modern applications require answering numerous parallel statistical questions. We introduce Prediction-Powered Adaptive Shrinkage (PAS), a method that bridges PPI with empirical Bayes shrinkage to improve the estimation of multiple means. PAS debiases noisy ML predictions within each task and then borrows strength across tasks by using those same predictions as a reference point for shrinkage. The amount of shrinkage is determined by minimizing an unbiased estimate of risk, and we prove that this tuning strategy is asymptotically optimal. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that PAS adapts to the reliability of the ML predictions and outperforms traditional and modern baselines in large-scale applications.</description>

      <title>Finite Sample Analysis of Distributional TD Learning with Linear Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the finite-sample statistical rates of distributional temporal difference (TD) learning with linear function approximation. The aim of distributional TD learning is to estimate the return distribution of a discounted Markov decision process for a given policy {\pi}. Prior works on statistical analysis of distributional TD learning mainly focus on the tabular case. In contrast, we first consider the linear function approximation setting and derive sharp finite-sample rates. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the sample complexity of linear distributional TD learning matches that of the classic linear TD learning. This implies that, with linear function approximation, learning the full distribution of the return using streaming data is no more difficult than learning its expectation (i.e. the value function). To derive tight sample complexity bounds, we conduct a fine-grained analysis of the linear-categorical Bellman equation, and employ the exponential stability arguments for products of random matrices. Our findings provide new insights into the statistical efficiency of distributional reinforcement learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Distribution Matching for Self-Supervised Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised transfer learning method called Distribution Matching (DM), which drives the representation distribution toward a predefined reference distribution while preserving augmentation invariance. The design of DM results in a learned representation space that is intuitively structured and offers easily interpretable hyperparameters. Experimental results across multiple real-world datasets and evaluation metrics demonstrate that DM performs competitively on target classification tasks compared to existing self-supervised transfer learning methods. Additionally, we provide robust theoretical guarantees for DM, including a population theorem and an end-to-end sample theorem. The population theorem bridges the gap between the self-supervised learning task and target classification accuracy, while the sample theorem shows that, even with a limited number of samples from the target domain, DM can deliver exceptional classification performance, provided the unlabeled sample size is sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Generalization Error of $f$-Divergence Stabilized Algorithms via Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solution to empirical risk minimization with $f$-divergence regularization (ERM-$f$DR) is extended to constrained optimization problems, establishing conditions for equivalence between the solution and constraints. A dual formulation of ERM-$f$DR is introduced, providing a computationally efficient method to derive the normalization function of the ERM-$f$DR solution. This dual approach leverages the Legendre-Fenchel transform and the implicit function theorem, enabling explicit characterizations of the generalization error for general algorithms under mild conditions, and another for ERM-$f$DR solutions.</description>

      <title>Confidence Estimation via Sequential Likelihood Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a universal framework for constructing confidence sets based on sequential likelihood mixing. Building upon classical results from sequential analysis, we provide a unifying perspective on several recent lines of work, and establish fundamental connections between sequential mixing, Bayesian inference and regret inequalities from online estimation. The framework applies to any realizable family of likelihood functions and allows for non-i.i.d. data and anytime validity. Moreover, the framework seamlessly integrates standard approximate inference techniques, such as variational inference and sampling-based methods, and extends to misspecified model classes, while preserving provable coverage guarantees. We illustrate the power of the framework by deriving tighter confidence sequences for classical settings, including sequential linear regression and sparse estimation, with simplified proofs.</description>

      <title>Internal Incoherency Scores for Constraint-based Causal Discovery Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal discovery aims to infer causal graphs from observational or experimental data. Methods such as the popular PC algorithm are based on conditional independence testing and utilize enabling assumptions, such as the faithfulness assumption, for their inferences. In practice, these assumptions, as well as the functional assumptions inherited from the chosen conditional independence test, are typically taken as a given and not further tested for their validity on the data. In this work, we propose internal coherency scores that allow testing for assumption violations and finite sample errors, whenever detectable without requiring ground truth or further statistical tests. We provide a complete classification of erroneous results, including a distinction between detectable and undetectable errors, and prove that the detectable erroneous results can be measured by our scores. We illustrate our coherency scores on the PC algorithm with simulated and real-world datasets, and envision that testing for internal coherency can become a standard tool in applying constraint-based methods, much like a suite of tests is used to validate the assumptions of classical regression analysis.</description>

      <title>Robust Information Selection for Hypothesis Testing with Misclassification Penalties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of robust information selection for a Bayesian hypothesis testing / classification task, where the goal is to identify the true state of the world from a finite set of hypotheses based on observations from the selected information sources. We introduce a novel misclassification penalty framework, which enables non-uniform treatment of different misclassification events. Extending the classical subset selection framework, we study the problem of selecting a subset of sources that minimize the maximum penalty of misclassification under a limited budget, despite deletions or failures of a subset of the selected sources. We characterize the curvature properties of the objective function and propose an efficient greedy algorithm with performance guarantees. Next, we highlight certain limitations of optimizing for the maximum penalty metric and propose a submodular surrogate metric to guide the selection of the information set. We propose a greedy algorithm with near-optimality guarantees for optimizing the surrogate metric. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithms in several instances of the information set selection problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In decision-making problems, the outcome of an intervention often depends on the causal relationships between system components and is highly costly to evaluate. In such settings, causal Bayesian optimization (CBO) can exploit the causal relationships between the system variables and sequentially perform interventions to approach the optimum with minimal data. Extending CBO to the multi-outcome setting, we propose Multi-Objective Causal Bayesian Optimization (MO-CBO), a paradigm for identifying Pareto-optimal interventions within a known multi-target causal graph. We first derive a graphical characterization for potentially optimal sets of variables to intervene upon. Showing that any MO-CBO problem can be decomposed into several traditional multi-objective optimization tasks, we then introduce an algorithm that sequentially balances exploration across these tasks using relative hypervolume improvement. The proposed method will be validated on both synthetic and real-world causal graphs, demonstrating its superiority over traditional (non-causal) multi-objective Bayesian optimization in settings where causal information is available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been argued that AI models' representations are becoming aligned as their scale and performance increase. Empirical analyses have been designed to support this idea and conjecture the possible alignment of different representations toward a shared statistical model of reality. In this paper, we propose a learning-theoretic perspective to representation alignment. First, we review and connect different notions of alignment based on metric, probabilistic, and spectral ideas. Then, we focus on stitching, a particular approach to understanding the interplay between different representations in the context of a task. Our main contribution here is relating properties of stitching to the kernel alignment of the underlying representation. Our results can be seen as a first step toward casting representation alignment as a learning-theoretic problem.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the barycenter of a distribution given i.i.d. data in a geodesic space. Assuming an upper curvature bound in Alexandrov's sense and a support condition ensuring the strong geodesic convexity of the barycenter problem, we establish finite-sample error bounds in expectation and with high probability. Our results generalize Hoeffding- and Bernstein-type concentration inequalities from Euclidean to geodesic spaces.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine sufficient conditions for overparametrized deep learning (DL) networks to guarantee the attainability of zero loss in the context of supervised learning, for the $\mathcal{L}^2$ cost and {\em generic} training data. We present an explicit construction of the zero loss minimizers without invoking gradient descent. On the other hand, we point out that increase of depth can deteriorate the efficiency of cost minimization using a gradient descent algorithm by analyzing the conditions for rank loss of the training Jacobian. Our results clarify key aspects on the dichotomy between zero loss reachability in underparametrized versus overparametrized DL.</description>

Abstract: Exponential moving average (EMA) has recently gained significant popularity in training modern deep learning models, especially diffusion-based generative models. However, there have been few theoretical results explaining the effectiveness of EMA. In this paper, to better understand EMA, we establish the risk bound of online SGD with EMA for high-dimensional linear regression, one of the simplest overparameterized learning tasks that shares similarities with neural networks. Our results indicate that (i) the variance error of SGD with EMA is always smaller than that of SGD without averaging, and (ii) unlike SGD with iterate averaging from the beginning, the bias error of SGD with EMA decays exponentially in every eigen-subspace of the data covariance matrix. Additionally, we develop proof techniques applicable to the analysis of a broad class of averaging schemes.</description>

      <title>Online detection of forecast model inadequacies using forecast errors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many organisations, accurate forecasts are essential for making informed decisions for a variety of applications from inventory management to staffing optimization. Whatever forecasting model is used, changes in the underlying process can lead to inaccurate forecasts, which will be damaging to decision-making. At the same time, models are becoming increasingly complex and identifying change through direct modelling is problematic. We present a novel framework for online monitoring of forecasts to ensure they remain accurate. By utilizing sequential changepoint techniques on the forecast errors, our framework allows for the real-time identification of potential changes in the process caused by various external factors. We show theoretically that some common changes in the underlying process will manifest in the forecast errors and can be identified faster by identifying shifts in the forecast errors than within the original modelling framework. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework on numerous forecasting approaches through simulations and show its effectiveness over alternative approaches. Finally, we present two concrete examples, one from Royal Mail parcel delivery volumes and one from NHS A\&amp;E admissions relating to gallstones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve a regularized weighted low-rank approximation problem by a stochastic gradient descent on a manifold. To guarantee the convergence of our stochastic gradient descent, we establish a convergence theorem on manifolds for retraction-based stochastic gradient descents admitting confinements. On sample data from the Netflix Prize training dataset, our algorithm outperforms the existing stochastic gradient descent on Euclidean spaces. We also compare the accelerated line search on this manifold to the existing accelerated line search on Euclidean spaces.</description>

      <title>InstaSHAP: Interpretable Additive Models Explain Shapley Values Instantly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the Shapley value and SHAP explanations have emerged as one of the most dominant paradigms for providing post-hoc explanations of black-box models. Despite their well-founded theoretical properties, many recent works have focused on the limitations in both their computational efficiency and their representation power. The underlying connection with additive models, however, is left critically under-emphasized in the current literature. In this work, we find that a variational perspective linking GAM models and SHAP explanations is able to provide deep insights into nearly all recent developments. In light of this connection, we borrow in the other direction to develop a new method to train interpretable GAM models which are automatically purified to compute the Shapley value in a single forward pass. Finally, we provide theoretical results showing the limited representation power of GAM models is the same Achilles' heel existing in SHAP and discuss the implications for SHAP's modern usage in CV and NLP.</description>

      <title>A Non-Asymptotic Theory of Seminorm Lyapunov Stability: From Deterministic to Stochastic Iterative Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of solving fixed-point equations for seminorm-contractive operators and establish foundational results on the non-asymptotic behavior of iterative algorithms in both deterministic and stochastic settings. Specifically, in the deterministic setting, we prove a fixed-point theorem for seminorm-contractive operators, showing that iterates converge geometrically to the kernel of the seminorm. In the stochastic setting, we analyze the corresponding stochastic approximation (SA) algorithm under seminorm-contractive operators and Markovian noise, providing a finite-sample analysis for various stepsize choices.
  A benchmark for equation solving is linear systems of equations, where the convergence behavior of fixed-point iteration is closely tied to the stability of linear dynamical systems. In this special case, our results provide a complete characterization of system stability with respect to a seminorm, linking it to the solution of a Lyapunov equation in terms of positive semi-definite matrices. In the stochastic setting, we establish a finite-sample analysis for linear Markovian SA without requiring the Hurwitzness assumption.
  Our theoretical results offer a unified framework for deriving finite-sample bounds for various reinforcement learning algorithms in the average reward setting, including TD($\lambda$) for policy evaluation (which is a special case of solving a Poisson equation) and Q-learning for control.</description>

      <title>Generalization Certificates for Adversarially Robust Bayesian Linear Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial robustness of machine learning models is critical to ensuring reliable performance under data perturbations. Recent progress has been on point estimators, and this paper considers distributional predictors. First, using the link between exponential families and Bregman divergences, we formulate an adversarial Bregman divergence loss as an adversarial negative log-likelihood. Using the geometric properties of Bregman divergences, we compute the adversarial perturbation for such models in closed-form. Second, under such losses, we introduce \emph{adversarially robust posteriors}, by exploiting the optimization-centric view of generalized Bayesian inference. Third, we derive the \emph{first} rigorous generalization certificates in the context of an adversarial extension of Bayesian linear regression by leveraging the PAC-Bayesian framework. Finally, experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superior robustness of the derived adversarially robust posterior over Bayes posterior, and also validate our theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>PredictaBoard: Benchmarking LLM Score Predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite possessing impressive skills, Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail unpredictably, demonstrating inconsistent success in even basic common sense reasoning tasks. This unpredictability poses a significant challenge to ensuring their safe deployment, as identifying and operating within a reliable "safe zone" is essential for mitigating risks. To address this, we present PredictaBoard, a novel collaborative benchmarking framework designed to evaluate the ability of score predictors (referred to as assessors) to anticipate LLM errors on specific task instances (i.e., prompts) from existing datasets. PredictaBoard evaluates pairs of LLMs and assessors by considering the rejection rate at different tolerance errors. As such, PredictaBoard stimulates research into developing better assessors and making LLMs more predictable, not only with a higher average performance. We conduct illustrative experiments using baseline assessors and state-of-the-art LLMs. PredictaBoard highlights the critical need to evaluate predictability alongside performance, paving the way for safer AI systems where errors are not only minimised but also anticipated and effectively mitigated. Code for our benchmark can be found at https://github.com/Kinds-of-Intelligence-CFI/PredictaBoard</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article focuses on covariance estimation for multi-study data. Popular approaches employ factor-analytic terms with shared and study-specific loadings that decompose the variance into (i) a shared low-rank component, (ii) study-specific low-rank components, and (iii) a diagonal term capturing idiosyncratic variability. Our proposed methodology estimates the latent factors via spectral decompositions and infers the factor loadings via surrogate regression tasks, avoiding identifiability and computational issues of existing alternatives. Reliably inferring shared vs study-specific components requires novel developments that are of independent interest. The approximation error decreases as the sample size and the data dimension diverge, formalizing a blessing of dimensionality. Conditionally on the factors, loadings and residual error variances are inferred via conjugate normal-inverse gamma priors. The conditional posterior distribution of factor loadings has a simple product form across outcomes, facilitating parallelization. We show favorable asymptotic properties, including central limit theorems for point estimators and posterior contraction, and excellent empirical performance in simulations. The methods are applied to integrate three studies on gene associations among immune cells.</description>

      <title>General Uncertainty Estimation with Delta Variances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision makers may suffer from uncertainty induced by limited data. This may be mitigated by accounting for epistemic uncertainty, which is however challenging to estimate efficiently for large neural networks. To this extent we investigate Delta Variances, a family of algorithms for epistemic uncertainty quantification, that is computationally efficient and convenient to implement. It can be applied to neural networks and more general functions composed of neural networks. As an example we consider a weather simulator with a neural-network-based step function inside -- here Delta Variances empirically obtain competitive results at the cost of a single gradient computation. The approach is convenient as it requires no changes to the neural network architecture or training procedure. We discuss multiple ways to derive Delta Variances theoretically noting that special cases recover popular techniques and present a unified perspective on multiple related methods. Finally we observe that this general perspective gives rise to a natural extension and empirically show its benefit.</description>

      <title>Efficient Multivariate Robust Mean Estimation Under Mean-Shift Contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic problem of robust mean estimation of an identity covariance Gaussian in the presence of mean-shift contamination. In this contamination model, we are given a set of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ generated i.i.d. via the following process. For a parameter $\alpha&lt;1/2$, the $i$-th sample $x_i$ is obtained as follows: with probability $1-\alpha$, $x_i$ is drawn from $\mathcal{N}(\mu, I)$, where $\mu \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is the target mean; and with probability $\alpha$, $x_i$ is drawn from $\mathcal{N}(z_i, I)$, where $z_i$ is unknown and potentially arbitrary. Prior work characterized the information-theoretic limits of this task. Specifically, it was shown that, in contrast to Huber contamination, in the presence of mean-shift contamination consistent estimation is possible. On the other hand, all known robust estimators in the mean-shift model have running times exponential in the dimension. Here we give the first computationally efficient algorithm for high-dimensional robust mean estimation with mean-shift contamination that can tolerate a constant fraction of outliers. In particular, our algorithm has near-optimal sample complexity, runs in sample-polynomial time, and approximates the target mean to any desired accuracy. Conceptually, our result contributes to a growing body of work that studies inference with respect to natural noise models lying in between fully adversarial and random settings.</description>

      <title>An Adversarial Analysis of Thompson Sampling for Full-information Online Learning: from Finite to Infinite Action Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an analysis of Thompson sampling for online learning under full feedback - also known as prediction with expert advice - where the learner's prior is defined over the space of an adversary's future actions, rather than the space of experts. We show regret decomposes into regret the learner expected a priori, plus a prior-robustness-type term we call excess regret. In the classical finite-expert setting, this recovers optimal rates. As an initial step towards practical online learning in settings with a potentially-uncountably-infinite number of experts, we show that Thompson sampling with a certain Gaussian process prior widely-used in the Bayesian optimization literature has a $\mathcal{O}(\beta\sqrt{T\log(1+\lambda)})$ rate against a $\beta$-bounded $\lambda$-Lipschitz~adversary.</description>

Abstract: Classification of high-dimensional low sample size (HDLSS) data poses a challenge in a variety of real-world situations, such as gene expression studies, cancer research, and medical imaging. This article presents the development and analysis of some classifiers that are specifically designed for HDLSS data. These classifiers are free of tuning parameters and are robust, in the sense that they are devoid of any moment conditions of the underlying data distributions. It is shown that they yield perfect classification in the HDLSS asymptotic regime, under some fairly general conditions. The comparative performance of the proposed classifiers is also investigated. Our theoretical results are supported by extensive simulation studies and real data analysis, which demonstrate promising advantages of the proposed classification techniques over several widely recognized methods.</description>

Abstract: The requirement of uncertainty quantification for anomaly detection systems has become increasingly important. In this context, effectively controlling Type I error rates ($\alpha$) without compromising the statistical power ($1-\beta$) of these systems can build trust and reduce costs related to false discoveries. The field of conformal anomaly detection emerges as a promising approach for providing respective statistical guarantees by model calibration. However, the dependency on calibration data poses practical limitations - especially within low-data regimes. In this work, we formally define and evaluate leave-one-out-, bootstrap-, and cross-conformal methods for anomaly detection, incrementing on methods from the field of conformal prediction. Looking beyond the classical inductive conformal anomaly detection, we demonstrate that derived methods for calculating resampling-conformal $p$-values strike a practical compromise between statistical efficiency (full-conformal) and computational efficiency (split-conformal) as they make more efficient use of available data. We validate derived methods and quantify their improvements for a range of one-class classifiers and datasets.</description>

Abstract: Given an unconditional diffusion model targeting a joint model $\pi(x, y)$, using it to perform conditional simulation $\pi(x \mid y)$ is still largely an open question and is typically achieved by learning conditional drifts to the denoising SDE after the fact. In this work, we express \emph{exact} conditional simulation within the \emph{approximate} diffusion model as an inference problem on an augmented space corresponding to a partial SDE bridge. This perspective allows us to implement efficient and principled particle Gibbs and pseudo-marginal samplers marginally targeting the conditional distribution $\pi(x \mid y)$. Contrary to existing methodology, our methods do not introduce any additional approximation to the unconditional diffusion model aside from the Monte Carlo error. We showcase the benefits and drawbacks of our approach on a series of synthetic and real data examples.</description>

      <title>Do Contemporary Causal Inference Models Capture Real-World Heterogeneity? Findings from a Large-Scale Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present unexpected findings from a large-scale benchmark study evaluating Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) estimation algorithms, i.e., CATE models. By running 16 modern CATE models on 12 datasets and 43,200 sampled variants generated through diverse observational sampling strategies, we find that: (a) 62\% of CATE estimates have a higher Mean Squared Error (MSE) than a trivial zero-effect predictor, rendering them ineffective; (b) in datasets with at least one useful CATE estimate, 80\% still have higher MSE than a constant-effect model; and (c) Orthogonality-based models outperform other models only 30\% of the time, despite widespread optimism about their performance. These findings highlight significant challenges in current CATE models and underscore the need for broader evaluation and methodological improvements.
  Our findings stem from a novel application of \textit{observational sampling}, originally developed to evaluate Average Treatment Effect (ATE) estimates from observational methods with experiment data. To adapt observational sampling for CATE evaluation, we introduce a statistical parameter, $Q$, equal to MSE minus a constant and preserves the ranking of models by their MSE. We then derive a family of sample statistics, collectively called $\hat{Q}$, that can be computed from real-world data. When used in observational sampling, $\hat{Q}$ is an unbiased estimator of $Q$ and asymptotically selects the model with the smallest MSE. To ensure the benchmark reflects real-world heterogeneity, we handpick datasets where outcomes come from field rather than simulation. By integrating observational sampling, new statistics, and real-world datasets, the benchmark provides new insights into CATE model performance and reveals gaps in capturing real-world heterogeneity, emphasizing the need for more robust benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Addressing Rotational Learning Dynamics in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving complex problems through agents' cooperation and competition, finding widespread applications across domains. Despite its success, MARL faces a reproducibility crisis. We show that, in part, this issue is related to the rotational optimization dynamics arising from competing agents' objectives, and require methods beyond standard optimization algorithms. We reframe MARL approaches using Variational Inequalities (VIs), offering a unified framework to address such issues. Leveraging optimization techniques designed for VIs, we propose a general approach for integrating gradient-based VI methods capable of handling rotational dynamics into existing MARL algorithms. Empirical results demonstrate significant performance improvements across benchmarks. In zero-sum games, Rock--paper--scissors and Matching pennies, VI methods achieve better convergence to equilibrium strategies, and in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment: Predator-prey, they also enhance team coordination. These results underscore the transformative potential of advanced optimization techniques in MARL.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Neural Goodness-of-Fit Test for Time Series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13986v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time series data are crucial across diverse domains such as finance and healthcare, where accurate forecasting and decision-making rely on advanced modeling techniques. While generative models have shown great promise in capturing the intricate dynamics inherent in time series, evaluating their performance remains a major challenge. Traditional evaluation metrics fall short due to the temporal dependencies and potential high dimensionality of the features. In this paper, we propose the REcurrent NeurAL (RENAL) Goodness-of-Fit test, a novel and statistically rigorous framework for evaluating generative time series models. By leveraging recurrent neural networks, we transform the time series into conditionally independent data pairs, enabling the application of a chi-square-based goodness-of-fit test to the temporal dependencies within the data. This approach offers a robust, theoretically grounded solution for assessing the quality of generative models, particularly in settings with limited time sequences. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method across both synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming existing methods in terms of reliability and accuracy. Our method fills a critical gap in the evaluation of time series generative models, offering a tool that is both practical and adaptable to high-stakes applications.</description>

      <title>Model agnostic local variable importance for locally dependent relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global variable importance measures are commonly used to interpret the results of machine learning models. Local variable importance techniques assess how variables contribute to individual observations. Current methods typically fail to accurately reflect locally dependent relationships between variables and instead focus on marginal importance values. Additionally, they are not natively adapted for multi-class classification problems. We propose a new model-agnostic method for calculating local variable importance, CLIQUE, that captures locally dependent relationships, improves over permutation-based methods, and can be directly applied to multi-category classification problems. Simulated and real-world examples show that CLIQUE emphasizes locally dependent information and properly reduces bias in regions where variables do not affect the response.</description>

      <title>An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Thompson Sampling for Logistic Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the performance of the Thompson Sampling algorithm for logistic bandit problems. In this setting, an agent receives binary rewards with probabilities determined by a logistic function, $\exp(\beta \langle a, \theta \rangle)/(1+\exp(\beta \langle a, \theta \rangle))$, with slope parameter $\beta&gt;0$, and where both the action $a\in \mathcal{A}$ and parameter $\theta \in \mathcal{O}$ lie within the $d$-dimensional unit ball. Adopting the information-theoretic framework introduced by Russo and Van Roy (2016), we analyze the information ratio, a statistic that quantifies the trade-off between the immediate regret incurred and the information gained about the optimal action. We improve upon previous results by establishing that the information ratio is bounded by $\tfrac{9}{2}d\alpha^{-2}$, where $\alpha$ is a minimax measure of the alignment between the action space $\mathcal{A}$ and the parameter space $\mathcal{O}$, and is independent of $\beta$. Using this result, we derive a bound of order $O(d/\alpha\sqrt{T \log(\beta T/d)})$ on the Bayesian expected regret of Thompson Sampling incurred after $T$ time steps. To our knowledge, this is the first regret bound for logistic bandits that depends only logarithmically on $\beta$ while being independent of the number of actions. In particular, when the action space contains the parameter space, the bound on the expected regret is of order $\tilde{O}(d \sqrt{T})$.</description>

      <title>Identifying metric structures of deep latent variable models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep latent variable models learn condensed representations of data that, hopefully, reflect the inner workings of the studied phenomena. Unfortunately, these latent representations are not statistically identifiable, meaning they cannot be uniquely determined. Domain experts, therefore, need to tread carefully when interpreting these. Current solutions limit the lack of identifiability through additional constraints on the latent variable model, e.g. by requiring labeled training data, or by restricting the expressivity of the model. We change the goal: instead of identifying the latent variables, we identify relationships between them such as meaningful distances, angles, and volumes. We prove this is feasible under very mild model conditions and without additional labeled data. We empirically demonstrate that our theory results in more reliable latent distances, offering a principled path forward in extracting trustworthy conclusions from deep latent variable models.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning with Pre-trained Conditional Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.12833v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transfer learning is crucial in training deep neural networks on new target tasks. Current transfer learning methods always assume at least one of (i) source and target task label spaces overlap, (ii) source datasets are available, and (iii) target network architectures are consistent with source ones. However, holding these assumptions is difficult in practical settings because the target task rarely has the same labels as the source task, the source dataset access is restricted due to storage costs and privacy, and the target architecture is often specialized to each task. To transfer source knowledge without these assumptions, we propose a transfer learning method that uses deep generative models and is composed of the following two stages: pseudo pre-training (PP) and pseudo semi-supervised learning (P-SSL). PP trains a target architecture with an artificial dataset synthesized by using conditional source generative models. P-SSL applies SSL algorithms to labeled target data and unlabeled pseudo samples, which are generated by cascading the source classifier and generative models to condition them with target samples. Our experimental results indicate that our method can outperform the baselines of scratch training and knowledge distillation.</description>

      <title>Hilbert's projective metric for functions of bounded growth and exponential convergence of Sinkhorn's algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04041v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the entropic optimal transport problem in unbounded settings, we study versions of Hilbert's projective metric for spaces of integrable functions of bounded growth. These versions of Hilbert's metric originate from cones which are relaxations of the cone of all non-negative functions, in the sense that they include all functions having non-negative integral values when multiplied with certain test functions. We show that kernel integral operators are contractions with respect to suitable specifications of such metrics even for kernels which are not bounded away from zero, provided that the decay to zero of the kernel is controlled. As an application to entropic optimal transport, we show exponential convergence of Sinkhorn's algorithm in settings where the marginal distributions have sufficiently light tails compared to the growth of the cost function.</description>

      <title>A projected nonlinear state-space model for forecasting time series signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning and forecasting stochastic time series is essential in various scientific fields. However, despite the proposals of nonlinear filters and deep-learning methods, it remains challenging to capture nonlinear dynamics from a few noisy samples and predict future trajectories with uncertainty estimates while maintaining computational efficiency. Here, we propose a fast algorithm to learn and forecast nonlinear dynamics from noisy time series data. A key feature of the proposed model is kernel functions applied to projected lines, enabling fast and efficient capture of nonlinearities in the latent dynamics. Through empirical case studies and benchmarking, the model demonstrates its effectiveness in learning and forecasting complex nonlinear dynamics, offering a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners in time series analysis.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Anomaly Detection for Lane Rendering Using Transformer with Self-Supervised Pre-Training and Customized Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04398v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The burgeoning navigation services using digital maps provide great convenience to drivers. Nevertheless, the presence of anomalies in lane rendering map images occasionally introduces potential hazards, as such anomalies can be misleading to human drivers and consequently contribute to unsafe driving conditions. In response to this concern and to accurately and effectively detect the anomalies, this paper transforms lane rendering image anomaly detection into a classification problem and proposes a four-phase pipeline consisting of data pre-processing, self-supervised pre-training with the masked image modeling (MiM) method, customized fine-tuning using cross-entropy based loss with label smoothing, and post-processing to tackle it leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, especially those involving Transformer models. Various experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline. Results indicate that the proposed pipeline exhibits superior performance in lane rendering image anomaly detection, and notably, the self-supervised pre-training with MiM can greatly enhance the detection accuracy while significantly reducing the total training time. For instance, employing the Swin Transformer with Uniform Masking as self-supervised pretraining (Swin-Trans-UM) yielded a heightened accuracy at 94.77% and an improved Area Under The Curve (AUC) score of 0.9743 compared with the pure Swin Transformer without pre-training (Swin-Trans) with an accuracy of 94.01% and an AUC of 0.9498. The fine-tuning epochs were dramatically reduced to 41 from the original 280. In conclusion, the proposed pipeline, with its incorporation of self-supervised pre-training using MiM and other advanced deep learning techniques, emerges as a robust solution for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of lane rendering image anomaly detection in digital navigation systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal coordination of resources: A solution from reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient allocation is important in nature and human society, where individuals frequently compete for limited resources. The Minority Game (MG) is perhaps the simplest toy model to address this issue. However, most previous solutions assume that the strategies are provided a priori and static, failing to capture their adaptive nature. Here, we introduce the reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm to MG, where individuals adjust decisions based on accumulated experience and expected rewards dynamically. We find that this RL framework achieves optimal resource coordination when individuals balance the exploitation of experience with random exploration. Yet, the imbalanced strategies of the two lead to suboptimal partial coordination or even anti-coordination. Our mechanistic analysis reveals a symmetry-breaking in action preferences at the optimum, offering a fresh solution to the MG and new insights into the resource allocation problem.</description>

      <title>Fast Bayesian Inference for Neutrino Non-Standard Interactions at Dark Matter Direct Detection Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-dimensional parameter spaces are commonly encountered in physics theories that go beyond the Standard Model. However, they often possess complicated posterior geometries that are expensive to traverse using techniques traditional to astroparticle physics. Several recent innovations, which are only beginning to make their way into this field, have made navigating such complex posteriors possible. These include GPU acceleration, automatic differentiation, and neural-network-guided reparameterization. We apply these advancements to dark matter direct detection experiments in the context of non-standard neutrino interactions and benchmark their performances against traditional nested sampling techniques when conducting Bayesian inference. Compared to nested sampling alone, we find that these techniques increase performance for both nested sampling and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, accelerating inference by factors of $\sim 100$ and $\sim 60$, respectively. As nested sampling also evaluates the Bayesian evidence, these advancements can be exploited to improve model comparison performance while retaining compatibility with existing implementations that are widely used in the natural sciences. Using these techniques, we perform the first scan in the neutrino non-standard interactions parameter space for direct detection experiments whereby all parameters are allowed to vary simultaneously. We expect that these advancements are broadly applicable to other areas of astroparticle physics featuring multi-dimensional parameter spaces.</description>

      <title>metabench -- A Sparse Benchmark of Reasoning and Knowledge in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) vary in their abilities on a range of tasks. Initiatives such as the Open LLM Leaderboard aim to quantify these differences with several large benchmarks (sets of test items to which an LLM can respond either correctly or incorrectly). However, high correlations within and between benchmark scores suggest that (1) there exists a small set of common underlying abilities that these benchmarks measure, and (2) items tap into redundant information and the benchmarks may thus be considerably compressed. We use data from n &gt; 5000 LLMs to identify the most informative items of six benchmarks, ARC, GSM8K, HellaSwag, MMLU, TruthfulQA and WinoGrande (with d = 28,632 items in total). From them we distill a sparse benchmark, metabench, that has less than 3% of the original size of all six benchmarks combined. This new sparse benchmark goes beyond point scores by yielding estimators of the underlying benchmark-specific abilities. We show that these estimators (1) can be used to reconstruct each original individual benchmark score with, on average, 1.24% root mean square error (RMSE), (2) reconstruct the original total score with 0.58% RMSE, and (3) have a single underlying common factor whose Spearman correlation with the total score is r = 0.94.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Missing values are prevalent across various fields, posing challenges for training and deploying predictive models. In this context, imputation is a common practice, driven by the hope that accurate imputations will enhance predictions. However, recent theoretical and empirical studies indicate that simple constant imputation can be consistent and competitive. This empirical study aims at clarifying if and when investing in advanced imputation methods yields significantly better predictions. Relating imputation and predictive accuracies across combinations of imputation and predictive models on 19 datasets, we show that imputation accuracy matters less i) when using expressive models, ii) when incorporating missingness indicators as complementary inputs, iii) matters much more for generated linear outcomes than for real-data outcomes. Interestingly, we also show that the use of the missingness indicator is beneficial to the prediction performance, even in MCAR scenarios. Overall, on real-data with powerful models, improving imputation only has a minor effect on prediction performance. Thus, investing in better imputations for improved predictions often offers limited benefits.</description>

      <title>Extracting Sentence Embeddings from Pretrained Transformer Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained transformer models shine in many natural language processing tasks and therefore are expected to bear the representation of the input sentence or text meaning. These sentence-level embeddings are also important in retrieval-augmented generation. But do commonly used plain averaging or prompt templates sufficiently capture and represent the underlying meaning? After providing a comprehensive review of existing sentence embedding extraction and refinement methods, we thoroughly test different combinations and our original extensions of the most promising ones on pretrained models. Namely, given 110 M parameters, BERT's hidden representations from multiple layers, and many tokens, we try diverse ways to extract optimal sentence embeddings. We test various token aggregation and representation post-processing techniques. We also test multiple ways of using a general Wikitext dataset to complement BERT's sentence embeddings. All methods are tested on eight Semantic Textual Similarity (STS), six short text clustering, and twelve classification tasks. We also evaluate our representation-shaping techniques on other static models, including random token representations. Proposed representation extraction methods improve the performance on STS and clustering tasks for all models considered. Very high improvements for static token-based models, especially random embeddings for STS tasks, almost reach the performance of BERT-derived representations. Our work shows that the representation-shaping techniques significantly improve sentence embeddings extracted from BERT-based and simple baseline models.</description>

      <title>Second Order Bounds for Contextual Bandits with Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many works have developed no-regret algorithms for contextual bandits with function approximation, where the mean reward function over context-action pairs belongs to a function class. Although there are many approaches to this problem, one that has gained in importance is the use of algorithms based on the optimism principle such as optimistic least squares. It can be shown the regret of this algorithm scales as square root of the product of the eluder dimension (a statistical measure of the complexity of the function class), the logarithm of the function class size and the time horizon. Unfortunately, even if the variance of the measurement noise of the rewards at each time is changing and is very small, the regret of the optimistic least squares algorithm scales with square root of the time horizon. In this work we are the first to develop algorithms that satisfy regret bounds of scaling not with the square root of the time horizon, but the square root of the sum of the measurement variances in the setting of contextual bandits with function approximation when the variances are unknown. These bounds generalize existing techniques for deriving second order bounds in contextual linear problems.</description>

      <title>Sharpness-Aware Minimization Efficiently Selects Flatter Minima Late in Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has substantially improved the generalization of neural networks under various settings. Despite the success, its effectiveness remains poorly understood. In this work, we discover an intriguing phenomenon in the training dynamics of SAM, shedding light on understanding its implicit bias towards flatter minima over Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). Specifically, we find that SAM efficiently selects flatter minima late in training. Remarkably, even a few epochs of SAM applied at the end of training yield nearly the same generalization and solution sharpness as full SAM training. Subsequently, we delve deeper into the underlying mechanism behind this phenomenon. Theoretically, we identify two phases in the learning dynamics after applying SAM late in training: i) SAM first escapes the minimum found by SGD exponentially fast; and ii) then rapidly converges to a flatter minimum within the same valley. Furthermore, we empirically investigate the role of SAM during the early training phase. We conjecture that the optimization method chosen in the late phase is more crucial in shaping the final solution's properties. Based on this viewpoint, we extend our findings from SAM to Adversarial Training.</description>

      <title>How Does Critical Batch Size Scale in Pre-training?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21676v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training large-scale models under given resources requires careful design of parallelism strategies. In particular, the efficiency notion of critical batch size (CBS), concerning the compromise between time and compute, marks the threshold beyond which greater data parallelism leads to diminishing returns. To operationalize it, we propose a measure of CBS and pre-train a series of auto-regressive language models, ranging from 85 million to 1.2 billion parameters, on the C4 dataset. Through extensive hyper-parameter sweeps and careful control of factors such as batch size, momentum, and learning rate along with its scheduling, we systematically investigate the impact of scale on CBS. Then we fit scaling laws with respect to model and data sizes to decouple their effects. Overall, our results demonstrate that CBS scales primarily with data size rather than model size, a finding we justify theoretically through the analysis of infinite-width limits of neural networks and infinite-dimensional least squares regression. Of independent interest, we highlight the importance of common hyper-parameter choices and strategies for studying large-scale pre-training beyond fixed training durations.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Uncertainty Quantification for Distributed Energy Adoption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid deployment of distributed energy resources (DER) has introduced significant spatio-temporal uncertainties in power grid management, necessitating accurate multilevel forecasting methods. However, existing approaches often produce overly conservative uncertainty intervals at individual spatial units and fail to properly capture uncertainties when aggregating predictions across different spatial scales. This paper presents a novel hierarchical spatio-temporal model based on the conformal prediction framework to address these challenges. Our approach generates circuit-level DER growth predictions and efficiently aggregates them to the substation level while maintaining statistical validity through a tailored non-conformity score. Applied to a decade of DER installation data from a local utility network, our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches, particularly in reducing prediction interval widths while maintaining coverage.</description>

      <title>Towards counterfactual fairness through auxiliary variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The challenge of balancing fairness and predictive accuracy in machine learning models, especially when sensitive attributes such as race, gender, or age are considered, has motivated substantial research in recent years. Counterfactual fairness ensures that predictions remain consistent across counterfactual variations of sensitive attributes, which is a crucial concept in addressing societal biases. However, existing counterfactual fairness approaches usually overlook intrinsic information about sensitive features, limiting their ability to achieve fairness while simultaneously maintaining performance. To tackle this challenge, we introduce EXOgenous Causal reasoning (EXOC), a novel causal reasoning framework motivated by exogenous variables. It leverages auxiliary variables to uncover intrinsic properties that give rise to sensitive attributes. Our framework explicitly defines an auxiliary node and a control node that contribute to counterfactual fairness and control the information flow within the model. Our evaluation, conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets, validates EXOC's superiority, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in achieving counterfactual fairness. Our code is available at https://github.com/CASE-Lab-UMD/counterfactual_fairness_2025.</description>

      <title>Disentangled Graph Autoencoder for Treatment Effect Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Treatment effect estimation from observational data has attracted significant attention across various research fields. However, many widely used methods rely on the unconfoundedness assumption, which is often unrealistic due to the inability to observe all confounders, thereby overlooking the influence of latent confounders. To address this limitation, recent approaches have utilized auxiliary network information to infer latent confounders, relaxing this assumption. However, these methods often treat observed variables and networks as proxies only for latent confounders, which can result in inaccuracies when certain variables influence treatment without affecting outcomes, or vice versa. This conflation of distinct latent factors undermines the precision of treatment effect estimation. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel disentangled variational graph autoencoder for treatment effect estimation on networked observational data. Our graph encoder disentangles latent factors into instrumental, confounding, adjustment, and noisy factors, while enforcing factor independence using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion. Extensive experiments on multiple networked datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Global Ease of Living Index: a machine learning framework for longitudinal analysis of major economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The drastic changes in the global economy, geopolitical conditions, and disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted the cost of living and quality of life. It is important to understand the long-term nature of the cost of living and quality of life in major economies. A transparent and comprehensive living index must include multiple dimensions of living conditions. In this study, we present an approach to quantifying the quality of life through the Global Ease of Living Index that combines various socio-economic and infrastructural factors into a single composite score. Our index utilises economic indicators that define living standards, which could help in targeted interventions to improve specific areas. We present a machine learning framework for addressing the problem of missing data for some of the economic indicators for specific countries. We then curate and update the data and use a dimensionality reduction approach (principal component analysis) to create the Ease of Living Index for major economies since 1970. Our work significantly adds to the literature by offering a practical tool for policymakers to identify areas needing improvement, such as healthcare systems, employment opportunities, and public safety. Our approach with open data and code can be easily reproduced and applied to various contexts. This transparency and accessibility make our work a valuable resource for ongoing research and policy development in quality-of-life assessment.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Optimizer Design for LLM via Structured Fisher Approximation with a Low-Rank Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing efficient optimizers for large language models (LLMs) with low-memory requirements and fast convergence is an important and challenging problem. This paper makes a step towards the systematic design of such optimizers through the lens of structured Fisher information matrix (FIM) approximation. We show that many state-of-the-art efficient optimizers can be viewed as solutions to FIM approximation (under the Frobenius norm) with specific structural assumptions. Building on these insights, we propose two design recommendations of practical efficient optimizers for LLMs, involving the careful selection of structural assumptions to balance generality and efficiency, and enhancing memory efficiency of optimizers with general structures through a novel low-rank extension framework. We demonstrate how to use each design approach by deriving new memory-efficient optimizers: Row and Column Scaled SGD (RACS) and Adaptive low-dimensional subspace estimation (Alice). Experiments on LLaMA pre-training (up to 1B parameters) validate the effectiveness, showing faster and better convergence than existing memory-efficient baselines and Adam with little memory overhead. Notably, Alice achieves better than 2x faster convergence over Adam, while RACS delivers strong performance on the 1B model with SGD-like memory.</description>

      <title>WENDy for Nonlinear-in-Parameters ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Weak-form Estimation of Non-linear Dynamics (WENDy) algorithm is extended to accommodate systems of ordinary differential equations that are nonlinear-in-parameters. The extension rests on derived analytic expressions for a likelihood function, its gradient and its Hessian matrix. WENDy makes use of these to approximate a maximum likelihood estimator based on optimization routines suited for non-convex optimization problems. The resulting parameter estimation algorithm has better accuracy, a substantially larger domain of convergence, and is often orders of magnitude faster than the conventional output error least squares method (based on forward solvers).
  The algorithm is efficiently implemented in Julia. We demonstrate the algorithm's ability to accommodate the weak form optimization for both additive normal and multiplicative log-normal noise, and present results on a suite of benchmark systems of ordinary differential equations. In order to demonstrate the practical benefits of our approach, we present extensive comparisons between our method and output error methods in terms of accuracy, precision, bias, and coverage.</description>
