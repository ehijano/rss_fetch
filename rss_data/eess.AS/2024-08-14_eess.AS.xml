      <title>Lyrics Transcription for Humans: A Readability-Aware Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Writing down lyrics for human consumption involves not only accurately capturing word sequences, but also incorporating punctuation and formatting for clarity and to convey contextual information. This includes song structure, emotional emphasis, and contrast between lead and background vocals. While automatic lyrics transcription (ALT) systems have advanced beyond producing unstructured strings of words and are able to draw on wider context, ALT benchmarks have not kept pace and continue to focus exclusively on words. To address this gap, we introduce Jam-ALT, a comprehensive lyrics transcription benchmark. The benchmark features a complete revision of the JamendoLyrics dataset, in adherence to industry standards for lyrics transcription and formatting, along with evaluation metrics designed to capture and assess the lyric-specific nuances, laying the foundation for improving the readability of lyrics. We apply the benchmark to recent transcription systems and present additional error analysis, as well as an experimental comparison with a classical music dataset.</description>

      <title>PRESENT: Zero-Shot Text-to-Prosody Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current strategies for achieving fine-grained prosody control in speech synthesis entail extracting additional style embeddings or adopting more complex architectures. To enable zero-shot application of pretrained text-to-speech (TTS) models, we present PRESENT (PRosody Editing without Style Embeddings or New Training), which exploits explicit prosody prediction in FastSpeech2-based models by modifying the inference process directly. We apply our text-to-prosody framework to zero-shot language transfer using a JETS model exclusively trained on English LJSpeech data. We obtain character error rates (CER) of 12.8%, 18.7% and 5.9% for German, Hungarian and Spanish respectively, beating the previous state-of-the-art CER by over 2x for all three languages. Furthermore, we allow subphoneme-level control, a first in this field. To evaluate its effectiveness, we show that PRESENT can improve the prosody of questions, and use it to generate Mandarin, a tonal language where vowel pitch varies at subphoneme level. We attain 25.3% hanzi CER and 13.0% pinyin CER with the JETS model. All our code and audio samples are available online.</description>

      <title>BSS-CFFMA: Cross-Domain Feature Fusion and Multi-Attention Speech Enhancement Network based on Self-Supervised Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech self-supervised learning (SSL) represents has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple downstream tasks. However, its application in speech enhancement (SE) tasks remains immature, offering opportunities for improvement. In this study, we introduce a novel cross-domain feature fusion and multi-attention speech enhancement network, termed BSS-CFFMA, which leverages self-supervised embeddings. BSS-CFFMA comprises a multi-scale cross-domain feature fusion (MSCFF) block and a residual hybrid multi-attention (RHMA) block. The MSCFF block effectively integrates cross-domain features, facilitating the extraction of rich acoustic information. The RHMA block, serving as the primary enhancement module, utilizes three distinct attention modules to capture diverse attention representations and estimate high-quality speech signals.
  We evaluate the performance of the BSS-CFFMA model through comparative and ablation studies on the VoiceBank-DEMAND dataset, achieving SOTA results. Furthermore, we select three types of data from the WHAMR! dataset, a collection specifically designed for speech enhancement tasks, to assess the capabilities of BSS-CFFMA in tasks such as denoising only, dereverberation only, and simultaneous denoising and dereverberation. This study marks the first attempt to explore the effectiveness of self-supervised embedding-based speech enhancement methods in complex tasks encompassing dereverberation and simultaneous denoising and dereverberation. The demo implementation of BSS-CFFMA is available online\footnote[2]{https://github.com/AlimMat/BSS-CFFMA. \label{s1}}.</description>

      <title>SaSLaW: Dialogue Speech Corpus with Audio-visual Egocentric Information Toward Environment-adaptive Dialogue Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents SaSLaW, a spontaneous dialogue speech corpus containing synchronous recordings of what speakers speak, listen to, and watch. Humans consider the diverse environmental factors and then control the features of their utterances in face-to-face voice communications. Spoken dialogue systems capable of this adaptation to these audio environments enable natural and seamless communications. SaSLaW was developed to model human-speech adjustment for audio environments via first-person audio-visual perceptions in spontaneous dialogues. We propose the construction methodology of SaSLaW and display the analysis result of the corpus. We additionally conducted an experiment to develop text-to-speech models using SaSLaW and evaluate their performance of adaptations to audio environments. The results indicate that models incorporating hearing-audio data output more plausible speech tailored to diverse audio environments than the vanilla text-to-speech model.</description>

      <title>VNet: A GAN-based Multi-Tier Discriminator Network for Speech Synthesis Vocoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in speech synthesis, remarkable achievements have been attained. In a thorough exploration of vocoders, it has been discovered that audio waveforms can be generated at speeds exceeding real-time while maintaining high fidelity, achieved through the utilization of GAN-based models. Typically, the inputs to the vocoder consist of band-limited spectral information, which inevitably sacrifices high-frequency details. To address this, we adopt the full-band Mel spectrogram information as input, aiming to provide the vocoder with the most comprehensive information possible. However, previous studies have revealed that the use of full-band spectral information as input can result in the issue of over-smoothing, compromising the naturalness of the synthesized speech. To tackle this challenge, we propose VNet, a GAN-based neural vocoder network that incorporates full-band spectral information and introduces a Multi-Tier Discriminator (MTD) comprising multiple sub-discriminators to generate high-resolution signals. Additionally, we introduce an asymptotically constrained method that modifies the adversarial loss of the generator and discriminator, enhancing the stability of the training process. Through rigorous experiments, we demonstrate that the VNet model is capable of generating high-fidelity speech and significantly improving the performance of the vocoder.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Space Fusion and Dual-Dimension Attention: A New Paradigm for Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning has demonstrated impressive performance in speech tasks, yet there remains ample opportunity for advancement in the realm of speech enhancement research. In addressing speech tasks, confining the attention mechanism solely to the temporal dimension poses limitations in effectively focusing on critical speech features. Considering the aforementioned issues, our study introduces a novel speech enhancement framework, HFSDA, which skillfully integrates heterogeneous spatial features and incorporates a dual-dimension attention mechanism to significantly enhance speech clarity and quality in noisy environments. By leveraging self-supervised learning embeddings in tandem with Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectrogram features, our model excels at capturing both high-level semantic information and detailed spectral data, enabling a more thorough analysis and refinement of speech signals. Furthermore, we employ the innovative Omni-dimensional Dynamic Convolution (ODConv) technology within the spectrogram input branch, enabling enhanced extraction and integration of crucial information across multiple dimensions. Additionally, we refine the Conformer model by enhancing its feature extraction capabilities not only in the temporal dimension but also across the spectral domain. Extensive experiments on the VCTK-DEMAND dataset show that HFSDA is comparable to existing state-of-the-art models, confirming the validity of our approach.</description>

      <title>Dilated Convolution with Learnable Spacings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis presents and evaluates the Dilated Convolution with Learnable Spacings (DCLS) method. Through various supervised learning experiments in the fields of computer vision, audio, and speech processing, the DCLS method proves to outperform both standard and advanced convolution techniques. The research is organized into several steps, starting with an analysis of the literature and existing convolution techniques that preceded the development of the DCLS method. We were particularly interested in the methods that are closely related to our own and that remain essential to capture the nuances and uniqueness of our approach. The cornerstone of our study is the introduction and application of the DCLS method to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), as well as to hybrid architectures that rely on both convolutional and visual attention approaches. DCLS is shown to be particularly effective in tasks such as classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. Initially using bilinear interpolation, the study also explores other interpolation methods, finding that Gaussian interpolation slightly improves performance. The DCLS method is further applied to spiking neural networks (SNNs) to enable synaptic delay learning within a neural network that could eventually be transferred to so-called neuromorphic chips. The results show that the DCLS method stands out as a new state-of-the-art technique in SNN audio classification for certain benchmark tasks in this field. These tasks involve datasets with a high temporal component. In addition, we show that DCLS can significantly improve the accuracy of artificial neural networks for the multi-label audio classification task. We conclude with a discussion of the chosen experimental setup, its limitations, the limitations of our method, and our results.</description>

      <title>FoVNet: Configurable Field-of-View Speech Enhancement with Low Computation and Distortion for Smart Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel multi-channel speech enhancement approach, FoVNet, that enables highly efficient speech enhancement within a configurable field of view (FoV) of a smart-glasses user without needing specific target-talker(s) directions. It advances over prior works by enhancing all speakers within any given FoV, with a hybrid signal processing and deep learning approach designed with high computational efficiency. The neural network component is designed with ultra-low computation (about 50 MMACS). A multi-channel Wiener filter and a post-processing module are further used to improve perceptual quality. We evaluate our algorithm with a microphone array on smart glasses, providing a configurable, efficient solution for augmented hearing on energy-constrained devices. FoVNet excels in both computational efficiency and speech quality across multiple scenarios, making it a promising solution for smart glasses applications.</description>

      <title>TOGGL: Transcribing Overlapping Speech with Staggered Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transcribing the speech of multiple overlapping speakers typically requires separating the audio into multiple streams and recognizing each one independently. More recent work jointly separates and transcribes, but requires a separate decoding component for each speaker. We propose the TOGGL model to simultaneously transcribe the speech of multiple speakers. The TOGGL model uses special output tokens to attribute the speech to each speaker with only a single decoder. Our approach generalizes beyond two speakers, even when trained only on two-speaker data. We demonstrate superior performance compared to competing approaches on a conversational speech dataset. Our approach also improves performance on single-speaker audio.</description>

      <title>Music2Latent: Consistency Autoencoders for Latent Audio Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient audio representations in a compressed continuous latent space are critical for generative audio modeling and Music Information Retrieval (MIR) tasks. However, some existing audio autoencoders have limitations, such as multi-stage training procedures, slow iterative sampling, or low reconstruction quality. We introduce Music2Latent, an audio autoencoder that overcomes these limitations by leveraging consistency models. Music2Latent encodes samples into a compressed continuous latent space in a single end-to-end training process while enabling high-fidelity single-step reconstruction. Key innovations include conditioning the consistency model on upsampled encoder outputs at all levels through cross connections, using frequency-wise self-attention to capture long-range frequency dependencies, and employing frequency-wise learned scaling to handle varying value distributions across frequencies at different noise levels. We demonstrate that Music2Latent outperforms existing continuous audio autoencoders in sound quality and reconstruction accuracy while achieving competitive performance on downstream MIR tasks using its latent representations. To our knowledge, this represents the first successful attempt at training an end-to-end consistency autoencoder model.</description>

      <title>Exploring the anatomy of articulation rate in spontaneous English speech: relationships between utterance length effects and social factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech rate has been shown to vary across social categories such as gender, age, and dialect, while also being conditioned by properties of speech planning. The effect of utterance length, where speech rate is faster and less variable for longer utterances, has also been shown to reduce the role of social factors once it has been accounted for, leaving unclear the relationship between social factors and speech production in conditioning speech rate. Through modelling of speech rate across 13 English speech corpora, it is found that utterance length has the largest effect on speech rate, though this effect itself varies little across corpora and speakers. While age and gender also modulate speech rate, their effects are much smaller in magnitude. These findings suggest utterance length effects may be conditioned by articulatory and perceptual constraints, and that social influences on speech rate should be interpreted in the broader context of how speech rate variation is structured.</description>

      <title>Detecting Audio-Visual Deepfakes with Fine-Grained Inconsistencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing methods on audio-visual deepfake detection mainly focus on high-level features for modeling inconsistencies between audio and visual data. As a result, these approaches usually overlook finer audio-visual artifacts, which are inherent to deepfakes. Herein, we propose the introduction of fine-grained mechanisms for detecting subtle artifacts in both spatial and temporal domains. First, we introduce a local audio-visual model capable of capturing small spatial regions that are prone to inconsistencies with audio. For that purpose, a fine-grained mechanism based on a spatially-local distance coupled with an attention module is adopted. Second, we introduce a temporally-local pseudo-fake augmentation to include samples incorporating subtle temporal inconsistencies in our training set. Experiments on the DFDC and the FakeAVCeleb datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of generalization as compared to the state-of-the-art under both in-dataset and cross-dataset settings.</description>

Abstract: In the fields of security systems, forensic investigations, and personalized services, the importance of speech as a fundamental human input outweighs text-based interactions. This research delves deeply into the complex field of Speaker Identification (SID), examining its essential components and emphasising Mel Spectrogram and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) for feature extraction. Moreover, this study evaluates six slightly distinct model architectures using extensive analysis to evaluate their performance, with hyperparameter tuning applied to the best-performing model. This work performs a linguistic analysis to verify accent and gender accuracy, in addition to bias evaluation within the AB-1 Corpus dataset.</description>

      <title>Temporal Variability and Multi-Viewed Self-Supervised Representations to Tackle the ASVspoof5 Deepfake Challenge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ASVspoof5, the fifth edition of the ASVspoof series, is one of the largest global audio security challenges. It aims to advance the development of countermeasure (CM) to discriminate bonafide and spoofed speech utterances. In this paper, we focus on addressing the problem of open-domain audio deepfake detection, which corresponds directly to the ASVspoof5 Track1 open condition. At first, we comprehensively investigate various CM on ASVspoof5, including data expansion, data augmentation, and self-supervised learning (SSL) features. Due to the high-frequency gaps characteristic of the ASVspoof5 dataset, we introduce Frequency Mask, a data augmentation method that masks specific frequency bands to improve CM robustness. Combining various scale of temporal information with multiple SSL features, our experiments achieved a minDCF of 0.0158 and an EER of 0.55% on the ASVspoof 5 Track 1 evaluation progress set.</description>

      <title>Neural Speech and Audio Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the integration of model-based and data-driven approaches within the realm of neural speech and audio coding systems. It highlights the challenges posed by the subjective evaluation processes of speech and audio codecs and discusses the limitations of purely data-driven approaches, which often require inefficiently large architectures to match the performance of model-based methods. The study presents hybrid systems as a viable solution, offering significant improvements to the performance of conventional codecs through meticulously chosen design enhancements. Specifically, it introduces a neural network-based signal enhancer designed to post-process existing codecs' output, along with the autoencoder-based end-to-end models and LPCNet--hybrid systems that combine linear predictive coding (LPC) with neural networks. Furthermore, the paper delves into predictive models operating within custom feature spaces (TF-Codec) or predefined transform domains (MDCTNet) and examines the use of psychoacoustically calibrated loss functions to train end-to-end neural audio codecs. Through these investigations, the paper demonstrates the potential of hybrid systems to advance the field of speech and audio coding by bridging the gap between traditional model-based approaches and modern data-driven techniques.</description>

While several existing methods provide solutions for speech-driven animation, precise control over content (what) and style (how) of the final performance is still challenging. We propose a novel approach that takes as input an audio, and the corresponding text to extract temporally-aligned content and disentangled style representations, in order to provide controls over 3D facial animation. Our method is trained in two stages, that evolves from audio prominent styles (how it sounds) to visual prominent styles (how it looks). We leverage a high-resource audio dataset in stage I to learn styles that control speech generation in a self-supervised learning framework, and then fine-tune this model with low-resource audio/3D mesh pairs in stage II to control 3D vertex generation. We employ a non-autoregressive seq2seq formulation to model sentence-level dependencies, and better mouth articulations. Our method provides flexibility that the style of a reference audio and the content of a source audio can be combined to enable audio style transfer. Similarly, the content can be modified, e.g. muting or swapping words, that enables style-preserving content editing.</description>

      <title>Source Separation of Multi-source Raw Music using a Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I developed a neural audio codec model based on the residual quantized variational autoencoder architecture. I train the model on the Slakh2100 dataset, a standard dataset for musical source separation, composed of multi-track audio. The model can separate audio sources, achieving almost SoTA results with much less computing power. The code is publicly available at github.com/LeonardoBerti00/Source-Separation-of-Multi-source-Music-using-Residual-Quantizad-Variational-Autoencoder</description>

      <title>PSM: Learning Probabilistic Embeddings for Multi-scale Zero-Shot Soundscape Mapping</title>

Abstract: A soundscape is defined by the acoustic environment a person perceives at a location. In this work, we propose a framework for mapping soundscapes across the Earth. Since soundscapes involve sound distributions that span varying spatial scales, we represent locations with multi-scale satellite imagery and learn a joint representation among this imagery, audio, and text. To capture the inherent uncertainty in the soundscape of a location, we design the representation space to be probabilistic. We also fuse ubiquitous metadata (including geolocation, time, and data source) to enable learning of spatially and temporally dynamic representations of soundscapes. We demonstrate the utility of our framework by creating large-scale soundscape maps integrating both audio and text with temporal control. To facilitate future research on this task, we also introduce a large-scale dataset, GeoSound, containing over $300k$ geotagged audio samples paired with both low- and high-resolution satellite imagery. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art on both GeoSound and the existing SoundingEarth dataset. Our dataset and code is available at https://github.com/mvrl/PSM.</description>

      <title>USDnet: Unsupervised Speech Dereverberation via Neural Forward Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In reverberant conditions with a single speaker, each far-field microphone records a reverberant version of the same speaker signal at a different location. In over-determined conditions, where there are multiple microphones but only one speaker, each recorded mixture signal can be leveraged as a constraint to narrow down the solutions to target anechoic speech and thereby reduce reverberation. Equipped with this insight, we propose USDnet, a novel deep neural network (DNN) approach for unsupervised speech dereverberation (USD). At each training step, we first feed an input mixture to USDnet to produce an estimate for target speech, and then linearly filter the DNN estimate to approximate the multi-microphone mixture so that the constraint can be satisfied at each microphone, thereby regularizing the DNN estimate to approximate target anechoic speech. The linear filter can be estimated based on the mixture and DNN estimate via neural forward filtering algorithms such as forward convolutive prediction. We show that this novel methodology can promote unsupervised dereverberation of single-source reverberant speech.</description>

      <title>peerRTF: Robust MVDR Beamforming Using Graph Convolutional Network</title>

Abstract: Accurate and reliable identification of the RTF between microphones with respect to a desired source is an essential component in the design of microphone array beamformers, specifically the MVDR criterion. Since an accurate estimation of the RTF in a noisy and reverberant environment is a cumbersome task, we aim at leveraging prior knowledge of the acoustic enclosure to robustify the RTF estimation by learning the RTF manifold. In this paper, we present a novel robust RTF identification method, tested and trained with real recordings, which relies on learning the RTF manifold using a GCN to infer a robust representation of the RTF in a confined area, and consequently enhance the beamformer's performance.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Audio Deepfake Detection: A Evolving Benchmark for Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of advanced large language models such as GPT-4, GPT-4o, and the Claude family has made fake audio detection increasingly challenging. Traditional fine-tuning methods struggle to keep pace with the evolving landscape of synthetic speech, necessitating continual learning approaches that can adapt to new audio while retaining the ability to detect older types. Continual learning, which acts as an effective tool for detecting newly emerged deepfake audio while maintaining performance on older types, lacks a well-constructed and user-friendly evaluation framework. To address this gap, we introduce EVDA, a benchmark for evaluating continual learning methods in deepfake audio detection. EVDA includes classic datasets from the Anti-Spoofing Voice series, Chinese fake audio detection series, and newly generated deepfake audio from models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o. It supports various continual learning techniques, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Learning without Forgetting (LwF), and recent methods like Regularized Adaptive Weight Modification (RAWM) and Radian Weight Modification (RWM). Additionally, EVDA facilitates the development of robust algorithms by providing an open interface for integrating new continual learning methods</description>

      <title>Improving Audio Generation with Visual Enhanced Captions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models have shown significant achievements in audio generation tasks. However, existing models struggle with complex and detailed prompts, leading to potential performance degradation. We hypothesize that this problem stems from the simplicity and scarcity of the training data. This work aims to create a large-scale audio dataset with rich captions for improving audio generation models. We first develop an automated pipeline to generate detailed captions by transforming predicted visual captions, audio captions, and tagging labels into comprehensive descriptions using a Large Language Model (LLM). The resulting dataset, Sound-VECaps, comprises 1.66M high-quality audio-caption pairs with enriched details including audio event orders, occurred places and environment information. We then demonstrate that training the text-to-audio generation models with Sound-VECaps significantly improves the performance on complex prompts. Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies of the models on several downstream audio-language tasks, showing the potential of Sound-VECaps in advancing audio-text representation learning. Our dataset and models are available online.</description>
