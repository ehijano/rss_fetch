      <title>Weighted error-sum identities for periodic continued fractions and their generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a purely $N$-periodic continued fraction $\xi=[\overline{a_0,a_1,\dots,a_{N-1}}]=[a_0,a_1,\cdots]$, with $a_k=a_{k+N}$ for all $k\ge 0$, and convergents $h_n/k_n=[a_0,a_1,\dots,a_n]$, we obtain explicit expressions for the weighted error sums $f_\xi(s)=\sum a_{n+1}\lvert h_n-\xi k_n\rvert^s$ for $s&gt;1$. A key observation is that, for each residue class $k_0\in{0,1,\dots,N-1}$, the subsequence of approximation errors $(h_k-\xi k_k)$ with $k\equiv k_0 \pmod N$ forms a geometric progression. In addition, we extend our methods to generalized continued fractions with numerators $(b_n)$, obtaining Euler-type identities and weighted error-sum formulae for $\pi$ and $\ln 2$.</description>

      <title>The Davenport constant of an interval: a proof that $\mathsf{D}=\chi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For two positive integers $m$ and $M$, we study the Davenport constant of the interval of integers $[\![ -m,M ]\!]$, that is the maximal length of a minimal zero-sum sequence composed of elements from $[\![ -m,M ]\!]$. We prove the conjecture that it is equal to $m+M- r$ where $r$ is the smallest integer which can be decomposed as a sum of two non-negative integers $t_1$ and $t_2$ ($r=t_1+t_2$) having the property that $\gcd (M-t_1, m-t_2)=1$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we present rigorously and as succintly as possible the theory of elliptic quasi-modular forms by means of moduli spaces and the Gauss-Manin connection, and deal with one of the main historical appearances of quasi-modular forms, which was the seminal case of mirror symmetry treated by Dijkgraaf.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the notion of mod $p^m$ singular Siegel modular forms of $p$-rank $r$
  to the vector-valued case and we show that also in this case a congruence mod $(p-1)p^{m-1}$
  between the scalar weight and the $p$-rank must hold. In some sense our proof is even simpler than the one we gave previously in the scaler valued case.</description>

      <title>On a certain type of deformation of umbral orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper we derive complicated families of orthogonal polynomials in one variable from scratch using the known ones as building blocks. We recall the basics of operational formalism and introduce the notations we use throughout this paper. Then we establish through this formalism the known families of orthogonal polynomials in order to see the mechanism that lies at the heart of classical and hypergeometric $q=1$ orthogonal polynomials and their associated families, which arise form this viewpoint in a very natural manner.</description>

      <title>Impacted Buildings for GL(2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we define a generating function for buildings of type $\widetilde{A}_1$ (i.e. trees) that are enhanced with a certain filtration structure. We prove that this generating function recovers the zeta function of certain quadratic orders. We do this by studying how the ideals of the orders distribute in the building of $SL(2, K)$.</description>

      <title>On the variance of the digits of $1/p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p&gt;3$ be a prime and $b\ge 2$ an integer such that $p$ does not divide $b$. Then $1/p$ has a periodic digit expansion with respect to the basis $b$. The length $q$ of the period is the (multiplicative) order of $b$ mod $p$. In the case $q=p-1$ a formula for the variance of the digits of a period was given previously. This formula involves a Dedekind sum. We determine the variance in the case $q=(p-1)/2$. If $p\equiv 3$ mod 4 a Dedekind sum and the class number of $\mathbb Q(\sqrt{-p})$ occur in the respective formula. If $p\equiv 1$ mod 4, the formula may be much more complex since it involves linear combinations of (possibly many) products of two Bernoulli numbers attached to odd characters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two divergent series in Entry 7 of Gauss's diary are extended systematically by introducing additional parameters. Rogers-Fine identities, Ramanujan's continued fractions and Heine's transformation relations of basic hypergeometric series are applied to find equivalent alternative series, which enable us to compute the sums of divergent series in question.</description>

      <title>A Formal Proof of a Continued Fraction Conjecture for $\pi$ Originating from the Ramanujan Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a formal analytic proof for a class of non-canonical polynomial continued fractions representing {\pi}/4, originally conjectured by the Ramanujan Machine using algorithmic induction [4]. By establishing an explicit correspondence with the ratio of contiguous Gaussian hypergeometric functions 2F1(a, b; c; z), we show that these identities can be derived via a discrete sequence of equivalence transformations. We further prove that the conjectured integer coefficients constitute a symbolically minimal realization of the underlying analytic kernel. Stability analysis confirms that the resulting limit-periodic structures reside strictly within the Worpitzky convergence disk, ensuring absolute convergence. This work demonstrates that such algorithmically discovered identities are not isolated numerical artifacts, but are deeply rooted in the classical theory of hypergeometric transformations.</description>

      <title>Two infinite families of elliptic curves with Mordell-Weil rank at least $3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider two infinite parametric families of elliptic curves defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ given by the equations $E_{a,b} : y^{2} = x^{3} - a^{2}x + b^{2}$ and $E^{\prime}_{a,b} : y^{2} = x^{3} - a^{2}x + b^{6}$, where $a,b \in \mathbb{N}$ satisfy certain mild conditions. We prove that the torsion group of $E_{a,b}(\mathbb{Q})$ is trivial and the Mordell-Weil ranks of both $E_{a,b}(\mathbb{Q})$ and $E^{\prime}_{a,b}(\mathbb{Q})$ are at least $3$ for infinitely many choices of $a$ and $b$ by using the N\'{e}ron-Tate height of a rational point and by exploiting the unit group of the ring of integers of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})$. This is an extension of the results of Brown-Myres and Fujita-Nara where lower bounds of the ranks were provided under the assumption that $a = 1$ or $b = 1$. Also, our families of elliptic curves vastly generalize the curves recently investigated by Hatley and Stack.</description>

      <title>On the $\mathfrak{M}_H(G)$-property for Selmer groups at supersingular reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ which has good supersingular reduction at the odd prime $p$. We study the variation of Iwasawa invariants and the $\mathfrak{M}_H(G)$-property for signed Selmer groups over $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions of an imaginary quadratic number field $K$ that lie inside the $\mathbb{Z}_p^2$-extension $\mathbb{K}_\infty$ of $K$ and are not necessarily cyclotomic. We prove several equivalent criteria for the validity of the $\mathfrak{M}_H(G)$-property which involve the growth of $\mu$-invariants of the signed Selmer groups over intermediate shifted $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions in $\mathbb{K}_\infty$, and the boundedness of $\lambda$-invariants as one runs over $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions of $K$ inside $\mathbb{K}_\infty$. We give examples where the $\mathfrak{M}_H(G)$-property holds, and also examples where we can prove that it does not hold.
  It is striking that although the case of supersingular reduction is much more difficult than the case of ordinary reduction, we get finer results here; moreover, we are able to derive analogous criteria for the validity of the $\mathfrak{M}_H(G)$-property of the classical Selmer group, as well as the fine Selmer group. Many of the properties that we investigate have not been studied before in this non-torsion setting.
  Further, we study various implications between the $\mathfrak{M}_H(G)$-properties for Selmer groups, signed Selmer groups and fine Selmer groups. We apply our results to a conjecture of Mazur, and prove implications between the $\mathfrak{M}_H(G)$-property and Conjectures A and B of Coates and Sujatha.</description>

      <title>Integral points over number fields: a Clemens complex jigsaw puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an asymptotic formula for the number of integral points of bounded log anticanonical height on a singular quartic del Pezzo surface over arbitrary number fields, with respect to the largest admissible boundary divisor. The resulting Clemens complex is more complicated than usual, and leads to particularly interesting effective cone constants, associated with exponentially many polytopes whose volumes appear in the expected formula. Like a jigsaw puzzle, these polytopes fit together to one large polytope. The volume of this polytope appears in the asymptotic formula that we obtain using the universal torsor method via o-minimal structures.</description>

      <title>p-Curvature and Non-Abelian Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X\to S$ be a smooth projective morphism. Katz proved the Grothendieck-Katz $p$-curvature conjecture for the Gauss-Manin connection on the $i$-th cohomology of $X/S$: if its $p$-curvature vanishes mod $p$ for infinitely many $p$, then the action of $\pi_1(S,s)$ on $H^i(X_s, \mathbb{Z})$ factors through a finite group. We prove a non-abelian analogue of this statement: if the $p$-curvature of the isomonodromy foliation on the moduli of flat bundles of rank $r$ on $X/S$ vanishes mod $p$ for infinitely many $p$, then the action of $\pi_1(S,s)$ on the rank $r$ integral characters of $\pi_1(X_s)$ factors through a finite group. We deduce many new cases of the Bost/Ekedahl--Shepherd-Barron--Taylor conjecture.
  The proofs rely on a non-abelian version of Katz's formula, and a non-abelian version of the Hodge index theorem.</description>

      <title>Torsion Vanishing for Some Shimura Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08705v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the torsion vanishing results of Caraiani-Scholze and Koshikawa. Our results apply to the cohomology of general Shimura varieties $(\mathbf{G},X)$ of PEL type $A$ or $C$, localized at a suitable maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ in the spherical Hecke algebra at primes $p$ such that $\mathbf{G}_{\mathbb{Q}_{p}}$ is a group for which we know the Fargues-Scholze local Langlands correspondence is the semi-simplification of a suitably nice local Langlands correspondence. This is accomplished by combining Koshikawa's technique, the theory of geometric Eisenstein series over the Fargues-Fontaine curve, the work of Santos describing the structure of the fibers of the minimally and toroidally compactified Hodge-Tate period morphism for general PEL type Shimura varieties of type $A$ or $C$, and ideas developed by Zhang on comparing Hecke correspondences on the moduli stack of $G$-bundles with the cohomology of Shimura varieties. In the process, we also establish a description of the generic part of the cohomology that bears resemblance to the work of Xiao-Zhu. Moreover, we also construct a filtration on the compactly supported cohomology that differs from Manotovan's filtration in the case that the Shimura variety is non-compact, allowing us to circumvent some of the circumlocutions taken by Cariani-Scholze. Our method showcases a very general strategy for proving such torsion vanishing results, and should bear even more fruit once the inputs are generalized. Motivated by this, we formulate an even more general torsion vanishing conjecture.</description>

      <title>Eisenstein points on the Hilbert cuspidal eigenvariety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the geometry of Hilbert $p$-adic eigenvarieties at classical parallel weight one intersection points of their cuspidal and Eisenstein loci. For instance, we determine all such points at which the weight map is \'etale. The Galois theoretic approach presents genuine difficulties due to the lack of good deformation theory for pseudo-characters irregular at $p$ and reflects the richness of the local geometry. We believe that our geometric results lead to deeper insight into the arithmetic of Hilbert automorphic forms and we produce in support several applications in Iwasawa theory.</description>

Abstract: Let $I(b,d,k)$ be the subseries of the harmonic series keeping the integers having exactly $k$ occurrences of the digit $d$ in base $b$. We prove the existence of an asymptotic expansion to all orders in descending powers of $b$, for fixed $d$ and $k$, of $I(b,d,k)-b\log(b)$. We explicitly give, depending on cases, either four or five terms. The coefficients involve the values of the zeta function at the integers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12922v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the work of Mestre, we use Weil's explicit formulas to compute explicit lower bounds on the conductors of elliptic curves and abelian varieties over number fields. Moreover, we obtain bounds for the conductor of elliptic curves and abelian varieties over $\mathbb{Q}$ with specified bad reduction and over number fields. As an application, for specific fields, we prove the non-existence of abelian varieties with everywhere good reduction.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Carmichael numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our primary concern is the computational complexity of algorithms that find all Carmichael numbers less than some specified bound $B$. We have three related results. First, we show CARMICHAELS is in $\textbf{P}$, where only the run-time is conditioned on the ERH. Second, we state a heuristically optimal tabulation algorithm, which is the first asymptotic improvement to tabulation algorithms in the $50$ years since Swift first described the prime-by-prime approach. Third, we implemented a related algorithm that tabulated $100$ times further while only doing about $5$ times the work of the prior tabulation. We found $308,279,939$ Carmichael numbers less than $10^{24}$ and we provide some statistics on these numbers.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic Properties of Several Generalized-Constant Sequences, with Implications for $\Gamma^{\left(n\right)}\left(1\right)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01849v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neither the Euler-Mascheroni constant, $\gamma=0.577215...$, nor the Euler-Gompertz constant, $\delta=0.596347...$, is currently known to be irrational. However, it has been proved that at least one of them is transcendental. The two constants are related by a well-known equation of Hardy, equivalent to $\gamma+\delta/e=\mathrm{Ein}(1)$, which recently has been generalized to $\gamma^{(n)}+\delta^{(n)}/e=\eta^{(n)}$, $n\ge0$ for sequences of constants $\gamma^{(n)}$, $\delta^{(n)}$, and $\eta^{(n)}$ (given respectively by raw, conditional, and partial moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution). Investigating the $\gamma^{(n)}$ through recurrence relations (where $\gamma^{(0)}=1$ and $\gamma^{(1)}=\gamma$), we find that at least one of the pair {$\gamma,\gamma^{(2)}$} and at least two of each set {$\gamma,\gamma^{(n)},\gamma^{(n+1)},\ldots,\gamma^{(2n)}$}, for $2\leq n\leq26$, are transcendental, with analogous results for the sequence $\Gamma^{(n)}(1)=\left(-1\right)^{n}\gamma^{\left(n\right)}$. We then show, via a theorem of Shidlovskii, that the $\eta^{(n)}$ are algebraically independent, and therefore transcendental, for all $n\ge0$, implying that at least one of each pair, {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}/e$} and {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}$}, and at least two of the triple {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}/e,\delta^{(n)}$}, are transcendental for all $n\ge1$. Further analysis of the $\gamma^{(n)}$ and $\eta^{(n)}$ reveals that the values $\delta^{(n)}/e$ are transcendental infinitely often with positive asymptotic density. Finally, we provide parallel results for the sequences $\tilde{\delta}^{(n)}$ and $\tilde{\eta}^{(n)}$ satisfying the "non-alternating analogue" equation $\gamma^{(n)}+\tilde{\delta}^{(n)}/e=\tilde{\eta}^{(n)}$.</description>

      <title>Rational Hodge--Tate prismatic crystals of quasi-l.c.i algebras and non-abelian $p$-adic Hodge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03458v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a bounded prism $(A,I)$ and a bounded quasi-l.c.i algebra $R$ over $\overline{A}$. In this paper, for any prism $S/A$ with a surjection $S\to R$ such that $\widehat{\mathbb L}_{\overline{S}/\overline{A}}$ is a $p$-completely flat module over $\overline{S}$, we establish an equivalence of categories between rational Hodge-Tate crystals on $(R/A)_{\Delta}$ and topologically nilpotent integrable connections on the Hodge--Tate cohomology ring $\overline{\Delta}_{R/S}$. As an application, for a non-zero divisor $a\in \overline{A}$, we introduce the concept of $a$-smallness for a rational Hodge-Tate prismatic crystal on $(R/A)_{\Delta}$. Finally, we focus on some special algebras $R$ over $\mathcal O_{\mathbb C_p}$ (or generally, the ring of integers of an algebraic closed and complete non-archimedean field) including all $p$-completely smooth algebras, $p$-complete algebras with semi-stable reductions and geometric valuation rings. By using our equivalence, we analyze the restriction functor from the category of $a$-small rational Hodge-Tate prismatic crystals to the category of $v$-vector bundles. This yields some new results in $p$-adic non-abelian Hodge Theory.</description>

      <title>Two algebraic proofs of the transcendence of $\mathrm{e}$ based on formal power series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We remind the classical analytical proof of the transcendence of $\mathrm{e}$ due to Hilbert. Then, using formal power series, we give two algebraic semiformal proofs of this result. The first proof is a specialization of the proof of the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem found by Beukers, B\'ezivin and Robba [2]. The second proof uses improper integrals of formal power series and is due to this author. We explain what ``semiformal'' means and indicate yet another analytical proof of the transcendence of $\mathrm{e}$. Like the two algebraic proofs, this proof avoids uncountable sets. It is due to this author in [7].</description>

      <title>Resolution of Erd\H{o}s Problem #728: a writeup of Aristotle's Lean proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a writeup of a resolution of Erd\H{o}s Problem #728; this is the first Erd\H{o}s problem (a problem proposed by Paul Erd\H{o}s which has been collected in the Erd\H{o}s Problems website) regarded as fully resolved autonomously by an AI system. The system in question is a combination of GPT-5.2 Pro by OpenAI and Aristotle by Harmonic, operated by Kevin Barreto. The final result of the system is a formal proof written in Lean, which we translate to informal mathematics in the present writeup for wider accessibility.
  The proved result is as follows. We show a logarithmic-gap phenomenon regarding factorial divisibility: For any constants $0&lt;C_1&lt;C_2$ and $0 &lt; \varepsilon &lt; 1/2$ there exist infinitely many triples $(a,b,n)\in\mathbb N^3$ with $\varepsilon n \le a,b \le (1-\varepsilon)n$ such that \[ a!\,b!\mid n!\,(a+b-n)!\qquad\text{and}\qquad C_1\log n &lt; a+b-n &lt; C_2\log n. \] The argument reduces this to a binomial divisibility $\binom{m+k}{k}\mid\binom{2m}{m}$ and studies it prime-by-prime. By Kummer's theorem, $\nu_p\binom{2m}{m}$ translates into a carry count for doubling $m$ in base $p$. We then employ a counting argument to find, in each scale $[M,2M]$, an integer $m$ whose base-$p$ expansions simultaneously force many carries when doubling $m$, for every prime $p\le 2k$, while avoiding the rare event that one of $m+1,\dots,m+k$ is divisible by an unusually high power of $p$. These "carry-rich but spike-free" choices of $m$ force the needed $p$-adic inequalities and the divisibility. The overall strategy is similar to results regarding divisors of $\binom{2n}{n}$ studied earlier by Erd\H{o}s and by Pomerance.</description>

      <title>Reflecting Poisson walks and dynamical universality in $p$-adic random matrix theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove dynamical local limits for the singular numbers of $p$-adic random matrix products at both the bulk and edge. The limit object which we construct, the reflecting Poisson sea, may thus be viewed as a $p$-adic analogue of line ensembles appearing in classical random matrix theory. However, in contrast to those it is a discrete space Poisson-type particle system with only local reflection interactions and no obvious determinantal structure. The limits hold for any $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z}_p)$-invariant matrix distributions under weak universality hypotheses, with no spatial rescaling.</description>

      <title>Accessing non-abelian quotients of the Grothendieck-Teichmueller group via elementary tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many challenging questions about the Grothendieck-Teichmueller group, $GT$, are motivated by the fact that this group receives the injective homomorphism (called the Ihara embedding) from the absolute Galois group, $G_Q$, of rational numbers. Although the question about the surjectivity of the Ihara embedding is a very challenging problem, in this paper, we construct a family of finite non-abelian quotients of $GT$ that receive surjective homomorphisms from $G_Q$. We also assemble these finite quotients into an infinite (non-abelian) profinite quotient of $GT$. We prove that the natural homomorphism from $G_Q$ to the resulting profinite group is also surjective. We give an explicit description of this profinite group.
  To achieve these goals, we used the groupoid $GTSh$ of $GT$-shadows for the gentle version of the Grothendieck-Teichmueller group. This groupoid was introduced in the recent paper by the second author and J. Guynee and the set $Ob(GTSh)$ of objects of $GTSh$ is a poset of certain finite index normal subgroups of the Artin braid group on 3 strands. We introduce a sub-poset $Dih$ of $Ob(GTSh)$ related to the family of dihedral groups and call it the dihedral poset. We show that each element $K$ of $Dih$ is the only object of its connected component in $GTSh$. Using the surjectivity of the cyclotomic character, we prove that, if the order of the dihedral group corresponding to $K$ is a power of 2, then the natural homomorphism from $G_Q$ to the finite group $GTSh(K, K)$ is surjective. We introduce the Lochak-Schneps conditions on morphisms of $GTSh$ and prove that each morphism of $GTSh$ with the target $K$ in $Dih$ satisfies the Lochak-Schneps conditions. Finally, we conjecture that the natural homomorphism from $G_Q$ to the finite group $GTSh(K, K)$ is surjective for every object $K$ of the dihedral poset.</description>

      <title>Finite subgroups of maximal order of the Cremona group over the rationals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Cr_\Q(2)$ be the Cremona group of rank $2$ over rational numbers. we give a classification of large finite subgroups $G$ of $\Cr_\Q(2)$ and give a new sharp bound smaller (but not multiplicative) than $M(\Q)=120960 = 2^7\cdot3^3\cdot5\cdot7$; the one given in \cite{MR2567402}. In particular, we prove that any finite subgroup $G \subset\Cr_\Q(2)$ has order $\mid G\mid \le 432$ and Lemma \ref{lemm-17} provides a group of order $432$. We use the modern approach of minimal $G-$surfaces, given a (smooth) rational surface $S\subset\p^2$ defined over $\Q$, we study the finite subgroups $G \subset \Aut_{\Q}(S)$ of automorphisms of $S$. We give the best bound for the order of $G\subset\Aut(S)$ for surfaces with a conic bundle structure invariant by $G$. We also give the best bound for the order of $G\subset \Aut_\Q(S)$ for all rational Del Pezzo surfaces of some given degree. In addition, we give descriptions of the finite subgroups of automorphisms of conic bundles and Del Pezzo surfaces of maximal size.</description>

      <title>Cocompact Fuchsian groups with a modular embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12656v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Fuchsian group $\Gamma$ has a modular embedding if its adjoint trace field is a totally real number field and every unbounded Galois conjugate $\Gamma^\sigma$ comes equipped with a holomorphic (or conjugate holomorphic) map ${\phi^\sigma : \mathbb{B}^1 \to \mathbb{B}^1}$ intertwining the actions of $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma^\sigma$ on the Poincar\'e disk $\mathbb{B}^1$. This paper provides the first cocompact nonarithmetic Fuchsian groups with a modular embedding that are not commensurable with a triangle group. The main result, proved using period domains, is that any immersed totally geodesic complex curve on a complex hyperbolic $2$-orbifold has a modular embedding. Another consequence is arithmeticity of totally geodesic curves on finite-volume complex hyperbolic surfaces that are commensurable with quotients of $\mathbb{B}^1$ by the group generated by reflections in quadrilaterals satisfying certain angle conditions.</description>

      <title>Groups with pairings, Hall modules, and Hall-Littlewood polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We relate the combinatorics of Hall-Littlewood polynomials to that of abelian $p$-groups with alternating or Hermitian perfect pairings. Our main result is an analogue of the classical relationship between the Hall algebra of abelian $p$-groups (without pairings) and Hall-Littlewood polynomials. Specifically, we define a module over the classical Hall algebra with basis indexed by groups with pairings, and explicitly relate its structure constants to Hall-Littlewood polynomials at different values of the parameter $t$. We also show certain expectation formulas with respect to Cohen-Lenstra type measures on groups with pairings. In the alternating case this gives a new and simpler proof of previous results of Delaunay-Jouhet.</description>
