      <title>Thermodynamic consistency and structure-preservation in summation by parts methods for the moist compressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moist thermodynamics is a fundamental driver of atmospheric dynamics across all scales, making accurate modeling of these processes essential for reliable weather forecasts and climate change projections. However, atmospheric models often make a variety of inconsistent approximations in representing moist thermodynamics. These inconsistencies can introduce spurious sources and sinks of energy, potentially compromising the integrity of the models.
  Here, we present a thermodynamically consistent and structure preserving formulation of the moist compressible Euler equations. When discretised with a summation by parts method, our spatial discretisation conserves: mass, water, entropy, and energy. These properties are achieved by discretising a skew symmetric form of the moist compressible Euler equations, using entropy as a prognostic variable, and the summation-by-parts property of discrete derivative operators. Additionally, we derive a discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method with energy and tracer variance stable numerical fluxes, and experimentally verify our theoretical results through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Do Inner Greenland's Melt Rate Dynamics Approach Coastal Ones?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Greenland Ice Sheet may be nearing a tipping point, transitioning to permanent melting. This article analyses two melt rate time series using the Bayesian Langevin estimation (BLE), providing further evidence for destabilizing melt dynamics, along with new insights from the method's nonlinear parameterisation. Comparing the results for Western Central Greenland and the Nuussuaq peninsula suggests that inland melt dynamics may approach less stable coastal dynamics on slow and fast scales. Both datasets show a significant increase in fast-scale amplitudes since the 1970s, possibly driven by large-scale atmospheric fluctuations. Additionally, the BLE's nonlinear drift proves crucial for obtaining these results, as a linear Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process fails to capture these dynamics due to the oversimplification of a strictly positive autocorrelation function.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Forecasting of the Dynamics of a Floating Wind Turbine Using Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a data-driven equation-free modeling of the dynamics of a hexafloat floating offshore wind turbine based on the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). The DMD is here used to provide a modal analysis and extract knowledge from the dynamic system. A forecasting algorithm for the motions, accelerations, and forces acting on the floating system, as well as the height of the incoming waves, the wind speed, and the power extracted by the wind turbine, is developed by using a methodological extension called Hankel-DMD, that includes time-delayed copies of the states in an augmented state vector. All the analyses are performed on experimental data collected from an operating prototype. The quality of the forecasts obtained varying two main hyperparameters of the algorithm, namely the number of delayed copies and the length of the observation time, is assessed using three different error metrics, each analyzing complementary aspects of the prediction. A statistical analysis exposed the existence of optimal values for the algorithm hyperparameters. Results show the approach's capability for short-term future estimates of the system's state, which can be used for real-time prediction and control. Furthermore, a novel Stochastic Hankel-DMD formulation is introduced by considering hyperparameters as stochastic variables. The stochastic version of the method not only enriches the prediction with its related uncertainty but is also found to improve the normalized root mean square error up to 10% on a statistical basis compared to the deterministic counterpart.</description>

      <title>Community Research Earth Digital Intelligence Twin (CREDIT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) for numerical weather prediction (NWP) have significantly transformed atmospheric modeling. AI NWP models outperform traditional physics-based systems, such as the Integrated Forecast System (IFS), across several global metrics while requiring fewer computational resources. However, existing AI NWP models face limitations related to training datasets and timestep choices, often resulting in artifacts that reduce model performance. To address these challenges, we introduce the Community Research Earth Digital Intelligence Twin (CREDIT) framework, developed at NSF NCAR. CREDIT provides a flexible, scalable, and user-friendly platform for training and deploying AI-based atmospheric models on high-performance computing systems. It offers an end-to-end pipeline for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, democratizing access to advanced AI NWP capabilities. We demonstrate CREDIT's potential through WXFormer, a novel deterministic vision transformer designed to predict atmospheric states autoregressively, addressing common AI NWP issues like compounding error growth with techniques such as spectral normalization, padding, and multi-step training. Additionally, to illustrate CREDIT's flexibility and state-of-the-art model comparisons, we train the FUXI architecture within this framework. Our findings show that both FUXI and WXFormer, trained on six-hourly ERA5 hybrid sigma-pressure levels, generally outperform IFS HRES in 10-day forecasts, offering potential improvements in efficiency and forecast accuracy. CREDIT's modular design enables researchers to explore various models, datasets, and training configurations, fostering innovation within the scientific community.</description>

      <title>Quasiannealed Monte Carlo method for light transport in strongly heterogeneous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random-walk Monte Carlo simulations are widely used to predict the optical properties of complex, disordered materials. In presence of large heterogeneities (e.g., spatially-extended nonscattering regions in a turbid environment), an explicit description of the micro and macrostructures and of the light propagation therein is generally required, in addition to a statistical average over a representative set of microstructures, thereby making simulations in so-called ``quenched'' disorder particularly time-consuming. We explore here the possibility to model light transport in finite-size strongly heterogeneous media without an explicit description of the underlying microstructure but from the knowledge of typical random-walk trajectories in infinite-size media, that take correlations between successive interaction events into account. Simulations may thus be performed for media of any macroscopic shape and size more efficiently. We illustrate this approach, coined ``quasiannealed'', with the case of a two-phase emulsion consisting of transparent spherical droplets dispersed in a turbid medium. Good agreement with predictions from simulations in quenched disorder on the reflectance of finite-thickness slab is found for a large set of microstructure properties and thicknesses with typical errors on the reflectance on the order of a percent.</description>

      <title>Is methane the 'climate culprit'? Fixing the 'Broken Record' while unmasking the dangers of using imprecise, long-term GWP for methane to address the climate emergency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) with a short atmospheric half-life (~8.4 years) and a high short-term impact on global warming which is significantly higher than that of CO2. Traditional metrics such as the 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP100) obscure the short-term, negative climatic effects of methane, potentially leading to inadequate policy responses. This study examines the limitations of GWP100 in capturing the true climate impact of methane, explores alternative metrics, and discusses the implications of under-reporting methane emissions. We highlight the necessity of adopting a more immediate perspective on methane to accelerate climate emergency action, while noting the adverse effects of the rapid growth rate of methane emissions on reduction efforts. Additionally, we hope that during COP29, policymakers will adopt actions that pay appropriate attention to the short-term warming potential of methane to dramatically reduce emissions and address the immediate climate crisis.</description>

      <title>A dual-pairing summation-by-parts finite difference framework for nonlinear conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust and stable high order numerical methods for solving partial differential equations are attractive because they are efficient on modern and next generation hardware architectures. However, the design of provably stable numerical methods for nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws pose a significant challenge. We present the dual-pairing (DP) and upwind summation-by-parts (SBP) finite difference (FD) framework for accurate and robust numerical approximations of nonlinear conservation laws. The framework has an inbuilt "limiter" whose goal is to detect and effectively resolve regions where the solution is poorly resolved and/or discontinuities are found. The DP SBP FD operators are a dual-pair of backward and forward FD stencils, which together preserve the SBP property. In addition, the DP SBP FD operators are designed to be upwind, that is they come with some innate dissipation everywhere, as opposed to traditional SBP and collocated discontinuous Galerkin spectral element methods which can only induce dissipation through numerical fluxes acting at element interfaces. We combine the DP SBP operators together with skew-symmetric and upwind flux splitting of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws. Our semi-discrete approximation is provably entropy-stable for arbitrary nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws. The framework is high order accurate, provably entropy-stable, convergent, and avoids several pitfalls of current state-of-the-art high order methods. We give specific examples using the in-viscid Burger's equation, nonlinear shallow water equations and compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics. Numerical experiments are presented to verify accuracy and demonstrate the robustness of our numerical framework.</description>
