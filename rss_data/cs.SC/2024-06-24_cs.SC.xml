      <title>A Local Search Algorithm for MaxSMT(LIA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MaxSAT modulo theories (MaxSMT) is an important generalization of Satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) with various applications. In this paper, we focus on MaxSMT with the background theory of Linear Integer Arithmetic, denoted as MaxSMT(LIA). We design the first local search algorithm for MaxSMT(LIA) called PairLS, based on the following novel ideas. A novel operator called pairwise operator is proposed for integer variables. It extends the original local search operator by simultaneously operating on two variables, enriching the search space. Moreover, a compensation-based picking heuristic is proposed to determine and distinguish the pairwise operations. Experiments are conducted to evaluate our algorithm on massive benchmarks. The results show that our solver is competitive with state-of-the-art MaxSMT solvers. Furthermore, we also apply the pairwise operation to enhance the local search algorithm of SMT, which shows its extensibility.</description>

      <title>Combining Neural Networks and Symbolic Regression for Analytical Lyapunov Function Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose CoNSAL (Combining Neural networks and Symbolic regression for Analytical Lyapunov function) to construct analytical Lyapunov functions for nonlinear dynamic systems. This framework contains a neural Lyapunov function and a symbolic regression component, where symbolic regression is applied to distill the neural network to precise analytical forms. Our approach utilizes symbolic regression not only as a tool for translation but also as a means to uncover counterexamples. This procedure terminates when no counterexamples are found in the analytical formulation. Compared with previous results, our algorithm directly produces an analytical form of the Lyapunov function with improved interpretability in both the learning process and the final results. We apply our algorithm to 2-D inverted pendulum, path following, Van Der Pol Oscillator, 3-D trig dynamics, 4-D rotating wheel pendulum, 6-D 3-bus power system, and demonstrate that our algorithm successfully finds their valid Lyapunov functions.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Emergency Vehicle Detection using Mel Spectrograms and Regular Expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13920v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In emergency situations, the high-speed movement of an ambulance through the city streets can be hindered by vehicular traffic. This work presents a method for detecting emergency vehicle sirens in real time. To obtain the audio fingerprint of a Hi-Lo siren, DSP and signal symbolization techniques were applied, which were contrasted against an audio classifier based on a deep neural network, using the same 280 audios of ambient sounds and 52 Hi-Lo siren audios dataset. In both methods, some classification accuracy metrics were evaluated based on its confusion matrix, resulting in the DSP algorithm having a slightly lower accuracy than the DNN model, however, it offers a self-explanatory, adjustable, portable, high performance and lower energy and consumption that makes it a more viable lower cost ADAS implementation to identify Hi-Lo sirens in real time.</description>
