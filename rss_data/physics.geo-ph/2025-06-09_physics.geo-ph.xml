      <title>Integrated Experimental and Numerical Investigations on the Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical Behavior of Clays and Argillaceous Rocks: A Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper synthesizes nearly a decade of research on the coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) behavior of clays and argillaceous rocks. Drawing from experimental observations, numerical model development, and field-scale simulations, it presents a consolidated view of soil-structure interaction under thermal loading, desiccation cracking, and long-term excavation impacts. Key findings are drawn from constitutive modeling, in situ tests, and energy geostructure applications, offering a practical THM framework for nuclear waste repositories and climate-resilient infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Initial Model Incorporation for Deep Learning FWI: Pretraining or Denormalization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subsurface property neural network reparameterized full waveform inversion (FWI) has emerged as an effective unsupervised learning framework, which can invert stably with an inaccurate starting model. It updates the trainable neural network parameters instead of fine-tuning on the subsurface model directly. There are primarily two ways to embed the prior knowledge of the initial model into neural networks, that is, pretraining and denormalization. Pretraining first regulates the neural networks' parameters by fitting the initial velocity model; Denormalization directly adds the outputs of the network into the initial models without pretraining. In this letter, we systematically investigate the influence of the two ways of initial model incorporation for the neural network reparameterized FWI. We demonstrate that pretraining requires inverting the model perturbation based on a constant velocity value (mean) with a two-stage implementation. It leads to a complex workflow and inconsistency of objective functions in the two-stage process, causing the network parameters to become inactive and lose plasticity. Experimental results demonstrate that denormalization can simplify workflows, accelerate convergence, and enhance inversion accuracy compared with pretraining.</description>

      <title>How to build transfer matrices, one wave at a time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04822v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how to build the closed-form expression of transfer matrices for wave propagation in layered media. The key is to represent the propagation across the piece-wise constant medium as a superposition of a finite number of paths ($2^{N-1}$ paths for a medium with $N$ layers), each one of them contributing a certain phase change (corresponding to signed sums of the phase change in each individual layer) and amplitude change (corresponding to the pattern of transmission and/or reflection associated to each path). The outlined technique is combinatorial in nature: it begins with the linear governing equations in frequency domain, whose fundamental solution is known, then it enumerates the finite number of paths across the overall system, then computes their associated phase and amplitude change, and finally adds all the possible paths to find the final result. Beyond providing physical insight, this ''path-by-path'' construction can also circumvent the need for transfer matrix numerical multiplication in many practical applications, potentially enabling substantial computational savings.</description>
