      <title>On Nash Equilibria in Play-Once and Terminal Deterministic Graphical Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider finite $n$-person deterministic graphical games and study the existence of pure stationary Nash-equilibrium in such games. We assume that all infinite plays are equivalent and form a unique outcome, while each terminal position is a separate outcome. It is known that for $n=2$ such a game always has a Nash equilibrium, while that may not be true for $n &gt; 2$.
  A game is called {\em play-once} if each player controls a unique position and {\em terminal} if any terminal outcome is better than the infinite one for each player. We prove in this paper that play-once games have Nash equilibria.
  We also show that terminal games have Nash equilibria if they have at most three terminals.</description>

      <title>Coarse-Grained Games: A Framework for Bounded Perception in Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In everyday life, we frequently make coarse-grained judgments. When we say that Olivia and Noah excel in mathematics, we disregard the specific differences in their mathematical abilities. Similarly, when we claim that a particular automobile manufacturer produces high-quality cars, we overlook the minor variations among individual vehicles. These coarse-grained assessments are distinct from erroneous or deceptive judgments, such as those resulting from student cheating or false advertising by corporations. Despite the prevalence of such judgments, little attention has been given to their underlying mathematical structure. In this paper, we introduce the concept of coarse-graining into game theory, analyzing games in which players may perceive different payoffs as identical while preserving the underlying order structure. This framework allows us to examine the rational inference processes that arise when players equate distinct micro-level payoffs at a macro level, and to explore how Nash equilibria are preserved or altered as a result. Our key findings suggest that coarse-grained games possess several desirable properties that make them suitable for modeling phenomena in the social sciences. This paper demonstrates two such applications: first, in cases of overly minor product updates, consumers may encounter an equilibrium selection problem, resulting in market behavior that is not driven by objective quality differences; second, the lemon market can be analyzed not only through objective information asymmetry but also through asymmetries in perceptual resolution or recognition ability.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Shirking in Technology Adoption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a model of technology adoption: a principal tries to induce a group of agents to exert costly effort to vet a new production technology before they choose whether to use it. The principal finds it too costly to simultaneously punish large groups of unproductive agents, so they shirk when coordination is possible. Widely applicable technology expands productive possibilities but also provides an opportunity for coordinated shirking, and can thus lead to widespread production failure. Furthermore, even agents who learn that they are using flawed technology may continue to do so. Applications include mortgage securitization in the financial crisis of 2008, and the adoption of generative artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Non-Bayesian Learning in Misspecified Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deviations from Bayesian updating are traditionally categorized as biases, errors, or fallacies, thus implying their inherent ``sub-optimality.'' We offer a more nuanced view. We demonstrate that, in learning problems with misspecified models, non-Bayesian updating can outperform Bayesian updating.</description>

      <title>Shapley-Scarf Markets with Objective Indifferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many object allocation problems, some of the objects may effectively be indistinguishable from each other, such as with dorm rooms or school seats. In such cases, it is reasonable to assume that agents are indifferent between identical copies of the same object. We call this setting ``objective indifferences.'' Top trading cycles (TTC) with fixed tie-breaking has been suggested and used in practice to deal with indifferences in object allocation problems. Under general indifferences, TTC with fixed tie-breaking is not Pareto efficient nor group strategy-proof. Furthermore, it may not select the core, even when it exists. Under objective indifferences, agents are always and only indifferent between copies of the same object. In this setting, TTC with fixed tie-breaking maintains Pareto efficiency, group strategy-proofness, and core selection. In fact, we present domain characterization results which together show that objective indifferences is the most general setting where TTC with fixed tie-breaking maintains these important properties.</description>

      <title>A Stable and Strategy-Proof Controlled School Choice Mechanism with Integrated and Flexible Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a controlled school choice model where students are categorized into different types, and the distribution of these types within a school influences its priority structure. This study provides a general framework that integrates existing controlled school choice models, including those utilizing reserve rules, quota rules, and bonus-point rules. Specifically, we introduce an adjusted scoring rule that unifies these rules. By achieving a matching that satisfies the stability defined in this framework, matching authorities can effectively manage the trade-offs inherent in controlled school choice markets. Moreover, the priority order for a school is represented as a weak order with each given assignment, meaning that ties are allowed. Our mechanism ensures a stable matching and satisfies strategy-proofness. In particular, when priority orders are restricted to linear orders with each given assignment, our mechanism guarantees student-optimal stability.</description>

      <title>Inertial Coordination Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze inertial coordination games: dynamic coordination games with an endogenously changing state that depends on (i) a persistent fundamental players privately learn about over time; and (ii) past play. The speed of learning determines long-run equilibrium dynamics: the risk-dominant action is played in the limit if and only if learning is slow such that posterior precisions grow sub-quadratically. This generalizes results from static global games and endows them with a learning foundation. Conversely, when learning is fast such that posterior precisions grow super-quadratically, shocks can propagate and generate self-fulfilling spirals.</description>

      <title>Voting with Random Proposers: Two Rounds Suffice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces Voting with Random Proposers (VRP) procedure to address the challenges of agenda manipulation in voting. In each round of VRP, a randomly selected proposer suggests an alternative that is voted on against the previous round's winner. In a framework with single-peaked preferences, we show that the VRP procedure guarantees that the Condorcet winner is implemented in a few rounds with truthful voting, and in just two rounds under sufficiently symmetric preference distributions or if status quo positions are not extreme. The results have applications for committee decisions, legislative decision-making, and the organization of citizens' assemblies and decentralized autonomous organizations.</description>

      <title>Preference Restrictions in Computational Social Choice: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.09092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social choice becomes easier on restricted preference domains such as single-peaked, single-crossing, and Euclidean preferences. Many impossibility theorems disappear, the structure makes it easier to reason about preferences, and computational problems can be solved more efficiently. In this survey, we give a thorough overview of many classic and modern restricted preference domains and explore their properties and applications. We do this from the viewpoint of computational social choice, letting computational problems drive our interest, but we include a comprehensive discussion of the economics and social choice literatures as well. Particular focus areas of our survey include algorithms for recognizing whether preferences belong to a particular preference domain, and algorithms for winner determination of voting rules that are hard to compute if preferences are unrestricted.</description>

      <title>A Deterministic and Linear Model of Dynamic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model of infinite horizon linear dynamic optimization and obtain results concerning existence of solution and satisfaction of the competitive condition and transversality condition being unconditionally sufficient for optimality of a trajectory. We also show that under some mild restrictions the optimal trajectory satisfies the Euler condition and a related transversality condition. We show that the optimal value function is concave and continuous and the optimal trajectory satisfies the functional equation of dynamic programming. Linearity bites when it comes to the definition of optimal decision rules which can no longer be guaranteed to be single-valued. We show that the optimal decision rule is an upper semi-continuous correspondence. For linear cake-eating problems, we obtain monotonicity results for the optimal value function and a conditional monotonicity result for optimal decision rules. We also introduce the concept of a two-phase linear cake eating problem and obtain a necessary condition that must be satisfied by all solutions of such problems. We show that for a class of linear dynamic optimization problems, known as interlinked linear dynamic optimization problems, a slightly modified version of the functional equation of dynamic programming is satisfied.</description>
