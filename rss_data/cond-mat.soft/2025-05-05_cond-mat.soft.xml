      <title>Graph Neural Network-based structural classification of glass-forming liquids and its interpretation via Self-Attention mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glass-forming liquids exhibit slow dynamics below their melting temperatures, maintaining an amorphous structure reminiscent of normal liquids. Distinguishing microscopic structures in the supercooled and high-temperature regimes remains a debated topic. Building on recent advances in machine learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), our study automatically extracts features, unveiling fundamental mechanisms driving structural changes at varying temperatures. We employ the Self-Attention mechanism to generate attention coefficients that quantify the importance of connections between graph nodes, providing insights into the rationale behind GNN predictions. Exploring structural changes with decreasing temperature through the GNN+Self-Attention using physically-defined structural descriptors, including the bond-orientational order parameter, Voronoi cell volume, and coordination number, we identify strong correlations between high attention coefficients and more disordered structures as a key indicator of variations in glass-forming liquids.</description>

      <title>Non-universal Impact of Cholesterol on Ionic Liquid-Membrane Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the role of cholesterol in ionic liquid (IL)-membrane interactions is essential for advancing biomedical applications of ILs, including the development of innovative antimicrobial agents. In this study, we explore the intricate and multifaceted role of cholesterol in modulating IL-membrane interactions, employing a comprehensive suite of biophysical techniques. We systematically examine how IL alkyl chain length and membrane physical state influence the impact of cholesterol on IL-lipid membrane interaction. The incorporation of ILs is shown to increase the area per lipid in both pristine dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and DPPC-cholesterol membranes. Cholesterol modulates the impact of ILs on lipid conformation, membrane viscoelasticity, and phase behavior. Small-angle neutron scattering and dynamic light scattering measurements reveal that cholesterol mitigates IL-induced structural perturbations in vesicles. Our isothermal titration calorimetry measurements reveal that the presence of cholesterol significantly weakens the binding of ILs to membranes. Intriguingly, despite this reduced binding affinity, cholesterol-containing membranes demonstrate enhanced permeabilization. This counterintuitive effect is attributed to cholesterol's ordering of lipid membranes, which increases susceptibility to stress and defects. Our results underscore the complex and non-universal interplay between lipid composition, IL alkyl chain length, and membrane phase state. These insights provide a deeper understanding of cholesterol's role in IL-membrane interactions, paving the way for the design of advanced applications of ILs in antimicrobial therapy and drug delivery.</description>

      <title>Kinetic roughening transition of ice crystals and its implications during recrystallization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth and morphology of ice crystals are highly sensitive to environmental conditions. Under atmospheric pressure, rapid growth from the liquid phase produces dendritic structures with sixfold symmetry. This morphology results from subtle variations in surface tension linked to crystallographic orientation, which guides arm growth under supercooled conditions. In contrast, slow growth yields disk-shaped crystals with rounded surfaces, suggesting surface roughness on all but the basal planes. Roughening is a thermodynamic phenomenon where a crystal surface becomes non-faceted due to the absence of a step-edge barrier, leading to large surface fluctuations. A kinetic roughening transition is a temperature-dependent shift in growth behaviour, in which faceted surfaces at low temperatures transform into rounded surfaces at higher temperatures. To observe slow growth at low temperatures, supercooling must be minimized, which can be achieved by lowering the melting point. This study investigates the kinetic roughening transition in ice crystals grown in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and proline-water solutions. Using cryomicroscopy and real-time image analysis, we identified a distinct roughening transition temperature (TR = -15.4 oC). At TR, the crystal growth morphology shifted from circular disks at higher temperatures to hexagonal plates at lower temperatures. This transition was solute-independent and governed primarily by temperature. Ice consistently melted as circular disks, regardless of temperature. Recrystallization experiments confirmed that crystals grew as hexagonal plates below TR but melted as disks. We also examined the influence of antifreeze protein III (AFPIII), which binds to specific crystallographic planes and modifies morphology through a distinct mechanism, effectively suppressing kinetic roughening</description>

      <title>Coarse-grained graph architectures for all-atom force predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a machine-learning framework termed coarse-grained all-atom force field (CGAA-FF), which incorporates coarse-grained message passing within an all-atom force field using equivariant nature of graph models. The CGAA-FF model employs grain embedding to encode atomistic coordinates into nodes representing grains rather than individual atoms, enabling predictions of both grain-level energies and atom-level forces. Tested on organic electrolytes, CGAA-FF achieves root-mean-square errors of 4.96 meV atom-1 for energy and 0.201 eV A-1 for force predictions. CGAA-FF significantly reduces computational costs, achieving about 22- and 14-fold improvements in simulation speed and memory efficiency, respectively, compared to the all-atom potential (SevenNet-0). Since this CGAA framework can be integrated into any equivariant architecture, we believe this work opens the door to efficient all-atom simulations of soft-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Hacktive Matter: data-driven discovery through hackathon-based cross-disciplinary coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The past decade has seen unprecedented growth in active matter and autonomous biomaterials research, yielding diverse classes of materials that promise revolutionary applications such as self-healing infrastructure and self-sensing tissue implants. However, inconsistencies in metrics, definitions, and analysis algorithms across research groups, as well as the high-dimension data streams, has hindered identification of performance intersections. Progress in this arena demands multi-disciplinary team approaches to discovery with scaffolded training and cross-pollination of ideas, and requires new learning and collaboration methods. To address this challenge, we have developed a hackathon platform to train future scientists and engineers in big data, interdisciplinary collaboration, and community coding; and to design and beta-test high-throughput (HTP) biomaterials analysis software and workflows. We enforce a flat hierarchy, pairing participants ranging from high school students to faculty with varied experiences and skills to collectively contribute to data acquisition and processing, ideation, coding, testing and dissemination. With clearly-defined goals and deliverables, participants achieve success through a series of tutorials, small group coding sessions, facilitated breakouts, and large group report-outs and discussions. These modules facilitate efficient iterative algorithm development and optimization; strengthen community and collaboration skills; and establish teams, benchmarks, and community standards for continued productive work. Our hackathons provide a powerful model for the soft matter community to educate and train students and collaborators in cutting edge data-driven analysis, which is critical for future innovation in complex materials research.</description>

      <title>Early-stage impact dynamics in dense suspensions of millimeter-sized particles</title>

Abstract: This study investigates the phenomenon of the early-stage dynamics of impact-induced hardening in dense suspensions, where materials undergo solidification upon impact. While Stokes flow theory traditionally applies to suspensions with micrometer-sized particles due to their low Reynolds numbers, suspensions containing larger particles defy such idealizations. Our work focuses on the early-stage impact-induced hardening of suspensions containing millimeter-sized particles through dynamic impact experiments. We are particularly interested in the maximum drag force $F_\mathrm{max}$ acting on the projectile as a function of the impact speed $u_0$. We successfully conducted experiments using these suspensions and confirmed the relation $F_\mathrm{max}\sim u_0^{3/2}$ for relatively large $u_0$ as observed in the previous studies suspensions of micrometer-sized particles. Our findings reveal that the early-stage behaviors of millimeter-sized particle suspensions align well with predictions from the floating model, typically applicable under Stokes flow conditions. This research sheds light on the complex dynamics of impact-induced hardening in dense suspensions, particularly with larger particles, advancing our understanding beyond conventional micrometer-sized systems.</description>

      <title>Active phase separation: new phenomenology from non-equilibrium physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In active systems, whose constituents have non-equilibrium dynamics at local level, fluid-fluid phase separation is widely observed. Examples include the formation of membraneless organelles within cells; the clustering of self-propelled colloidal particles in the absence of attractive forces, and some types of ecological segregation. A schematic understanding of such active phase separation was initially borrowed from what is known for the equilibrium case, in which detailed balance holds at microscopic level. However it has recently become clear that in active systems the absence of detailed balance, although it leave phase separation qualitatively unchanged in some regimes (for example domain growth driven by interfacial tension via Ostwald ripening), can in other regimes radically alter its phenomenology at mechanistic level. For example, microphase separation can be caused by reverse Ostwald ripening, a process that is hard to imagine from an equilibrium perspective. This and other new phenomena arise because, instead of having a single, positive interfacial tension like their equilibrium counterparts, the fluid-fluid interfaces created by active phase separation can have several distinct interfacial tensions governing different properties, some of which can be negative. These phenomena can be broadly understood by studying continuum field theories for a single conserved scalar order parameter (the fluid density), supplemented with a velocity field in cases where momentum conservation is also present. More complex regimes arise in systems described by multiple scalar order parameters (especially with nonreciprocal interactions between these); or when an order parameter undergoes both conserved and non-conserved dynamics; or in systems that support orientational long-range order in one or more of the coexisting phases.

      <title>Self-generated electrokinetic flows from active-charged boundary patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a hydrodynamic description of self-generated electrolyte flow in capillaries whose bounding walls feature both non-uniform distributions of charge and non-uniform active ionic fluxes. The hydrodynamic velocity arising in such a system has components that are forbidden by symmetry in the absence of charge and fluxes. However, when these two boundary mechanisms are simultaneously present, they can lead to a symmetry broken state where steady flows with both unidirectional and circulatory components emerge. We show that these flow states arise when modulated boundary patterns of charge and fluxes are offset by a flux-charge phase difference, which is associated with the separation between sites of their peak densities on the wall. Mismatch in diffusivity of cationic and anionic species can modify the flow states and becomes an enhancing factor when fluxes of both ion species are being produced together at the same site. We demonstrate that this mechanism can be realized with a microfluidic generator which is powered by enzyme-coated patches that catalyzes reactants in the solution to produce fluxes of ions. The local ionic elevation or depletion that disrupts a non-uniform double layer, promotes self-induced gradients yielding persistent body forces to generate bulk fluid motion. Our work quantifies a boundary-driven mechanism behind self-sustained electrolyte flow in confined environments that exists without any external bulk-imposed fields or gradients. It provides a theoretical framework for understanding the combined effect of active and charged boundaries that are relevant in biological or soft matter systems, and can be utilized in electrofluidic and iontronic applications.</description>

      <title>Decoding active force fluctuations from spatial trajectories of active systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mesoscopic active systems exhibit various unique behaviours - absent in passive systems - due to the forces generated by the corresponding constituents by converting their available free energies. However, estimating these forces - which are also stochastic and remain intertwined with the thermal noise - is especially non-trivial. Here, we introduce a technique to extract such fluctuating active forces acting on a passive particle immersed in an active bath with high statistical accuracy by filtering out the related thermal noise. We first test the efficacy of our method under numerical scenarios with different types of activity, and then apply it to the experimental trajectories of a microscopic particle (optically) trapped inside an active bath consisting of motile \textit{E.Coli.} bacteria. We believe that our simple yet powerful approach, which appears agnostic to the nature of the active force, should enable accurate measurement of force dynamics in living matter and potentially allow direct but reliable estimation of key thermodynamic parameters such as heat, work, and entropy production.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the embedded states of a fluorescent probe within a lipid bilayer using molecular dynamics simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physicochemical properties of lipid bilayers (membranes) are closely associated with various cellular functions and are often evaluated using absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies. For instance, by employing fluorescent probes that exhibit spectra reflective of the surrounding membrane environment, one can estimate the membrane polarity. Thus, elucidating how such probes are embedded within the membranes would be beneficial for enabling a deeper interpretation of the spectra. Here, we apply molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with an enhanced sampling method to investigate the embedded state of 6-propionyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (Prodan) within a membrane composed of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), as well as its variation upon the addition of ethanol as a cosolvent to the aqueous phase. In the absence of ethanol, it is found that the bulky moieties of Prodan (propionyl and dimethylamine groups) prefer to be oriented toward the membrane center owing to the voids existing near the center. The structural change in the membrane induced by the addition of ethanol causes a reduction in the void population near the center, resulting in a diminished orientation preference of Prodan.</description>

      <title>Fully independent response in disordered solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlike in crystals, it is difficult to trace emergent material properties of amorphous solids to their underlying structure. Nevertheless, one can tune features of a disordered spring network, ranging from bulk elastic constants to specific allosteric responses, through highly precise alterations of the structure. This has been understood through the notion of independent bond-level response -- the observation that in many cases, different springs have different effects on different properties. While this idea has motivated inverse design in numerous contexts, it has not been formalized and quantified in a general context that not just informs but enables and predicts inverse design. Here, we show how to quantify independent response by linearizing the simultaneous change in multiple emergent features, and introduce the much stronger notion of fully independent response. Remarkably, we find that the mechanical properties of disordered solids are always fully independent across a wide array of scenarios, regardless of the target features, tunable parameters, and details of particle-particle interactions. Furthermore, our formulation quantifies the susceptibility of feature changes to parameter changes, which we find to be correlated with the maximum linear tunability. These results formalize our understanding of a key fundamental difference between ordered and disordered solids while also creating a practical tool to both understand and perform inverse design.</description>
