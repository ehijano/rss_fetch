      <title>Approximation and parameterized algorithms for covering disjointness-compliable set families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set-family ${\cal F}$ is disjointness-compliable if $A' \subseteq A \in {\cal F}$ implies $A' \in {\cal F}$ or $A \setminus A' \in {\cal F}$; if ${\cal F}$ is also symmetric then ${\cal F}$ is proper. A classic result of Goemans and Williamson [SODA 92:307-316] states that the problem of covering a proper set-family by a min-cost edge set admits approximation ratio $2$, by a classic primal-dual algorithm. However, there are several famous algorithmic problems whose set-family ${\cal F}$ is disjointness-compliable but not symmetric -- among them $k$-Minimum Spanning Tree ($k$-MST), Generalized Point-to-Point Connection (G-P2P), Group Steiner, Covering Steiner, multiroot versions of these problems, and others. We will show that any such problem admits approximation ratio $O(\alpha \log \tau)$, where $\tau$ is the number of inclusion-minimal sets in the family ${\cal F}$ that models the problem and $\alpha$ is the best known approximation ratio for the case when $\tau=1$. This immediately implies several results, among them the following two. (i) The first deterministic polynomial time $O(\log n)$-approximation algorithm for the G-P2P problem. Here the $\tau=1$ case is the $k$-MST problem. (ii) Approximation ratio $O(\log^4 n)$ for the multiroot version of the Covering Steiner problem, where each root has its own set of groups. Here the $\tau=1$ case is the Covering Steiner problem.
  We also discuss the parameterized complexity of covering a disjointness-compliable family ${\cal F}$, when parametrized by $\tau$. We will show that if ${\cal F}$ is proper then the problem is fixed parameter tractable and can be solved in time $O^*(3^\tau)$. For the non-symmetric case we will show that the problem admits approximation ratio between $\alpha$ and $\alpha+1$ in time $O^*(3^\tau)$, which is essentially the best possible.</description>

      <title>On the near-tightness of $\chi \leq 2r$: a general $\sigma$-ary construction and a binary case via LFSRs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of compressed string indexes, recent work has introduced suffixient sets and their corresponding repetitiveness measure $\chi$. In particular, researchers have explored its relationship to other repetitiveness measures, notably $r$, the number of runs in the Burrows--Wheeler Transform (BWT) of a string. Navarro et al. (2025) proved that $\chi \leq 2r$, although empirical results by Cenzato et al. (2024) suggest that this bound is loose, with real data bounding $\chi$ by around $1.13r$ to $1.33r$ when the size of the alphabet is $\sigma = 4$. To better understand this gap, we present two cases for the asymptotic tightness of the $\chi \leq 2r$ bound: a general construction for arbitrary $\sigma$ values, and a binary alphabet case, consisting of de Bruijn sequences constructed by linear-feedback shift registers (LFSRs) from primitive polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_2$. The second is a novel characterization of which de Bruijn sequences achieve the literature run-minimal pattern for the cyclic BWT. Moreover, we show that de Bruijn sequences fail to close the gap for $\sigma \geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Certified Lower Bounds and Efficient Estimation of Minimum Accuracy in Quantum Kernel Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The minimum accuracy heuristic evaluates quantum feature maps without requiring full quantum support vector machine (QSVM) training. However, the original formulation is computationally expensive, restricted to balanced datasets, and lacks theoretical backing. This work generalizes the metric to arbitrary binary datasets and formally proves it constitutes a certified lower bound on the optimal empirical accuracy of any linear classifier in the same feature space. Furthermore, we introduce Monte Carlo strategies to efficiently estimate this bound using a random subset of Pauli directions, accompanied by rigorous probabilistic guarantees. These contributions establish minimum accuracy as a scalable, theoretically sound tool for pre-screening feature maps on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Generalized $k$-Center: Distinguishing Doubling and Highway Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.00675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider generalizations of the $k$-Center problem in graphs of low doubling and highway dimension. For the Capacitated $k$-Supplier with Outliers (CkSwO) problem, we show an efficient parameterized approximation scheme (EPAS) when the parameters are $k$, the number of outliers and the doubling dimension of the supplier set. On the other hand, we show that for the Capacitated $k$-Center problem, which is a special case of CkSwO, obtaining a parameterized approximation scheme (PAS) is $\mathrm{W[1]}$-hard when the parameters are $k$, and the highway dimension. This is the first known example of a problem for which it is hard to obtain a PAS for highway dimension, while simultaneously admitting an EPAS for doubling dimension.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Aspects of the Log-Laplace Transform and a Non-Euclidean Proximal Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of efficient sampling algorithms catering to non-Euclidean geometries has been a challenging endeavor, as discretization techniques which succeed in the Euclidean setting do not readily carry over to more general settings. We develop a non-Euclidean analog of the recent proximal sampler of [LST21], which naturally induces regularization by an object known as the log-Laplace transform (LLT) of a density. We prove new mathematical properties (with an algorithmic flavor) of the LLT, such as strong convexity-smoothness duality and an isoperimetric inequality, which are used to prove a mixing time on our proximal sampler matching [LST21] under a warm start. As our main application, we show our warm-started sampler improves the value oracle complexity of differentially private convex optimization in $\ell_p$ and Schatten-$p$ norms for $p \in [1, 2]$ to match the Euclidean setting [GLL22], while retaining state-of-the-art excess risk bounds [GLLST23]. We find our investigation of the LLT to be a promising proof-of-concept of its utility as a tool for designing samplers, and outline directions for future exploration.</description>

      <title>Compact representation of maximal palindromes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Palindromes are strings that read the same forward and backward. The computation of palindromic structures within strings is a fundamental problem in string algorithms, being motivated by potential applications in formal language theory and bioinformatics. Although the number of palindromic factors in a string of length $n$ can be quadratic, they can be implicitly represented in $O(n \log n)$ bits of space by storing the lengths of all maximal palindromes in an integer array, which can be computed in $O(n)$ time [Manacher, 1975]. In this paper, we propose a novel $O(n)$-bit representation of all maximal palindromes in a string, which enables $O(1)$-time retrieval of the length of the maximal palindrome centered at any given position. The data structure can be constructed in $O(n)$ time from the input string of length $n$. Since Manacher's algorithm and the notion of maximal palindromes are widely utilized for solving numerous problems involving palindromic structures, our compact representation will accelerate the development of more space-efficient solutions to such problems. Indeed, as the first application of our compact representation of maximal palindromes, we present a data structure of size $O(n)$ bits that can compute the longest palindrome appearing in any given factor of a string of length $n$ in $O(\log n)$ time.</description>

Abstract: We show how we can merge two run-length compressed Burrows-Wheeler Transforms (RL-BWTs) into a run-length compressed extended Burrows-Wheeler Transform (eBWT) in $O (r)$ space and $\tilde O(r + L)$ time, where $r$ is the number of runs in the final eBWT and $L$ is the sum of the longest common prefix (LCP) values at the beginnings of those runs.</description>

      <title>Prefix Sums via Kronecker Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit prefix sums through the lens of linear algebra. We describe an identity that decomposes triangular all-ones matrices as a sum of two Kronecker products, and apply it to design recursive prefix sum algorithms and circuits. Notably, the proposed family of circuits is the first one that achieves the following three properties simultaneously: (i) zero-deficiency, (ii) constant fan-out per-level, and (iii) depth that is asymptotically strictly smaller than $2\log(n)$ for input length $n$. As an application, we show how to use these circuits to design quantum adders with $1.893\log(n)+O(1)$ Toffoli depth, $O(n)$ Toffoli gates, and $O(n)$ additional qubits, improving the Toffoli depth and/or Toffoli size of existing constructions.</description>
