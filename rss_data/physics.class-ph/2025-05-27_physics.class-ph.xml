      <title>Effects of off-diagonal permittivity terms on polarization singularities in anisotropic grating system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolutions of polarization singularities, including bound states in the continuum (BICs) and circularly polarized states (C points), are usually realized by tuning the geometric parameters of photonic crystal slabs. Here, we use the off-diagonal terms of permittivity tensor to manipulate polarization singularities without breaking the structural symmetry in an anisotropic grating system. By controlling the optical axis of anisotropic media, BICs can be shifted to different positions or split into C points, meanwhile, the creation and annihilation of multiple C points are also observed during the evolution process for both TE and TM modes, respectively. Remarkably, two different splitting directions of BICs can be achieved by tuning the off-diagonal terms of permittivity tensor for the two modes. This work illustrates the important role of off-diagonal terms on the far-field polarization singularities and provide an alternative way to precisely manipulate optical singularities</description>

      <title>Simple and exact nonlinear pendulum motion for all possible initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16816v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simple and formally exact solutions of energy-conserving nonlinear pendulum motion are derived for all three classes: swinging, stopping, and spinning. Although with seemingly very different characteristic motions, the three classes can now be treated on the same footing using the frequency domain. The solutions are the first exact and complete description of energy-conserving pendulum in the frequency domain reported in the literature. The key insight is the importance of angular velocity frequency analysis, rather than that of angular displacement. The emphasis on velocity frequency domain should benefit other studies of nonlinear motion as well. Brief theoretical derivations are given. The solutions are validated by exact numerical values and frequency analysis of dynamical simulations using velocity verlet integration. Their unique simplicity should be useful in a theoretical development that requires a tractable mathematical framework or in an introductory physics course that aims to discuss nonlinear pendulum.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Lagrangian and Multisymplectic Hamiltonian Formalisms for the Description of Classical Fields Interacting with Point Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multisymplectic Hamiltonian formalism is a generalization of the Hamiltonian formalism that is known to manifestly preserve Lorentz covariance in the description of fields and has been suggested as a possible path for developing a covariant canonical quantization process. However, since this formalism allows for multiple definitions of Poisson brackets, its practical use in field theory has been very limited. In this paper, we demonstrate the equivalence between the Lagrangian and the multisymplectic Hamiltonian formalisms in the momentum representation for describing classical fields interacting with point particles by deriving the image in that representation of the de Donder-Weyl function for a general tensor representation of the Lorentz group. The calculation is performed explicitly for a complex scalar field, the electromagnetic field, and the classical Dirac field. The obtained results allow us to propose a Lorentz-covariant bilinear form as a Poisson bracket with respect to the canonical variables of the fields, thus opening the possibility of studying the complete system in a canonical and relativistic coherent way.</description>

      <title>Soft superconductivity in covalent bismuth dihydride BiH$_2$ under extreme conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12062v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong magnetic fields provide a unique environment for investigating the fundamental properties of superconducting materials, especially for hydride superconductors with large upper critical fields. Following this idea, we have investigated the effect of pulsed magnetic fields on covalent bismuth dihydride (BiH$_2$), successfully synthesized under pressure up to 211 GPa. The electrical resistance measurements indicate that the superconducting phase $P2_1/m$-BiH$_2$ exhibits the highest superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$) of 70 K among MH$_2$-type hydride apart from H$_2$S. The electrical transport experiments under both pulsed (up to 50 T) and steady magnetic fields (up to 16 T) for $P2_1/m$- and $C2/m$-BiH$_2$ indicate that the upper critical fields $\mu_0 H_{c2}(0)$ = 12--16 T are unusually low, much lower than that of clathrate-like metal polyhydrides with similar $T_c$. This is due to the unexpectedly high Fermi velocity in BiH$_2$, about $1.1 \times 10^6$ m/s, which allows to classify BiH$_2$ as a 'soft' molecular superconducting hydride with relatively weak vortex pinning. Measurements of the current-voltage characteristics in the pulsed mode make it possible to experimentally establish the temperature dependence of the critical current density (the maximum $J_c(0) = 10$ kA/mm$^2$), which indicates the presence of two $s$-wave superconducting gaps in BiH$_2$ at 172--176 GPa: $\Delta_L(0) = 6.9 \pm 1.2$ meV and $\Delta_S(0) \sim 1.5$ meV.</description>
