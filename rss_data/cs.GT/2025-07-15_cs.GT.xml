      <title>Protocols for Verifying Smooth Strategies in Bandits and Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study protocols for verifying approximate optimality of strategies in multi-armed bandits and normal-form games. As the number of actions available to each player is often large, we seek protocols where the number of queries to the utility oracle is sublinear in the number of actions. We prove that such verification is possible for sufficiently smooth strategies that do not put too much probability mass on any specific action. We provide protocols for verifying that a smooth policy for a multi-armed bandit is $\varepsilon$-optimal. Our verification protocols require provably fewer arm queries than learning. Furthermore, we establish a nearly-tight lower bound on the query complexity of verification in our settings. As an application, we show how to use verification for bandits to achieve verification in normal-form games. This gives a protocol for verifying whether a given strategy profile is an approximate strong smooth Nash equilibrium, with a query complexity that is sublinear in the number of actions.</description>

      <title>Pricing with Tips in Three-Sided Delivery Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model a delivery platform facilitating transactions among three sides: buyers, stores, and couriers. In addition to buyers paying store-specific purchase prices and couriers receiving store--buyer-specific delivery compensation from the platform, each buyer has the option to directly tip for delivery from a specific store. An equilibrium consists of prices, compensations, tips, and transactions that clear the market, such that buyers receive deliveries from preferred stores considering the prices and tips they pay, and couriers deliver preferred orders considering the compensations and tips they receive.
  We illustrate the role of tips in pricing: Without tips, an equilibrium is only guaranteed to exist when there are at least as many couriers as buyers or stores. In contrast, with tips an equilibrium always exists. From an efficiency perspective, the optimal with-tip equilibrium welfare is always weakly larger than the optimal without-tip equilibrium welfare. However, we show that even with tips, efficient equilibria may not exist, and calculating the optimal equilibrium welfare is NP-hard. To address these challenges, we identify natural conditions on market structure that ensure the existence of efficient with-tip equilibria and allow these efficient equilibria to be computed in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Fair Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study the problem of designing optimal contracts under fairness constraints on the task assignments and compensations. We adopt the notion of envy-free (EF) and its relaxations, $\epsilon$-EF and envy-free up to one item (EF1), in contract design settings. Unlike fair allocations, EF contracts are guaranteed to exist. However, computing any constant-factor approximation to the optimal EF contract is NP-hard in general, even using $\epsilon$-EF contracts. For this reason, we consider settings in which the number of agents or tasks is constant. Notably, while even with three agents, finding an EF contract better than $2/5$ approximation of the optimal is NP-hard, we are able to design an FPTAS when the number of agents is constant, under relaxed notions of $\epsilon$-EF and EF1. Moreover, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for computing the optimal EF contract when the number of tasks is constant. Finally, we analyze the price of fairness in contract design. We show that the price of fairness for exact EF contracts can be unbounded, even with a single task and two agents. In contrast, for EF1 contracts, the price of fairness is bounded between $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ and $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of agents.</description>

      <title>A Parallelizable Approach for Characterizing NE in Zero-Sum Games After a Linear Number of Iterations of Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study online optimization methods for zero-sum games, a fundamental problem in adversarial learning in machine learning, economics, and many other domains. Traditional methods approximate Nash equilibria (NE) using either regret-based methods (time-average convergence) or contraction-map-based methods (last-iterate convergence). We propose a new method based on Hamiltonian dynamics in physics and prove that it can characterize the set of NE in a finite (linear) number of iterations of alternating gradient descent in the unbounded setting, modulo degeneracy, a first in online optimization. Unlike standard methods for computing NE, our proposed approach can be parallelized and works with arbitrary learning rates, both firsts in algorithmic game theory. Experimentally, we support our results by showing our approach drastically outperforms standard methods.</description>

      <title>Better Regret Rates in Bilateral Trade via Sublinear Budget Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilateral trade is a central problem in algorithmic economics, and recent work has explored how to design trading mechanisms using no-regret learning algorithms. However, no-regret learning is impossible when budget balance has to be enforced at each time step. Bernasconi et al. [Ber+24] show how this impossibility can be circumvented by relaxing the budget balance constraint to hold only globally over all time steps. In particular, they design an algorithm achieving regret of the order of $\tilde O(T^{3/4})$ and provide a lower bound of $\Omega(T^{5/7})$.
  In this work, we interpolate between these two extremes by studying how the optimal regret rate varies with the allowed violation of the global budget balance constraint. Specifically, we design an algorithm that, by violating the constraint by at most $T^{\beta}$ for any given $\beta \in [\frac{3}{4}, \frac{6}{7}]$, attains regret $\tilde O(T^{1 - \beta/3})$. We complement this result with a matching lower bound, thus fully characterizing the trade-off between regret and budget violation. Our results show that both the $\tilde O(T^{3/4})$ upper bound in the global budget balance case and the $\Omega(T^{5/7})$ lower bound under unconstrained budget balance violation obtained by Bernasconi et al. [Ber+24] are tight.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of the Optimal Correlated Equilibria in Extensive-Form Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major open question in algorithmic game theory is whether normal-form correlated equilibria (NFCE) can be computed efficiently in succinct games such as extensive-form games [DFF+25,6PR24,FP23,HvS08,VSF08,PR08]. Motivated by this question, we study the associated Threshold problem: deciding whether there exists a correlated equilibrium whose value exceeds a given threshold. We prove that this problem is PSPACE-hard for NFCE in multiplayer extensive-form games with perfect recall, even for fixed thresholds. To contextualize this result, we also establish the complexity of the Threshold problem for Nash equilibria in this setting, showing it is ER-complete. These results uncover a surprising complexity reversal: while optimal correlated equilibria are computationally simpler than optimal Nash in normal-form games, the opposite holds in extensive-form games, where computing optimal correlated equilibria is provably harder. Building on this line of inquiry, we also address a related question by [VSF08], who introduced the notions of extensive-form correlated equilibrium (EFCE) and agent-form correlated equilibrium (AFCE). They asked how difficult the Threshold problem is for AFCE; we answer this question by proving that it is NP-hard, even in two-player games without chance nodes. Complementing our hardness results, we establish tight complexity classifications for the Threshold problem across several correlated equilibrium concepts - including EFCE, AFCE, normal-form coarse, extensive-form coarse, and agent-form coarse correlated equilibria. For each of these solution concepts in multiplayer stochastic extensive-form games with perfect recall, we prove NP-completeness by providing matching NP upper bounds to the previously known hardness results. Together, our results provide the most complete landscape to date for the complexity of optimal equilibrium computation in extensive-form games.</description>

      <title>AI Mother Tongue: Self-Emergent Communication in MARL via Endogenous Symbol Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), the development of Emergent Communication has long been constrained by the ``Joint Exploration Dilemma'', leading agents to fall into a ``Communication Vacuum Equilibrium'' . Traditional methods address this by introducing inductive biases to facilitate communication emergence . This study fundamentally questions whether such artificial inductive biases are, in fact, over-engineering. Through experiments with the ``AI Mother Tongue'' (AIM) framework, based on a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), we demonstrate that when agents possess an endogenous symbol system, their neural representations naturally exhibit spontaneous semantic compression and Nash equilibrium-driven semantic convergence, achieving effective symbolic communication without external inductive biases. This aligns with recent neuroscience findings suggesting that the human brain does not directly use human language for internal thought , and resonates with research on ``soft thinking'' capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) . Compared to traditional explicit communication methods, AIM demonstrates stronger generality and efficiency. The interpretable analysis toolkit developed in this study confirms that symbol usage exhibits a significant power-law distribution, leading to three major theoretical insights: the ``Neural Communication Hypothesis'', the ``Tool-First Principle'', and the ``Semantic Interpretability Paradigm''. Future research will explore the integration of Hierarchical Quantized Variational Autoencoders (HQ-VAE) to enhance AIM's complex expressive capabilities and investigate the potential for ``Reinforcement Learning (RL) Low-Level Pre-training''. This discovery offers new avenues for bridging symbolism and connectionism.</description>

      <title>Game Theory Meets LLM and Agentic AI: Reimagining Cybersecurity for the Age of Intelligent Threats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protecting cyberspace requires not only advanced tools but also a shift in how we reason about threats, trust, and autonomy. Traditional cybersecurity methods rely on manual responses and brittle heuristics. To build proactive and intelligent defense systems, we need integrated theoretical frameworks and software tools. Game theory provides a rigorous foundation for modeling adversarial behavior, designing strategic defenses, and enabling trust in autonomous systems. Meanwhile, software tools process cyber data, visualize attack surfaces, verify compliance, and suggest mitigations. Yet a disconnect remains between theory and practical implementation.
  The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI offers a new path to bridge this gap. LLM-powered agents can operationalize abstract strategies into real-world decisions. Conversely, game theory can inform the reasoning and coordination of these agents across complex workflows. LLMs also challenge classical game-theoretic assumptions, such as perfect rationality or static payoffs, prompting new models aligned with cognitive and computational realities. This co-evolution promises richer theoretical foundations and novel solution concepts. Agentic AI also reshapes software design: systems must now be modular, adaptive, and trust-aware from the outset.
  This chapter explores the intersection of game theory, agentic AI, and cybersecurity. We review key game-theoretic frameworks (e.g., static, dynamic, Bayesian, and signaling games) and solution concepts. We then examine how LLM agents can enhance cyber defense and introduce LLM-driven games that embed reasoning into AI agents. Finally, we explore multi-agent workflows and coordination games, outlining how this convergence fosters secure, intelligent, and adaptive cyber systems.</description>

      <title>Approximate solutions to games of ordered preference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must balance ranked objectives, such as minimizing travel time, ensuring safety, and coordinating with traffic. Games of ordered preference effectively model these interactions but become computationally intractable as the time horizon, number of players, or number of preference levels increase. While receding horizon frameworks mitigate long-horizon intractability by solving sequential shorter games, often warm-started, they do not resolve the complexity growth inherent in existing methods for solving games of ordered preference. This paper introduces a solution strategy that avoids excessive complexity growth by approximating solutions using lexicographic iterated best response (IBR) in receding horizon, termed "lexicographic IBR over time." Lexicographic IBR over time uses past information to accelerate convergence. We demonstrate through simulated traffic scenarios that lexicographic IBR over time efficiently computes approximate-optimal solutions for receding horizon games of ordered preference, converging towards generalized Nash equilibria.</description>

      <title>Assignment Markets with Budget Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.06132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies markets where a set of indivisible items is sold to bidders with quasilinear, unit-demand valuations, subject to a hard budget constraint. Without financial constraints the well-known assignment market model of Shapley and Shubik (1971) allows for a simple ascending auction format that is incentive-compatible, and strongly Pareto-optimal. However, this auction model does not capture the possibility that bidders face hard budget constraints. We design an iterative auction that depends on demand queries and an easily verifiable additional condition to maintain the properties in the presence of budget constraints. If instead this additional condition does not hold, incentive compatibility and core stability are at odds, and we cannot hope to achieve strong Pareto optimality in a simple ascending auction even with truthful bidding. Moreover, even in a complete information model where the auctioneer has access to valuations and budget constraints, the problem is NP-hard.</description>

Abstract: We initiate the study of Bayesian conversations, which model interactive communication between two strategic agents without a mediator. We compare this to communication through a mediator and investigate the settings in which a mediation can expand the range of implementable outcomes.
  We look into the eventual outcome of two-player games after interactive communication. We focus on games where only one agent has a non-trivial action and examine the performance of communication protocols that are individually rational (IR) for both parties. We characterize the structure of the social-welfare optimal protocol of a given number of rounds and thus show a separation between Bayesian conversation and mediated protocols. We demonstrate an example where the optimal conversation protocol requires infinitely many rounds of communication, and further show that for settings with binary actions and binary types, any optimal protocol either is finite (with at most 6 rounds) or requires infinitely many rounds of communication.</description>

      <title>PPA-Game: Characterizing and Learning Competitive Dynamics Among Online Content Creators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the Proportional Payoff Allocation Game (PPA-Game), which characterizes situations where agents compete for divisible resources. In the PPA-game, agents select from available resources, and their payoffs are proportionately determined based on heterogeneous weights attributed to them. Such dynamics simulate content creators on online recommender systems like YouTube and TikTok, who compete for finite consumer attention, with content exposure reliant on inherent and distinct quality. We first conduct a game-theoretical analysis of the PPA-Game. While the PPA-Game does not always guarantee the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium (PNE), we identify prevalent scenarios ensuring its existence. Simulated experiments further prove that the cases where PNE does not exist rarely happen. Beyond analyzing static payoffs, we further discuss the agents' online learning about resource payoffs by integrating a multi-player multi-armed bandit framework. We propose an online algorithm facilitating each agent's maximization of cumulative payoffs over $T$ rounds. Theoretically, we establish that the regret of any agent is bounded by $O(\log^{1 + \eta} T)$ for any $\eta &gt; 0$. Empirical results further validate the effectiveness of our online learning approach.</description>

      <title>The Non-Cooperative Rational Synthesis Problem for Subgame Perfect Equilibria and omega-regular Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the rational synthesis problem for multi-player games played on graphs when rational players are following subgame perfect equilibria. In these games, one player, the system, declares his strategy upfront, and the other players, composing the environment, then rationally respond by playing strategies forming a subgame perfect equilibrium. We study the complexity of the rational synthesis problem when the players have {\omega}-regular objectives encoded as parity objectives. Our algorithm is based on an encoding into a three-player game with imperfect information, showing that the problem is in 2ExpTime. When the number of environment players is fixed, the problem is in ExpTime and is NP- and coNP-hard. Moreover, for a fixed number of players and reachability objectives, we get a polynomial algorithm.</description>

      <title>Group-wise oracle-efficient algorithms for online multi-group learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of online multi-group learning, a learning model in which an online learner must simultaneously achieve small prediction regret on a large collection of (possibly overlapping) subsequences corresponding to a family of groups. Groups are subsets of the context space, and in fairness applications, they may correspond to subpopulations defined by expressive functions of demographic attributes. In contrast to previous work on this learning model, we consider scenarios in which the family of groups is too large to explicitly enumerate, and hence we seek algorithms that only access groups via an optimization oracle. In this paper, we design such oracle-efficient algorithms with sublinear regret under a variety of settings, including: (i) the i.i.d. setting, (ii) the adversarial setting with smoothed context distributions, and (iii) the adversarial transductive setting.</description>

Abstract: The Knaster-Tarski theorem, also known as Tarski's theorem, guarantees that every monotone function defined on a complete lattice has a fixed point. We analyze the query complexity of finding such a fixed point on the $k$-dimensional grid of side length $n$ under the $\leq$ relation. Specifically, there is an unknown monotone function $f: \{0,1,\ldots, n-1\}^k \to \{0,1,\ldots, n-1\}^k$ and an algorithm must query a vertex $v$ to learn $f(v)$.
  A key special case of interest is the Boolean hypercube $\{0,1\}^k$, which is isomorphic to the power set lattice--the original setting of the Knaster-Tarski theorem. We prove a lower bound that characterizes the randomized and deterministic query complexity of the Tarski search problem on the Boolean hypercube as $\Theta(k)$. More generally, we give a randomized lower bound of $\Omega\left( k + \frac{k \log{n}}{\log{k}} \right)$ for the $k$-dimensional grid of side length $n$, which is asymptotically optimal in high dimensions when $k$ is large relative to $n$.</description>

      <title>Consumable Data via Quantum Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08495v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical data can be copied and re-used for computation, with adverse consequences economically and in terms of data privacy. Motivated by this, we formulate problems in one-way communication complexity where Alice holds some data $x$ and Bob holds $m$ inputs $y_1,... , y_m$. They want to compute $m$ instances of a bipartite relation $R$ on every pair $(x, y_1),\ldots, (x, y_m)$. We call this the asymmetric direct sum question for one-way communication. We give a number of examples where the quantum communication complexity of such problems scales polynomially with $m$, while the classical communication complexity depends at most logarithmically on $m$. Thus, for such problems, data behaves like a consumable resource that is effectively destroyed upon use when the owner stores and transmits it as quantum states, but not when transmitted classically. We show an application to a strategic data-selling game, and discuss other potential economic implications.</description>
