      <title>Spiking Neural Networks: The Future of Brain-Inspired Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent the latest generation of neural computation, offering a brain-inspired alternative to conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Unlike ANNs, which depend on continuous-valued signals, SNNs operate using distinct spike events, making them inherently more energy-efficient and temporally dynamic. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of SNN design models, training algorithms, and multi-dimensional performance metrics, including accuracy, energy consumption, latency, spike count, and convergence behavior. Key neuron models such as the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) and training strategies, including surrogate gradient descent, ANN-to-SNN conversion, and Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP), are examined in depth. Results show that surrogate gradient-trained SNNs closely approximate ANN accuracy (within 1-2%), with faster convergence by the 20th epoch and latency as low as 10 milliseconds. Converted SNNs also achieve competitive performance but require higher spike counts and longer simulation windows. STDP-based SNNs, though slower to converge, exhibit the lowest spike counts and energy consumption (as low as 5 millijoules per inference), making them optimal for unsupervised and low-power tasks. These findings reinforce the suitability of SNNs for energy-constrained, latency-sensitive, and adaptive applications such as robotics, neuromorphic vision, and edge AI systems. While promising, challenges persist in hardware standardization and scalable training. This study concludes that SNNs, with further refinement, are poised to propel the next phase of neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Exploiting heterogeneous delays for efficient computation in low-bit neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks rely on learning synaptic weights. However, this overlooks other neural parameters that can also be learned and may be utilized by the brain. One such parameter is the delay: the brain exhibits complex temporal dynamics with heterogeneous delays, where signals are transmitted asynchronously between neurons. It has been theorized that this delay heterogeneity, rather than a cost to be minimized, can be exploited in embodied contexts where task-relevant information naturally sits contextually in the time domain. We test this hypothesis by training spiking neural networks to modify not only their weights but also their delays at different levels of precision. We find that delay heterogeneity enables state-of-the-art performance on temporally complex neuromorphic problems and can be achieved even when weights are extremely imprecise (1.58-bit ternary precision: just positive, negative, or absent). By enabling high performance with extremely low-precision weights, delay heterogeneity allows memory-efficient solutions that maintain state-of-the-art accuracy even when weights are compressed over an order of magnitude more aggressively than typically studied weight-only networks. We show how delays and time-constants adaptively trade-off, and reveal through ablation that task performance depends on task-appropriate delay distributions, with temporally-complex tasks requiring longer delays. Our results suggest temporal heterogeneity is an important principle for efficient computation, particularly when task-relevant information is temporal - as in the physical world - with implications for embodied intelligent systems and neuromorphic hardware.</description>

      <title>W-PCA Based Gradient-Free Proxy for Efficient Search of Lightweight Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demand for efficient natural language processing (NLP) systems has led to the development of lightweight language models. Previous work in this area has primarily focused on manual design or training-based neural architecture search (NAS) methods. Recently, zero-shot NAS methods have been proposed for evaluating language models without the need for training. However, prevailing approaches to zero-shot NAS often face challenges such as biased evaluation metrics and computational inefficiencies. In this paper, we introduce weight-weighted PCA (W-PCA), a novel zero-shot NAS method specifically tailored for lightweight language models. Our approach utilizes two evaluation proxies: the parameter count and the number of principal components with cumulative contribution exceeding $\eta$ in the feed-forward neural (FFN) layer. Additionally, by eliminating the need for gradient computations, we optimize the evaluation time, thus enhancing the efficiency of designing and evaluating lightweight language models. We conduct a comparative analysis on the GLUE and SQuAD datasets to evaluate our approach. The results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces training time compared to one-shot NAS methods and achieves higher scores in the testing phase compared to previous state-of-the-art training-based methods. Furthermore, we perform ranking evaluations on a dataset sampled from the FlexiBERT search space. Our approach exhibits superior ranking correlation and further reduces solving time compared to other zero-shot NAS methods that require gradient computation.</description>

      <title>Elastic Architecture Search for Efficient Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large pre-trained language models become increasingly critical to natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, their substantial computational and memory requirements have raised significant economic and environmental concerns. Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces the Elastic Language Model (ELM), a novel neural architecture search (NAS) method optimized for compact language models. ELM extends existing NAS approaches by introducing a flexible search space with efficient transformer blocks and dynamic modules for dimension and head number adjustment. These innovations enhance the efficiency and flexibility of the search process, which facilitates more thorough and effective exploration of model architectures. We also introduce novel knowledge distillation losses that preserve the unique characteristics of each block, in order to improve the discrimination between architectural choices during the search process. Experiments on masked language modeling and causal language modeling tasks demonstrate that models discovered by ELM significantly outperform existing methods.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Deep Learning and Forensic Approach for Robust Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models has made synthetic media increasingly realistic, raising societal concerns around misinformation, identity fraud, and digital trust. Existing deepfake detection methods either rely on deep learning, which suffers from poor generalization and vulnerability to distortions, or forensic analysis, which is interpretable but limited against new manipulation techniques. This study proposes a hybrid framework that fuses forensic features, including noise residuals, JPEG compression traces, and frequency-domain descriptors, with deep learning representations from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs). Evaluated on benchmark datasets (FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF v2, DFDC), the proposed model consistently outperformed single-method baselines and demonstrated superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art hybrid approaches, achieving F1-scores of 0.96, 0.82, and 0.77, respectively. Robustness tests demonstrated stable performance under compression (F1 = 0.87 at QF = 50), adversarial perturbations (AUC = 0.84), and unseen manipulations (F1 = 0.79). Importantly, explainability analysis showed that Grad-CAM and forensic heatmaps overlapped with ground-truth manipulated regions in 82 percent of cases, enhancing transparency and user trust. These findings confirm that hybrid approaches provide a balanced solution, combining the adaptability of deep models with the interpretability of forensic cues, to develop resilient and trustworthy deepfake detection systems.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Application of Utility Theory in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a unifying concept in economics, game theory, and operations research, even in the Robotics and AI field, the utility is used to evaluate the level of individual needs, preferences, and interests. Especially for decision-making and learning in multi-agent/robot systems (MAS/MRS), a suitable utility model can guide agents in choosing reasonable strategies to achieve their current needs and learning to cooperate and organize their behaviors, optimizing the system's utility, building stable and reliable relationships, and guaranteeing each group member's sustainable development, similar to the human society. Although these systems' complex, large-scale, and long-term behaviors are strongly determined by the fundamental characteristics of the underlying relationships, there has been less discussion on the theoretical aspects of mechanisms and the fields of applications in Robotics and AI. This paper introduces a utility-orient needs paradigm to describe and evaluate inter and outer relationships among agents' interactions. Then, we survey existing literature in relevant fields to support it and propose several promising research directions along with some open problems deemed necessary for further investigations.</description>

      <title>Generative thermodynamic computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generative modeling framework for thermodynamic computing, in which structured data is synthesized from noise by the natural time evolution of a physical system governed by Langevin dynamics. While conventional diffusion models use neural networks to perform denoising, here the information needed to generate structure from noise is encoded by the dynamics of a thermodynamic system. Training proceeds by maximizing the probability with which the computer generates the reverse of a noising trajectory, which ensures that the computer generates data with minimal heat emission. We demonstrate this framework within a digital simulation of a thermodynamic computer. If realized in analog hardware, such a system would function as a generative model that produces structured samples without the need for artificially-injected noise or active control of denoising.</description>

      <title>Multimodal LLM-assisted Evolutionary Search for Programmatic Control Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has achieved impressive success in control tasks. However, its policies, represented as opaque neural networks, are often difficult for humans to understand, verify, and debug, which undermines trust and hinders real-world deployment. This work addresses this challenge by introducing a novel approach for programmatic control policy discovery, called Multimodal Large Language Model-assisted Evolutionary Search (MLES). MLES utilizes multimodal large language models as programmatic policy generators, combining them with evolutionary search to automate policy generation. It integrates visual feedback-driven behavior analysis within the policy generation process to identify failure patterns and guide targeted improvements, thereby enhancing policy discovery efficiency and producing adaptable, human-aligned policies. Experimental results demonstrate that MLES achieves performance comparable to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) across two standard control tasks while providing transparent control logic and traceable design processes. This approach also overcomes the limitations of predefined domain-specific languages, facilitates knowledge transfer and reuse, and is scalable across various tasks, showing promise as a new paradigm for developing transparent and verifiable control policies.</description>
