      <title>A Note on Constructive Canonical Splitter Strategies in Nowhere Dense Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radius-$r$ splitter game is played on a graph $G$ between two players: Splitter and Connector. In each round, Connector selects a vertex $v$, and the current game arena is restricted to the radius-$r$ neighborhood of $v$. Then Splitter removes a vertex from this restricted subgraph. The game ends, and Splitter wins, when the arena becomes empty. Splitter aims to end the game as quickly as possible, while Connector tries to prolong it for as long as possible. The splitter game was introduced by Grohe, Kreutzer and Siebertz to characterize nowhere dense graph classes. They showed that a class $\mathscr{C}$ of graphs is nowhere dense if and only if for every radius $r$ there exists a number $\ell$ such that Splitter has a strategy on every $G\in \mathscr{C}$ to win the radius-$r$ splitter game in at most $\ell$ rounds. It was recently proved by Ohlmann et al. that there are only a bounded number of possible Splitter moves that are progressing, that is, moves that lead to an arena where Splitter can win in one less round. The proof of Ohlmann et al. is based on the compactness theorem and does not give a constructive bound on the number of progressing moves. In this work, we give a simple constructive proof, showing that if Splitter can force a win in the radius-$r$ game in $k$ rounds, then there are at most $(2r+1)^{\,2^{k-1}-1}$ progressing moves.</description>

      <title>On Syntactical Simplification of Temporal Operators in Negation-free MTL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal reasoning in dynamic, data-intensive environments increasingly demands expressive yet tractable logical frameworks. Traditional approaches often rely on negation to express absence or contradiction. In such contexts, Negation-as-Failure is commonly used to infer negative information from the lack of positive evidence. However, open and distributed systems such as IoT networks or the Semantic Web Negation-as-Failure semantics become unreliable due to incomplete and asynchronous data. This has led to a growing interest in negation-free fragments of temporal rule-based systems, which preserve monotonicity and enable scalable reasoning.
  This paper investigates the expressive power of negation-free MTL, a temporal logic framework designed for rule-based reasoning over time. We show that the "always" operators of MTL, often treated as syntactic sugar for combinations of other temporal constructs, can be eliminated using "once", "since" and "until" operators. Remarkably, even the "once" operators can be removed, yielding a fragment based solely on "until" and "since". These results challenge the assumption that negation is necessary for expressing universal temporal constraints, and reveal a robust fragment capable of capturing both existential and invariant temporal patterns. Furthermore, the results induce a reduction in the syntax of MTL, which in turn can provide benefits for both theoretical study as well as implementation efforts.</description>

      <title>Initial Algebras of Domains via Quotient Inductive-Inductive Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain theory has been developed as a mathematical theory of computation and to give a denotational semantics to programming languages. It helps us to fix the meaning of language concepts, to understand how programs behave and to reason about programs. At the same time it serves as a great theory to model various algebraic effects such as non-determinism, partial functions, side effects and numerous other forms of computation.
  In the present paper, we present a general framework to construct algebraic effects in domain theory, where our domains are DCPOs: directed complete partial orders. We first describe so called DCPO algebras for a signature, where the signature specifies the operations on the DCPO and the inequational theory they obey. This provides a method to represent various algebraic effects, like partiality. We then show that initial DCPO algebras exist by defining them as so called Quotient Inductive-Inductive Types (QIITs), known from homotopy type theory. A quotient inductive-inductive type allows one to simultaneously define an inductive type and an inductive relation on that type, together with equations on the type. We illustrate our approach by showing that several well-known constructions of DCPOs fit our framework: coalesced sums, smash products and free DCPOs (partiality and power domains). Our work makes use of various features of homotopy type theory and is formalized in Cubical Agda.</description>

      <title>Effects of the Strict-Tolerant Approach on Intuitionistic and Minimal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the literature on the strict-tolerant logical approach by applying its methods to intuitionistic and minimal logic. In short, the strict-tolerant approach modifies the usual notion of logical consequence by stipulating that, in order for an inference to be valid, from the truth of the premises must follow the non-falsity of the conclusion. This notion can also be generalized to define strict-tolerant metainferences, metametainferences and so on, which may or may not generate logics distinct from those obtained on the inferential level. It is already known that strict-tolerant definitions can make the notion of inference for non-classical logics collapse into the classical notion, but the strength of this effect is not yet fully known. This paper shows that intuitionistic strict-tolerant inferences also collapse into classical ones, but minimal ones do not. However, minimal strict-tolerant logic has the property that no inferences are valid (which is not carried over to the metainferential level). Additionally, it is shown that the logics obtained from intuitionistic, minimal and classical logic at the metainferential level are distinct from each other.</description>

      <title>State Algebra for Propositional Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents State Algebra, a novel framework designed to represent and manipulate propositional logic using algebraic methods. The framework is structured as a hierarchy of three representations: Set, Coordinate, and Row Decomposition. These representations anchor the system in well-known semantics while facilitating the computation using a powerful algebraic engine. A key aspect of State Algebra is its flexibility in representation. We show that although the default reduction of a state vector is not canonical, a unique canonical form can be obtained by applying a fixed variable order during the reduction process. This highlights a trade-off: by foregoing guaranteed canonicity, the framework gains increased flexibility, potentially leading to more compact representations of certain classes of problems. We explore how this framework provides tools to articulate both search-based and knowledge compilation algorithms and discuss its natural extension to probabilistic logic and Weighted Model Counting.</description>

      <title>From Thin Concurrent Games to Generalized Species of Structures (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01082v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two families of denotational models have emerged from the semantic analysis of linear logic: dynamic models, typically presented as game semantics, and static models, typically based on a category of relations. In this paper we introduce a formal bridge between a dynamic model and a static model: the model of thin concurrent games and strategies, based on event structures, and the model of generalized species of structures, based on distributors. A special focus of this paper is the two-dimensional nature of the dynamic-static relationship, which we formalize with double categories and bicategories.
  In the first part of the paper, we construct a symmetric monoidal oplax functor from linear concurrent strategies to distributors. We highlight two fundamental differences between the two models: the composition mechanism, and the representation of resource symmetries. In the second part of the paper, we adapt established methods from game semantics (visible strategies, payoff structure) to enforce a tighter connection between the two models. We obtain a cartesian closed pseudofunctor, which we exploit to shed new light on recent results in the theory of the lambda-calculus.</description>

      <title>Monoid Theory in Alonzo: A Little Theories Formalization in Simple Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alonzo is a practice-oriented classical higher-order version of predicate logic that extends first-order logic and that admits undefined expressions. Named in honor of Alonzo Church, Alonzo is based on Church's type theory, Church's formulation of simple type theory. The little theories method is a method for formalizing mathematical knowledge as a theory graph consisting of theories as nodes and theory morphisms as directed edges. The development of a mathematical topic is done in the "little theory" in the theory graph that has the most convenient level of abstraction and the most convenient vocabulary, and then the definitions and theorems produced in the development are transported, as needed, to other theories via the theory morphisms in the theory graph.
  The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how a body of mathematical knowledge can be formalized in Alonzo using the little theories method. This is done by formalizing monoid theory -- the body of mathematical knowledge about monoids -- in Alonzo. Instead of using the standard approach to formal mathematics in which mathematics is done with the help of a proof assistant and all details are formally proved and mechanically checked, we employ an alternative approach in which everything is done within a formal logic but proofs are not required to be fully formal. The standard approach focuses on certification, while this alternative approach focuses on communication and accessibility.</description>

      <title>Sound Statistical Model Checking for Probabilities and Expected Rewards (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical model checking estimates probabilities and expectations of interest in probabilistic system models by using random simulations. Its results come with statistical guarantees. However, many tools use unsound statistical methods that produce incorrect results more often than they claim. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of tools and their correctness, as well as of sound methods available for estimating probabilities from the literature. For expected rewards, we investigate how to bound the path reward distribution to apply sound statistical methods for bounded distributions, of which we recommend the Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz inequality that has not been used in SMC so far. We prove that even reachability rewards can be bounded in theory, and formalise the concept of limit-PAC procedures for a practical solution. The 'modes' SMC tool implements our methods and recommendations, which we use to experimentally confirm our results.</description>

      <title>A study of the Antlion Random Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random walks (RWs) are fundamental stochastic processes with applications across physics, computer science, and information processing. A recent extension, the laser chaos decision-maker, employs chaotic time series from semiconductor lasers to solve multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems at ultrafast speeds, and its threshold adjustment mechanism has been modeled as an RW. However, previous analyses assumed complete memory preservation ($\alpha = 1$), overlooking the role of partial memory in balancing exploration and exploitation. In this paper, we introduce the Antlion Random Walk (ARW), defined by $X_t = \alpha X_{t-1} + \xi_t$ with $\alpha \in [0,1]$ and Rademacher-distributed increments $(\xi_t)$, which describes a walker pulled back toward the origin before each step. We show that varying $\alpha$ significantly alters ARW dynamics, yielding distributions that range from uniform-like to normal-like. Through mathematical and numerical analyses, we investigate expectation, variance, reachability, positive-side residence time, and distributional similarity. Our results place ARWs within the framework of autoregressive (AR(1)) processes while highlighting distinct non-Gaussian features, thereby offering new theoretical insights into memory-aware stochastic modeling of decision-making systems.</description>
