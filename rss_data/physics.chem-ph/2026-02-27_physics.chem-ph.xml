      <title>Benchmarking short-range machine learning potentials for atomistic simulations of metal/electrolyte interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomistic simulations of electrochemical interfaces remain challenging due to the long time scales required to adequately sample the structure of the electric double layer. The emergence of efficient, short-range machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) offers a promising alternative to computationally expensive density functional theory-based molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) simulations in this regard. However, in standard periodic DFT calculations of metal surfaces, the surface charge is implicitly set by the number of counterions in the simulation cell, making it a global property that is difficult to represent with strictly local MLIPs. Here, we benchmark common MLIP architectures (DP, ACE, MACE) for charged Au/water interfaces containing solvated sodium ions. We find that MLIPs trained on datasets spanning multiple surface charge states yield inconsistent predictions of interfacial water orientation and ion distributions, although message-passing models with a larger receptive field exhibit greater robustness to training on mixed-charge datasets. In contrast, models trained on a single charge state produce consistent equilibrium interfacial properties. Finally, we assess the performance of the eSEN model trained on the recently released Open Catalyst 2025 dataset, which includes solid/liquid interfaces that span a wide range of surface charge densities. Overall, our results characterize the limitations of short-range MLIPs for simulations of electrochemical interfaces and provide practical guidance for constructing training datasets for simulations of charged metal/electrolyte interfaces.</description>

      <title>Learning Thermal Response Forces: A Method for Extending the Thermodynamic Transferability of Coarse-Grained Models via Machine-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learned (ML) coarse-grained (CG) models are a promising tool for significantly enhancing the efficiency of molecular simulations by systematically removing degrees of freedom while retaining fidelity to the underlying fine-grained model. The CG potential of mean force (PMF) is inherently dependent on thermodynamic conditions and, hence, a CG force-field (FF) which is trained at one thermodynamic state point is not necessarily accurate at another. We propose, in this work, a novel and data-efficient means of learning temperature dependence into ML CG force-fields via training on the thermal response forces of the PMF. We demonstrate how incorporating these terms into ML CG FFs confers significantly improved transferability for CG water models and demonstrate how this transferability enables accurate and predictive CG dynamics.</description>

      <title>Evidence of orbital mixing upon ionization via Cooper minimum photoelectron dynamics in epichlorohydrin. Experiment and Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A peculiar electron correlation effect, leading to orbital rotation upon ionization, theoretically predicted long ago, was never experimentally characterized. The effect is expected to appear prominently in the photoionization of chiral molecules, due to the lack of symmetry constraints to wave-functions mixing. This is observed to have a profound effect on the photoelectron dynamics, as here demonstrated by investigating \b{eta} asymmetry parameters and partial cross-section observables in the Cl 3p Cooper minimum region of epichlorohydrin, a chiral prototype system. Angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy with tunable synchrotron radiation allowed measuring Cooper minimum $\beta$ oscillations, which were observed for solely two valence photoionization channels. The nature and number of channels exhibiting such dynamical behavior, along with the extent of the observed oscillation amplitudes, could not be accounted for by predictions based on Hartree-Fock (HF) and Density Functional Theory (DFT). These features could only be explained by incorporating correlation effects, which mix single-hole configurations of identical symmetry, in the characterization of the four lowest-lying molecular cation states, via equation-of-motion coupled cluster singles and doubles Dyson orbitals.</description>

      <title>An Information-theoretic Collective Variable for Configurational Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entropy governs molecular self-assembly, phase transitions, and material stability, yet remains challenging to quantify and directly control in molecular systems. Here, we demonstrate that the computable information density (CID), a data compression-based information theoretic metric, provides an instantaneous general measure of configurational entropy in molecular dynamics simulations, reflecting both local and long-range structural organization. We validate the CID across systems of increasing complexity, beginning with single-component Lennard-Jones melting before examining binary phase separation, polymer condensation and dispersion, and assembly of amorphous carbon networks at multiple densities. Unlike conventional order parameters, CID requires no a priori knowledge of relevant structural features and captures entropic signatures across a variety of molecular systems and discretization resolutions. By establishing entropy as a directly accessible structural metric, this framework lays a foundation for future entropy-driven materials design and optimization strategies.</description>

      <title>Efficient training of generative models from multireference simulations and its application to the design of Dy complexes with large magnetic anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative machine learning models can potentially provide direct access to novel and relevant portions of the full chemical space, overcoming the cost of systematic sampling. However, the training of these models generally requires a large amount of data, often precluding the use of expensive high-level ab initio simulations for this task. The generation of coordination compounds of Dy with large magnetic anisotropy represents a topical example, where multireference simulations of large molecules are necessary to perform reliable predictions. Here, we show that a semi-supervised chemically-inspired training-by-proxy of generative variational autoencoders can reduce the cost associated with building a training set from multireference simulations by two orders of magnitude. We illustrate the power of this approach by generating 100s of new organic ligands for Dy(III) pentagonal bipyramidal complexes exhibiting record values of magnetic anisotropy, while starting from datasets as small as 1k multireference calculations. This work thus paves the way to the computational generation of molecules as complex coordination compounds with target electronic and magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Ceci n'est pas un committor, yet it samples like one: efficient sampling via approximated committor functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomistic simulations are widely used to investigate reactive processes but are often limited by the rare event problem due to kinetic bottlenecks. We recently introduced an enhanced sampling approach based on the committor function, machine-learned following a variational principle. This method combines a transition-state-oriented bias potential, expressed as a functional of the committor, with a metadynamics-like bias along a committor-based collective variable, enabling uniform exploration of reaction pathways. In its original formulation, the committor is represented by a neural network that takes physical descriptors as input and is trained by minimizing a functional involving gradients with respect to atomic coordinates, which can be computationally demanding in some cases. Here, we propose a simplified learning criterion formulated entirely in the descriptor space, which bypasses the need for explicit and costly coordinate gradients and provides a relaxed upper bound to the original variational principle. Although this approach does not formally target the exact committor, we show that it retains robust sampling performance while significantly reducing computational costs, thus enabling the study of processes that would be practically unfeasible using the original formulation.</description>

      <title>mrfmsim: a modular, extendable, and readable simulation platform for magnetic resonance force microscopy experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present mrfmsim, an open-source package that facilitates the design, simulation, and signal validation of magnetic resonance force microscopy experiments. The mrfmsim package uses directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to model experiments and employs a plugin system that enables adding custom experiments and functionalities. Unlike common DAG-powered workflow packages, mrfmsim allows flexible customization of experiments post-definition, such as optimized looping, without requiring rewriting the internal model. In this paper, we highlight the challenges of building simulation packages for experiments that undergo continuous development in a graduate research setting. We demonstrate how a one-off approach to experimental simulation yielded erroneous results, and how the modularity, extendibility, and readability of the new platform enabled correct results and a significantly accelerated development cycle.</description>

      <title>Toward Quantum-Aware Machine Learning: Improved Prediction of Quantum Dissipative Dynamics via Complex Valued Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately modeling quantum dissipative dynamics remains challenging due to environmental complexity and non-Markovian memory effects. Although machine learning provides a promising alternative to conventional simulation techniques, most existing models employ real-valued neural networks (RVNNs) that inherently mismatch the complex-valued nature of quantum mechanics. By decoupling the real and imaginary parts of the density matrix, RVNNs can obscure essential amplitude-phase correlations, compromising physical consistency. Here, we introduce complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) as a physics-consistent framework for learning quantum dissipative dynamics. CVNNs operate directly on complex-valued inputs, preserve the algebraic structure of quantum states, and naturally encode quantum coherences. Through numerical benchmarks on the spin-boson model and several variants of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex, we demonstrate that CVNNs outperform RVNNs in convergence speed, training stability, and physical fidelity -- including significantly improved trace conservation and Hermiticity. These advantages increase with system size and coherence complexity, establishing CVNNs as a robust, scalable, quantum-aware classical approach for simulating open quantum systems in the pre-fault-tolerant quantum era.</description>

      <title>Extrapolation of Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials for Organic and Polymeric Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25022v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) have surged in popularity due to their promise of expanding the spatiotemporal scales possible for simulating molecules with high fidelity. The accuracy of any MLIP is dependent on the data used for its training; thus, for large molecules, like polymers, where accurate training data is prohibitively difficult to obtain, it becomes necessary to pursue non-traditional methods to construct MLIPs, many of which are based on constructing MLIPs using smaller, analogous chemical systems. However, we have yet to understand the limits to which smaller molecules can be used as a proxy for extrapolating macromolecular energetics. Here, we provide a ``control study'' for such experiments, exploring the ability of MLIP approaches to extrapolate between n=1-8 n-polyalkanes at identical conditions. Through Principal Covariates Classification, we quantitatively demonstrate how convergence in chemical environments between training and testing datasets coincides with an MLIP's transferability. Additionally, we show how careful attention to the construction of an MLIP's neighbor list can promote greater transferability when considering various levels of the energetic hierarchy. Our results establish a roadmap for how one can create transferable MLIPs for macromolecular systems without the prohibitive cost of constructing system-specific training data.</description>

      <title>MaxwellLink: A unified framework for self-consistent light-matter simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major challenge in light-matter simulations is bridging the disparate time and length scales of electrodynamics and molecular dynamics. Current computational approaches often rely on heuristic approximations of either the electromagnetic (EM) or the material component, hindering the exploration of complex light-matter systems. Herein, MaxwellLink -- a modular, open-source Python framework -- is developed for the massively parallel, self-consistent propagation of classical EM fields interacting with a large heterogeneous molecular ensemble. The package utilizes a robust TCP/UNIX socket interface to couple EM solvers with a wide range of molecular drivers. In this initial release, MaxwellLink supports EM solvers spanning from single-mode cavities to full-feature three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) engines, and molecules described by multilevel open quantum systems, force-field and first-principles molecular dynamics, and nonadiabatic real-time Ehrenfest dynamics. With the socket-based architecture, users can seamlessly switch between levels of theory of either the EM solver or molecules without modifying the counterpart. Moreover, the EM engine and molecular drivers scale independently across multiple high-performance computing (HPC) nodes, facilitating large-scale simulations previously inaccessible to existing numerical schemes. The versatility and accuracy of this code are further demonstrated through applications including superradiance, radiative energy transfer, vibrational strong coupling in Bragg resonators, and plasmonic heating of molecular gases. By providing a unified, extensible engine, MaxwellLink potentially offers a powerful platform for exploring emerging phenomena across the research fronts of spectroscopy, quantum optics, plasmonics, and polaritonics.</description>
