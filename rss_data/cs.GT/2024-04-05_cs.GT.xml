      <title>Learning to Bid in Forward Electricity Markets Using a No-Regret Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a common practice in the current literature of electricity markets to use game-theoretic approaches for strategic price bidding. However, they generally rely on the assumption that the strategic bidders have prior knowledge of rival bids, either perfectly or with some uncertainty. This is not necessarily a realistic assumption. This paper takes a different approach by relaxing such an assumption and exploits a no-regret learning algorithm for repeated games. In particular, by using the \emph{a posteriori} information about rivals' bids, a learner can implement a no-regret algorithm to optimize her/his decision making. Given this information, we utilize a multiplicative weight-update algorithm, adapting bidding strategies over multiple rounds of an auction to minimize her/his regret. Our numerical results show that when the proposed learning approach is used the social cost and the market-clearing prices can be higher than those corresponding to the classical game-theoretic approaches. The takeaway for market regulators is that electricity markets might be exposed to greater market power of suppliers than what classical analysis shows.</description>

      <title>A Reduction from Multi-Parameter to Single-Parameter Bayesian Contract Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main result of this paper is an almost approximation-preserving polynomial-time reduction from the most general multi-parameter Bayesian contract design (BCD) to single-parameter BCD. That is, for any multi-parameter BCD instance $I^M$, we construct a single-parameter instance $I^S$ such that any $\beta$-approximate contract (resp. menu of contracts) of $I^S$ can in turn be converted to a $(\beta -\epsilon)$-approximate contract (resp. menu of contracts) of $I^M$. The reduction is in time polynomial in the input size and $\log(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$; moreover, when $\beta = 1$ (i.e., the given single-parameter solution is exactly optimal), the dependence on $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ can be removed, leading to a polynomial-time exact reduction. This efficient reduction is somewhat surprising because in the closely related problem of Bayesian mechanism design, a polynomial-time reduction from multi-parameter to single-parameter setting is believed to not exist. Our result demonstrates the intrinsic difficulty of addressing moral hazard in Bayesian contract design, regardless of being single-parameter or multi-parameter.
  As byproducts, our reduction answers two open questions in recent literature of algorithmic contract design: (a) it implies that optimal contract design in single-parameter BCD is not in APX unless P=NP even when the agent's type distribution is regular, answering the open question of [Alon et al. 2021] in the negative; (b) it implies that the principal's (order-wise) tight utility gap between using a menu of contracts and a single contract is $\Theta(n)$ where $n$ is the number of actions, answering the major open question of [Guruganesh et al. 2021] for the single-parameter case.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Teacher-Student Curriculum Learning through the Cooperative Mechanics of Experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Teacher-Student Curriculum Learning (TSCL) is a curriculum learning framework that draws inspiration from human cultural transmission and learning. It involves a teacher algorithm shaping the learning process of a learner algorithm by exposing it to controlled experiences. Despite its success, understanding the conditions under which TSCL is effective remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a data-centric perspective to analyze the underlying mechanics of the teacher-student interactions in TSCL. We leverage cooperative game theory to describe how the composition of the set of experiences presented by the teacher to the learner, as well as their order, influences the performance of the curriculum that is found by TSCL approaches. To do so, we demonstrate that for every TSCL problem, there exists an equivalent cooperative game, and several key components of the TSCL framework can be reinterpreted using game-theoretic principles. Through experiments covering supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and classical games, we estimate the cooperative values of experiences and use value-proportional curriculum mechanisms to construct curricula, even in cases where TSCL struggles. The framework and experimental setup we present in this work represent a novel foundation for a deeper exploration of TSCL, shedding light on its underlying mechanisms and providing insights into its broader applicability in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Stability theory of game-theoretic group feature explanations for machine learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.10878v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study feature attributions of Machine Learning (ML) models originating from linear game values and coalitional values defined as operators on appropriate functional spaces. The main focus is on random games based on the conditional and marginal expectations. The first part of our work formulates a stability theory for these explanation operators by establishing certain bounds for both marginal and conditional explanations. The differences between the two games are then elucidated, such as showing that the marginal explanations can become discontinuous on some naturally-designed domains, while the conditional explanations remain stable. In the second part of our work, group explanation methodologies are devised based on game values with coalition structure, where the features are grouped based on dependencies. We show analytically that grouping features this way has a stabilizing effect on the marginal operator on both group and individual levels, and allows for the unification of marginal and conditional explanations. Our results are verified in a number of numerical experiments where an information-theoretic measure of dependence is used for grouping.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Persuasion Through Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a Bayesian persuasion problem where a sender wants to persuade a receiver to take a binary action, such as purchasing a product. The sender is informed about the (binary) state of the world, such as whether the quality of the product is high or low, but only has limited information about the receiver's beliefs and utilities. Motivated by customer surveys, user studies, and recent advances in generative AI, we allow the sender to learn more about the receiver by querying an oracle that simulates the receiver's behavior. After a fixed number of queries, the sender commits to a messaging policy and the receiver takes the action that maximizes her expected utility given the message she receives. We characterize the sender's optimal messaging policy given any distribution over receiver types. We then design a polynomial-time querying algorithm that optimizes the sender's expected utility in this Bayesian persuasion game. We also consider approximate oracles, more general query structures, and costly queries.</description>

      <title>Cardinal-Utility Matching Markets: The Quest for Envy-Freeness, Pareto-Optimality, and Efficient Computability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08851v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike ordinal-utility matching markets, which are well-developed from the viewpoint of both theory and practice, recent insights from a computer science perspective have left cardinal-utility matching markets in a state of flux. The celebrated pricing-based mechanism for one-sided cardinal-utility matching markets due to Hylland and Zeckhauser, which had long eluded efficient algorithms, was finally shown to be intractable; the problem of computing an approximate equilibrium is PPAD-complete.
  This led us to ask the question: is there an alternative, polynomial time, mechanism for one-sided cardinal-utility matching markets which achieves the desirable properties of HZ, i.e.\ (ex-ante) envy-freeness (EF) and Pareto-optimality (PO)? In this paper we show:
  1. The problem of finding an EF+PO lottery in a one-sided cardinal-utility matching market is PPAD-complete.
  2. A $(2 + \epsilon)$-approximately envy-free and (exactly) Pareto-optimal lottery can be found in polynomial time using Nash bargaining. Moreover, the resulting mechanism is $(2 + \epsilon)$-approximately incentive compatible.
  We also present several results on two-sided cardinal-utility matching markets, including non-existence of EF+PO lotteries as well as existence of justified-envy-free and weak Pareto-optimal lotteries.</description>
