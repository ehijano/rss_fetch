      <title>LEGATO: Large-scale End-to-end Generalizable Approach to Typeset OMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Legato, a new end-to-end transformer model for optical music recognition (OMR). Legato is the first large-scale pretrained OMR model capable of recognizing full-page or multi-page typeset music scores and the first to generate documents in ABC notation, a concise, human-readable format for symbolic music. Bringing together a pretrained vision encoder with an ABC decoder trained on a dataset of more than 214K images, our model exhibits the strong ability to generalize across various typeset scores. We conduct experiments on a range of datasets and demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. Given the lack of a standardized evaluation for end-to-end OMR, we comprehensively compare our model against the previous state of the art using a diverse set of metrics.</description>

      <title>Video Compression for Spatiotemporal Earth System Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale Earth system datasets, from high-resolution remote sensing imagery to spatiotemporal climate model outputs, exhibit characteristics analogous to those of standard videos. Their inherent spatial, temporal, and spectral redundancies can thus be readily exploited by established video compression techniques. Here, we present xarrayvideo, a Python library for compressing multichannel spatiotemporal datasets by encoding them as videos. Our approach achieves compression ratios of up to 250x while maintaining high fidelity by leveraging standard, well-optimized video codecs through ffmpeg. We demonstrate the library's effectiveness on four real-world multichannel spatiotemporal datasets: DynamicEarthNet (very high resolution Planet images), DeepExtremeCubes (high resolution Sentinel-2 images), ERA5 (weather reanalysis data), and the SimpleS2 dataset (high resolution multichannel Sentinel-2 images), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNRs) of 55.86, 40.60, 46.58, and 43.23 dB at 0.1 bits per pixel per band (bpppb) and 65.91, 54.28, 62.90, and 55.04 dB at 1 bpppb. We are redistributing two of these datasets, DeepExtremeCubes (2.3 Tb) and DynamicEarthNet (525 Gb), in the machine-learning-ready and cloud-ready TACO format through HuggingFace at significantly reduced sizes (270 Gb and 8.5 Gb, respectively) without compromising quality (PSNR 55.77-56.65 and 60.15). No performance loss is observed when the compressed versions of these datasets are used in their respective deep learning-based downstream tasks (next step reflectance prediction and landcover segmentation). In conclusion, xarrayvideo presents an efficient solution for handling the rapidly growing size of Earth observation datasets, making advanced compression techniques accessible and practical to the Earth science community.

      <title>Metrics to Detect Small-Scale and Large-Scale Citation Orchestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19219v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Citation counts and related metrics have pervasive uses and misuses in academia and research appraisal, serving as scholarly influence and recognition measures. Hence, comprehending the citation patterns exhibited by authors is essential for assessing their research impact and contributions within their respective fields. Although the h-index, introduced by Hirsch in 2005, has emerged as a popular bibliometric indicator, it fails to account for the intricate relationships between authors and their citation patterns. This limitation becomes particularly relevant in cases where citations are strategically employed to boost the perceived influence of certain individuals or groups, a phenomenon that we term "orchestration". Orchestrated citations can introduce biases in citation rankings and therefore necessitate the identification of such patterns. Here, we use Scopus data to investigate orchestration of citations across all scientific disciplines. Orchestration could be small-scale, when the author him/herself and/or a small number of other authors use citations strategically to boost citation metrics like h-index; or large-scale, where extensive collaborations among many co-authors lead to high h-index for many/all of them. We propose three orchestration indicators: extremely low values in the ratio of citations over the square of the h-index (indicative of small-scale orchestration); extremely small number of authors who can explain at least 50% of an author's total citations (indicative of either small-scale or large-scale orchestration); and extremely large number of co-authors with more than 50 co-authored papers (indicative of large-scale orchestration). The distributions, potential thresholds based on 1% (and 5%) percentiles, and insights from these indicators are explored and put into perspective across science.</description>

      <title>Rich Interoperable Metadata for Cultural Heritage Projects at Jagiellonian University</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rich metadata created nowadays for objects stored in libraries has nowhere to be stored, because core standards, namely MARC 21 and Dublin Core, are not flexible enough. The aim of this paper is to summarize our work-in-progress on tackling this problem in research on cultural heritage objects at the Jagiellonian University (JU). We compared the objects' metadata currently being collected at the JU (with examples of manuscript, placard, and obituary) with five widespread metadata standards used by the cultural heritage community: Dublin Core, EAD, MODS, EDM and Digital Scriptorium. Our preliminary results showed that mapping between them is indeed problematic, but we identified requirements that should be followed in further work on the JU cultural heritage metadata schema in order to achieve maximum interoperability. As we move forward, based on the successive versions of the conceptual model, we will conduct experiments to validate the practical feasibility of these mappings and the degree to which the proposed model will actually enable integration with data in these various metadata formats.</description>

      <title>Unfolding the Past: A Comprehensive Deep Learning Approach to Analyzing Incunabula Pages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed a proof-of-concept method for the automatic analysis of the structure and content of incunabula pages. A custom dataset comprising 500 annotated pages from five different incunabula was created using resources from the Jagiellonian Digital Library. Each page was manually labeled with five predefined classes: Text, Title, Picture, Table, and Handwriting. Additionally, the publicly available DocLayNet dataset was utilized as supplementary training data. To perform object detection, YOLO11n and YOLO11s models were employed and trained using two strategies: a combined dataset (DocLayNet and the custom dataset) and the custom dataset alone. The highest performance (F1 = 0.94) was achieved by the YOLO11n model trained exclusively on the custom data. Optical character recognition was then conducted on regions classified as Text, using both Tesseract and Kraken OCR, with Tesseract demonstrating superior results. Subsequently, image classification was applied to the Picture class using a ResNet18 model, achieving an accuracy of 98.7% across five subclasses: Decorative_letter, Illustration, Other, Stamp, and Wrong_detection. Furthermore, the CLIP model was utilized to generate semantic descriptions of illustrations. The results confirm the potential of machine learning in the analysis of early printed books, while emphasizing the need for further advancements in OCR performance and visual content interpretation.</description>

      <title>Large language models for automated scholarly paper review: A survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted human society, influencing various domains. Among them, academia is not simply a domain affected by LLMs, but it is also the pivotal force in the development of LLMs. In academic publication, this phenomenon is represented during the incorporation of LLMs into the peer review mechanism for reviewing manuscripts. LLMs hold transformative potential for the full-scale implementation of automated scholarly paper review (ASPR), but they also pose new issues and challenges that need to be addressed. In this survey paper, we aim to provide a holistic view of ASPR in the era of LLMs. We begin with a survey to find out which LLMs are used to conduct ASPR. Then, we review what ASPR-related technological bottlenecks have been solved with the incorporation of LLM technology. After that, we move on to explore new methods, new datasets, new source code, and new online systems that come with LLMs for ASPR. Furthermore, we summarize the performance and issues of LLMs in ASPR, and investigate the attitudes and reactions of publishers and academia to ASPR. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions associated with the development of LLMs for ASPR. This survey serves as an inspirational reference for the researchers and can promote the progress of ASPR for its actual implementation.</description>
