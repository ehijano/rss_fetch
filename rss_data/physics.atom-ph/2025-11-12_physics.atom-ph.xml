      <title>Dual Magnetic and Electric Dipole Symmetry: Pseudo Angular Momentum in Parity Space and the Electric Land\'e $g$-Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EDMs probe fundamental symmetries and underpin BSM searches. We give a symmetry-based description, analogous to the Zeeman effect, that puts magnetic and electric dipoles on equal footing under EM duality. In hydrogen, $\vec B$ (pseudovector) couples to $\hat{\vec J}$ and reduces $SO(4)$ to $SO(2)$ generated by $\hat J_z$. A static $\vec E$ (polar) couples within a fixed $n$ to a scaled Runge-Lenz operator $\hat{\vec A}_{\rm sc}$, mixes parities, and preserves $SO(2)\times SO(2)$ generated by $\hat J_z$ and $\hat A_{{\rm sc},z}$. This motivates a pseudo-angular momentum $\hat{\vec J}_p$ built from $\hat{\vec A}_{\rm sc}$ and a Land\'e factor $g_E$, so the orbital dipole is $\hat{\vec d}_{\rm orb}=g_E d_B \hat{\vec J}_p/\hbar$, with $d_B=ea_0=2\mu_B/(c\alpha)$. Stark mixing of $2s$ and $2p_{m=0}$ gives $|\langle d_{\rm orb}\rangle|=3d_B$ ($g_E=3$). Following Ohanian's magnetisation formalism, we construct its electric dual: the microscopic polarisation $\vec P$ has nonzero curl, defining a magnetic probability current $\vec J_m=-\epsilon_0^{-1}\nabla\times\vec P$, and the EDM expectation is $\langle \hat{\vec d}_{\rm tot}\rangle=-\frac{\epsilon_0}{2}\int \vec r\times \vec J_m\, d^3r=d_B\big[g_E\langle \hat{\vec J}_p\rangle/\hbar+g_E^{e}\langle \hat{\vec S}\rangle/\hbar\big]$, with $g_E^{e}=2d_{\rm int}/d_B$. Here $\hat{\vec S}$ encodes any intrinsic EDM $d_{\rm int}$, while $\hat{\vec J}_p$ captures the Stark-induced pseudo-angular momentum from Runge-Lenz symmetry. The dual framework shows that induced EDMs arise from circulating magnetic probability currents, mirroring magnetic dipoles from circulating electric probability currents.</description>

      <title>Cold-atom fountain for atom-surface interaction measurements mediated by a near-resonant evanescent light field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold atomic ensembles offer precise tools for probing near-field interactions, yet experimental data linking atom dynamics to surface-induced forces remains limited. This study investigated the interaction between atoms and a dielectric surface using an atomic fountain measurement technique, in which cold rubidium atoms were released from a moving optical dipole trap. The launched cold atoms were irradiated with an evanescent light detuned from the D$_2$ transition by $-$20.2 to $+$20.2 MHz, after which they were recaptured by reactivating the optical dipole trap. Our measurements revealed that the number of recaptured atoms decreased with increasing flight time, and the decay was suppressed under blue-detuned conditions. We modeled the motion dynamics of the cold atomic ensemble, incorporating Casimir-Polder interactions between the dielectric surface and cold atoms, and observed that the rate of decrease in the number of residual atoms depended on the value of the van der Waals potential coefficient $C_3$. The calculation results demonstrated good agreement with the experimental results, allowing us to estimate $C_3 = 5.6^{+2.4}_{-1.9} \times 10^{-49}$ Jm$^3$ by comparing simulations with the experimental results across various $C_3$ values, accounting for experimental errors.</description>

      <title>Two-loop electron self-energy in bound-electron $g$ factor: diagrams in momentum-coordinate representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-loop electron self-energy correction is one of the most problematic QED effects and, for a long time, was the dominant source of uncertainty in the theoretical prediction of the bound-electron $g$ factor in hydrogen-like ions. A major breakthrough was recently achieved in [B. Sikora et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 123001 (2025)], where this effect was calculated without any expansion in the nuclear binding strength parameter $Z\alpha$ (where $Z$ is the nuclear charge number and $\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant). In this paper, we describe our calculations of one of the most difficult parts of the two-loop self-energy, represented by Feynman diagrams that are treated in the mixed momentum-coordinate representation.</description>

      <title>A Compact Dual-Beam Zeeman Slower for High-Flux Cold Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a compact design of dual-beam Zeeman slower optimized for efficient production of cold atom applications. Traditional single-beam configurations face challenges from substantial residual atomic flux impacting downstream optical windows, resulting in increased system size, atomic deposition contamination, and a reduced operational lifetime. Our approach employs two oblique laser beams and a capillary-array collimation system to address these challenges while maintaining efficient deceleration. For rubidium ($^{87}$Rb), simulations demonstrate a significant increase in the fraction of atoms captured by a two-dimensional magneto-optical trap (2D-MOT) and nearly eliminate atom-induced contamination probability at optical windows, all within a compact Zeeman slower length of 44 cm. Experimental validation with Rb and Yb demonstrates highly efficient atomic loading within the same compact design. This advancement represents a substantial improvement for high-flux cold atom applications, providing reliable performance for high-precision metrology, quantum computation and simulation.</description>

      <title>Excited $\Sigma$ states of the hydrogen-antihydrogen molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adopting explicitly correlated Kolos-Wolniewicz-type basis functions, the Born-Oppenheimer potential curves of a number of excited $\Sigma$ states of the hydrogen-antihydrogen system ($\bar{\rm H}$) were calculated for both, even and odd, Q symmetries, including also free positronium states. It is demonstrated that the excited leptonic states support ro-vibrational states with energies close to the ground-state dissociation threshold. As a consequence, the excited leptonic states need to be considered in theoretical treatments of ground-state H-$\bar{\mathrm{H}}$ collisions.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic source of atomic tritium for precision spectroscopy and neutrino-mass measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a concept for a cryogenic source of atomic tritium at sub-kelvin temperatures and energies suitable for magnetic trapping. The source is based on the dissociation of solid molecular tritium films below 1 K by electrons from a pulsed RF discharge, a technique recently demonstrated for atomic hydrogen, combined with buffer-gas cooling and magnetic confinement. We analyze the key processes limiting the source performance, adsorption, spin exchange and recombination, and show that atomic tritium fluxes exceeding 1e15 per second at kinetic energies of 100 mK can be achieved at the entrance of a magnetic trap. Such a source would enable Doppler-free two-photon 1S-2S spectroscopy in atomic tritium for high-precision measurements of the triton charge radius, provid- ing a crucial benchmark for bound-state QED and improving the comparison between electronic, muonic, and scattering determinations of nuclear sizes in light systems. Beyond spectroscopy, an atomic tritium source avoids molecular final-state broadening in beta-decay and is therefore neces- sary for next-generation neutrino-mass measurements; combined with detector technologies such as sub-eV resolution quantum sensors or cyclotron radiation emission spectroscopy, it enables order-of- magnitude improvement compared to the current KATRIN sensitivity, reaching sensitivities below the inverted ordering regime. Additionally, the source can be used to generate a beam of low- field-seeking deuterium atoms for loading magnetic traps, an important benchmark before trapping tritium atoms and useful for precision spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Quantum Calculations of the Cavity Shift in Electron Magnetic Moment Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The measurement of the anomalous electron magnetic moment $g-2$ through quantum transitions of a single trapped electron is the most stringent test of quantum field theory. These experiments are now so precise that they must account for the effects of the cavity containing the electron. Classical calculations of this "cavity shift" must subtract the electron's divergent self-field, and thus require knowledge of the exact Green's function for the cavity's electromagnetic field. We perform the first fully quantum calculation of the cavity shift in a closed cavity, which instead involves subtracting linearly divergent cavity mode sums and integrals. Using contour integration methods, we find perfect agreement with existing classical results for both spherical and cylindrical cavities, justifying their current use. Moreover, our mode-based results can be naturally generalized to account for systematic effects, necessary to push future measurements to the next order of magnitude in precision.</description>

      <title>Nuclear spin relaxation in zero- to ultralow-field magnetic resonance spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear-magnetic-resonance experiments can interrogate a broad spectrum of molecular-tumbling regimes and can accurately measure interatomic distances in solution with sub-nanometer resolution. In the zero- to ultralow-field (ZULF) regime, population and coherence decay reveal nontrivial behavior due to strong coupling between nuclear spins. We note, in particular, the surprising effects that different resonances show different relaxation rates, depending on (i) the (pre)polarizing magnet field and the shuttling trajectory to the detection region at nano- and microtesla fields, (ii) the strength of the measurement field, (iii) the detection method (single-channel or quadrature), and even (iv) the nutation angle induced by the excitation pulse. We describe herein experimental data of relaxation rates measured for a 13C-labeled formic acid sample, with an atomic-magnetometer-based ZULF setup, and develop a theoretical framework to explain the detected effects and extract molecular properties. The observed effects could be used for spectral assignment, for the establishment of specific motional regimes, for image contrast, and for the characterization of relaxation processes at nano- to microtesla magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Sub-Doppler cooling, state preparation, and optical trapping of a triel atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultracold gases of atoms from Main Group III (Group 13) of the Periodic Table, also known as "triel elements," have great potential for a new generation of quantum matter experiments. The first magneto-optical trap of a triel element (indium) was recently realized, but more progress is needed before a triel is ready for modern ultracold quantum science experiments in optical traps. Reaching this regime typically requires atoms that are cooled to the 10 uK level or below, prepared in pure quantum states, and confined in a laser field. Here we report the achievement of all three of these milestones in atomic indium. First, we perform polarization gradient cooling of an indium gas to 15 uK. Second, we spin polarize the gas into a single hyperfine sublevel of either the $5P_{1/2}$ indium ground state or the $5P_{3/2}$ metastable state. Third, we trap indium in a 1064 nm optical lattice, achieving a 3 s trap lifetime. With these results, indium is now a candidate for a next generation quantum research platform.</description>

      <title>CaF+CaF interactions in the ground and excited electronic states: implications for collisional losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate \textit{ab initio} potential energy surfaces are essential to understand and predict collisional outcomes in ultracold molecular systems. In this study, we explore the intermolecular interactions between two laser-cooled CaF molecules, both in their ground and excited electronic states, aiming to understand the mechanisms behind the observed collisional losses on the non-reactive, spin-polarized surface of the CaF+CaF system. Using state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} methods, we compute twelve electronic states of the Ca$_2$F$_2$ complex within the rigid rotor approximation applied to CaF. Calculating the potential energy surfaces for the excited electronic states of Ca$_2$F$_2$ is challenging and computationally expensive. Our approach employs the multireference configuration interaction method, restricted to single and double excitations, along with a reasonably large active space to ensure the convergence in the excited states. We also compute the spin-orbit coupling between the ground state and the lowest spin-polarized triplet state, as well as the spin-spin coupling within the lowest triplet state (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$. Additionally, we determine the electric transition dipole moments for the (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$-(2) $^3\mathrm{A}'$ and (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$-(1) $^3\mathrm{A}''$ transitions. Notably, we find that the lowest spin-polarized state (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$, shifted by 1064 nm of laser light from the optical dipole trap, intersects several electronically excited states. Finally, by analyzing the potential energy surfaces, we discuss two plausible pathways that may account for the observed collisional losses on the spin-polarized surface of the CaF+CaF system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17997v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms efficiently link photons between the radio-frequency (RF) and optical domains. They furnish a medium in which the presence of an RF field imprints on the transmission of a probe laser beam by altering the coherent coupling between atomic quantum states. The immutable atomic energy structure underpins quantum-metrological RF field measurements and has driven intensive efforts to realize inherently self-calibrated sensing devices. Here we investigate spectroscopic signatures owing to the angular momentum quantization of the atomic states utilized in an electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) sensing scheme for linearly polarized RF fields. Specific combinations of atomic terms are shown to give rise to universal, distinctive fingerprints in the detected optical fields upon rotating the RF field polarization. Using a dressed state picture, we identify two types of atomic angular momentum ladders that display strikingly disparate spectroscopic signatures, including the complementary absence or presence of a central spectral EIT peak. Our study adds important insights into the prospects of Rydberg atomic gases for quantum metrological electric field characterization. In particular, it calls into question prevailing interpretations of SI-traceable Rydberg atom electrometers.</description>

      <title>Strong Confinement of a Nanodiamond in a Needle Paul Trap: Towards Matter-Wave Interferometry with Massive Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics (QM) and General relativity (GR), also known as the theory of gravity, are the two pillars of modern physics. A matter-wave interferometer with a massive particle, can test numerous fundamental ideas, including the spatial superposition principle - a foundational concept in QM - in completely new regimes, as well as the interface between QM and GR, e.g., testing the quantization of gravity. Consequently, there exists an intensive effort to realize such an interferometer. While several paths are being pursued, we focus on utilizing nanodiamonds as our particle, and a spin embedded in the nanodiamond together with Stern-Gerlach forces, to achieve a closed loop in space-time. There is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We are posting this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to highlight our plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor, hoping this will support this growing community. In this work, we achieve strong confinement of a levitated particle, which is crucial for angular confinement, precise positioning, and perhaps also advantageous for deep cooling. We designed a needle Paul trap with a controllable distance between the electrodes, giving rise to a strong electric gradient. By combining it with an effective charging method - electrospray - we reach a trap frequency of up to 40 kHz, which is more than twice the state of the art. We believe that the designed trap could become a significant tool in the hands of the community working towards massive matter-wave interferometry. We would be happy to make more details available upon request.</description>
