      <title>Graph Neural Network-Based Topology Optimization for Self-Supporting Structures in Additive Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning-based framework for topology optimization of self-supporting structures, specifically tailored for additive manufacturing (AM). By employing a graph neural network (GNN) that acts as a neural field over the finite element mesh, the framework effectively learns and predicts continuous material distributions. An integrated AM filter ensures printability by eliminating unsupported overhangs, while the optimization process minimizes structural compliance under volume and stress constraints. The stress constraint is enforced using a differentiable p-norm aggregation of von Mises stress, promoting mechanical reliability in the optimized designs. A key advantage of the approach lies in its fully differentiable architecture, which leverages automatic differentiation throughout the optimization loop--eliminating the need for explicit sensitivity derivation for both the filter and the stress constraint. Numerical experiments demonstrate the ability of the framework to generate stress-constrained manufacturable topologies under various loading and boundary conditions, offering a practical pathway toward AM-ready high-performance designs with reduced post-processing requirements.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio Quantum Transport with the GW Approximation, 42,240 Atoms, and Sustained Exascale Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing nanoscale electronic devices such as the currently manufactured nanoribbon field-effect transistors (NRFETs) requires advanced modeling tools capturing all relevant quantum mechanical effects. State-of-the-art approaches combine the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism and density functional theory (DFT). However, as device dimensions do not exceed a few nanometers anymore, electrons are confined in ultra-small volumes, giving rise to strong electron-electron interactions. To account for these critical effects, DFT+NEGF solvers should be extended with the GW approximation, which massively increases their computational intensity. Here, we present the first implementation of the NEGF+GW scheme capable of handling NRFET geometries with dimensions comparable to experiments. This package, called QuaTrEx, makes use of a novel spatial domain decomposition scheme, can treat devices made of up to 84,480 atoms, scales very well on the Alps and Frontier supercomputers (&gt;80% weak scaling efficiency), and sustains an exascale FP64 performance on 42,240 atoms (1.15 Eflop/s).</description>

      <title>A Spline-Based Stress Function Approach for the Principle of Minimum Complementary Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In computational engineering, ensuring the integrity and safety of structures in fields such as aerospace and civil engineering relies on accurate stress prediction. However, analytical methods are limited to simple test cases, and displacement-based finite element methods (FEMs), while commonly used, require a large number of unknowns to achieve high accuracy; stress-based numerical methods have so far failed to provide a simple and effective alternative. This work aims to develop a novel numerical approach that overcomes these limitations by enabling accurate stress prediction with improved flexibility for complex geometries and boundary conditions and fewer degrees of freedom (DOFs). The proposed method is based on a spline-based stress function formulation for the principle of minimum complementary energy, which we apply to plane, linear elastostatics. The method is first validated against analytical solutions and then tested on two test cases challenging for current state-of-the-art numerical schemes, a bi-layer cantilever with anisotropic material behavior, and a cantilever with a non-prismatic, parabolic-shaped beam geometry. Results demonstrate that our approach, unlike analytical methods, can be easily applied to general geometries and boundary conditions, and achieves stress accuracy comparable to that reported in the literature for displacement-based FEMs, while requiring significantly fewer DOFs. This novel spline-based stress function approach thus provides an efficient and flexible tool for accurate stress prediction, with promising applications in structural analysis and numerical design.</description>
