      <title>Monte Carlo algorithm for calculating pre-neutron fragment mass and kinetic energy distributions from measurements using the 2E Technique for reaction 235U(nth, f)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An algorithm is proposed that enables the calculation of pre-neutron mass and energy distributions of fission fragments from uranium-235, induced by thermal neutrons, utilizing measurements obtained through the 2E technique. This algorithm facilitates the inference of the curve representing the average multiplicity of prompt neutrons relative to the pre-neutron mass of the fission fragments.</description>

      <title>Design and Integration of JUNO-OSIRIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is a neutrino detection experiment characterized by an acrylic sphere, measuring 35.4 m in diameter, containing 20,000 tons of liquid scintillator. This sphere is encompassed by as many as 17,600 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) with a 20-inch diameter, achieving an overall coverage of 77.9%. With these impressive capabilities, the JUNO experiment aims to achieve an exceptional effective energy resolution of 3% at 1 MeV. The Online Scintillator Internal Radioactivity Investigation System (OSIRIS) serves as a precursor detector, around 100 m aside in horizontal of the site of the JUNO detector underground, tasked with monitoring and examining the purity of the liquid scintillator prior to its transfer to the JUNO central detector. The OSIRIS, also as a pre-detector of JUNO, is constructed with a cylindrical acrylic vessel designed to hold 18 tons of liquid scintillator. It is situated within a 9-m height cylindrical tank filled with 550 tons of pure water. This detector was specifically engineered to search for the fast coincidence decays of $^{214}$Bi -$^{214}$Po and $^{212}$Bi -$^{212}$Po in the decay chains of $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th, respectively.OSIRIS has been designed to reach a sensitivity of 10$^{-16}$ g/g for U/Th to test scintillator radiopurity to the level required for the detection of solar neutrinos. Additionally, 64 20-inch microchannel plate PMTs (MCP PMTs) were positioned around the liquid scintillator vessel to observe incoming interactions, along with an additional 12 20-inch MCP PMTs for the water Cherenkov muon veto system. The OSIRIS pre-detector has been fully constructed and integrated, providing a plenty of preliminary results from the air runs. The next step in the process involves commencing the filling soon, aiming to involve an in-depth examination of the impurities within the liquid scintillator.</description>

      <title>On the development of an RFSoC-based ultra-fast Phasemeter with GHz bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise measurements of the frequency and phase of an electrical or optical signal play a key role in various branches of science and engineering. Tracking changing laser frequencies is specifically demanding when the lasers themselves are noisy or if the frequencies rapidly change because they encode highly dynamic signals in, e.g., Doppler-ranging or dynamic cavity readout. Here, we report the development of a high signal bandwidth (&gt; 2 GHz) and high tracking bandwidth (2 MHz) multi-channel Phasemeter. The implementation utilizes an all-digital phase-locked loop realized within the field programmable gate array (FPGA) part of a Radio Frequency System-on-Chip (RFSoC), the programmable logic. We present performance measurements, discuss the role of the high tracking bandwidth for tracking highly dynamic signals, and demonstrate ultra-stable phase locking of a beat note between two widely tunable external cavity diode lasers. We achieve a phase-noise floor in the sub-milli radian regime, even for GHz signals, and demonstrate stable tracking of signals with a frequency change rate of 240 GHz/s.</description>

      <title>Calibrating coordinate system alignment in a scanning transmission electron microscope using a digital twin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D STEM) a focused beam is scanned over a specimen and a diffraction pattern is recorded at each position using a pixelated detector. During the experiment, it must be ensured that the scan coordinate system of the beam is correctly calibrated relative to the detector coordinate system. Various simplified and approximate models are used implicitly and explicitly for understanding and analyzing the recorded data, requiring translation between the physical reality of the instrument and the abstractions used in data interpretation. Here, we introduce a calibration method where interactive live data processing in combination with a digital twin is used to match a set of models and their parameters with the action of a real-world instrument.</description>

      <title>Fault Localization in a Microfabricated Surface Ion Trap using Diamond Nitrogen-Vacancy Center Magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computing hardware becomes more complex with ongoing design innovations and growing capabilities, the quantum computing community needs increasingly powerful techniques for fabrication failure root-cause analysis. This is especially true for trapped-ion quantum computing. As trapped-ion quantum computing aims to scale to thousands of ions, the electrode numbers are growing to several hundred with likely integrated-photonic components also adding to the electrical and fabrication complexity, making faults even harder to locate. In this work, we used a high-resolution quantum magnetic imaging technique, based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, to investigate short-circuit faults in an ion trap chip. We imaged currents from these short-circuit faults to ground and compared to intentionally-created faults, finding that the root-cause of the faults was failures in the on-chip trench capacitors. This work, where we exploited the performance advantages of a quantum magnetic sensing technique to troubleshoot a piece of quantum computing hardware, is a unique example of the evolving synergy between emerging quantum technologies to achieve capabilities that were previously inaccessible.</description>

      <title>Aberration compensation for the anamorphic triplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compensation of the generalized spherical aberrations is discussed for the plane-symmetric and anamorphic optical systems. The compensation rules are derived for an economical three-component double-plane symmetric system containing two cylindrical mirrors and one toroidal lens. Anamorphic systems, which provide large magnifications in the two orthogonal directions, are presented.</description>
