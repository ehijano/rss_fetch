      <title>From Safeguards Application to Fundamental Physics: Advancements in Reactor Neutrino Detection with the {\nu}-Angra Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operating on a surface with high noise rates and requiring susceptible, yet small-scale detectors, the Neutrinos-Angra detector is an excellent platform for technological development and expertise in new detection methods. This report details the primary features of the detector, the electronics involved, and preliminary physics results from the operational phase, particularly the ON-OFF analysis comparing the signals with the reactor in operation (ON) and during the maintenance shut-down (OFF), demonstrating the detector's capability to monitor reactor activity. Additionally, we will briefly discuss the prospects of using a cryogenic calorimeter to detect neutrinos via Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CEvNS), highlighting potential advancements in neutrino detection technology. Looking ahead, the project promises to play a crucial role in the integration of Latin American scientists and engineers into global scientific collaborations, significantly contributing to the LASF4RI and the broader HECAP strategic framework.</description>

      <title>MP-You: A Web-based MPI Simulation Tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is an emerging imaging technique with many applications and a very active field of research. This app provides users with the opportunity to develop some intuition about the inner workings of MPI as it is being researched through NIST's Thermal MagIC project in an interactive and fun way. Users can vary different experimental and post-processing parameters to see how the image quality and particle reconstruction changes for different measurement conditions.</description>

      <title>TOF MLEM Adaptation for the Total-Body J-PET with a Realistic Analytical System Response Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02967v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a study of the original image reconstruction algorithm based on the time-of-flight maximum likelihood expectation maximisation (TOF MLEM), developed for the total-body (TB) Jagiellonian PET (J-PET) scanners. The method is applicable to generic cylindrical or modular multi-layer layouts and is extendable to multi-photon imaging. The system response matrix (SRM) is represented as a set of analytical functions, uniquely defined for each pair of plastic scintillator strips used for the detection. A realistic resolution model (RM) in detector space is derived from fitting the Monte Carlo simulated emissions and detections of annihilation photons on oblique transverse planes. Additional kernels embedded in SRM account for TOF, parallax effect and axial smearing. The algorithm was tested on datasets, simulated in GATE for the NEMA IEC and static XCAT phantoms inside a 24-module 2-layer TB J-PET. Compared to the reference TOF MLEM with none or a shift-invariant RM, an improvement was observed, as evaluated by the analysis of image quality, difference images and ground truth metrics. We also reconstructed the data with additive contributions, pre-filtered geometrically and with non-TOF scatter correction applied. Despite some deterioration, the obtained results still capitalise on the realistic RM with better edge preservation and superior ground truth metrics. The envisioned prospects of the TOF MLEM with analytical SRM include its application in multi-photon imaging and further upgrade to account for the non-collinearity, positron range and other factors.</description>

      <title>Impact of E-plane Misalignment on THz Diagonal Horn Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in developing terahertz front-ends is achieving high coupling efficiency between the waveguide feed horn and the optical beam. In this paper, we have quantified the alignment requirements for the widely used E-plane split diagonal horn antenna through theoretical analysis, electromagnetic simulation, and experimental validation within the 325-500 GHz frequency range. The results from our analytical models, simulations, and measurements are consistent and shows good agreement. They reveal that even minor geometric asymmetries can cause significant increases in fractional power radiated to the cross-polar component due to amplitude and phase imbalances in the TE10 and TE01 modes. Furthermore, a misalignment of approximately 8% of the wavelength was observed to result in a 3-dB degradation in the optical coupling to a Gaussian beam (Gaussicity) in middle of the waveguide band. These findings highlight the critical importance of precise alignment and feed horn machining for the successful implementation of terahertz front-end systems.</description>

      <title>Use of current-potential patches to obtain fundamental improvements to the coils of magnetic fusion devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central issue in the design of tokamaks or stellarators is the coils that produce the external magnetic fields. The freedom that remains unstudied in the design of coils is enormous. This freedom could be quickly studied computationally at low cost with high reliability. In particular, the space between toroidal field or modular coils that block access to the plasma chamber could be increased by a large factor. This paper explains how this could be done using the concept of current-potential patches that was developed in Todd Elder's thesis.</description>

      <title>Improving the Accuracy of Temperature Measurement on TEM samples using Plasmon Energy Expansion Thermometry (PEET): Addressing Sample Thickness Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in analytical scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and microelectronic mechanical systems (MEMS) based microheaters have enabled in-situ materials characterization at the nanometer scale at elevated temperature. In addition to resolving the structural information at elevated temperatures, detailed knowledge of the local temperature distribution inside the sample is essential to reveal thermally induced phenomena and processes. Here, we investigate the accuracy of plasmon energy expansion thermometry (PEET) as a method to map the local temperature in a tungsten (W) lamella in a range between room temperature and 700 degC. In particular, we address the influence of sample thickness in the range of a typical electron-transparent TEM sample (from 30 nm to 70 nm) on the temperature-dependent plasmon energy. The shift in plasmon energy, used to determine the local sample temperature, is not only temperature-dependent, but in case of W also thickness-dependent in sample thicknesses below approximately 60 nm. The results highlight the importance of considering sample thickness (and especially thickness variations) when analyzing the local bulk plasmon energy for temperature measurement using PEET. However, in case of W, an increasing beam broadening (FWHM) of the bulk plasmon peak with decreasing sample thickness can be used to improve the accuracy of PEET in TEM lamellae with varying sample thickness.</description>
