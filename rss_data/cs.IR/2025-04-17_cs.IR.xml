      <title>PATFinger: Prompt-Adapted Transferable Fingerprinting against Unauthorized Multimodal Dataset Usage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11509v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multimodal datasets can be leveraged to pre-train large-scale vision-language models by providing cross-modal semantics. Current endeavors for determining the usage of datasets mainly focus on single-modal dataset ownership verification through intrusive methods and non-intrusive techniques, while cross-modal approaches remain under-explored. Intrusive methods can adapt to multimodal datasets but degrade model accuracy, while non-intrusive methods rely on label-driven decision boundaries that fail to guarantee stable behaviors for verification. To address these issues, we propose a novel prompt-adapted transferable fingerprinting scheme from a training-free perspective, called PATFinger, which incorporates the global optimal perturbation (GOP) and the adaptive prompts to capture dataset-specific distribution characteristics. Our scheme utilizes inherent dataset attributes as fingerprints instead of compelling the model to learn triggers. The GOP is derived from the sample distribution to maximize embedding drifts between different modalities. Subsequently, our PATFinger re-aligns the adaptive prompt with GOP samples to capture the cross-modal interactions on the carefully crafted surrogate model. This allows the dataset owner to check the usage of datasets by observing specific prediction behaviors linked to the PATFinger during retrieval queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme against unauthorized multimodal dataset usage on various cross-modal retrieval architectures by 30% over state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>RAID: An In-Training Defense against Attribute Inference Attacks in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In various networks and mobile applications, users are highly susceptible to attribute inference attacks, with particularly prevalent occurrences in recommender systems. Attackers exploit partially exposed user profiles in recommendation models, such as user embeddings, to infer private attributes of target users, such as gender and political views. The goal of defenders is to mitigate the effectiveness of these attacks while maintaining recommendation performance. Most existing defense methods, such as differential privacy and attribute unlearning, focus on post-training settings, which limits their capability of utilizing training data to preserve recommendation performance. Although adversarial training extends defenses to in-training settings, it often struggles with convergence due to unstable training processes. In this paper, we propose RAID, an in-training defense method against attribute inference attacks in recommender systems. In addition to the recommendation objective, we define a defensive objective to ensure that the distribution of protected attributes becomes independent of class labels, making users indistinguishable from attribute inference attacks. Specifically, this defensive objective aims to solve a constrained Wasserstein barycenter problem to identify the centroid distribution that makes the attribute indistinguishable while complying with recommendation performance constraints. To optimize our proposed objective, we use optimal transport to align users with the centroid distribution. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets to evaluate RAID. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of RAID and demonstrate its significant superiority over existing methods in multiple aspects.</description>

      <title>Improving LLM Interpretability and Performance via Guided Embedding Refinement for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fast development of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers growing opportunities to further improve sequential recommendation systems. Yet for some practitioners, integrating LLMs to their existing base recommendation systems raises questions about model interpretability, transparency and related safety. To partly alleviate challenges from these questions, we propose guided embedding refinement, a method that carries out a guided and interpretable usage of LLM to enhance the embeddings associated with the base recommendation system. Instead of directly using LLMs as the backbone of sequential recommendation systems, we utilize them as auxiliary tools to emulate the sales logic of recommendation and generate guided embeddings that capture domain-relevant semantic information on interpretable attributes. Benefiting from the strong generalization capabilities of the guided embedding, we construct refined embedding by using the guided embedding and reduced-dimension version of the base embedding. We then integrate the refined embedding into the recommendation module for training and inference. A range of numerical experiments demonstrate that guided embedding is adaptable to various given existing base embedding models, and generalizes well across different recommendation tasks. The numerical results show that the refined embedding not only improves recommendation performance, achieving approximately $10\%$ to $50\%$ gains in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Recall rate, and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), but also enhances interpretability, as evidenced by case studies.</description>

Abstract: Currently, large language models are gaining popularity, their achievements are used in many areas, ranging from text translation to generating answers to queries. However, the main problem with these new machine learning algorithms is that training such models requires large computing resources that only large IT companies have. To avoid this problem, a number of methods (LoRA, quantization) have been proposed so that existing models can be effectively fine-tuned for specific tasks. In this paper, we propose an E2E (end to end) audio summarization model using these techniques. In addition, this paper examines the effectiveness of these approaches to the problem under consideration and draws conclusions about the applicability of these methods.</description>

      <title>Rethinking LLM-Based Recommendations: A Query Generation-Based, Training-Free Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing large language model LLM-based recommendation methods face several challenges, including inefficiency in handling large candidate pools, sensitivity to item order within prompts ("lost in the middle" phenomenon) poor scalability, and unrealistic evaluation due to random negative sampling. To address these issues, we propose a Query-to-Recommendation approach that leverages LLMs to generate personalized queries for retrieving relevant items from the entire candidate pool, eliminating the need for candidate pre-selection. This method can be integrated into an ID-based recommendation system without additional training, enhances recommendation performance and diversity through LLMs' world knowledge, and performs well even for less popular item groups. Experiments on three datasets show up to 57 percent improvement, with an average gain of 31 percent, demonstrating strong zero-shot performance and further gains when ensembled with existing models.</description>

      <title>Generative Recommendation with Continuous-Token Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a significant trend toward using large language model (LLM)-based recommender systems (RecSys). Current research primarily focuses on representing complex user-item interactions within a discrete space to align with the inherent discrete nature of language models. However, this approach faces limitations due to its discrete nature: (i) information is often compressed during discretization; (ii) the tokenization and generation for the vast number of users and items in real-world scenarios are constrained by a limited vocabulary. Embracing continuous data presents a promising alternative to enhance expressive capabilities, though this approach is still in its early stages. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework, DeftRec, which incorporates \textbf{de}noising di\textbf{f}fusion models to enable LLM-based RecSys to seamlessly support continuous \textbf{t}oken as input and target. First, we introduce a robust tokenizer with a masking operation and an additive K-way architecture to index users and items, capturing their complex collaborative relationships into continuous tokens. Crucially, we develop a denoising diffusion model to process user preferences within continuous domains by conditioning on reasoning content from pre-trained large language model. During the denoising process, we reformulate the objective to include negative interactions, building a comprehensive understanding of user preferences for effective and accurate recommendation generation. Finally, given a continuous token as output, recommendations can be easily generated through score-based retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, showing that DeftRec surpasses competitive benchmarks, including both traditional and emerging LLM-based RecSys.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Compound Retrieval Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern retrieval systems do not rely on a single ranking model to construct their rankings. Instead, they generally take a cascading approach where a sequence of ranking models are applied in multiple re-ranking stages. Thereby, they balance the quality of the top-K ranking with computational costs by limiting the number of documents each model re-ranks. However, the cascading approach is not the only way models can interact to form a retrieval system.
  We propose the concept of compound retrieval systems as a broader class of retrieval systems that apply multiple prediction models. This encapsulates cascading models but also allows other types of interactions than top-K re-ranking. In particular, we enable interactions with large language models (LLMs) which can provide relative relevance comparisons. We focus on the optimization of compound retrieval system design which uniquely involves learning where to apply the component models and how to aggregate their predictions into a final ranking. This work shows how our compound approach can combine the classic BM25 retrieval model with state-of-the-art (pairwise) LLM relevance predictions, while optimizing a given ranking metric and efficiency target. Our experimental results show optimized compound retrieval systems provide better trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency than cascading approaches, even when applied in a self-supervised manner.
  With the introduction of compound retrieval systems, we hope to inspire the information retrieval field to more out-of-the-box thinking on how prediction models can interact to form rankings.</description>

      <title>Clarifying Ambiguities: on the Role of Ambiguity Types in Prompting Methods for Clarification Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In information retrieval (IR), providing appropriate clarifications to better understand users' information needs is crucial for building a proactive search-oriented dialogue system. Due to the strong in-context learning ability of large language models (LLMs), recent studies investigate prompting methods to generate clarifications using few-shot or Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts. However, vanilla CoT prompting does not distinguish the characteristics of different information needs, making it difficult to understand how LLMs resolve ambiguities in user queries. In this work, we focus on the concept of ambiguity for clarification, seeking to model and integrate ambiguities in the clarification process. To this end, we comprehensively study the impact of prompting schemes based on reasoning and ambiguity for clarification. The idea is to enhance the reasoning abilities of LLMs by limiting CoT to predict first ambiguity types that can be interpreted as instructions to clarify, then correspondingly generate clarifications. We name this new prompting scheme Ambiguity Type-Chain of Thought (AT-CoT). Experiments are conducted on various datasets containing human-annotated clarifying questions to compare AT-CoT with multiple baselines. We also perform user simulations to implicitly measure the quality of generated clarifications under various IR scenarios.</description>

      <title>From Conceptual Data Models to Multimodal Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 1) Introduction and Conceptual Framework: This document explores the concept of information design by dividing it into two major practices: defining the meaning of a corpus of textual data and its visual or multimodal representation. It draws on expertise in enriching textual corpora, particularly audiovisual ones, and transforming them into multiple narrative formats. The text highlights a crucial distinction between the semantic content of a domain and the modalities of its graphic expression, illustrating this approach with concepts rooted in structural semiotics and linguistics traditions.
  2) Modeling and Conceptual Design:  The article emphasizes the importance of semantic modeling, often achieved through conceptual networks or graphs. These tools enable the structuring of knowledge within a domain by accounting for relationships between concepts, contexts of use, and specific objectives. Stockinger also highlights the constraints and challenges involved in creating dynamic and adaptable models, integrating elements such as thesauri or interoperable ontologies to facilitate the analysis and publication of complex corpora.
  3) Applications and Multimodal Visualization:  The text concludes by examining the practical application of these models in work environments like OKAPI, developed to analyze, publish, and reuse audiovisual data. It also discusses innovative approaches such as visual storytelling and document reengineering, which involve transforming existing content into new resources tailored to various contexts. These methods emphasize interoperability, flexibility, and the intelligence of communication systems, paving the way for richer and more collaborative use of digital data. The content of this document was presented during the "Semiotics of Information Design" Day organized by Anne Beyaert-Geslin of the University of Bordeaux Montaigne (MICA laboratory) on June 21, 2018, in Bordeaux.</description>

      <title>A New Paradigm of User-Centric Wireless Communication Driven by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next generation of wireless communications seeks to deeply integrate artificial intelligence (AI) with user-centric communication networks, with the goal of developing AI-native networks that more accurately address user requirements. The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) offers significant potential in realizing these goals. However, existing efforts that leverage LLMs for wireless communication often overlook the considerable gap between human natural language and the intricacies of real-world communication systems, thus failing to fully exploit the capabilities of LLMs. To address this gap, we propose a novel LLM-driven paradigm for wireless communication that innovatively incorporates the nature language to structured query language (NL2SQL) tool. Specifically, in this paradigm, user personal requirements is the primary focus. Upon receiving a user request, LLMs first analyze the user intent in terms of relevant communication metrics and system parameters. Subsequently, a structured query language (SQL) statement is generated to retrieve the specific parameter values from a high-performance real-time database. We further utilize LLMs to formulate and solve an optimization problem based on the user request and the retrieved parameters. The solution to this optimization problem then drives adjustments in the communication system to fulfill the user's requirements. To validate the feasibility of the proposed paradigm, we present a prototype system. In this prototype, we consider user-request centric semantic communication (URC-SC) system in which a dynamic semantic representation network at the physical layer adapts its encoding depth to meet user requirements. Additionally, two LLMs are employed to analyze user requests and generate SQL statements, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Think Before Recommend: Unleashing the Latent Reasoning Power for Sequential Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential Recommendation (SeqRec) aims to predict the next item by capturing sequential patterns from users' historical interactions, playing a crucial role in many real-world recommender systems. However, existing approaches predominantly adopt a direct forward computation paradigm, where the final hidden state of the sequence encoder serves as the user representation. We argue that this inference paradigm, due to its limited computational depth, struggles to model the complex evolving nature of user preferences and lacks a nuanced understanding of long-tail items, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{ReaRec}, the first inference-time computing framework for recommender systems, which enhances user representations through implicit multi-step reasoning. Specifically, ReaRec autoregressively feeds the sequence's last hidden state into the sequential recommender while incorporating special reasoning position embeddings to decouple the original item encoding space from the multi-step reasoning space. Moreover, we introduce two lightweight reasoning-based learning methods, Ensemble Reasoning Learning (ERL) and Progressive Reasoning Learning (PRL), to further effectively exploit ReaRec's reasoning potential. Extensive experiments on five public real-world datasets and different SeqRec architectures demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our proposed ReaRec. Remarkably, post-hoc analyses reveal that ReaRec significantly elevates the performance ceiling of multiple sequential recommendation backbones by approximately 30\%-50\%. Thus, we believe this work can open a new and promising avenue for future research in inference-time computing for sequential recommendation.</description>

      <title>Towards Personalized Conversational Sales Agents : Contextual User Profiling for Strategic Action</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08754v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) aim to engage users in dialogue to provide tailored recommendations. While traditional CRSs focus on eliciting preferences and retrieving items, real-world e-commerce interactions involve more complex decision-making, where users consider multiple factors beyond simple attributes. To bridge this gap, we introduce Conversational Sales (CSales), a novel task that unifies preference elicitation, recommendation, and persuasion to better support user decision-making. For a realistic evaluation of CSales, we present CSUser, an LLM-based user simulator constructed from real-world data, modeling diverse user profiles with needs and personalities. Additionally, we propose CSI, a conversational sales agent that proactively infers contextual profiles through dialogue for personalized action planning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CSUser effectively replicates real-world users and emphasize the importance of contextual profiling for strategic action selection, ultimately driving successful purchases in e-commerce.</description>

Abstract: Despite the growing use of Electronic Health Records (EHR) for AI-assisted diagnosis prediction, most data-driven models struggle to incorporate clinically meaningful medical knowledge. They often rely on limited ontologies, lacking structured reasoning capabilities and comprehensive coverage. This raises an important research question: Will medical knowledge improve predictive models to support stepwise clinical reasoning as performed by human doctors? To address this problem, we propose DuaLK, a dual-expertise framework that combines two complementary sources of information. For external knowledge, we construct a Diagnosis Knowledge Graph (KG) that encodes both hierarchical and semantic relations enriched by large language models (LLM). To align with patient data, we further introduce a lab-informed proxy task that guides the model to follow a clinically consistent, stepwise reasoning process based on lab test signals. Experimental results on two public EHR datasets demonstrate that DuaLK consistently outperforms existing baselines across four clinical prediction tasks. These findings highlight the potential of combining structured medical knowledge with individual-level clinical signals to achieve more accurate and interpretable diagnostic predictions.

      <title>Efficient Distributed Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Enhancing Language Model Performance</title>

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) support efficient deployments on resource-constrained edge devices, but their limited capacity compromises inference performance. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising solution to enhance model performance by integrating external databases, without requiring intensive on-device model retraining. However, large-scale public databases and user-specific private contextual documents are typically located on the cloud and the device separately, while existing RAG implementations are primarily centralized. To bridge this gap, we propose DRAGON, a distributed RAG framework to enhance on-device SLMs through both general and personal knowledge without the risk of leaking document privacy. Specifically, DRAGON decomposes multi-document RAG into multiple parallel token generation processes performed independently and locally on the cloud and the device, and employs a newly designed Speculative Aggregation, a dual-side speculative algorithm to avoid frequent output synchronization between the cloud and device. A new scheduling algorithm is further introduced to identify the optimal aggregation side based on real-time network conditions. Evaluations on real-world hardware testbed demonstrate a significant performance improvement of DRAGON-up to 1.9x greater gains over standalone SLM compared to the centralized RAG, substantial reduction in per-token latency, and negligible Time to First Token (TTFT) overhead.</description>
