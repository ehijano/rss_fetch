      <title>Fast chaos indicator from auto-differentiation for dynamic aperture optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic differentiation provides an efficient means of computing derivatives of complex functions with machine precision, thereby enabling differentiable simulation. In this work, we propose the use of the norm of the tangent map, obtained from differentiable tracking of particle trajectories, as a computationally efficient indicator of chaotic behavior in phase space. In many cases, a one-turn or few-turn tangent map is sufficient for this purpose, significantly reducing the computational cost associated with dynamic aperture optimization. As an illustrative application, the proposed indicator is employed in the dynamic aperture optimization of an ALS-U lattice design.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic emittance properties of an Fe-doped Beta-Ga2O3(010) photocathode: Ultracold electron emission at 300K and the polaron self-energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements of the spectral emission properties of an iron-doped Beta-Ga2O3(010) photocathode at 300K reveal the presence of ultracold electron emission with a 6meV mean transverse energy (MTE) in the 3.5-4.4eV photon energy range (282-354nm). This extreme sub-thermal photoemission signal is consistent with direct emission of electrons photoexcited from the Fe dopant states into the low effective mass and positive electron affinity primary conduction band, and it is superimposed on a stronger signal with a larger MTE associated with an (optical)phonon-mediated momentum resonant Franck-Condon (FC) emission process from a thermally populated and negative electron affinity upper conduction band. For photon energies above 4.5eV, a transition from a long to a short transport regime is forced by an absorption depth reduction to below 100nm and both MTE signals exhibit spectral trends consistent with phonon-mediated FC emission if the polaron formation self-energy is included in the initial photoexcited electron thermalization.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic radiation reaction and energy extraction from black holes: The tail term cannot be ignored</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03411v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study electromagnetic radiation reaction in curved space and the dynamics of radiating charged particles. The equation of motion for such particles is the DeWitt-Brehme equation, and it contains a particularly complicated, non-local, tail term. It has been claimed that the tail term can be neglected in certain magnetized black hole spacetimes, and that radiation reaction may then lead to energy extraction ("orbital widening") in the absence of an ergoregion. We show that such claims are incorrect, at least in the Newtonian limit: the tail term can never be neglected consistently in the relevant scenarios, and when it is included the reported energy extraction no longer occurs. Thus, previous results are called into question by our work.</description>
