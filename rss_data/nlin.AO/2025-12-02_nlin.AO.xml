      <title>Circular current induced by angular dynamics in swarmalator populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a modified swarmalator model that generates collective rotational currents in phase synchronization. Our approach builds on the original swarmalator model [4], introducing a key modification: the phase-dependent terms in the spatial dynamics are replaced with a simpler driving term that depends on both the phase and a specified origin. We investigate the dynamics of this model through extensive numerical simulations. When the origin is fixed, spiral motions of synchronized and clustered swarmalators emerge from a finite fraction of random initial conditions, resulting in collective currents. To prevent the unrealistic divergence of these spirals, we introduce a dynamic origin, defined as the center of the swarmalators' positions. With this dynamic origin, the system evolves into rotating collective currents, where synchronized swarmalators form stable circular patterns. In both the fixed and dynamic origin cases, we also observe no-current states, in which synchronized swarmalators aggregate near the origin. Finally, we find that the formation of collective currents can be facilitated by tuning the phase variables either at initialization or during the system's evolution.</description>

      <title>Qualitatively distinct mechanisms of noise-induced escape in diffusively coupled bistable elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of noise-induced escape in ensembles of bistable elements is challenging, because nonlinearity, coupling, and noise all play essential roles. We show that the interplay of these three factors yields three qualitatively distinct escape mechanisms in diffusively coupled bistable elements, depending on the coupling strength. To clarify the relation between coupling strength and mean escape time, we derive effective one-dimensional dynamics: nonlinear mean-field Fokker-Planck equation in the weak-coupling regime, stochastic mean-field dynamics in the strong-coupling regime, and deterministic mean-field dynamics in the intermediate regime. We validate these reduced descriptions by comparing predictions with numerical simulations. We identify a distinct dominant driving factor of escape processes in each regime. Notably, the three escape mechanisms emerge through the interplay of nonlinearity, diffusive coupling, and dynamical noise -- rather than bifurcations of the noise-free system. Our approach serves as a framework applicable to other diffusively coupled stochastic nonlinear systems, motivating a further search for similar synergistic phenomena.</description>

      <title>X-SYCON: Xylem-Inspired Passive Gradient Control for Communication-Free Swarm Response in Dynamic Disaster Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present X-SYCON, a xylem-inspired multi-agent architecture in which coordination emerges from passive field dynamics rather than explicit planning or communication. Incidents (demands) and obstructions (hazards) continually write diffusing and decaying scalar fields, and agents greedily ascend a local utility $U=\phi_{\mathrm{DE}}-\kappa\,\phi_{\mathrm{HZ}}$ with light anti-congestion and separation. A beaconing rule triggered on first contact temporarily deepens the local demand sink, accelerating completion without reducing time-to-first-response. Across dynamic, partially blocked simulated environments, we observe low miss rates and stable throughput with interpretable, tunable trade-offs over carrier count, arrival rate, hazard density, and hazard sensitivity $\kappa$. We derive that a characteristic hydraulic length scale $\ell\approx\sqrt{D/\lambda}$ predicts recruitment range in a continuum approximation, and we provide a work-conservation (Ohm-law) bound consistent with sublinear capacity scaling with team size. Empirically: (i) soft hazard penalties yield fewer misses when obstacles already block motion; (ii) throughput saturates sublinearly with carriers while reliability improves sharply; (iii) stronger arrivals can reduce misses by sustaining sinks that recruit help; and (iv) phase-stability regions shrink with hazard density but are recovered by more carriers or higher arrivals. We refer to X-SYCON as an instance of Distributed Passive Computation and Control, and we evaluate it in simulations modeling communication-denied disaster response and other constrained sensing-action regimes.</description>

      <title>Tuning Universality in Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) exhibit crackling-like avalanches whose origin lacks a mechanistic explanation. Here, I derive a stochastic theory of deep information propagation (DIP) by incorporating Central Limit Theorem (CLT)-level fluctuations. Four effective couplings $(r, h, D_1, D_2)$ characterize the dynamics, yielding a Landau description of the static exponents and a Directed Percolation (DP) structure of activity cascades. Tuning the couplings selects between avalanche dynamics generated by a Brownian Motion (BM) in a logarithmic trap and an absorbed free BM, each corresponding to a distinct universality classes. Numerical simulations confirm the theory and demonstrate that activation function design controls the collective dynamics in random DNNs.</description>

      <title>Could society itself spiral into a Lorenz-like chaos when facing an epidemic threat?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how societies react to epidemic threats requires more than tracking infection curves. Public perception, collective memory and behavioural adaptation interact through feedback loops that can amplify or suppress the spread of fear, vigilance and precaution. In this work we reinterpret the classical Lorenz system in a socioepidemic context, governed by nonlinear interactions between perceived infection, social transmission behaviour and memory of past risk. We provide a qualitative analysis of the model and show that small fluctuations in perception or behaviour can trigger transitions between stable, oscillatory and chaotic collective responses. These results suggest that social reactions to epidemics may evolve according to intrinsic dynamical rules, generating complex patterns of vigilance, fatigue and renewed concern that mirror the irregular rhythms observed in real outbreaks. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating behavioural feedbacks into epidemic modeling and reveal how chaotic dynamics may arise not only from pathogens but from society itself.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Framework for the Formation of Large Animal Groups: Topological Coordination, Subgroup Merging, and Velocity Inheritance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large animal groups -- bird flocks, fish schools, insect swarms -- are often assumed to form by gradual aggregation of sparsely distributed individuals. Using a mathematically precise framework based on time-varying directed interaction networks, we show that this widely held view is incomplete.
  The theory demonstrates that large moving groups do not arise by slow accumulation; instead, they emerge through the rapid merging of multiple pre-existing subgroups that are simultaneously activated under high-density conditions. The key mechanism is topological: the long-term interaction structure of any moving group contains a single dominant strongly connected component (SCC). This dominant SCC determines the collective velocity -- both speed and direction -- of the entire group.
  When two subgroups encounter one another, the trailing subgroup aligns with -- and ultimately inherits -- the velocity of the dominant SCC of the leading subgroup. Repeated merging events naturally generate large groups whose speed is predicted to be lower than the mean speed of the original subgroups. The same dynamics explain several universal empirical features: broad neighbour-distance distributions, directional asymmetry in neighbour selection, and the characteristic narrow-front, wide-rear geometry of real flocks.
  The framework yields testable predictions for STARFLAG-style 3D datasets, offering a unified explanation for the formation, maintenance, and geometry of coordinated animal groups.</description>

      <title>Nonconserved critical dynamics of the two-dimensional Ising model as a surface kinetic roughening process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have revisited the non-conserved (or model A) critical dynamics of the two-dimensional Ising model through numerical simulations of its lattice and continuum formulations --Glauber dynamics and the timedependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equation, respectively--, to analyze them with current tools from surface kinetic roughening. Our study examines two critical quenches, one from an ordered and a different one from a disordered initial state, for both of which we assess the dynamic scaling ansatz, the critical exponent values, and the fluctuation field statistics that occur. Notably, the dynamic scaling ansatz followed by the system strongly depends on the initial condition: a critical quench from the ordered phase follows Family-Vicsek (FV) scaling, while a critical quench from the disordered phase shows an initial overgrowth regime with intrinsic anomalous roughening, followed by relaxation to equilibrium. This behavior is explained in terms of the dynamical instability of the stochastic Ginzburg-Landau equation at the critical temperature, whereby the linearly unstable term is eventually stabilized by nonlinear interactions. For both quenches we have determined the occurrence of probability distribution functions for the field fluctuations, which are time-independent along the non-equilibrium dynamics when suitably normalized by the time-dependent fluctuation amplitude. Additionally, we have developed a related interface model for a field which scales as the space integral of the TDGL field (integral GL model). Numerical simulations of this model reveal either FV or faceted anomalous roughening, depending on the critical quenched performed, as well as an emergent symmetry in the fluctuation statistics for a critical quench from the ordered phase.</description>

      <title>Collective is different: Information exchange and speed-accuracy trade-offs in self-organized patterning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During development, highly ordered structures emerge as cells collectively coordinate with each other. While recent advances have clarified how individual cells process and respond to external signals, understanding collective cellular decision making remains a major challenge. Here, we introduce a minimal, analytically tractable, model of cell patterning via local cell-cell communication. Using this framework, we identify a trade-off between the speed and accuracy of collective pattern formation and, by adapting techniques from stochastic chemical kinetics, quantify how information flows between cells during patterning. Our analysis reveals counterintuitive features of collective patterning: globally optimized solutions do not necessarily maximize intercellular information transfer and individual cells may appear suboptimal in isolation. Moreover, the model predicts that instantaneous information shared between cells can be non-monotonic in time as patterning occurs. An analysis of recent experimental data from lateral inhibition in Drosophila pupal abdomen finds a qualitatively similar effect.</description>
