      <title>Wake dynamics of a square cylinder while moving upward in quiescent water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the wake dynamics of a square cylinder rising through quiescent water over a range of Froude numbers ($\mathrm{Fr}$). Time-resolved Particle Image Velocimetry provides velocity and vorticity fields that enable pressure reconstruction and vortex characterization. Diagnostics based on swirl strength ($\lambda_{ci}$), the Okubo-Weiss parameter ($W$), and a shear-vortex interaction measure ($\Lambda$) reveal that the wake is governed by a persistent pair of counter-rotating vortices rather than by periodic shedding. Circulation exhibits a two-regime dependence on $\mathrm{Fr}$, with a sharp increase below $\mathrm{Fr}\approx 1$ and saturation above this threshold, mirroring entrainment force scaling reported previously. While vortex area remains nearly constant, swirl strength and negative-$W$ regions expand with $\mathrm{Fr}$, indicating that entrainment enhancement arises from intensified rotation rather than an enlarged vortex footprint. These findings provide new physical insight into vortex-free-surface interactions and enrich the understanding of entrainment mechanisms in unsteady wakes, with implications for multiphase flows and the hydrodynamic design of naval and offshore structures.</description>

      <title>Waves drive the rise and fall of 2D flows in rotating turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence follows a few well-known organizational principles, rooted in conservation laws. One such principle states that a system conserving two sign-definite invariants self-organizes into large-scale structures. Ordinary three-dimensional turbulence does not fall within this paradigm. However, when subject to rotation, 3D turbulence is profoundly altered: rotation produces 3D inertial waves, while also sustaining emergent two-dimensional structures and favoring domain-scale flows called condensates. This interplay raises a fundamental question: why and when are 2D flows sustained even when only 3D waves are excited? Using extensive numerical simulations of the rotating 3D Navier-Stokes equations together with a quasi-linear wave-kinetic theory, we show that near-resonant interactions between 3D waves and a large-scale 2D flow impose an additional conservation law: inertial waves must conserve their helicity separately for each helicity sign. This emergent sign-definite invariant constrains the waves to transfer their energy to large-scale 2D motions. However, as rotation increases, resonance conditions become more restrictive and the energy transfer from 3D to 2D progressively vanishes, leading to a transition from condensate-dominated turbulence to pure inertial-wave turbulence for the 3D modes. We derive analytical expressions for this 3D-2D energy transfer as a function of rotation, Reynolds number and domain geometry, and verify them numerically. Together, these results establish a mechanism underlying two-dimensionalization in rotating turbulence, and, more broadly, illustrate how wave-mean flow interactions can drive large-scale self-organization.</description>

      <title>Artificial Bottleneck Effect in Large Eddy Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Navier-Stokes turbulence, a bottleneck effect in the energy cascade near the viscous cutoff causes an overshoot in the energy spectrum, or spectral bump, relative to Kolmogorov's -5/3 scaling. A similar overshoot occurs in large-eddy simulations (LES) when an eddy viscosity model is used. It is not a viscous phenomenon but is caused by error in the residual stress model. This artificial bottleneck effect in LES leads to an over-prediction of kinetic energy even when a dynamic procedure is used to capture the spectral decay at the cutoff scale. Recently, Johnson [2022, J. Fluid Mech., 934, A30] introduced a generalization of spatial filtering that provides a dynamic procedure without a test filter. In this paper, this method of Stokes flow regularization (SFR) is used with kinetic energy considerations to generate a range of LES models and explore the bottleneck effect in more detail. The coefficients for each dynamic model are determined locally, without averaging over homogeneous directions. A posteriori tests of the models in isotropic turbulence are reported, demonstrating the robustness of the SFR-based procedure for different model forms and enabling fair comparisons in terms of their impact on the bottleneck effect. An effective way to mitigate the bottleneck is to add a nonlinear gradient component in the residual stress closure, forming a dynamic mixed model. This approach improves representation of residual stress structure and energy cascade efficiencies.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Sand Transport Sensitivity to Dune Shape: Field-Validated CFD with AirSketcher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coastal dune management often alters crest and lee geometry, yet quantifying the transport impact of small shape changes is difficult without heavy models. This paper presents a streamlined, field-anchored CFD workflow (AirSketcher) that ingests a side-profile image, auto-detects the dune outline, and computes near-surface flow. A neutral ABL power-law inlet is applied consistently across scenarios; turbulence is closed with a one-equation eddy-viscosity model. Model skill is established against multi-height mast measurements at Tomahawk Beach (Dunedin, NZ): height-matched profile correlations are strong and the solver reproduces stoss speed-up, crest amplification, and lee-side recovery. For design comparison, a geometry-aware transport proxy is formed as a cubic line-integral of speed along a near-surface polyline (Bagnold-type scaling). Three shapes are evaluated under the validated wind: baseline, top-cut, and back-cut. Integrated proxies indicate sand-transport reductions of 17% (top-cut) and 40% (back-cut) relative to the baseline. Flow patterns explain the reductions, crest-peak attenuation, muted lee jets, earlier reattachment, concentrating deposition nearer the crest, especially for the back-cut. The approach offers a rapid, interpretable metric for screening dune modifications before committing to fully coupled morpho dynamic modelling.</description>

      <title>Comparison of turbulence statistics in isothermal and non-isothermal large eddy simulations of supercritical carbon dioxide jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supercritical carbon dioxide is of interest in a wide range of engineering problems, including carbon capture, utilization, and storage as well as advanced cycles for power generation. Non-ideal variations in physical properties of supercritical carbon dioxide impact the physics of these systems. It is important to understand how drastic changes in thermodynamic properties influence these flow physics to aid and optimize the design of future technologies related to carbon capture and sequestration. In this study, we simulate turbulent supercritical carbon dioxide jets to gain a better understanding of these physics. Of particular interest is the impact of pseudo-boiling on supercritical flow dynamics. We use a second-order finite volume discretization method with adaptive mesh refinement as implemented in the reacting flow solver, PeleC, to perform a large eddy simulation of three turbulent jets of supercritical carbon dioxide. We use the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state to close the system and more accurately incorporate the departure from ideal gas behavior into the turbulent flow physics. We find that the isothermal supercritical jet exhibits many similar flow characteristics compared to ideal gas round turbulent jets, with minor differences seen in the decay and spreading rate of the jet and in a noticeable anisotropy between resolved turbulent kinetic energy components. The non-isothermal jet excluding the pseudo-boiling point exhibits only small difference compared to the isothermal case. Crossing the pseudo-boiling point results in markedly different behavior, with evidence indicative of increased Kelvin-Helmholtz-like instabilities and much faster jet decay and disintegration. These factors impact the degree of mixing in the transition region of the jet, indicating a potential for larger heat transfer and more rapid combustion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of three-dimensional turbulent flows from sparse and noisy planar measurements: A weight-sharing neural network approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a method for reconstructing three-dimensional turbulent flows from sparse measurements without the need for ground truth data during training. A weight-sharing network is developed to infer the full flow fields from measurements of velocity sampled at three planes and boundary pressure at one additional plane, inspired by experimental configurations. The weight-sharing network shares identical parameters along homogeneous directions, which results in efficient data utilization and reduced computational memory requirements. First, we compare the weight-sharing network to the PC-DualConvNet, adapted from prior work, by reconstructing a 3D Kolmogorov flow from noise-free measurements with a snapshot-enforced loss. Both networks accurately recover time-averaged 3D flow fields and the correct energy spectrum up to wavenumber 10. The weight-sharing network has the ability to infer flow structures distant from measurement planes. Second, we carry out reconstruction from measurements corrupted with white noise (SNR 15) using a mean-enforced loss. We show that, for the weight-sharing network, validation sensor loss on unseen data decreases with training sensor loss -- unlike PC-DualConvNet. This shows improved generalization and that training sensor loss estimates generalization error. The weight-sharing network offers good generalization, parameter efficiency, and hyperparameter robustness. The proposed method opens the possibility of three-dimensional flow reconstruction from experiments.</description>

      <title>Validation of a Reynolds-averaged numerical simulation environment to simulate high-pressure, auto-igniting hydrogen diffusion flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydrogen (H2) fueled direct-injection (DI) compression-ignition (CI) argon power cycle (APC) is an attractive technology to counteract the mismatch between energy demand and supply from renewable energy sources. The development of the APC, as well as air-breathing DI CI H2 engines, can be advanced by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) combustion models are an effective approach to predict global in-cylinder variables such pressure and heat release rate. However, validity of this method to simulate the complex phenomena associated with high-pressure, auto-igniting hydrogen jets is not ensured due to the underlying model assumptions. In this study, a RANS CFD environment using two commonly used eddy-viscosity models and the Reynolds stress model (RSM) is extensively validated. Combustion is modeled with a detailed chemistry model. First, hydrogen distributions in non-reacting jets are compared against literature data to assess the accuracy of the models on turbulent mixing at high pressure. Subsequently, the capability of the model to simulate auto-igniting jets is assessed by comparison with reported measurement data of closed-vessel experiments at high pressure. Ignition delay times, pressure rise profiles, and heat release rate profiles are compared for different ambient temperature and oxygen concentration. Adequate agreement is found for the diffusive combustion phase for all models, despite the lack of turbulence-chemistry interaction in the combustion model. Trends with ambient temperature and oxygen concentration were well predicted and the best agreement is found for the RSM.</description>

      <title>Pore-Scale Dynamics of Multiphase Reactive Transport in Water-Wet Carbonates under CO2-Acidified Brine Injection: Dissolution Patterns and Reaction Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depleted carbonate hydrocarbon reservoirs are promising sites for geological CO2 storage, yet the presence of residual hydrocarbons introduces complex pore-scale interactions that influence the dynamics of solid dissolution. This study reveals how residual oil affects dissolution patterns and effective reaction rates during CO2-acidified brine injection into Ketton limestone under reservoir conditions. We combine time-resolved X-ray microtomography (micro-CT), core-flooding experiments, and direct numerical simulations to assess the impact of pore space heterogeneity, oil distribution and injection rate. We find that the coupling between pore structure, residual oil saturation and oil displacement control flow heterogeneity, reactive surface accessibility, dissolution patterns and the reaction rates. At low injection rate, dissolution by channel widening is enhanced by oil displacement. This mechanism is especially important when dissolution is suppressed by heterogeneity in the pore space and the residual oil. At high injection rates, a more uniform dissolution occurs and can be enhanced by re-mobilisation of oil blocking brine flow. Effective reaction rates in two-phase flow are found to be lower than in the the equivalent single-phase case and up to two orders of magnitude lower than the batch rates due to persistent transport limitations. These findings offer mechanistic insights into multiphase reactive transport in carbonates and highlight the need for accurate understanding of the impact of the hydrocarbon phase on reaction to improve predictions of CO2 storage efficiency.</description>

      <title>Data-driven transient growth analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transient growth analysis has been extensively studied in asymptotically stable flows to identify their short-term amplification of perturbations. Generally, in global transient growth analyses, matrix-free methods are adopted, requiring the construction of adjoint equations, either in the discrete or continuous form. This paper introduces a data-driven algorithm that circumvents the adjoint equations by extracting the optimal initial perturbation and its energy growth over a specified time horizon from transient snapshots of perturbations. This method is validated using data from the linearised complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, backward-facing step flow, and the Batchelor vortex. Unlike model-based methods, which require $S$ sets of integrations of the linearised governing equation and its adjoint for $S$ time horizons, the proposed approach collects the snapshots of $S$ time horizons in one integration of the linearised equation. Furthermore, this study provides a robust framework for utilising proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes to synthesise optimal modes. The developed capacity to conduct transient growth analyses without solving the adjoint equations is expected to significantly reduce the barriers to transient dynamics research.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of friction reduction and underlying mechanism of air film via parallel and tandem injections on a hypersonic flat plate at high altitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study uses numerical simulations to analyze a flat-plate with air films generated via parallel and tandem injections under freestream conditions of Ma=15 at an altitude of H=60km. Simulations are carried out using various mass flow rates and jet spacing, followed by an examination of the effect of the streamwise-to-spanwise aspect ratio of the injection hole. The following key findings are acquired: (1) Under hypersonic and high-altitude conditions, the air injection lifts the incoming flow, producing a pronounced low-speed region near the injection site and over the downstream wall. A plateau appears in the wall-normal distribution of the streamwise velocity, with a value significantly lower than that of its freestream counterpart. This reduces the near-wall velocity gradient, thereby achieving drag reduction. However, the subsequent flow reattachment may lead to localized drag increases; (2) As the mass flow rate of injection increases, the wall-normal extent of the near-wall low-speed layer expands and the film coverage broadens; however, the increased friction limits gains in drag reduction, and greater flow losses are also incurred; (3) Increasing the hole spacing in the parallel injection reduces the penetration height of the film, the spanwise coverage, and the drag reduction efficiency, as well as decreasing the flow losses. In contrast, for the studied tandem injections, no significant differences are observed with analogous spacing variations; (4) Increasing the injection aspect ratio enlarges the spanwise coverage of the low-speed layer, improves the spanwise uniformity of the streamwise velocity distribution, diminishes the friction-increasing zones, and significantly enhances the drag reduction. Notably, the consequences are the inverse of those of the low-speed situation.</description>

      <title>A flux bounce-back scheme for the filtered Spectral Element Lattice Boltzmann Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a spectral element lattice Boltzmann method (SELBM) with the flux bounce-back (FBB) scheme, to enable accurate simulations of single-phase fluid dynamics in unstructured mesh. We adopt an Eulerian description of the streaming process in place of the perfect shift in the regular LBM. The spectral element method is used to spatially discretize the convective term, while the strong stability-preserving Runge-Kutta (SSPRK) method is used for time integration. To increase stability, we investigate the use of an explicit filter, particularly in the context of the sensitive double shear layer problem. The results indicate that by using the high-order polynomial, we can effectively eliminate the small vortices around the neck region. We introduce the flux bounce-back scheme to enable the current scheme to handle complex boundaries. The proposed scheme and flux boundary method are validated through benchmark simulations, including the unsteady Couette flow and the planar Poiseuille flow. Further validation is provided through the Taylor-Green vortex problem, demonstrating the accuracy and convergence of the scheme for isotropic turbulence. Finally, we consider a fully developed turbulent flow within a cylindrical pipe and correctly predict the turbulent boundary layer profile.</description>

      <title>A novel generalized inner product-based wave scattering from an underwater source in a compressible ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19196v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by applications to underwater explosions and volcanic eruptions, this paper considers the evolution of an initial pressure disturbance in the ocean, including effects due to the dynamic and static compression of water and the free surface. In order to solve the equations of motion of a linear compressible ocean, a special inner product is introduced, which allows us to apply self-adjoint operator theory. What results is a Hilbert space in which the acoustic-gravity modes are orthogonal in the generalised sense. This allows the time-domain evolution of the free surface and subsurface pressure field resulting from an initial disturbance to be calculated. Our simulations show initial radial propagation of the pressure pulse and subsequent reflection from the water surface and the rigid ocean floor, eventually leading to horizontal propagation away from the source point. The solutions with and without the inclusion of the static compression are compared, and the effect of static compression is shown to be small but not negligible.</description>

      <title>Mass dependence of overshooting beneath convective envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the dependence of convective core overshooting on mass has attracted much attention, no corresponding work exists for overshooting below a convective envelope. We aim to quantify this relationship for pre-main sequence stars of intermediate mass ranging from $1.2 M_{\mathsf{sun}}$ to $6 M_{\mathsf{sun}}$. These stars have a similar thermal and density structure, making this a suitable choice to isolate the effect of changing mass. We produce a series of two-dimensional global simulations of stars using MUSIC, a fully compressible, time-implicit hydrodynamics code. The stars that we select for this study are near the end of the pre-main sequence and are convectively unstable above 80% of their stellar radius; they thus have a convective envelope that is shallower than the current sun. For this series of stellar models, a simple scaling with luminosity, with a scaling exponent of 1/4, accounts for the increasing overshooting with stellar mass. This result has interesting similarities with the scaling found by Baraffe et al. [2023] for a range of intermediate mass and massive stars at the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) that have convective cores.</description>

      <title>Stoichiometry preservation and generalization of Bilger mixture fraction for non-premixed combustion with differential molecular diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bilger mixture fraction is a widely used parameter in non-premixed combustion when considering differential molecular diffusion, a prevalent phenomenon in hydrogen or hydrogen-blended fuel combustion. The property of stoichiometry preservation of mixture fractions is investigated. Two different Bilger mixture fraction formulations are clarified. It is found that they belong to a class of one-parameter generalized mixture fraction definitions discovered in this work. Specific definitions from the class of mixture fractions are compared for hydrocarbon fuels. The comparison shows that the difference can be significant. An optimal mixture fraction definition is sought from the general definitions by minimizing its deviation from the desired properties. The obtained optimal mixture fractions show overall better preservation of stoichiometry than Bilger's definitions. The extension of the generalized mixture fraction to other fuels that contain nitrogen (like ammonia $\mathrm{NH_3}$) or sulfur (like hydrogen sulfide $\mathrm{H_2S}$) is also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Entropy conservative discretization of compressible Euler equations with an arbitrary equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel spatial discretization procedure for the compressible Euler equations which guarantees entropy conservation at a discrete level when an arbitrary equation of state is assumed. The proposed method, based on a locally-conservative discretization, guarantees also the spatial conservation of mass, momentum, and total energy and is kinetic energy-preserving. In order to achieve the entropy-conservation property for an arbitrary non-ideal gas, a general strategy is adopted based on the manipulation of discrete balance equations through the imposition of global entropy conservation and the use of a summation by parts rule. The procedure, which is extended to an arbitrary order of accuracy, conducts to a general form of the internal-energy numerical flux which results in a nonlinear function of thermodynamic and dynamic variables and still admits the mass flux as a residual degree of freedom. The effectiveness of the novel entropy-conservative formulation is demonstrated through numerical tests making use of some of the most popular cubic equations of state.</description>

      <title>Finite-difference compatible entropy-conserving schemes for the compressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a family of entropy-conserving finite-difference discretizations for the compressible flow equations. In addition to conserving the primary quantities of mass, momentum, and total energy, the methods also preserve kinetic energy and pressure equilibrium. The schemes are based on finite-difference (FD) representations of the logarithmic mean, establishing and leveraging a broader link between linear and nonlinear two-point averages and FD forms. The schemes are locally conservative due to the summation-by-parts property and therefore admit a local flux form, making them applicable also in finite-volume and finite-element settings. The effectiveness of these schemes is validated through various test cases (1D Sod shock tube, 1D density wave, 2D isentropic vortex, 3D Taylor-Green vortex) that demonstrate exact conservation of entropy along with conservation of the primary quantities and preservation of pressure equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Comparison of lubrication theory and Stokes flow models in step bearings with flow separation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Reynolds equation from lubrication theory and the Stokes equations for low Reynolds number flows are distinct models for an incompressible fluid with negligible inertia. Here we investigate the sensitivity of the Reynolds equation to large gradients in the surface geometry. We present an analytic solution to the Reynolds equation in a piecewise-linear domain alongside a more general finite difference solution. For the Stokes equations, we use a finite difference solution for the biharmonic stream-velocity formulation. We compare the fluid velocity, pressure, and resistance for various step bearing geometries in the lubrication and Stokes limits. We find that the solutions to the Reynolds equation do not capture flow separation resulting from large cross-film pressure gradients. Flow separation and corner flow recirculation in step bearings are explored further; we consider the effect of smoothing large gradients in the surface geometry in order to recover limits under which the lubrication and Stokes approximations converge.</description>

      <title>On the role of water activity on the formation of a protein-rich coffee ring in an evaporating multicomponent drop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coffee-ring effect is a universal feature of evaporating sessile droplets with pinned contact line, wherein solutes or particles are advected to the droplet's edge due to evaporation-driven flows. While existing models have successfully described this phenomenon in particle-laden droplets, they often assume that hydrodynamics are decoupled from solute transport. This assumption breaks down in complex fluids, such as protein or polymeric solutions, where the solute can influence evaporation through changes in water activity. Here, we investigate model respiratory droplets primarily composed of water, salt, and a type of the glycoprotein mucin. Using fluorescence microscopy, we observe the formation of a well-defined protein ring at the droplet edge as water evaporates. The growth and morphology of this ring exhibit a strong dependence on ambient relative humidity ($H_r$), revealing dynamics that existing models cannot capture. Specifically, we find that protein accumulation at the edge is governed by the feedback between local solute concentration and evaporation rate. To account for this, we develop a minimal theoretical model based on the lubrication approximation, incorporating the coupling between hydrodynamics and solute transport through the evaporation rate. Our framework reproduces key features of the experimental observations and suggests a physical basis for the $H_r$-dependent stability and infectivity of respiratory droplets containing viruses.</description>

      <title>Broken detailed balance in driven macroscopic capillary self-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Macroscopic objects supported by surface tension at the fluid interface can self-assemble through the action of capillary forces arising from interfacial deformations. The resulting self-assembled structures are typically ordered but remain trapped in one of potentially many metastable states in the capillary energy landscape in the absence of external forces. In contrast, microscopic colloidal systems leverage both thermal and active fluctuations to overcome energy barriers, enabling transitions between microstates of the system. We herein utilize supercritical Faraday waves to drive structural rearrangements between metastable states of few-particle clusters of millimetric spheres bound by capillary attractions at the fluid interface. By tracking all microstate transitions experimentally, we find that the system is endowed with a non-zero entropy production rate reflecting broken detailed balance and the system's departure from equilibrium. Our experimental results are in quantitative agreement with simulations of a many-body active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model, pointing to universal features of active and driven self-assembly across scales. These findings invite a corresponding investigation at the microscale using colloids that are themselves active or are placed in a wider class of athermal environments such as bacterial baths.</description>

      <title>Two dimensional potential theory with a view towards vortex motion: Energy, capacity and Green functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper reviews some parts of classical potential theory with applications to two dimensional fluid dynamics, in particular vortex motion. Energy and forces within a system of point vortices are similar to those for point charges when the vortices are kept fixed, but the dynamics is different in the case of free vortices. Starting from Bernoulli's equation we derive these laws. Letting the number of vortices tend to infinity leads in the limit to considerations of capacity, harmonic measure and many other notions in potential theory. In particular various kinds of Green functions have a central role in the paper, where we make a difference between electrostatic and hydrodynamic Green function.
  We also consider the corresponding concepts in the case of closed Riemann surfaces provided with a metric. From a canonically defined monopole Green function we rederive much of the classical theory of harmonic and analytic forms. In the final section of the paper we return to the planar case, then reappearing in form of a symmetric Riemann surface, the Schottky double. Bergman kernels, electrostatic and hydrodynamic, come up naturally, and associated to the Green function the is a certain Robin function which is important for vortex motion and which also relates to capacity functions in classical potential theory.</description>

      <title>Radiation forces and torques in optics and acoustics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mechanical action of various kinds of waves has been recognized for several centuries. The first tide of scientific interest in wave-induced forces and torques emerged at the turn of the 20th century, with the development of wave theories and the concepts of wave momentum and angular momentum. A second surge occurred in the past several decades, driven by technological breakthroughs: the invention of lasers and the controlled generation of structured wave fields. This resulted in major discoveries, including optical trapping and manipulation of small particles, from atomic to micro sizes, as well as acoustic manipulation of larger particles, including biological cells and samples. Nowadays, radiation forces and torques underpin numerous applications: optical and acoustic tweezers, acoustofluidic sorting of biological cells, optomechanical systems operating in both classical and quantum regimes, solar sails, quantum simulators, volumetric displays, etc. In this review, we present a unifying perspective on optical and acoustic forces and torques acting on various particles, addressing both their theoretical foundations and key applications. Our approach relies on the universal connection between the local energy, momentum, and spin densities of wave fields and the principal forces and torques exerted on small particles. Moreover, we describe important cases of nontrivial (e.g., lateral and pulling) forces and complex (e.g., chiral and anisotropic) particles. We also highlight significant experimental achievements involving optical and acoustic manipulation in structured wave fields. Our aim is to illuminate the common fundamental origins and close interconnections between the mechanical actions of optical and acoustic fields, thereby fostering a deeper understanding and advancing the development of optomechanical and acoustomechanical applications.</description>

      <title>Meshless projection model-order reduction via reference spaces for smoothed-particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a model-order reduction framework for the meshless weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. The proposed framework introduces the concept of modal reference spaces to overcome the challenges of discovering low-dimensional subspaces from unstructured, dynamic, and mixing numerical topology that is often seen in SPH simulations. The proposed modal reference spaces enable a low-dimensional representation of the SPH field equations while maintaining their inherent meshless qualities. Modal reference spaces are constructed by projecting SPH snapshot data onto a reference space where low-dimensionality of field quantities can be discovered via traditional modal decomposition techniques (e.g., the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)). Modal quantities are mapped back to the meshless SPH space via scattered data interpolation during the online predictive stage. The proposed model-order reduction framework is cast into the \emph{meshless} Galerkin POD (GPOD) and the Adjoint Petrov--Galerkin (APG) projection model-order reduction (PMOR) formulation. The PMORs are tested on three numerical experiments: 1) the Taylor--Green vortex; 2) lid-driven cavity; and 3) flow past an open cavity. Results show good agreement in reconstructed and predictive velocity fields, which showcase the ability of the proposed framework to evolve the unstructured, dynamic, and mixing SPH field equations in a low-dimensional subspace. Results also show that the pressure field is sensitive to the projection error due to the stiff weakly-compressible assumption made in the current SPH framework, but can be alleviated through nonlinear approximations, such as the APG approach. Ultimately, the presented meshless model-order reduction framework marks a step toward enabling drastic cost savings of SPH simulations.</description>
