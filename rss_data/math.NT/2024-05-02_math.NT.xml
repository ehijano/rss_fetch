      <title>Base change and Iwasawa Main Conjectures for ${\rm GL}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E/\mathbb{Q}$ be an elliptic curve of conductor $N$, $p$ an odd prime of good ordinary reduction such that $E[p]$ is an irreducible $G_{\mathbb{Q}}$-module, and $K$ an imaginary quadratic field with all primes dividing $Np$ split. We prove Iwasawa Main Conjectures for the $\mathbb{Z}_p$-cyclotomic and $\mathbb{Z}_p$-anticyclotomic deformation of $E$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ and $K$ respectively, dispensing with any of the ramification hypotheses on $E[p]$ in previous works. Using base change, the proofs are based on Wan's divisibility towards a three-variable main conjecture for $E$ over a quartic CM field containing $K$.
  As an application, we prove cases of the two-variable main conjecture for $E$ over $K$. The one-variable main conjectures imply the $p$-part of the conjectural Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer formula if ${\rm ord}_{s=1}L(E,s)\leq 1$. They are also an ingredient in the proof of Kolyvagin's conjecture and its cyclotomic variant in our joint work with Grossi \cite{BCGS}.</description>

      <title>Large Values of Newform Dedekind Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a generalized Dedekind sum $S_{\chi_1,\chi_2}(a,c)$ attached to newform Eisenstein series $E_{\chi_1,\chi_2}(z,s)$. Our work shows the Dedekind sum is rarely substantially larger than $\log^3 c$. The method of proof first relates the size of the Dedekind sum to continued fractions. A result of Hensley from 1991 then controls the average size of the maximal partial quotient in the continued fraction expansion of $a/c$.
  We complement this result by computing approximate values of the Dedekind sum in some special cases, which in particular produces examples of large values of the Dedekind sum.</description>

      <title>Large sums of high order characters II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\chi$ be a primitive character modulo $q$, and let $\delta &gt; 0$. Assuming that $\chi$ has large order $d$, for any $d$th root of unity $\alpha$ we obtain non-trivial upper bounds for the number of $n \leq x$ such that $\chi(n) = \alpha$, provided $x &gt; q^{\delta}$. This improves upon a previous result of the first author by removing restrictions on $q$ and $d$. As a corollary, we deduce that if the largest prime factor of $d$ satisfies $P^+(d) \to \infty$ then the level set $\chi(n) = \alpha$ has $o(x)$ such solutions whenever $x &gt; q^{\delta}$, for any fixed $\delta &gt; 0$.
  Our proof relies, among other things, on a refinement of a mean-squared estimate for short sums of the characters $\chi^\ell$, averaged over $1 \leq \ell \leq d-1$, due to the first author, which goes beyond Burgess' theorem as soon as $d$ is sufficiently large. We in fact show the alternative result that either (a) the partial sum of $\chi$ itself, or (b) the partial sum of $\chi^\ell$, for ``almost all'' $1 \leq \ell \leq d-1$, exhibits cancellation on the interval $[1,q^{\delta}]$, for any fixed $\delta &gt; 0$.
  By an analogous method, we also show that the P\'{o}lya-Vinogradov inequality may be improved for either $\chi$ itself or for almost all $\chi^\ell$, with $1 \leq \ell \leq d-1$. In particular, our averaged estimates are non-trivial whenever $\chi$ has sufficiently large even order $d$.</description>

      <title>A Note on Large Sums of Divisor-Bounded Multiplicative Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a multiplicative function $f$, we let $S(x,f)=\sum_{n\leq x}f(n)$ be the associated partial sum. In this note, we show that lower bounds on partial sums of divisor-bounded functions result in lower bounds on the partial sums associated to their products. More precisely, we let $f_j$, $j=1,2$ be such that $|f_j(n)|\leq \tau(n)^\kappa$ for some $\kappa\in\mathbb{N}$, and assume their partial sums satisfy $\left|S(x_j,f_j)\right|\geq \eta x_j (\log x_j)^{2^\kappa-1}$ for some $x_1, x_2\gg 1$ and $\eta&gt;\max_j\{(\log x_j)^{-1/100}\}$. We then show that there exists $x\geq \min\{x_1, x_2\}^{\xi^2}$ such that $\left|S(x,f_1f_2)\right|\geq \xi x (\log x)^{2^{2\kappa}-1}$, where $\xi=C\eta^{1+2^{\kappa+3}}$ for some absolute constant $C&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Preperiodic points of polynomial dynamical systems over finite fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a prime $p$, positive integers $r,n$, and a polynomial $f$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{F}_{p^r}$, let $W_{p,r,n}(f)=f^n\left(\mathbb{F}_{p^r}\right)\setminus f^{n+1}\left(\mathbb{F}_{p^r}\right)$. As $n$ varies, the $W_{p,r,n}(f)$ partition the set of strictly preperiodic points of the dynamical system induced by the action of $f$ on $\mathbb{F}_{p^r}$. In this paper we compute statistics of strictly preperiodic points of dynamical systems induced by unicritical polynomials over finite fields by obtaining effective upper bounds for the proportion of $\mathbb{F}_{p^r}$ lying in a given $W_{p,r,n}(f)$. Moreover, when we generalize our definition of $W_{p,r,n}(f)$, we obtain both upper and lower bounds for the resulting averages.</description>

      <title>Elliptic multiple zeta values, Grothendieck-Teichm\"uller and mould theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:1506.09050v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we define an elliptic double shuffle Lie algebra $ds_{ell}$ that generalizes the well-known double shuffle Lie algebra $ds$ to the elliptic situation. The double shuffle, or dimorphic, relations satisfied by elements of the Lie algebra $ds$ express two families of algebraic relations between multiple zeta values that conjecturally generate all relations. In analogy with this, elements of the elliptic double shuffle Lie algebra $ds_{ell}$ are Lie polynomials having a dimorphic property called $\Delta$-bialternality that conjecturally describes the (dual of the) set of algebraic relations between elliptic multiple zeta values, periods of objects of the category $MEM$ of mixed elliptic motives defined by Hain and Matsumoto. We show that one of Ecalle's major results in mould theory can be reinterpreted as yielding the existence of an injective Lie algebra morphism $ds\rightarrow ds_{ell}$. Our main result is the compatibility of this map with the tangential-base-point section ${\rm Lie}\,\pi_1(MTM)\rightarrow {\rm Lie}\,\pi_1(MEM)$ constructed by Hain and Matsumoto and with the section $grt\rightarrow grt_{ell}$ mapping the Grothendieck-Teichm\"uller Lie algebra $grt$ into the elliptic Grothendieck-Teichm\"uller Lie algebra $grt_{ell}$ constructed by Enriquez.</description>

      <title>The Failure of Galois Descent for p-Selmer Groups of Elliptic Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.02486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that if F is the rational numbers or a multiquadratic number field, p is 2,3, or 5, and K/F is a Galois extension of degree a power of p, then for elliptic curves E/Q ordered by height, the average dimension of the p-Selmer groups of E/K is bounded. In particular, this provides a bound for the average K-rank of elliptic curves E/Q for such K. Additionally, we give bounds for certain representation-theoretic invariants of Mordell--Weil groups over Galois extensions of such F.
  The central result is: for each finite Galois extension K/F of number fields and prime number p, as E/Q varies, the difference in dimension between the Galois fixed space in the p-Selmer group of E/K and the p-Selmer group of E/F has bounded average.</description>

Abstract: We establish instances of Beilinson-Tate conjectures for automorphic representations of $\mathrm{PGSp}_6$ whose Spin $L$-function has a pole at $s=1$. Using the exceptional theta correspondence between the split group of type $G_2$ and $\mathrm{PGSp}_6$ and assuming the non-vanishing of a certain archimedean integral, this allows us to confirm a conjecture of Gross and Savin on rank $7$ motives of type $G_2$.</description>

Abstract: Every Salem numbers of degree 4,6,8,12,14 or 16 is the dynamical degree of an automorphism of a non-projective K3 surface. We define a notion of signature of an automorphism, and use it to give a necessary and sufficient condition for Salem numbers of degree 10 and 18 to be realized as the dynamical degree of such an automorphism. The first part of the paper contains results on isometries of lattices.</description>

      <title>The Shimura lift and congruences for modular forms with the eta multiplier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07438v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Shimura correspondence is a fundamental tool in the study of half-integral weight modular forms. In this paper, we prove a Shimura-type correspondence for spaces of half-integral weight cusp forms which transform with a power of the Dedekind eta multiplier twisted by a Dirichlet character. We prove that the lift of a cusp form of weight $\lambda+1/2$ and level $N$ has weight $2\lambda$ and level $6N$, and is new at the primes $2$ and $3$ with specified Atkin-Lehner eigenvalues. This precise information leads to arithmetic applications. For a wide family of spaces of half-integral weight modular forms we prove the existence of infinitely many primes $\ell$ which give rise to quadratic congruences modulo arbitrary powers of $\ell$.</description>

      <title>On the Folklore set and Dirichlet spectrum for matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Folklore set of Dirichlet improvable matrices in $\mathbb R^{m\times n}$ which are neither singular nor badly approximable. We prove the non-emptiness for all positive integer pairs $m,n$ apart from $\{m,n\}=\{ 1,1\}$ and $\{m,n\}=\{ 2,3\}$ in a constructive way. For a wide range of integer pairs $(m,n)$ we construct subsets of the Folklore set with an exact prescribed Dirichlet constant (in some right neighbourhood of $0$). This enables us to provide information on the Dirichlet Spectrum of matrices. The key technique of our construction is to build certain $2$-dimensional simultaneously approximable very singular vectors, and then `lift' these vectors to higher dimensions by `glueing' them to a large set of well-behaved matrices. Our technique is also applicable to arbitrary norms. As a corollary, we obtain lower bounds on the Hausdorff dimension of these sets. These statements complement previous results of the middle-named author (Selecta Math. 2023), Beresnevich et. al. (Adv. Math. 2023), and Das et. al. (Adv. Math. 2024).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.05862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We make quantitative improvements to recently obtained results on the structure of the image of a large difference set under certain quadratic forms and other homogeneous polynomials. Previous proofs used deep results of Benoist-Quint on random walks in certain subgroups of $\operatorname{SL}_r(\mathbb{Z})$ (the symmetry groups of these quadratic forms) that were not of a quantitative nature. Our new observation relies on noticing that rather than studying random walks, one can obtain more quantitative results by considering polynomial orbits of these group actions that are not contained in cosets of submodules of $\mathbb{Z}^r$ of small index. Our main new technical tool is a uniform Furstenberg-S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy theorem that holds for a large class of polynomials not necessarily vanishing at zero, which may be of independent interest and is derived from a density increment argument and Hua's bound on polynomial exponential sums.</description>

Abstract: For the product $X=C\times S$ of a curve and a surface over a number field, we construct unconditionally a Beilinson--Bloch type height pairing for homologically trivial algebraic cycles on $X$. Then for an embedding $f: C\to S$, we define an arithmetic diagonal cycle modified from the graph of $f$. This work extends previous work of Gross and Schoen when $S$ is the product of two curves, and is based on our recent work which relates the height pairings and the standard conjectures.</description>

Abstract: Let X be a complex projective K3 surface, and let T(X) be its transcendental lattice; the characteristic polynomials of the isometries of T(X) induced by automorphisms of X are powers of cyclotomic polynomials. Which powers of cyclotomic polynomials occur ? The aim of this note is to answer this question, as well as related ones, and give an alternative approach to some results of Kondo, Machida, Oguiso, Vorontsov, Xiao and Zhang; this leads to questions and results concerning orthogonal groups of lattices.</description>
