      <title>Evaluation of A National Digitally-Enabled Health Promotion Campaign for Mental Health Awareness using Social Media Platforms Tik Tok, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mental health disorders rank among the 10 leading contributors to the global burden of diseases, yet persistent stigma and care barriers delay early intervention. This has inspired efforts to leverage digital platforms for scalable health promotion to engage at-risk populations. To evaluate the effectiveness of a digitally-enabled mental health promotion (DEHP) campaign, we conducted an observational cross-sectional study of a 3-month (February-April 2025) nation-wide campaign in Singapore. Campaign materials were developed using a marketing funnel framework and disseminated across YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. This included narrative videos and infographics to promote symptom awareness, coping strategies, and/or patient navigation to mindline.sg, as the intended endpoint for user engagement and support. Primary outcomes include anonymised performance analytics (impressions, unique reach, video content view, engagements) stratified by demographics, device types, and sector. Secondary outcomes measured cost-efficiency metrics and traffic to mindline.sg respectively. This campaign generated 3.49 million total impressions and reached 1.39 million unique residents, with a Cost per Mille at \$26.90, Cost per Click at \$29.33, and Cost per Action at \$6.06. Narrative videos accumulated over 630,000 views and 18,768 engagements. Overall, we demonstrate that DEHP campaigns can achieve national engagement for mental health awareness through multi-channel distribution and creative, narrative-driven designs.</description>

      <title>Whom We Trust, What We Fear: COVID-19 Fear and the Politics of Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic triggered not only a global health crisis but also an infodemic, an overload of information from diverse sources influencing public perception and emotional responses. In this context, fear emerged as a central emotional reaction, shaped by both media exposure and demographic factors. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between individuals' self-reported levels of fear about COVID-19 and the information sources they rely on, across nine source categories, including medical experts, government institutions, media, and personal networks. In particular, we defined a score that ranks fear levels based on self-reported concerns about the pandemic, collected through the Delphi CTIS survey in the United States between May 2021 and June 2022. We found that both fear levels and information source usage closely follow COVID-19 infection trends, exhibit strong correlations within each group (fear levels across sources are strongly correlated, as are patterns of source usage), and vary significantly across demographic groups, particularly by age and education. Applying causal inference methods, we showed that the type of information source significantly affects individuals' fear levels. Furthermore, we demonstrated that information source preferences can reliably match the political orientation of U.S. states. These findings highlight the importance of information ecosystem dynamics in shaping emotional and behavioral responses during large-scale crises.</description>

      <title>Universal vulnerability in strong modular networks with various degree distributions between inequality and equality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generally, networks are classified into two sides of inequality and equality with respect to the number of links at nodes by the types of degree distributions. One side includes many social, technological, and biological networks which consist of a few nodes with many links, and many nodes with a few links, whereas the other side consists of all nodes with an equal number of links. In comprehensive investigations between them, we have found that, as a more equal network, the tolerance of whole connectivity is stronger without fragmentation against the malfunction of nodes in a wide class of randomized networks. However, we newly find that all networks which include typical well-known network structures between them become extremely vulnerable, if a strong modular (or community) structure is added with commonalities of areas, interests, religions, purpose, and so on. These results will encourage avoiding too dense unions by connecting nodes and taking into account the balanced resource allocation between intra- and inter-links of weak communities. We must reconsider not only efficiency but also tolerance against attacks or disasters, unless no community that is really impossible.</description>

      <title>PyGenStability: Multiscale community detection with generalized Markov Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05385v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present PyGenStability, a general-use Python software package that provides a suite of analysis and visualisation tools for unsupervised multiscale community detection in graphs. PyGenStability finds optimized partitions of a graph at different levels of resolution by maximizing the generalized Markov Stability quality function with the Louvain or Leiden algorithms. The package includes automatic detection of robust graph partitions and allows the flexibility to choose quality functions for weighted undirected, directed and signed graphs, and to include other user-defined quality functions.</description>

      <title>Network Formation and Dynamics Among Multi-LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10659v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social networks profoundly influence how humans form opinions, exchange information, and organize collectively. As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded into social and professional environments, it is critical to understand whether their interactions approximate human-like network dynamics. We develop a framework to study the network formation behaviors of multiple LLM agents and benchmark them against human decisions. Across synthetic and real-world settings, including friendship, telecommunication, and employment networks, we find that LLMs consistently reproduce fundamental micro-level principles such as preferential attachment, triadic closure, and homophily, as well as macro-level properties including community structure and small-world effects. Importantly, the relative emphasis of these principles adapts to context: for example, LLMs favor homophily in friendship networks but heterophily in organizational settings, mirroring patterns of social mobility. A controlled human-subject survey confirms strong alignment between LLMs and human participants in link-formation decisions. These results establish that LLMs can serve as powerful tools for social simulation and synthetic data generation, while also raising critical questions about bias, fairness, and the design of AI systems that participate in human networks.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic embedding of multilayer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multilayer networks offer a powerful framework for modeling complex systems across diverse domains, effectively capturing multiple types of connections and interdependent subsystems commonly found in real world scenarios. To analyze these networks, embedding techniques that project nodes into a lower-dimensional geometric space are essential. This paper introduces a novel hyperbolic embedding framework that advances the state of the art in multilayer network analysis. Our method, which supports heterogeneous node sets across networks and inter-layer connections, generates layer-specific hyperbolic embeddings, enabling detailed intra-layer analysis and inter-layer comparisons, while simultaneously preserving the global multilayer structure within hyperbolic space, a capability that sets it apart from existing approaches, which typically rely on independent embedding of layers. Through experiments on synthetic multilayer stochastic block models, we demonstrate that our approach effectively preserves community structure, even when layers consist of different node sets. When applied to real brain networks, the method successfully clusters disease-related brain regions from different patients, outperforming layer-independent approaches and highlighting its relevance for comparative analysis. Overall, this work provides a robust tool for multilayer network analysis, enhancing interpretability and offering new insights into the structure and function of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Multiscale mobility patterns and the restriction of human movement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.06323v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From the perspective of human mobility, the COVID-19 pandemic constituted a natural experiment of enormous reach in space and time. Here, we analyse the inherent multiple scales of human mobility using Facebook Movement Maps collected before and during the first UK lockdown. First, we obtain the pre-lockdown UK mobility graph, and employ multiscale community detection to extract, in an unsupervised manner, a set of robust partitions into flow communities at different levels of coarseness. The partitions so obtained capture intrinsic mobility scales with better coverage than NUTS regions, which suffer from mismatches between human mobility and administrative divisions. Furthermore, the flow communities in the fine scale partition match well the UK Travel to Work Areas (TTWAs) but also capture mobility patterns beyond commuting to work. We also examine the evolution of mobility under lockdown, and show that mobility first reverted towards fine scale flow communities already found in the pre-lockdown data, and then expanded back towards coarser flow communities as restrictions were lifted. The improved coverage induced by lockdown is well captured by a linear decay shock model, which allows us to quantify regional differences both in the strength of the effect and the recovery time from the lockdown shock.</description>

      <title>LGDE: Local Graph-based Dictionary Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07764v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Local Graph-based Dictionary Expansion (LGDE), a method for data-driven discovery of the semantic neighbourhood of words using tools from manifold learning and network science. At the heart of LGDE lies the creation of a word similarity graph from the geometry of word embeddings followed by local community detection based on graph diffusion. The diffusion in the local graph manifold allows the exploration of the complex nonlinear geometry of word embeddings to capture word similarities based on paths of semantic association, over and above direct pairwise similarities. Exploiting such semantic neighbourhoods enables the expansion of dictionaries of pre-selected keywords, an important step for tasks in information retrieval, such as database queries and online data collection. We validate LGDE on two user-generated English-language corpora and show that LGDE enriches the list of keywords with improved performance relative to methods based on direct word similarities or co-occurrences. We further demonstrate our method through a real-world use case from communication science, where LGDE is evaluated quantitatively on the expansion of a conspiracy-related dictionary from online data collected and analysed by domain experts. Our empirical results and expert user assessment indicate that LGDE expands the seed dictionary with more useful keywords due to the manifold-learning-based similarity network.</description>
