      <title>Type Theory for the Working Mathematical Music Theorist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many formal languages of contemporary mathematical music theory -- particularly those employing category theory -- are powerful but cumbersome: ideas that are conceptually simple frequently require expression through elaborate categorical constructions such as functor categories. This paper proposes a remedy in the form of a type-theoretic symbolic language that enables mathematical music theorists to build and reason about musical structures more intuitively, without relinquishing the rigor of their categorical foundations. Type theory provides a syntax in which elements, functions, and relations can be expressed in simple terms, while categorical semantics supplies their mathemusical interpretation. Within this system, reasoning itself becomes constructive: propositions and proofs are treated as objects, yielding a framework in which the formation of structures and the reasoning about them take place within the same mathematical language. The result is a concise and flexible formalism that restores conceptual transparency to mathemusical thought and supports new applications, illustrated here through the theory of voice-leading spaces.</description>

      <title>Torsion and complete dualizable objects in tensor-triangulated categories over a Noetherian ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study categories of dualizable torsion and complete objects for compactly-rigidly generated tensor-triangulated categories T with a Noetherian central action of a graded commutative Noetherian ring R. We show that they always admit a natural Noetherian action of the completed graded ring R^ and that the categories of dualizable torsion and complete objects can be abstractly reconstructed as tensor-triangulated R^-linear categories from the category of compact torsions objects with the corresponding structure. If the category of compact objects of T in addition admits a strong generator g, we show that the torsion coreflection (resp. complete reflection) of g is a strong generator for the category of dualizable torsion (resp. dualizable complete) objects. In that case, we also show that the categories of dualizable torsion and compact torsion objects determine each other in terms of Brown-type representability theorems.</description>

      <title>Modular operads, iterated distributive laws and a nerve theorem for circuit algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Circuit algebras are a symmetric version of Jones's planar algebras. They originated in quantum topology as a framework for encoding virtual crossings. Oriented circuit algebras are equivalent to wheeled props. This paper
  extends existing results for modular operads to construct a graphical calculus and monad for general circuit algebras and prove an abstract nerve theorem. Specialisations of these results to wheeled props follow as straightforward corollaries.
  The machinery used to prove these results relies on a subtle interplay between distributive laws and abstract nerve theory, and provides extra insights into the underlying structures.</description>

      <title>What is a monoid?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many situations one encounters an entity that resembles a monoid. It consists of a carrier and two operations that resemble a unit and a multiplication, subject to three equations that resemble associativity and left and right unital laws. The question then arises whether this entity is, in fact, a monoid in a suitable sense.
  Category theorists have answered this question by providing a notion of monoid in a monoidal category, or more generally in a multicategory. While these encompass many examples, there remain cases which do not fit into these frameworks, such as the notion of relative monad and the modelling of call-by-push-value sequencing. In each of these examples, the leftmost and/or the rightmost factor of a multiplication or associativity law seems to be distinguished.
  To include such examples, we generalize the multicategorical framework in two stages.
  Firstly, we move to the framework of a left-skew multicategory (due to Bourke and Lack), which generalizes both multicategory and left-skew monoidal category. The notion of monoid in this framework encompasses examples where only the leftmost factor is distinguished, such as the notion of relative monad.
  Secondly, we consider monoids in the novel framework of a bi-skew multicategory. This encompasses examples where both the leftmost and the rightmost factor are distinguished, such as the notion of a category on a span, and the modelling of call-by-push-value sequencing.
  In the bi-skew framework (which is the most general), we give a coherence result saying that a monoid corresponds to an unbiased monoid, i.e. a map from the terminal bi-skew multicategory.</description>
