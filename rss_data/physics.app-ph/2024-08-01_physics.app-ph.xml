      <title>Effective Magnetic Switching of THz Signal in Planar Structured Spintronic Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21623v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate an efficient swithcable spintronic THz emission from a Co(2nm)/Pt(2nm) bilayer split into a grating of micro- or nanostripes in applied external magnetic field of the order of 10mT. The THz signal is effectively emitted if the samples are magnetized perpendicular to the stripes direction and decreases upon a 90-degree rotation of a sample. The maximal 27-fold ratio of amplitude change is achieved for the sample with a $2 \mu m$ width of stripes. For the samples with easy magnetization axis directed perpendicular to stripes the THz signal is linearly polarized in the direction of the stripes and abruptly switches during the sample re-magnetization process. If the easy axis is along the stripes the THz source is almost switched off in a zero magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Charged-impurity free printing-based diffusion doping in molybdenum disulfide field-effect transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In practical electronic applications, where doping is crucial to exploit large-area two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, surface charge transfer doping (SCTD) has emerged as a promising strategy to tailor their electrical characteristics. However, impurity scattering caused by resultant ionized dopants, after donating or withdrawing carriers, hinders transport in 2D semiconductor layers, limiting the carrier mobility. Here, we propose a diffusion doping method for chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown molybdenum disulfide that avoids interference from charged impurities. Selectively inkjet-printed dopants were introduced only on the contact region, allowing excessively donated electrons to diffuse to the channel layer due to the electron density difference. Therefore, diffusion-doped molybdenum disulfide FETs do not have undesirable charged impurities on the channel, exhibiting over two-fold higher field-effect mobility compared with conventional direct-doped ones. Our study paves the way for a new doping strategy that simultaneously suppresses charged impurity scattering and facilitates the tailoring of the SCTD effect.</description>

      <title>Graded lithium-ion battery pouch cells to homogenise current distributions and mitigate lithium plating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial distributions in current, temperature, state-of-charge and degradation across the plane of large format lithium-ion battery pouch cells can significantly impact their performance, especially at high C-rates. In this paper, a method to smooth out these spatial distributions by grading the electrode microstructure in-the-plane is proposed. A mathematical model of a large format pouch cell is developed and validated against both temperature and voltage experimental data. An analytic solution for the optimal graded electrode that achieves a uniform current distribution across the pouch cell is then derived. The model predicts that the graded electrodes could significantly reduce the likelihood of lithium plating in large format pouch cells, with grading increasing the C-rate at which plating occurs from 2.75C to 5.5C. These results indicate the potential of designing spatially varying electrode architectures to homogenise the response of large format pouch cells and improve their high rate performance.</description>

      <title>Shadow Area and Degrees-of-Freedom for Free-Space Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The number of degrees-of-freedom (NDoF) in a communication system is limited by the number of antenna ports, element shapes, positions, and the propagation environment. As the number of antenna elements increases within a given region, the NDoF eventually saturates due to correlation of the radiated fields. The maximal NDoF can be determined numerically for communication between two regions using singular value decomposition of a channel model representing wave propagation between densely sampled sources at the transmitter and fields at the receiver. This paper provides a straightforward analytical estimate of the NDoF for arbitrarily shaped transmitter and receiver regions. The analysis show that the NDoF for electrically large regions is approximated by the mutual shadow area of the regions, measured in wavelengths. Several setups illustrate the results, which are then compared with numerical evaluations of the singular values of the propagation channel. These new analytical expressions also simplify to previously established results based on Weyl's law and the paraxial approximation.</description>

      <title>Bimodal Scaling Law and Size Effect In Superelastic Nanopillars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shape memory alloys that can deform and then spring back to their original shape, have found a wide range of applications in the medical field, from heart valves to stents. As we push the boundaries of technology creating smaller, more precise tools for delicate surgery treatments, the behavior of these alloys at tiny scales becomes increasingly crucial. In this study, we discover that the size effect of critical stress required for stress-induced phase transformation is not universal. We propose an orientation-dependent power decay law, indicating a specific increase in critical stress for pillars smaller than 1 micron meter for the nominally soft [001] and hard [111] orientations. Additionally, we observe high transformability with 11\% recoverable strain under high stress (2 GPa) through lattice frustration at 200nm scale. This research opens new avenues for exploring the superior elastic behavior of shape memory alloys for nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Multiple sliding ferroelectricity of rhombohedral-stacked InSe for reconfigurable photovoltaics and imaging applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through stacking engineering of two-dimensional (2D) materials, a switchable interface polarization can be generated through interlayer sliding, so called sliding ferroelectricity, which is advantageous over the traditional ferroelectricity due to ultra-thin thickness, high switching speed and low fatigue. However, 2D materials with intrinsic sliding ferroelectricity are still rare, with the exception of rhombohedral-stacked MoS2, which limits sliding ferroelectricity for practical applications such as high-speed storage, photovoltaic, and neuromorphic computing. Here, we reported the observation of sliding ferroelectricity with multiple states in undoped rhombohedral-stacked InSe ({\gamma}-InSe) via dual-frequency resonance tracking piezoresponse force microscopy, scanning Kelvin probe microscopy and conductive atomic force microscopy. The tunable bulk photovoltaic effect via the electric field is achieved in the graphene/{\gamma}-InSe/graphene tunneling device with a photovoltaic current density of ~15 mA/cm2, which is attributed to the multiple sliding steps in {\gamma}-InSe according to our theoretical calculations. The vdw tunneling device also features a high photo responsivity of ~255 A/W and a fast response time for real-time imaging. Our work not only enriches rhombohedral-stacked 2D materials for sliding ferroelectricity, but also sheds light on their potential for tunable photovoltaics and imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Diffractive Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Waveguide design is crucial in developing efficient light delivery systems, requiring meticulous material selection, precise manufacturing, and rigorous performance optimization, including dispersion engineering. Here, we introduce universal diffractive waveguide designs that can match the performance of any conventional dielectric waveguide and achieve various functionalities. Optimized using deep learning, our diffractive waveguide designs can be cascaded to each other to form any desired length and are comprised of transmissive diffractive surfaces that permit the propagation of desired guided modes with low loss and high mode purity. In addition to guiding the targeted modes along the propagation direction through cascaded diffractive units, we also developed various waveguide components and introduced bent diffractive waveguides, rotating the direction of mode propagation, as well as programmable mode filtering and mode splitting diffractive waveguide designs, showcasing the versatility of this platform. This diffractive waveguide framework was experimentally validated in the terahertz (THz) spectrum using 3D-printed diffractive layers to selectively pass certain spatial modes while rejecting others. Diffractive waveguides can be scaled to operate at different wavelengths, including visible and infrared parts of the spectrum, without the need for material dispersion engineering, providing an alternative to traditional waveguide components. This advancement will have potential applications in telecommunications, imaging, sensing and spectroscopy, among others.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature efficient single-photon generation from CdSe/ZnS nanoplateletes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the search for materials for quantum information science applications, colloidal semiconductor nanoplatelets (NPLs) have emerged as a highly promising new class of materials due to their interesting optical properties, such as narrow emission linewidth and fast photoluminescence (PL) lifetimes at room temperature. So far only few works focused on the quantum properties of their emission, however, NPLs, with their atomic-scale thickness and one-dimensional quantum confinement, are promising candidates for single-photon sources. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature single-photon emission from core/shell CdSe/ZnS NPLs, which feature 8$x$20 nm$^2$ surface area and 1 nm shell. The limited surface area ensures effective Auger non-radiative recombination, resulting in highly efficient single-photon generation with values of photon purity as low as $g^{(2)}(\tau)=0.04$. The observed long-period blinking and bleaching, typical of such thin shells, can be easily reduced by increasing the shell thickness. This work establishes NPLs as new single-photon sources very well suited for integration into quantum photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Response of a multi-wavelength laser to single-sideband optical injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-mode semiconductor lasers subject to optical injection have been shown to trigger a wide range of dynamical behavior from injection locking to chaos. Multi-wavelength lasers add even more degrees of freedom and complexity to the dynamical repertoire potentially unlocking new functionalities for applications ranging from THz generation and processing to all-optical memories. In particular, leveraging the inherent mode coupling in multi-wavelength lasers, spectral multiplication over a THz range of an injected optical signal has been shown. While most of the research on optical injection has been focused on single-mode semiconductor lasers, the dynamical behavior of multi-wavelength lasers, particularly when subjected to injection of amplitude-modulated signals remains vastly unexplored. In this work, we numerically and experimentally investigate the response of an on-chip dual-wavelength laser subject to the optical injection of a single-sideband signal around one of the modes of the laser. Our findings show an asymmetric power evolution of the sidebands appearing around both the injected and un-injected modes with respect to the modulation frequency. The power and bandwidth of the sideband signals strongly depend on the resonance frequency produced by the interference between the cavity mode and the injection, which can be tailored by twerking the strength and the detuning of the injection. The outcomes of our numerical investigations, based on rate equations, align closely with the experimental results highlighting the influence of key injection and laser parameters.</description>

      <title>Stable Perovskite Solar Cells via exfoliated graphite as an ion diffusion-blocking layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ion and metal diffusion in metal halide perovskites, charge-transporting layers, and electrodes are detrimental to the performance and stability of perovskite-based photovoltaic devices. As a result, there is an intense research interest in developing novel defect and ion diffusion mitigation strategies. We present a simple, low-cost, scalable, and highly effective method that uses spray-coated exfoliated graphite interlayers to block ion and metal diffusion and humidity ingress within the perovskite, the hole transport material, and metal electrodes. The influence of inserting the exfoliated graphite films on the structural, surface morphology, and optoelectronic properties were examined through various methods, including X-ray diffraction, Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry, Scanning electron microscope, atomic force microscopy, Current-voltage (J-V) characteristics, Transient photocurrent, and transient photovoltage. Our comprehensive investigation found that exfoliated graphite films reduced the I- and Li+ diffusion among the layers, leading to defect mitigation, reducing non-radiative recombination, and enhancing the device stability. Consequently, the best-performing device demonstrated a power conversion efficiency of 25% and a fill factor exceeding 80%. Additionally, these devices were subjected to different lifetime tests, which significantly enhanced the operational stability.</description>

      <title>Hyperspectral near infrared imaging using a tunable spectral phasor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging captures both spectral and spatial information from a sample. The near infrared (NIR, &gt; 800 nm) is advantageous for biomedical imaging as it falls into the tissue transparency window but also contains vibrational overtone and combination modes useful for molecular fingerprinting. Here, we demonstrate hyperspectral NIR imaging using a spectral phasor transformation (HyperNIR). This method employs a liquid crystal variable retarder (LCVR) for tunable, wavelength-dependent sine-, cosine and no filtering that transforms optical signals into phasor space. Spectral information is thus obtained with just three images. The LCVR can be adjusted to cover a spectral range from 900 nm to 1600 nm in windows tunable from 50 nm to 700 nm. This approach enables distinguishing NIR fluorophores with emission peaks less than 5 nm apart. Furthermore, we demonstrate label-free hyperspectral NIR reflectance imaging to identify plastic polymers and to monitor in vivo plant health. The approach uses the full camera resolution and reaches hyperspectral frame rates of 0.2 per second, limited only by the switching rate of the LCVR. HyperNIR facilitates straightforward hyperspectral imaging with standard NIR cameras for applications in biomedical imaging and environmental monitoring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing and optimizing optical amplifiers to maximize system performance is becoming increasingly important as optical communication systems strive to increase throughput. Offline optimization of optical amplifiers relies on models ranging from white-box models deeply rooted in physics to black-box data-driven and physics-agnostic models. Here, we compare the capabilities of white-, grey- and black-box models on the challenging test case of optimizing a bidirectional distributed Raman amplifier to achieve a target frequency-distance signal power profile. We show that any of the studied methods can achieve similar frequency and distance flatness of between 1 and 3.6 dB (depending on the definition of flatness) over the C-band in an 80-km span. Then, we discuss the models' applicability, advantages, and drawbacks based on the target application scenario, in particular in terms of flexibility, optimization speed, and access to training data.</description>

      <title>Unifying thermophotovoltaic performance metrics with technoeconomics: the relative importance of efficiency vs. power density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermophotovoltaics (TPV) are becoming a promising new heat engine with rapid recent gains in performance. Their performance is characterized by two metrics: efficiency and power density. As we bridge the gap between lab-scale and system-scale devices, we need to understand how each of these metrics impacts the technoeconomics of a TPV system. In this work, we develop a technoeconomic metric based on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) to understand how the metrics should be weighted relative to each other in terms of importance. We find that systems with high infrastructure and fuel costs should prioritize TPV efficiency, while systems where the TPV cell cost dominates should prioritize power density. We then evaluate how concrete cell improvements could improve the technoeconomics of five example systems, identifying the most impactful specific properties. Namely, improving spectral control with sub-bandgap reflectance is the most effective at reducing LCOE in systems with high infrastructure cost, while increasing view factor and reducing series resistance are most critical in systems with high TPV cell cost. Improving just 1-2 of these properties can reduce the LCOE by 30-50%, reaching competitive values of 8 cents/kWh. This study therefore helps researchers understand which performance metric is more important for their application and how to achieve high values of this performance metric.</description>
