      <title>Aletheia: Emulating the non-linear matter power spectrum in the context of evolution mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Aletheia, a new emulator of the non-linear matter power spectrum, $P(k)$, built upon the evolution mapping framework. This framework addresses the limitations of traditional emulation by focusing on $h$-independent cosmological parameters, which can be separated into those defining the linear power spectrum shape ($\mathbf{\Theta}_{\mathrm{s}}$) and those affecting only its amplitude evolution ($\mathbf{\Theta}_{\mathrm{e}}$). The combined impact of evolution parameters and redshift is compressed into a single amplitude parameter, $\sigma_{12}$. Aletheia uses a two-stage Gaussian Process emulation: a primary emulator predicts the non-linear boost factor as a function of ($\mathbf{\Theta}_{\mathrm{s}}$) and $\sigma_{12}$ for fixed evolution parameters, while a second one applies a small linear correction based on the integrated growth history. The emulator is trained on shape parameters spanning $\pm$5$\sigma$ of Planck constraints and a wide clustering range $0.2 &lt; \sigma_{12} &lt; 1.0$, providing predictions for $0.006\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1} &lt; k &lt; 2\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. We validate Aletheia against N-body simulations, demonstrating sub-percent accuracy. When tested on a suite of dynamic dark energy models, the full emulator's predictions show a variance of approximately 0.2%, a factor of five smaller than that of the state-of-the-art EuclidEmulator2 (around 1% variance). Furthermore, Aletheia maintains sub-percent accuracy for the best-fit dynamic dark energy cosmology from recent DESI data, a model whose parameters lie outside the training ranges of most conventional emulators. This demonstrates the power of the evolution mapping approach, providing a robust and extensible tool for precision cosmology.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Model Dependence of MCMC-Based 21 cm Power Spectrum Parameter Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection and analysis of the cosmic 21 cm signal of neutral hydrogen has long been considered the most promising route towards exploration of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). 21CMMC, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler of the semi-numerical simulation code 21cmFAST, has already been used in conjunction with published upper limits on the 21 cm signal from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), and the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) to constrain the astrophysics of the EoR. Here we investigate the extent to which analysis of the EoR performed using 21CMMC is dependent on the underlying semi-numerical model. We used 21cmFAST to simulate two datasets of 21 cm light-cones which differ only in the algorithm used to identify ionized regions (the so-called "bubble-finding" algorithm). We then tested 21CMMC's ability to return key astrophysical parameters when using the different bubble-finding algorithms. We find that the performance of 21CMMC depends sensitively on the agreement between the astrophysical model of our mock data and the model used for sampling. This result has important implications for the analysis of the 21 cm signal performed using 21CMMC and further motivates investigation into model-independent analysis techniques for 21 cm EoR data.</description>

      <title>Large Scale White Noise and Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of white noise on large scales is a generic property of the dynamics of physical systems described by local non-linear partial differential equations. Non-linearities prevent the small scale dynamics from being erased by smoothing. Unresolved small scale dynamics act as an uncorrelated (white or Poissonian) noise (seemingly stochastic but actually deterministic) contribution to large scale dynamics. This white noise exists even when the dynamics is very nearly linear. In cases where the power spectrum is sub-Poissonian on large scales, this noise will dominate on the largest scale power no matter the amplitude of the inhomogeneities. Such is the case in the standard model of cosmology, where the primordial density power spectrum is expected to have an almost Harrison-Zel'dovich, $P[k]\sim k$, spectrum on a much broader range of scales than can be observed. Even though linear gravitational evolution dominates non-linear corrections by a factor $\sim10^5$, the non-observation of white noise on the Hubble scale precludes the extrapolation of this power law below the comoving $1\,$pc scale. More generally, observation or non-observation of large scale white noise provides a powerful probe of the universe on very small scales in the early early universe. Gravitational radiation, phase transitions, vorticity, and running of the spectral index are all phenomena that can be probed with large scale white noise. Large scale white noise is a non-optional feature of all cosmological models but one which has not heretofore been appreciated.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Origin of the Tully-Fisher Relation in Dark Matter Dominated Galaxies: A Theoretical-Empirical Derivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we introduce the concept of self-interacting dark matter with scale-dependent equation of state, in the context of which dark matter is collisional and its equation of state is radius-dependent and has the form $P(r)=K(r)\left(\frac{\rho(r)}{\rho_{\star}}\right)^{\gamma(r)}$. We confronted the effectively 2-parameter model with 174 galaxies from the SPARC data, and we found that the rotation curves of 100 galaxies can be perfectly fitted by the model. These galaxies are dark matter dominated, mostly dwarfs, low-luminosity and low-surface-brightness spiral galaxies. We demonstrate that scale-dependent self-interacting dark matter solves the cusp-core issue for dark matter dominated galaxies. More importantly, the structure of the scale-dependent SIDM model produces in a semi-theoretically and semi-empirically way the canonical Tully-Fisher and the baryonic Tully-Fisher relations when these 100 viable dwarfs, low-surface-brightness and low-luminosity galaxies are taken into account. The behavior of the entropy function $K(r)$ is assumed to be $K(r)=K_0\times\left(1+\frac{r}{r_c}\right)^{-p}$. The perfect fits of the rotation curves come for a nearly isothermal and virialized dark matter halo, which naturally predicts the correlation $K_0\sim V_{\mathrm{max}}^2$. This correlation holds true empirically as confirmed by the data and we also find empirically $L\sim K_0^2$ from the data, thus the canonical Tully-Fisher relation is reproduced semi-theoretically and semi-empirically. We perform the same task and we find theoretically, for dark matter dominated galaxies, that $K_0\sim V_{\mathrm{flat}}^2$ which is also confirmed empirically from the data, along with the correlation $K_0\sim M_b^{0.5}$, hence the baryonic Tully-Fisher law naturally emerges in a semi-theoretical and semi-empirical manner.</description>

      <title>Accessing the homogeneity scale with 21 cm intensity mapping surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The homogeneity scale, $R_{\rm H}$, offers a fundamental test of the Cosmological Principle, yet it has not yet been measured with 21cm intensity mapping surveys. A key limitation for such a measurement is the telescope beam, which artificially smooths the observed signal. We quantify this effect using the two-point correlation function and the correlation dimension, $\mathcal{D}_2(r)$, to model how beam convolution suppresses intrinsic clustering. For any given redshift $z$, we identify a maximum beam width, $\sigma_{\rm max}(z)$, beyond which the homogeneity scale cannot be recovered. This limit defines an inaccessible region in the $\sigma \times z$ parameter space, where $R_{\rm H}$ is erased by beam smoothing. Applying this framework to several current and upcoming radio telescopes, we assess their ability to probe $R_{\rm H}$. Our results provide the first quantitative forecast of the instrumental requirements for measuring the cosmic homogeneity scale with 21cm IM, and establish a theoretical basis for future observational applications.</description>

      <title>Photon rest mass from localized fast radio bursts with improved distribution of dispersion measure from extragalactic gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The assumption that photons are massless is a foundational postulate of modern physics, yet it remains subject to experimental verification. Fast radio bursts (FRBs), with their cosmological distances and precisely measured dispersion, offer an excellent laboratory for testing this hypothesis. In this work, we propose an improved distribution function for the dispersion measure arising from extragalactic gas and demonstrate that it provides an excellent fit to mock data. We then apply this distribution to constrain the photon rest mass under the $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM cosmological models, the last of which is favored by recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation observations. The corresponding 1$\sigma$ upper limits on the photon mass are found to be $4.83\times10^{-51}\,\mathrm{kg}$, $4.71\times10^{-51}\,\mathrm{kg}$, and $4.86\times10^{-51}\,\mathrm{kg}$, respectively, which are the most stringent constraints derived from FRBs to date. These results indicate that the choice of cosmological model has only a minor impact on photon-mass bounds, demonstrate that FRBs provide robust and reliable constraints, and offer strong empirical support for the massless nature of the photon.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of magnetic monopole evolution in an expanding universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic monopoles are an inevitable feature of post-inflation symmetry-breaking phase transitions in grand unified theories. Analytic estimates of their density indicate that they are compatible with standard cosmology only if their mass is less than $10^{11}$ GeV. We initiate a programme of numerical studies of monopole dynamics by simulating a gas of 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles formed by the Kibble mechanism after a phase transition. In this paper we simulate monopoles in a radiation background, but without interactions with the radiation, in order to resolve differences between analytical models. We find that during the radiation era, the monopoles find each other and annihilate efficiently enough to keep their density fraction constant, which supports the modelling of Zel'dovich and Khlopov and Preskill in the epoch when plasma interactions can be neglected. In the matter era the density fraction decreases logarithmically. Further work is needed to quantify the effect of the thermal bath, which is expected to reduce the annihilation rate at later times.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking as a Late-Time Trigger for Interacting Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent tensions in the Hubble constant (H0) and the matter clustering parameter (S8) motivate late-time new physics that suppresses structure growth without significantly altering the background expansion history of the LambdaCDM model. We study a class of dark-sector dynamics in which a scalar dark energy field, governed by a Z2-symmetric quartic potential, interacts with dark matter through Yukawa and portal couplings. When the matter density drops below a critical threshold, a cosmological spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism generates a time-dependent vacuum expectation value v(a) and activates an effective coupling eta(a). This creates a symmetric phase (a &lt;= ac) identical to LambdaCDM at early times, and a broken phase (a &gt; ac) in which eta(a) &gt; 0 transfers energy from dark matter to dark energy, suppressing linear structure growth. Using RSD, BAO, cosmic chronometers, Pantheon+SH0ES supernovae, and compressed Planck distance priors, we compare a fixed LambdaCDM background with a self-consistent coupled-scalar evolution. The RSD-only analysis shows a strong shift: the dynamical background gives Omega_m ~ 0.31 +/- 0.10 and sigma8,0 ~ 0.59 +/- 0.01, while the fixed-background case gives Omega_m ~ 0.20 +/- 0.09 and sigma8,0 ~ 0.75 +/- 0.05. In the full joint fit, we obtain Omega_m = 0.29 +/- 0.01, H0 = 69.7 +/- 0.6 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, and sigma8,0 = 0.78 +/- 0.01. A late-time interaction triggered by spontaneous symmetry breaking can therefore damp structure growth and ease the S8 tension while leaving the expansion history and the inferred H0 essentially unchanged, suggesting distinct physical origins for the two tensions.</description>

      <title>On the impact of the supernova subsamples in reducing the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The persistent 4-6$\sigma$ difference between early- and late-time Hubble constant ($H_{0}$) measurements, known as the "Hubble tension," is a major problem in modern cosmology. We study how differences in colour ($c$), stretch ($x_{1}$), and host galaxy properties-stellar mass ($M$) and specific star formation rate (sSFR)-between calibration and Hubble Flow (HF) Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) samples used by SH0ES affect SN luminosity standardization and $H_{0}$ estimates. We generate subsamples from both, estimating $H_{0}$, $M_{B}$, $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\Delta_{host}$, and $\sigma_{int}$. We use Kolmogorov-Smirnov to assess the consistency between subsamples and reveal how parameter estimates change as sample matching improves. The calibration sample is not fully representative of the HF sample, especially in $M$ and sSFR. Improving sample consistency leads to changes in $H_{0}$, $M_{B}$, $\alpha$, and $\sigma_{int}$, though overall values remain broadly stable. Better-matched subsamples tend to yield a mass step consistent with zero within 1$\sigma$. By disentangling SN subpopulations, we find persistent differences in $H_{0}$ ($\sim$2-3$\sigma$) and $M_{B}$ ($\sim2\sigma$) between low- and high-stretch SNe: $H_{0} = 75.27 \pm 1.18$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ for low-stretch and $H_{0} = 71.25 \pm 1.59$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ for high-stretch, resulting in Hubble tensions of 6.07$\sigma$ and 2.52$\sigma$. These differences suggest SNe Ia subpopulations with varying dust and intrinsic colour not captured by a single $\beta$, impacting cosmology. Estimating a single $H_{0}$ for both subpopulations yields $H_{0} = 73.78 \pm 2.17$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, with a much larger uncertainty that lowers the Hubble tension from $5.87\sigma$ to $\sim2.86\sigma$. Our results suggest that the mass step may arise from an over-correction of more than one SN subpopulation associated to different environments.</description>

      <title>The SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey: X-ray scaling relations of galaxy groups and clusters in the western Galactic hemisphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The soft X-ray telescope on board the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission, eROSITA (extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array), has produced the largest sample to date of galaxy groups and clusters detected via their intracluster/intragroup medium (ICM/IGrM) emission. Scaling relations between the intrinsic properties of these systems provide valuable insight into their formation and evolution. In this work, we investigate the scaling relations between key physical properties, such as soft band X-ray luminosity, temperature, gas mass, and the low-scatter mass proxy $Y_{\rm X}$, for the galaxy groups and clusters detected in the first eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1). Our analysis fully accounts for selection effects and the redshift evolution of the observable distributions. We construct a high-purity sample of $3061$ galaxy groups and clusters spanning the redshift range $0.05&lt;z&lt;1.07$ and mass range of $1.1\times10^{13}&lt;M_{500}/$M$_{\odot}&lt;1.6\times10^{15}$. This represents the largest sample to date used for scaling relation analysis. The selection function, derived from state-of-the-art simulations of the eROSITA sky, is rigorously incorporated into our modeling. We report best-fit parameters - normalization, slope, redshift evolution, and intrinsic scatter - for a set of scaling relations: $L_{\mathrm{X}}-T$, $L_{\mathrm{X}}-M_{\rm gas}$, $L_{\mathrm{X}}-Y_{\rm X}$, as well as the $M_{\rm gas}-T$ relation. Our best-fit models indicate that the slopes of the scaling relations deviate significantly from self-similar expectations, while the redshift evolution remains consistent with the self-similar model. The fits exhibit small statistical uncertainties, likely owing to the large sample size. Our results are in good agreement with previous observational studies that account for selection effects, as well as with simulations that incorporate non-gravitational physics.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Fields in the Shapley Supercluster Core with POSSUM: Challenging Model Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14377v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faraday Rotation Measure (RM) Grids provide a sensitive means to trace magnetized plasma across a wide range of cosmic environments. We study the RM signal from the Shapley Supercluster Core (SSC), in order to constrain the magnetic field properties of the gas. The SSC region consists of two galaxy clusters A3558 and A3562, and two galaxy groups between them, at $z\simeq 0.048$. We combine RM Grid data with thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect data, obtained from the POSSUM pilot survey, and Planck, respectively. To robustly determine the gas density, its magnetic field properties, and their correlation, we study the RM scatter in the SSC region and its behavior as a function of distance to the nearest cluster/group. We compare observational results with semi-analytic Gaussian random field models and more realistic cosmological MHD simulations. With a sky-density of 36 RMs/deg$^{2}$, we detect an excess RM scatter of $30.5\pm 4.6 \, \mathrm{rad/m^2}$ in the SSC region. Comparing with models, we find an average magnetic field strength of 1-3 $\mu$G (in the groups and clusters). The RM scatter profile, derived from data ranging from 0.3-1.8 $r_{500}$ for all objects, is systematically flatter than expected compared to models, with $\eta&lt;0.5$ being favored. Despite this discrepancy, we find that cosmological MHD simulations matched to the SSC structure most closely align with scenarios where the magnetic field is amplified by the turbulent velocity in the intercluster regions on scales $\lesssim 0.8\,r_{500}$. The dense RM grid and precision provided by POSSUM allows us to probe magnetized gas in the SSC clusters and groups on scales within and beyond their $r_{500}$. Flatter-than-expected RM scatter profiles reveal a significant challenge in reconciling observations with even the most realistic predictions from cosmological MHD simulations in the outskirts of interacting clusters.</description>

Abstract: We study the cosmological impact of ultralight dark matter (ULDM) with a quadratic coupling to Standard Model particles. In addition to the suppression of small-scale power from ULDM itself, the coupling induces a variation of fundamental constants that is modulated by the ULDM oscillatory field value. In this work, we consider the ULDM-induced, time-dependent variation of the fine structure constant and the mass of the electron. These variations modify the predicted abundance of light elements during Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and the process of recombination, thereby affecting the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We use CMB anisotropy data and baryon acoustic oscillation measurements to obtain constraints on the variation of couplings over a wide range of ULDM masses. We self-consistently account for the modification of the primordial helium abundance during BBN in computing the CMB power spectra. We find that the allowed ULDM fraction of total dark matter abundance is more constrained for ULDM masses $\lesssim 10^{-26}~\mathrm{eV}$ in the presence of the variations. Moreover, our constraints on the variational couplings for ULDM masses $\lesssim 10^{-27}~\mathrm{eV}$ are stronger than the ones derived from the primordial helium abundance at BBN. Under our ULDM model, the variation of fundamental constants has no appreciable impact on the Hubble constant inferred from CMB data and thus does not present a viable solution to the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Synchrotron Spectral Parameters with QUIJOTE-MFI2 in combination with Planck and WMAP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a parametric component separation forecast for the QUIJOTE-MFI2 instrument (10-20 GHz), assessing its impact on constraining polarised synchrotron emission at $1^\circ$ FWHM and $N_{\rm side}=64$. Using simulated sky maps based on power-law and curved synchrotron spectra, we show that adding QUIJOTE-MFI2 to existing WMAP+$Planck$+MFI data yields statistically unbiased parameter estimates with substantial uncertainty reductions: improvement factors reach $\sim$10 for the synchrotron spectral index ($\beta_s$), $\sim$5 for the curvature parameter ($C_s$), and $\sim$43 for polarisation amplitudes in bright regions. Deep QUIJOTE cosmological fields enable $\beta_s$ constraints even in intrinsically low SNR regions where WMAP+$Planck$ alone remain prior-dominated. Current combined sensitivities are insufficient to detect a synchrotron curvature of $C_s=-0.052$ on a pixel-by-pixel basis, but a $2\sigma$ detection is achievable for $|C_s|\gtrsim 0.14$ in the brightest regions of the Galactic plane. In those deep cosmological fields, combining QUIJOTE-MFI2 with WMAP and $Planck$ reduces the median synchrotron residual at 100 GHz by a factor 2.2 (to 0.022 $\mu$K$_{\rm CMB}$) and the total residual by a factor 1.8 (to 0.030 $\mu$K$_{\rm CMB}$). These results demonstrate that QUIJOTE-MFI2 will provide critical low-frequency information for modelling Galactic synchrotron emission, offering valuable complementary constraints for future CMB surveys such as LiteBIRD and the Simons Observatory.</description>

      <title>High-resolution weak lensing mass mapping from DES-Y3 data using diffusion-based prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution mapping of cosmic mass distribution is essential for a variety of astrophysical applications including understanding cosmic structure formation, and galaxy formation and evolution. However dark matter is not directly observed and therefore we need advanced methods for solving inverse problems to reconstruct the underlying cosmic matter distribution. Here, we train a generative diffusion model and use it in the Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) framework to reconstruct mass maps from Dark Energy Survey-Year 3 (DES-Y3) weak gravitational lensing data at high (1 arcminute) resolution. We show that the standard DPS results are biased, but they can be easily corrected by scaling the log-likelihood score during the diffusion process, yielding unbiased results with proper uncertainty quantification. The resulting mass maps reveal cosmic structures with enhanced detail, opening the door for improved astrophysical studies using the obtained mass maps.</description>

      <title>Closing in on $\alpha$-attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies combined with large-scale structure may point towards higher values of the scalar spectral index, $n_s$. This puts previously preferred inflationary models, such as $\alpha$-attractors, in tension with the new measurements. Pending a resolution of the tension between BAO parameters as determined by CMB datasets and those determined by DESI, we explore in this work the large-$n_s$ regime of $\alpha$-attractor T-models. We show that some T-models can self-consistently produce an extended reheating stage with a stiff equation of state $(\bar w&gt;1/3)$, which allows values for $n_s$ closer to unity. We employ constraints from P-ACT-LB-BK18 data to illustrate what large-$n_s$ observations might imply for T-models. We show that the $n_s$ measurement yields an upper limit on $\alpha$ that is stronger than the one from the tensor-to-scalar ratio only. We find that $n_s$ is maximised for $\alpha\sim1$, therefore the seven Poincar\'e models are well placed to deliver large $n_s$. However, the ability of a stiff reheating stage to increase the compatibility of T-models with large-$n_s$ measurements saturates as $\bar{w}\to1$. Thanks to this effect, we establish that the largest $n_s$ that T-models can produce is $n_s=0.9682$. T-models are therefore highly predictive in the large-$n_s$ regime and our result provides, under the assumption of perturbative reheating, a benchmark which could be used in the future to rule out T-models.</description>

      <title>Equilateral non-Gaussian Bias at the Field Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) is a common prediction of a wide class of inflationary models. Equilateral-type PNG, generically predicted by single-field inflationary models with higher-derivative interactions, imprints subtle but measurable signatures on the large-scale distribution of matter. An important parameter of these imprints is the PNG-induced bias coefficient $b_\psi$, which quantifies how the abundance and clustering of dark matter halos and galaxies respond to mode coupling in the initial conditions. Measuring $b_\psi$ is important for constraining equilateral PNG, yet it is notoriously challenging due to its degeneracy with Gaussian scale-dependent bias contributions. In this work, we present the first precision measurements of equilateral $b_\psi$ for dark matter halos using effective field theory at the field level. We show that this approach disentangles PNG effects from those of the Gaussian bias by virtue of noise variance cancellation. We compare our results with the phenomenological predictions based on the Peak-Background Split model, finding some agreement at the qualitative level on the redshift and mass dependence, but poor agreement at the quantitative level. We present a fitting formula for $b_\psi$ as a function of the linear bias, which can be used to set priors in PNG searches with ongoing and future galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Nature of Dark Matter from Tidal Radii of Cluster Galaxy Subhalos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters provides a powerful probe of the spatial distribution of dark matter and its microphysical properties. Strong and weak lensing constraints on the density profiles of subhalos and their truncation radii offer key diagnostics for distinguishing between collisionless cold dark matter (CDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). Notably, in the strongly collisional SIDM regime, subhalo core collapse and enhanced mass loss from ram-pressure stripping predict steeper central density slopes and more compact truncation radii--features that are directly testable with current lensing data. We analyze subhalo truncation in eight lensing clusters (Abell 2218, 383, 963, 209, 2390, and MACS J0416.1, J1206.2, J1149.6) that span the redshift range &lt;$z_\text{spec}$&gt;$ \simeq 0.17$-$0.54$ with virial masses $M_{200} \simeq0.41$-$2.2\times 10^{15}$ M$_\odot$ to constrain SIDM versus CDM. Our results indicate that the outer spatial extents of subhalos are statistically consistent with CDM, corroborated by redshift- and mass-matched analogs from the Illustris-TNG simulations. We conclude that the tidal radii of cluster galaxy subhalos serve as an important and complementary diagnostic of the nature of dark matter in these violent, dense environments.</description>

      <title>The first data-driven bounds on the quantum decoherence of inflationary gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The (large-scale) structures we observe in the Universe are classical, but within the inflationary scenario they do originate from quantum fluctuations. This leads to the question: ''How did this quantum-to-classical transition occur?''. A potential explanation is quantum decoherence due to interactions between different fields present during inflation. The tensor modes (i.e. primordial gravitational waves) can interact with a scalar sector, causing their quantum decoherence to occur and inducing a change in the gravitational wave (GW) background. The power spectrum of these GWs can be constrained using the upper bounds found by Planck, BICEP/Keck Array, LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, and the Pulsar Timing Array detections. These impose constraints on the interaction between the fields. We find that the observational upper bounds mainly constrain scenarios with a strong interaction, especially if the interaction is also strongly time dependent. Furthermore, we find which observationally allowed scenarios have not completed decoherence by the end of inflation, thus possibly leaving quantum signatures in the GW background. Lastly, we show that, interestingly enough, there are decoherence scenarios corresponding to the signal observed by PTA experiments. This highlights the importance of the quantum decoherence effect on GWs.</description>

      <title>Stripped-Envelope Supernovae for QCD Axion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: QCD axions would be copiously produced in the proto-neutron star formed in a core-collapse supernova (SN). After escaping, they would convert into gamma rays in the Galactic magnetic field and, as recently shown, in that of the progenitor star itself. Here, we show that Type Ibc SNe -- whose progenitors have lost their hydrogen or even helium envelopes -- are the optimal targets for this search. The stripped progenitors are much more compact, and show larger magnetic fields than both red and blue supergiants, the progenitors of Type IIP/L SNe. If the next galactic SN is of Type Ibc, Fermi-LAT or a similar gamma-ray satellite might be able to discover the QCD axion down to masses as small as $m_a\simeq 10^{-4}\,\rm eV$ (Peccei-Quinn scale $f_a\simeq 10^{11} \,\rm GeV$).</description>

      <title>The observed total star formation rate function up to z \sim 6: complementary UV and IR contributions and comparison with state-of-the-art galaxy formation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the obscured IR-derived and the dust-corrected UV star formation rate functions (SFRFs) compare with each other, and with predictions from state-of-the-art theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution. We derive the IR-SFRF from the ALMA A$^3$COSMOS survey, by converting the IR luminosity functions (IR-LFs) into SFRF after correcting for AGN contribution. Similarly, we obtain the UV SFRFs from literature UV LFs, corrected for dust-extinction. First, we fit the two SFRFs independently via a MCMC approach, then we combine them to obtain the first estimate of the total SFRF out to $z \sim 6$. Finally, we compare this SFRF with the predictions of a set of theoretical models. We derived the UV (dust-extinction corrected, from literature UV-LFs) and IR SFRFs (from Herschel and ALMA IR-LFs) at $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 6$ , finding that they are mostly complementary, covering different ranges in star formation rate (SFR$ &lt; 10-100$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ for the UV-corrected and SFR$ &gt; 100$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ for the IR). From the comparison of the total SFRF with model predictions we find an overall good agreement at $z &lt; 2.5$, with increasing difference at higher redshifts, with all models missing the galaxies that are forming stars with the highest SFRs. We finally obtained the UV (dust-corrected), IR and total star formation rate densities (SFRDs), finding that there are no redshift ranges where UV and IR alone are able to reproduce the whole total SFRD.</description>

      <title>The Scoured Spike: Suppression of Indirect Dark Matter Signals by a Hidden Companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A massive "dark companion"-such as an intermediate-mass black hole or other compact dark object-orbiting the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center can dynamically reshape the surrounding dark-matter spike. Through gravitational heating and angular-momentum exchange, the companion excavates a "scoured" region that lowers the inner density and suppresses the expected annihilation signal. We quantify this effect by computing the suppression of the dark-matter annihilation $J$-factor induced by such a companion, combining an analytic scouring-radius model with full numerical integrations of the modified density profile. We scan the parameter space of companion mass, orbital separation, system age, and spike slope, explicitly including the interplay with the annihilation plateau. For canonical Gondolo-Silk spikes with $\gamma_{\rm sp} \gtrsim 2$, we find that the distribution is remarkably resilient and that the companion produces at most mild reductions of the $J$-factor. In contrast, for pre-heated or otherwise shallow spikes with $\gamma_{\rm sp} \lesssim 1.8$, even a modest $\sim 10^{4}\,M_\odot$ companion on a O(100) AU orbit and O(Gyr) age can suppress the annihilation flux by one to two orders of magnitude. The numerical results are accurately captured (typically at the $\lesssim 10\%$ level) by a simple fitting formula in terms of a dimensionless scouring parameter that measures the ratio between the scoured region and the annihilation core. Our findings demonstrate that neglecting a dark companion can lead to substantial overestimates of the Galactic Center $J$-factor, with direct consequences for interpreting gamma-ray, neutrino, and antimatter searches for annihilating dark matter.</description>

      <title>Infrared Quantum Electrodynamics and the Rayleigh-Jeans Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared quantum electrodynamics (IR-QED) acquires a natural geometric interpretation once soft photons are described as adiabatically transported electron-photon clouds. Within this framework, the relevant infrared structure is encoded in a functional Berry phase associated with the space of gauge connections, and the corresponding Berry corrections modify the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum. The infrared scaling symmetry of the Rayleigh-Jeans law leads to a simple renormalization-group equation whose solution determines the frequency dependence of an effective factor $F_{\rm eff}(\omega)$ controlling the strength of the electron-photon cloud dressing. As a result, the energy density of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) receives a Berry-induced correction that scales as a power law and produces a frequency-dependent temperature excess in the radio domain. Although the exponent $\gamma$ governing this scaling behaviour is not fixed internally by the present formulation of IR-QED and must instead be determined phenomenologically, the existence and structure of the excess are genuine predictions of the theory. Remarkably, the resulting expression is extremely simple and naturally aligns with the deviations suggested by the ARCADE 2 data. Taken together, these results indicate that Berry phases in IR-QED may lead to observable consequences in the low-frequency tail of the CMB spectrum.</description>

      <title>A non-local origin for massive gravity and late-time acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accelerated expansion of the universe poses a significant challenge to General Relativity. Non-local modifications to gravity have emerged as a compelling class of theories to address this dark energy puzzle. Building upon earlier proposals, we investigate a specific non-local modified gravity action incorporating terms like $R\Box^{-2}R$, $R^{\mu\nu}\Box^{-2}R_{\mu\nu}$, $R^{\mu\nu\sigma\delta}\Box^{-2}R_{\mu\nu\sigma\delta}$ and demonstrate that it provides a dynamical origin for a massive graviton by reducing to the standard and extended Fierz-Pauli action at the linearized level. A fixed-point analysis of the background cosmology reveals a stable de Sitter attractor, ensuring the model naturally drives accelerated expansion. Crucially, we investigate the cosmological perturbations and show that the theory's six propagating degrees of freedom are free from ghost instabilities. We further demonstrate that all large-scale tensor modes are dynamically stable and decay on the accelerating background. This ghost-free massive gravity extension provides distinct predictions for gravitational wave polarizations and is theoretically consistent with $\mathbf{\Lambda CDM}$ at late times, positioning it as a unique alternative to scalar-tensor models like $f(R)$ and Galileons. This robust stability at both the background and perturbative levels establishes our model as a consistent and compelling alternative to the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.</description>

      <title>Cosmological dynamics of interacting dark matter-dark energy in generalized Rastall gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate late-time interacting cosmologies within the framework of generalized Rastall gravity, where the interaction arises naturally from the non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor. We formulate the background evolution of the dark sector as an autonomous dynamical system, defining interaction terms $Q_1=\alpha\,\dot{f}$ and $Q_2=-\dot{f}\,(1+\alpha)$, with $\alpha$ a constant parameter and $f$ a time-dependent function. Three interaction cases are studied: $f \propto \rho_m$, $f \propto \rho_{de}$, and $f \propto \rho_m + \rho_{de}$, assuming a constant dark-energy equation of state $w_{de}$. For each scenario, we derive the closed dynamical system in terms of the density parameters $(\Omega_{de}, \Omega_m)$, identify its fixed points, and analyze their stability across the parameter space. In this context, the phase-space exhibits a standard cosmological dynamics: an unstable radiation point, a transient matter saddle, and a stable late-time attractor with accelerated expansion. In addition, we utilize a joint likelihood analysis with Cosmic Chronometers, PantheonPlus, and DESI data to obtain marginalized parameter estimates at the $68\%$ and $95\%$ confidence levels, constraining the parameter space in each interaction model.</description>

      <title>Exotic compact objects in Einstein-Scalar-Maxwell theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In k-essence theories within general relativity, where the matter Lagrangian depends on a real scalar field $\phi$ and its kinetic term $X$, static and spherically symmetric compact objects with a positive-definite energy density cannot exist without introducing ghosts. We show that this no-go theorem can be evaded when the k-essence Lagrangian is extended to include a dependence on the field strength $F$ of a $U(1)$ gauge field, taking the general form ${\cal L}(\phi, X, F)$. In Einstein-scalar-Maxwell theories with a scalar-vector coupling $\mu(\phi) F$, we demonstrate the existence of asymptotically flat, charged compact stars whose energy density and pressure vanish at the center. With an appropriate choice of the coupling function $\mu(\phi)$, we construct both electric and magnetic compact objects and derive their metric functions and scalar- and vector-field profiles analytically. We compute their masses and radii, showing that the compactness lies in the range ${\cal O}(0.01)&lt;{\cal C}&lt;{\cal O}(0.1)$. A linear perturbation analysis reveals that electric compact objects are free of strong coupling, ghost, and Laplacian instabilities at all radii for $\mu(\phi)&gt;0$, while magnetic compact objects suffer from strong coupling near the center.</description>

      <title>Impact of conversion-driven processes on singlet-doublet Majorana dark matter relic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The singlet-doublet dark matter model offers a rich framework for exploring the nature of dark matter (DM) through its unique fermion structure. In this model, the important parameters are singlet-doublet mass splitting $\Delta{M}$, singlet-doublet mixing angle $\sin\theta$, and DM mass $M_{\rm DM}$. If the DM is assumed to be of Dirac nature, then the annihilation, co-annihilation, and conversion driven processes combinedly allows a range of parameter space: $1~{\rm GeV} \lesssim M_{\rm DM}\lesssim750$ GeV and $10^{-6}\lesssim\sin\theta\lesssim0.04$ for all $\Delta{M}&gt;1$ GeV. While the nature of DM either Dirac or Majorana is not known, in this work we assume the nature of singlet-doublet DM to be of Majorana type and find that the relic density and direct detection can be satisfied in a larger parameter space. In particular, the allowed ranges of DM mass and $\sin\theta$ are: $1~{\rm GeV}\lesssim M_{\rm DM}\lesssim1750$ GeV and $2\times10^{-7}\lesssim\sin\theta\lesssim0.16$ for all $\Delta{M}&gt;1$ GeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.08484v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the exploration of the cosmology of dark fifth forces: new forces acting solely on Dark Matter. We focus on long range interactions which lead to an effective violation of the Equivalence Principle on cosmological scales today. At the microscopic level, the dark fifth force can be realized by a light scalar with mass smaller than the Hubble constant today ($\lesssim 10^{-33}\,\text{eV}$) coupled to Dark Matter. We study the behavior of the background cosmology and linear perturbations in such a Universe. At the background level, the new force modifies the evolution of the Dark Matter energy density and thus the Hubble flow. At linear order, it modifies the growth of matter perturbations and generates relative density and velocity perturbations between Dark Matter and baryons that grow over time. We derive constraints from current CMB and BAO data, bounding the strength of the dark fifth force to be less than a percent of gravity. These are the strongest constraints to date. We present potential implications of this scenario for the Hubble tension and discuss how our results are modified if the light scalar mediator accounts for the observed density of the Dark Energy. Finally, we comment on the interplay between our constraints and searches for violations of the Equivalence Principle in the visible sector.</description>

      <title>Enhancing inflationary model predictions via refined slow-roll dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01713v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inflationary paradigm not only addresses early universe puzzles but also aligns well with the observational constraints, with slow-roll inflationary models fitting the best. Evaluating these model predictions requires considering both slow-roll inflationary dynamics and the subsequent reheating epoch. This involves the quantitative analysis that takes into account the effective equation of state (EoS) and duration of reheating, connecting these with the perturbations generated deep during the inflationary era. Given the complexities involved, many approximations are often used for simplification. However, as future observations are expected to improve the accuracy of these observables significantly, this work takes a different approach. Instead of relying on approximations, and instead of looking into the complex effects of (pre-)reheating, we focus on the corrections arising purely from more accurate analytical evaluations of the perturbations generated during the inflationary era itself. This is because the reheating dynamics is model-dependent and lack a single concrete analytical description, and thus introduce large uncertainties, making robust predictions difficult. In this article, we mainly incorporate two improvements: the first is the accurate dynamics of the slow-roll evolution and, thus, the end of inflation, and the second is the higher-order slow-roll corrections to the perturbed observables. Our findings indicate that, by implementing these corrections, the theoretical predictions improve significantly. It also indicates that seemingly minor corrections can have significant effects on the perturbed observables, and these refined predictions can be compared with future observations to potentially rule out models and help resolve the degeneracy problem of the inflationary paradigm.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the dark matter-baryon interaction cross section from galaxy cluster thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) models with a non-zero DM-baryon interaction cross section imply energy transfer between DM and baryons. We present a new method of constraining the DM-baryon interaction cross section and DM particle mass for velocity-independent interactions using the thermodynamics of galaxy clusters. If the baryonic gas in these clusters is in thermodynamic equilibrium and DM cools baryons, this cooling rate is limited by the net heating rate of other mechanisms in the cluster. We use the REFLEX clusters from the Meta-Catalogue of X-ray detected Clusters of Galaxies (MCXC) with mass estimates from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) catalog of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) selected galaxy clusters. This yields 95% upper bounds on the DM-proton interaction cross section for velocity-independent interactions of $\sigma_0\leq9.3\times10^{-28} \mathrm{~cm^2}$ for DM masses, $m_\chi = 10^{-4} - 10^{-1}$ GeV. These constraints are within an order of magnitude of the best constraints derived in this mass range, and serve as a complementary, independent constraint. We also apply this model to the fractional interacting DM scenario, where only 10% and 1% of the DM is interacting. Unlike other methods, this constraint scales linearly with this fraction. This yields 95% upper bounds of $\sigma_0\leq1.1\times10^{-26} \mathrm{~cm^2}$ and $\sigma_0\leq8.2\times10^{-26} \mathrm{~cm^2}$, which are the strongest existing constraints for this scenario. This paper serves as a proof of concept. Upcoming SZ measurements will provide temperature profiles for galaxy clusters. Combining these measurements with more complex thermodynamic models could lead to more robust constraints.</description>

      <title>Threshold for PBH formation in the type-II region and its analytical estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05814v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically simulate the formation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) in a radiation-dominated Universe under the assumption of spherical symmetry, driven by the collapse of adiabatic fluctuations, for different curvature profiles $\zeta$. Our results show that the threshold for PBH formation, defined as the peak value of the critical compaction function $\mathcal{C}_{c}(r_m)$ (where $r_m$ is the scale at which the peak occurs), does not necessarily asymptotically saturate to its maximum possible value in the type-I region for sufficiently sharp profiles. Instead, the threshold is found in the type-II region with $\mathcal{C}_{c}(r_m)$ being a minimum. We find, for the cases tested, that this is a general trend associated with profiles that exhibit extremely large curvatures in the linear component of the compaction function $\mathcal{C}_{l}(r) \equiv -4r \zeta'(r)/3$ shape around its peak $r_m$ (spiky shapes). To measure this curvature at $r_m$, we define a dimensionless parameter, $\kappa \equiv -r^{2}_m \mathcal{C}_l''(r_m)$, and we find that the thresholds observed in the type-II region occur for sufficiently large $\kappa$ for the profiles we have used, contrary to expectations. By defining the threshold in terms of $\mathcal{C}_{l,c}(r_m)$, we extend previous analytical estimations to the type-II region, which is shown to be accurate within a few percent when compared to the numerical simulations for the tested profiles. Our results suggest that current PBH abundance calculations for models where the threshold lies in the type-II region may have been overestimated due to the general assumption that it should saturate at the boundary between the type-I and type-II regions.</description>

Abstract: A mechanism for generating anisotropic enhancements of the curvature perturbation through a vector field is proposed. We find that when the mixing between the inflaton perturbation and the vector-field perturbation is sufficiently strong in the anisotropic inflation, the power spectrum becomes dominated by anisotropic constant modes. This suggests that statistical anisotropy in primordial black hole (PBH) formation may be inevitable if inflation undergoes an anisotropic inflationary phase. Our findings offer a novel approach to probe vector fields during inflation and to test the cosmic no-hair conjecture.</description>

      <title>How to embed any likelihood into SBI: Application to Planck + Stage IV galaxy surveys and Dynamical Dark Energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) allows fast Bayesian inference for simulators encoding implicit likelihoods. However, some explicit likelihoods cannot be easily reformulated as simulators, hindering their integration into combined analyses within SBI frameworks. One key example in cosmology is given by the Planck CMB likelihoods. We present a simple method to construct an effective simulator for any explicit likelihood using samples from a previously converged Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) run. This effective simulator can subsequently be combined with any forward simulator. To illustrate this method, we combine the full Planck CMB likelihoods with a 3x2pt simulator (cosmic shear, galaxy clustering and their cross-correlation) for a Stage IV survey like Euclid, and test evolving dark energy parameterized by the $w_0w_a$ equation-of-state. Assuming the $w_0w_a$CDM cosmology hinted by DESI BAO DR2 + Planck 2018 + PantheonPlus SNIa datasets, we find that future 3x2pt data alone could detect evolving dark energy at $5\sigma$, while its combination with current CMB, BAO and SNIa datasets could raise the detection to almost $7\sigma$. Moreover, thanks to simulation reuse enabled by SBI, we show that our joint analysis is in excellent agreement with MCMC while requiring zero Boltzmann solver calls. This result opens up the possibility of performing massive global scans combining explicit and implicit likelihoods in a highly efficient way.</description>

Abstract: The alignments of galaxies across the large-scale structure of the Universe are known to be a source of contamination for gravitational lensing, but they can also probe cosmology and the physics of galaxy evolution in many ways. In this review, I cover developments in our understanding of intrinsic alignments over the past 25 years on: (1) different approaches to model intrinsic alignments across a range of scales, (2) existing observational constraints, (3) predictions from cosmological numerical $N$-body and hydrodynamical simulations, (4) mitigation strategies to account for their contamination to lensing observables and (5) cosmological and astrophysical applications. While the review focuses mostly on two-point statistics of intrinsic alignments, I also give a summary of other statistics beyond two-point. Finally, I point out some of the open problems hindering the understanding or application of intrinsic alignments and how they might be overcome in the future.</description>

      <title>Addressing the DESI DR2 Phantom-Crossing Anomaly and Enhanced $H_0$ Tension with Reconstructed Scalar-Tensor Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent cosmological data, including DESI DR2, highlight significant tensions within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. When analyzed in the context of General Relativity (GR), the latest DESI data favor a dynamical dark energy (DDE) equation of state, $w(z)$, that crosses the phantom divide line $w=-1$. However, this framework prefers a lower Hubble constant, $H_0$, than Planck 2018, thereby worsening the tension with local measurements. This phantom crossing is a key feature that cannot be achieved by minimally coupled scalar fields (quintessence) within GR. This suggests the need for a new degree of freedom that can simultaneously: (A) increase the best-fit value of $H_0$ in the context of the DESI DR2 data, and (B) allow the crossing of the $w=-1$ line within a new theoretical approach. We argue that both of these goals may be achieved in the context of Modified Gravity (MG), and in particular, Scalar-Tensor (ST) theories, where phantom crossing is a natural and viable feature. We demonstrate these facts by analyzing a joint dataset including DESI DR2, Pantheon+, CMB, and growth-rate (RSD) data in the context of simple parametrizations for the effective gravitational constant, $\mu_G(z) \equiv G_{eff}/G_N$, and the DDE equation of state, $w(z)$. This MG framework significantly alleviates the tension, leading to a higher inferred value of $H_0 = 70.6 \pm 1.7 \, \text{km s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}$. We also present a systematic, data-driven reconstruction of the required underlying ST Lagrangian and provide simple, generic analytical expressions for both the non-minimal coupling $F(\Phi) = 1+\xi\Phi^{2}e^{n\Phi}$ and the scalar potential $U(\Phi) = U_{0}+ae^{b\Phi^{2}}$, which well-describe the reconstructed functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constraining the mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD) is crucial for improving the precision and accuracy of time-delay cosmography. Joint analyses of lensing and stellar kinematics are widely adopted to break the MSD. A 3D mass and stellar tracer population is required to accurately interpret the kinematics data. Our forward-modeling procedure aims at evaluating the projection effects of strong lensing and kinematics observables and to determine an optimal model assumption for the stellar kinematics analysis leading to an unbiased MSD and $H_0$. We numerically simulate the projection and selection effects for both a triaxial ETG sample from the IllustrisTNG simulation and an axisymmetric sample that matches the properties of slow-rotator galaxies representative of the strong lens galaxy population. Using the axisymmetric sample, we generate mock kinematics observables with axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Modeling (JAM) and assess kinematic recovery under different model assumptions. Using the triaxial sample, we quantify the random uncertainty introduced by modeling triaxial galaxies with axisymmetric JAM. We show that spherical JAM analysis of spatially unresolved kinematic data introduces a bias of up to 2%-4% (depending on the intrinsic shape of the lens) in the inferred MSD. Our model largely corrects this bias, resulting in a residual random uncertainty in the range of 0-2.2% in the stellar velocity dispersion (0-4.4% in $H_0$) depending on the projected ellipticity and the anisotropy of the stellar orbits. This residual uncertainty can be further mitigated using spatially resolved kinematic data which constrain the intrinsic shape. We also show that the random uncertainty in the velocity dispersion recovery using axisymmetric JAM for axisymmetric galaxies is at the level of &lt; 0.24%, and the uncertainty using axisymmetric JAM for triaxial galaxies is at the level of &lt; 0.17%.</description>

      <title>Impacts of axion cooling on the direct detection of supernova axions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae provide a unique opportunity to probe axions because they can be a copious source of the particles. It has recently been proposed that axion helioscopes can be used for the direct search for supernova axions if a supernova event appears within a few hundred parsecs. However, the event number of supernova axions has been estimated only within the post-process framework. In this study, we perform long-term supernova simulations for a 9.6M_sun star coupled with the axion emission to reevaluate the event number of axions detected by the helioscopes. We find that the additional cooling induced by the axion emission can significantly decrease the temperature in the proto-neutron star. As a result, the axion luminosity and hence the axion event number are reduced, compared with the result obtained through post-processing. Our result indicates that the nonlinear feedback of the axion emission is an essential factor to predict the axion detectability, and underscores the need for systematic simulation studies across various progenitor models.</description>

      <title>Complete Classification of Domain Wall Solutions in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric 2HDM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a complete classification of domain wall solutions in the two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) with a global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, categorised as superconducting, CP-violating, or neither, depending on the scalar particle masses and the ratio of the two Higgs doublets' vacuum expectation values. We demonstrate that any domain wall solution can be reduced to depend on only six of the eight general field components, with further field reductions possible within different regions of the parameter space. Furthermore, we show that the superconducting solutions can be used to construct stable, current-carrying domain walls in two spatial dimensions. Similarly, the CP-violating solutions allow for two-dimensional configurations where CP symmetry is locally broken on the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric wall, which could provide an out-of-equilibrium environment for CP-violating processes to occur.</description>

      <title>Deep Chandra X-ray Observations of Abell 2029: the Merger History of a Relaxed, Strong Cool Core Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present results from very deep (485 ks) Chandra X-ray observations of the relaxed, cool core cluster Abell 2029 (z = 0.0767). A2029 hosts one of the longest, most continuous sloshing spirals ever observed, which we find extends nearly 600 kpc from the cluster core. In addition to providing detailed views of the sloshing spiral, imaging and spectroscopic analysis reveals ICM substructure related to the merger history including a broad ``splash'' of cooler gas and a potential merger shock. The radio lobes of the central WAT source show evidence of alignment with the sloshing motions, consistent with ICM bulk flow, rather than host-galaxy motion, being the primary driver of lobe bending. Comparison to a 1:10 mass-ratio off-axis merger simulation indicates that the observed ICM structures are relics of a second core passage of a subcluster ~4 Gyr after the start of the merger, where the ``splash'' feature is revealed to be a wake of cool gas trailing behind the subcluster. Overall, our results suggest that A2029 is still settling from past interactions -- showing that even the initially most relaxed-looking clusters can be hiding a rich history of dynamical activity.</description>

      <title>ELAIS-N1 deep field uGMRT Band-2: constraints on diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present high sensitivity, low radio frequency continuum observations of the ELAIS-N1 field with 32 hours of observations of the uGMRT Band-2 ($120-250$ MHz) covering $5.86\,\text{deg}^2$ area, achieving a central off-source RMS noise of $237\,\mu\mathrm{Jy}/\mathrm{beam}$ with a resolution of $11.45''$ at the central frequency of 183 MHz. A radio source catalogue of 1027 sources statistically matches with similar observations at different frequencies within the sensitivity range of the uGMRT. The calibrated data is further used to characterise the dominant foreground, the Diffuse Galactic Synchrotron Emission (DGSE), in angular scale and frequency regime. We derived the angular power spectrum (APS) of DGSE in two ways: image-based estimator (i-APS) and visibility-based Tapered Gridded Estimator (TGE; hereafter as t-APS). We assess the characteristics of DGSE with a power-law form of $C_{\ell} = A({1000}/{\ell})^{\beta}$. Combining data from Band-2 and earlier Band-3 observations, we derived a spectral variation of $C_{\ell}$ in the form of $C_{\ell} = A{\nu^{-2{\alpha}}}{\ell^{-{\beta}}}$. Our result indicates a spectral break at $\nu = 230\,{\pm}\,5$ MHz, corresponding to a synchrotron age of $t_\text{syn} = 106\,{\pm}\,1$ Myr for the cosmic-ray electrons (CRe). This break result suggests a low-energy cutoff in the CRe population, leading to spectral curvature at low frequencies. Using both of the techniques, i-APS and t-APS, we find that the mean spectral index $\alpha$ and power-law index $\beta$ are consistent within the frequency range $120-500$ MHz.</description>

      <title>Symmetry of Bounce Solutions at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The seminal work of Coleman, Glaser, and Martin established that, at zero temperature, any non-trivial solution to the equations of motion with the least Euclidean action is $O(D)$-symmetric. This paper extends their foundational analysis to finite temperature. We rigorously prove that for a broad class of scalar potentials, any saddle-point configuration with the least action is necessarily $O(D\!-\!1)$-symmetric and monotonic in the spatial directions. This result provides a firm mathematical justification for the symmetry properties widely assumed in studies of thermal vacuum decay and cosmological phase transitions.</description>
