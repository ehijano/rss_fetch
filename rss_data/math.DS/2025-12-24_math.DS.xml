      <title>Generalized q-dimensions of measures on Non-autonomous conformal sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generalized q-dimensions of measures supported on non-autonomous conformal attractors, which are the generalizations of Moran sets and the attractors of iterated function systems. We first prove that the critical values of generalized upper and lower pressure functions are always the upper bounds for the upper and lower generalized q-dimensions of measures supported on non-autonomous conformal sets. Then we obtain dimension formulas for generalized q-dimensions if non-autonomous conformal attractors satisfy certain separation conditions, and moreover, the generalized q-dimension formulae may be simplified for the Bernoulli measures. Finally, we provide the generalized q-dimension formulae for measures supported on autonomous conformal sets.</description>

      <title>Compact non-uniformizable Li-Yorke chaotic dynamical systems via an example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main aim of this paper is extending the concept of scambled pair and Li--Yorke chaos to non--uniform compact dynamical systems. We show for finite (compact Alexandroff) topological space $X$ with at least two elements the following statements are equivalent:
  $\bullet$ one--sided shift $\sigma:X^{\mathbb{N}}\to X^\mathbb{N}$ is Li--Yorke chaotic,
  $\bullet$ one--sided shift $\sigma:X^{\mathbb{N}}\to X^\mathbb{N}$ has at least one scrambled pair,
  $\bullet$ one--sided shift $\sigma:X^{\mathbb{N}}\to X^\mathbb{N}$ has at least one non--asymptotic pair,
  $\bullet$ there exists $a,b\in X$ such that $\overline{\{a\}}\cap\overline{\{b\}}=\varnothing$,
  $\bullet$ $\bigcap\{\overline{\{a\}}:a\in X\}=\varnothing$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that on a standard non-atomic probability space the set of all invertible measure-preserving transformations is residual in the set of all measure-preserving transformations with respect to the strong (=weak) operator topology. This implies that all properties which are generic for invertible transformations are also generic for general ones.</description>

      <title>Constructing Toeplitz arrays via cut and project schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show a one-to-one correspondence between Toeplitz arrays over residually finite topological groups and model sets obtained via specific cut and project schemes, built from the odometer associated to the Toeplitz array. As an application, we construct irregular Toeplitz arrays which are extensions of maximal rank $k$ over their maximal equicontinuous factor (given by the associated odometer) and have exactly $k$ different ergodic measures. A modification of the construction also allows to obtain examples with the same measure-theoretic structure, but infinite maximal rank.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev's method applied to polynomials with two distinct roots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Julia set of the Chebyshev's method applied to polynomials with exactly two distinct roots is shown to be connected, and its Fatou set is proved to be the union of attracting basins corresponding to the two roots. Further, if the two roots have the same multiplicity then the common boundary of the two immediate basins is proved to be a connected subset of the Julia set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of relating cycles on a \emph{triod} $Y$ to \emph{circle rotations}. We prove that the simplest cycles on a \emph{triod}~$Y$ with a given \emph{rotation number}~$\rho$, called \emph{triod--twist cycles} are conjugate, via a piece-wise monotone map of \emph{modality} at most~$m + 3$, where~$m$ is the \emph{modality} of~$P$ to the rotation on~$S^1$ by angle~$\rho$, restricted to one of its cycles.</description>

      <title>Koopman for stochastic dynamics: error bounds for kernel extended dynamic mode decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove $L^\infty$-error bounds for kernel extended dynamic mode decomposition (kEDMD) approximants of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical systems. To this end, we establish Koopman invariance of suitably chosen reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and provide an in-depth analysis of the pointwise error in terms of the data points. The latter is split into two parts by showing that kEDMD for stochastic systems involves a kernel regression step leading to a deterministic error in the fill distance as well as Monte Carlo sampling to approximate unknown expected values yielding a probabilistic error in terms of the number of samples. We illustrate the derived bounds by means of Langevin-type stochastic differential equations involving a nonlinear double-well potential.</description>

      <title>Elementwise conservative actions and new constructions of boomerang subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that countable non-abelian free groups admit uncountably many mutually singular elementwise conservative non-singular random subgroups, which are supported on infinite subgroups of infinite index and singular with respect to every invariant random subgroup. This complements recent rigidity results for elementwise-conservative random subgroups in higher rank lattices by the first- and third-named authors. Our proof is based on a study of representations of free groups into measurable full groups in which the action of the first generator of the free group is fixed. We show that elementwise conservativity is generic among such representations in the sense of Baire category.</description>

      <title>A note on an open conjecture in rational dynamical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2101.07796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently ,mathematicians have been interested in studying the theory of discrete dynamical system, specifically difference equation, such that considerable works about discussing the behavior properties of its solutions (boundedness and unboundedness) are discussed and published in many areas of mathematics which involves several interesting results and applications in applied mathematics and physics ,One of the most important discrete dynamics which is became of interest for researchers in the field is the rational dynamical system .In this paper we give a negative answer to the eight open conjecture in rational dynamical system proposed by G.Ladas and Palladino many years ago which states :
  Assume $\alpha,\beta, \lambda \in [0,\infty)$. Then every positive solution of the difference equation \\:
  \begin{align*} z_{n+1}=\frac{\alpha+z_{n}\beta +z_{n-1}\lambda}{z_{n-2}},\quad n=0,1,\ldots \end{align*} is bounded if and only if $\beta=\lambda$.
  We will use a construction of subenergy function and some properties of Todd's difference equation to disprove that conjecture in general.Some new results (Chebychev approximation) and analysis regarding that open conjecture are presented.</description>

      <title>Nonadditive families of potentials: physical equivalence and some regularity relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.05926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that additive and asymptotically additive families of continuous functions with respect to suspension flows are physically equivalent. In particular, the equivalence result holds for hyperbolic flows and some classes of expansive flows in general. Moreover, we show how this equivalence result can be used to extend the nonadditive thermodynamic formalism and multifractal analysis. In the second part of this work, we obtain a Liv\v{s}ic-like result for nonadditive families of potentials and also address the H\"older and Bowen regularity problem for the physical equivalence relations with respect to hyperbolic symbolic flows.</description>

      <title>Generalized $(C, \lambda)$-structure for nonlinear diffeomorphisms of Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a generalized $(C, \lambda)$-structure, which generalizes hyperbolicity to nonlinear dynamics in Banach spaces. The main novelties are that we allow the hyperbolic splitting to be discontinuous, and that in the invariance condition we assume only inclusions rather than equalities for both the stable and unstable subspaces. This allows us to cover Morse-Smale systems and generalized hyperbolicity. We suggest that generalized $(C, \lambda)$-structure for infinite-dimensional dynamics plays a role analogous to that of ``Axiom A and the strong transversality condition'' for dynamics on compact manifolds. For diffeomorphisms of a reflexive Banach space, we show that generalized $(C, \lambda)$-structure implies Lipschitz (periodic) shadowing and is robust under $C^1$-small perturbations. Assuming that generalized $(C, \lambda)$-structure is continuous for diffeomorphisms on an arbitrary Banach space we obtain a weak form of structural stability: the diffeomorphism is semi-conjugate in both directions with any of its $C^1$-small perturbation.</description>

      <title>Stability of Non-Hyperbolic Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In unfoldings of homoclinic tangencies we find codimension-1 laminations consisting of maps exhibiting an invariant, non-hyperbolic Cantor set containing a Collet-Eckmann point with dense orbit. The dynamics on this Cantor set remains unchanged along the leaves of the lamination, ensuring codimension-1 stability. Furthermore, each leaf contains a map with infinitely many sinks accumulating on the non-hyperbolic Cantor set containing the Collet-Eckmann point. These results provide a new perspective on the stability of chaotic non-hyperbolic sets in two-dimensional systems and reveal surprising coexistence phenomena that highlight the richness and complexity of such dynamics. Along the way the paper introduces a generalized renormalization scheme for two-dimensional systems.</description>

Abstract: We present the first explicit example of an interval exchange transformation with flips (FIET) possessing three distinct invariant ergodic measures. The proof is based on a generalization of M. Keane's method, using the Rauzy induction adapted for FIETs, which contributes to the study of the ergodic properties of this class of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>A short introduction to the control theory in finite-dimensional spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a brief introduction to control theory in finite-dimensional spaces. The material is partly based on my lectures for the Master 1 program in Math\'ematiques et applications at Sorbonne University, delivered over the past few years. The aim is to provide a concise overview of the subject, primarily focusing on the linear setting. Proofs are presented in detail and are selected to allow for extensions to the infinite-dimensional case in many situations. Topics covered include the Kalman rank condition, the Hautus test, observability, stability, detectability and dynamic observers, the Pole Shifting Theorem, the linear test for controllability, linear-quadratic optimal control over finite and infinite horizons, and stabilization via Gramians.</description>
