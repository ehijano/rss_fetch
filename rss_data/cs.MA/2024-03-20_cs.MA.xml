      <title>Uber Stable: Formulating the Rideshare System as a Stable Matching Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peer-to-peer ride-sharing platforms like Uber, Lyft, and DiDi have revolutionized the transportation industry and labor market. At its essence, these systems tackle the bipartite matching problem between two populations: riders and drivers. This research paper comprises two main components: an initial literature review of existing ride-sharing platforms and efforts to enhance driver satisfaction, and the development of a novel algorithm implemented through simulation testing to allow us to make our own observations. The core algorithm utilized is the Gale-Shapley deferred acceptance algorithm, applied to a static matching problem over multiple time periods. In this simulation, we construct a preference-aware task assignment model, considering both overall revenue maximization and individual preference satisfaction. Specifically, the algorithm design incorporates factors such as passenger willingness-to-pay, driver preferences, and location attractiveness, with an overarching goal of achieving equitable income distribution for drivers while maintaining overall system efficiency.
  Through simulation, the paper compares the performance of the proposed algorithm with random matching and closest neighbor algorithms, looking at metrics such as total revenue, revenue per ride, and standard deviation to identify trends and impacts of shifting priorities. Additionally, the DA algorithm is compared to the Boston algorithm, and the paper explores the effect of prioritizing proximity to passengers versus distance from city center. Ultimately, the research underscores the importance of continued exploration in areas such as dynamic pricing models and additional modeling for unconventional driving times to further enhance the findings on the effectiveness and fairness of ride-sharing platforms.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network-based Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for Resilient Distributed Coordination of Multi-Robot Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing multi-agent coordination techniques are often fragile and vulnerable to anomalies such as agent attrition and communication disturbances, which are quite common in the real-world deployment of systems like field robotics. To better prepare these systems for the real world, we present a graph neural network (GNN)-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method for resilient distributed coordination of a multi-robot system. Our method, Multi-Agent Graph Embedding-based Coordination (MAGEC), is trained using multi-agent proximal policy optimization (PPO) and enables distributed coordination around global objectives under agent attrition, partial observability, and limited or disturbed communications. We use a multi-robot patrolling scenario to demonstrate our MAGEC method in a ROS 2-based simulator and then compare its performance with prior coordination approaches. Results demonstrate that MAGEC outperforms existing methods in several experiments involving agent attrition and communication disturbance, and provides competitive results in scenarios without such anomalies.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Ride-Pooling Revenue: Pricing Strategies and Driver-Traveller Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ride-pooling, to gain momentum, needs to be attractive for all the parties involved. This includes also drivers, who are naturally reluctant to serve pooled rides. This can be controlled by the platform's pricing strategy, which can stimulate drivers to serve pooled rides. Here, we propose an agent-based framework, where drivers serve rides that maximise their utility. We simulate a series of scenarios in Delft and compare three strategies. Our results show that drivers, when they maximize their profits, earn more than in both the solo-rides and only-pooled rides scenarios. This shows that serving pooled rides can be beneficial as well for drivers, yet typically not all pooled rides are attractive for drivers. The proposed framework may be further applied to propose discriminative pricing in which the full potential of ride-pooling is exploited, with benefits for the platform, travellers, and (which is novel here) to the drivers.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent Reinforcement Traffic Signal Control based on Interpretable Influence Mechanism and Biased ReLU Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic signal control is important in intelligent transportation system, of which cooperative control is difficult to realize but yet vital. Many methods model multi-intersection traffic networks as grids and address the problem using multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL). Despite these existing studies, there is an opportunity to further enhance our understanding of the connectivity and globality of the traffic networks by capturing the spatiotemporal traffic information with efficient neural networks in deep RL. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent actor-critic framework based on an interpretable influence mechanism with a centralized learning and decentralized execution method. Specifically, we first construct an actor-critic framework, for which the piecewise linear neural network (PWLNN), named biased ReLU (BReLU), is used as the function approximator to obtain a more accurate and theoretically grounded approximation. Finally, our proposed framework is validated on two synthetic traffic networks to coordinate signal control between intersections, achieving lower traffic delays across the entire traffic network compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.</description>

      <title>Hyper Strategy Logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strategy logic (SL) is a powerful temporal logic that enables strategic reasoning in multi-agent systems. SL supports explicit (first-order) quantification over strategies and provides a logical framework to express many important properties such as Nash equilibria, dominant strategies, etc. While in SL the same strategy can be used in multiple strategy profiles, each such profile is evaluated w.r.t. a path-property, i.e., a property that considers the single path resulting from a particular strategic interaction. In this paper, we present Hyper Strategy Logic (HyperSL), a strategy logic where the outcome of multiple strategy profiles can be compared w.r.t. a hyperproperty, i.e., a property that relates multiple paths. We show that HyperSL can capture important properties that cannot be expressed in SL, including non-interference, quantitative Nash equilibria, optimal adversarial planning, and reasoning under imperfect information. On the algorithmic side, we identify an expressive fragment of HyperSL with decidable model checking and present a model-checking algorithm. We contribute a prototype implementation of our algorithm and report on encouraging experimental results.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Security in Multi-Robot Systems through Co-Observation Planning, Reachability Analysis, and Network Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses security challenges in multi-robot systems (MRS) where adversaries may compromise robot control, risking unauthorized access to forbidden areas. We propose a novel multi-robot optimal planning algorithm that integrates mutual observations and introduces reachability constraints for enhanced security. This ensures that, even with adversarial movements, compromised robots cannot breach forbidden regions without missing scheduled co-observations. The reachability constraint uses ellipsoidal over-approximation for efficient intersection checking and gradient computation. To enhance system resilience and tackle feasibility challenges, we also introduce sub-teams. These cohesive units replace individual robot assignments along each route, enabling redundant robots to deviate for co-observations across different trajectories, securing multiple sub-teams without requiring modifications. We formulate the cross-trajectory co-observation plan by solving a network flow coverage problem on the checkpoint graph generated from the original unsecured MRS trajectories, providing the same security guarantees against plan-deviation attacks. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed algorithm, which significantly strengthens the security of multi-robot systems in the face of adversarial threats.</description>

      <title>Multi-Robot Connected Fermat Spiral Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Multi-Robot Connected Fermat Spiral (MCFS), a novel algorithmic framework for Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning (MCPP) that adapts Connected Fermat Spiral (CFS) from the computer graphics community to multi-robot coordination for the first time. MCFS uniquely enables the orchestration of multiple robots to generate coverage paths that contour around arbitrarily shaped obstacles, a feature that is notably lacking in traditional methods. Our framework not only enhances area coverage and optimizes task performance, particularly in terms of makespan, for workspaces rich in irregular obstacles but also addresses the challenges of path continuity and curvature critical for non-holonomic robots by generating smooth paths without decomposing the workspace. MCFS solves MCPP by constructing a graph of isolines and transforming MCPP into a combinatorial optimization problem, aiming to minimize the makespan while covering all vertices. Our contributions include developing a unified CFS version for scalable and adaptable MCPP, extending it to MCPP with novel optimization techniques for cost reduction and path continuity and smoothness, and demonstrating through extensive experiments that MCFS outperforms existing MCPP methods in makespan, path curvature, coverage ratio, and overlapping ratio. Our research marks a significant step in MCPP, showcasing the fusion of computer graphics and automated planning principles to advance the capabilities of multi-robot systems in complex environments.

Abstract: On the one side, the formalism of Global Transformations comes with the claim of capturing any transformation of space that is local, synchronous and deterministic.The claim has been proven for different classes of models such as mesh refinements from computer graphics, Lindenmayer systems from morphogenesis modeling and cellular automata from biological, physical and parallel computation modeling.The Global Transformation formalism achieves this by using category theory for its genericity, and more precisely the notion of Kan extension to determine the global behaviors based on the local ones.On the other side, Causal Graph Dynamics describe the transformation of port graphs in a synchronous and deterministic way and has not yet being tackled.In this paper, we show the precise sense in which the claim of Global Transformations holds for them as well.This is done by showing different ways in which they can be expressed as Kan extensions, each of them highlighting different features of Causal Graph Dynamics.Along the way, this work uncovers the interesting class of Monotonic Causal Graph Dynamics and their universality among General Causal Graph Dynamics.</description>

      <title>Caching-Augmented Lifelong Multi-Agent Path Finding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), which involves finding collision-free paths for multiple robots, is crucial in various applications. Lifelong MAPF, where targets are reassigned to agents as soon as they complete their initial objectives, offers a more accurate approximation of real-world warehouse planning. In this paper, we present a novel mechanism named Caching-Augmented Lifelong MAPF (CAL-MAPF), designed to improve the performance of Lifelong MAPF. We have developed a new map grid type called cache for temporary item storage and replacement and designed a lock mechanism for it to improve the stability of the planning solution. This cache mechanism was evaluated using various cache replacement policies and a spectrum of input task distributions. We identified three main factors significantly impacting CAL-MAPF performance through experimentation: suitable input task distribution, high cache hit rate, and smooth traffic. Overall, CAL-MAPF has demonstrated potential for performance improvements in certain task distributions, maps and agent configurations.</description>

      <title>Agent-based MST Construction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: {\em Minimum-weight spanning tree} (MST) is one of the fundamental and well-studied problems in distributed computing. In this paper, we initiate the study of constructing MST using mobile agents (aka robots). Suppose $n$ agents are positioned initially arbitrarily on the nodes of a connected, undirected, arbitrary, anonymous, port-labeled, weighted $n$-node, $m$-edge graph $G$ of diameter $D$ and maximum degree $\Delta$. The agents relocate themselves autonomously and compute an MST of $G$ such that exactly one agent positions on a node and tracks in its memory which of its adjacent edges belong to the MST. The objective is to minimize time and memory requirements. Following the literature, we consider the synchronous setting in which each agent performs its operations synchronously with others and hence time can be measured in rounds. We first establish a generic result: if $n$ and $\Delta$ are known a priori and memory per agent is as much as node memory in the message-passing model (of distributed computing), agents can simulate any $O(T)$-round deterministic algorithm for any problem in the message-passing model to the agent model in $O(\Delta T \log n+n\log^2n)$ rounds. As a corollary, MST can be constructed in the agent model in $O(\max\{\Delta \sqrt{n} \log n \log^*n, \Delta D \log n,n\log^2n\})$ rounds simulating the celebrated $O(\sqrt{n} \log^*n +D)$-round GKP algorithm for MST in the message-passing model. We then establish that, without knowing any graph parameter a priori, there exists a deterministic algorithm to construct MST in the agent model in $O(m+n\log n)$ rounds with $O(n \log n)$ bits memory at each agent. The presented algorithm needs to overcome highly non-trivial challenges on how to synchronize agents in computing MST as they may initially be positioned arbitrarily on the graph nodes.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Adversarial Node Placement in Decentralized Federated Learning Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07946v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Federated Learning (FL) grows in popularity, new decentralized frameworks are becoming widespread. These frameworks leverage the benefits of decentralized environments to enable fast and energy-efficient inter-device communication. However, this growing popularity also intensifies the need for robust security measures. While existing research has explored various aspects of FL security, the role of adversarial node placement in decentralized networks remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by analyzing the performance of decentralized FL for various adversarial placement strategies when adversaries can jointly coordinate their placement within a network. We establish two baseline strategies for placing adversarial node: random placement and network centrality-based placement. Building on this foundation, we propose a novel attack algorithm that prioritizes adversarial spread over adversarial centrality by maximizing the average network distance between adversaries. We show that the new attack algorithm significantly impacts key performance metrics such as testing accuracy, outperforming the baseline frameworks by between $9\%$ and $66.5\%$ for the considered setups. Our findings provide valuable insights into the vulnerabilities of decentralized FL systems, setting the stage for future research aimed at developing more secure and robust decentralized FL frameworks.</description>

      <title>Distributed Pose-graph Optimization with Multi-level Partitioning for Collaborative SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01657v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The back-end module of Distributed Collaborative Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (DCSLAM) requires solving a nonlinear Pose Graph Optimization (PGO) under a distributed setting, also known as SE(d)-synchronization. Most existing distributed graph optimization algorithms employ a simple sequential partitioning scheme, which may result in unbalanced subgraph dimensions due to the different geographic locations of each robot, and hence imposes extra communication load. Moreover, the performance of current Riemannian optimization algorithms can be further accelerated. In this letter, we propose a novel distributed pose graph optimization algorithm combining multi-level partitioning with an accelerated Riemannian optimization method. Firstly, we employ the multi-level graph partitioning algorithm to preprocess the naive pose graph to formulate a balanced optimization problem. In addition, inspired by the accelerated coordinate descent method, we devise an Improved Riemannian Block Coordinate Descent (IRBCD) algorithm and the critical point obtained is globally optimal. Finally, we evaluate the effects of four common graph partitioning approaches on the correlation of the inter-subgraphs, and discover that the Highest scheme has the best partitioning performance. Also, we implement simulations to quantitatively demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art distributed pose graph optimization protocols.</description>
