      <title>Generalized Hostadter functions $G, H$ and beyond: numeration systems and discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12615v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hofstadter's G function is recursively defined via G(0) = 0 and then G(n) = n -G(G(n -1)). Following Hofstadter, a family (F\_k) of similar functions is obtained by varying the number k of nested recursive calls in this equation. We study here some Fibonacci-like sequences that are deeply connected with these functions F\_k . In particular, the Zeckendorf theorem can be adapted to provide digital expansions via sums of terms of these sequences. On these digital expansions, the functions F k are acting as right shifts of the digits. The Fibonacci-like sequences are then expressed in terms of zeros of the polynomial X^k -X^(k-1) -1. Thanks to that, we estimate the discrepancy of each function F\_k , i.e., the maximal distance between F\_k and its linear equivalent. This discrepancy is finite exactly when k $\le$ 4. This also solves some related questions, in particular two twenty-year-old OEIS conjectures stating how close the functions F\_3 and F\_4 are from the integer parts of their linear equivalents. Moreover F\_k can coincide exactly with such an integer part only when k $\le$ 2, while F\_k is almost additive exactly when k $\le$ 4. Finally, a nice fractal shape a la Rauzy has been encountered when investigating the discrepancy of F\_3 .</description>

      <title>Generalized De Bruijn Words, Invertible Necklaces, and the Burrows-Wheeler Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define generalized de Bruijn words, as those words having a Burrows--Wheeler transform that is a concatenation of permutations of the alphabet. We show how to interpret generalized de Bruijn words in terms of Hamiltonian cycles in the generalized de Bruijn graphs introduced in the early '80s in the context of network design. When the size of the alphabet is a prime, we give relations between generalized de Bruijn words, normal bases of finite fields, invertible circulant matrices, and Reutenauer groups. In particular, we highlight a correspondence between binary de Bruijn words of order $d+1$, binary necklaces of length $2^{d}$ having an odd number of $1$s, invertible BWT matrices of size $2^{d}\times 2^{d}$, and normal bases of the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{2^{2^{d}}}$.</description>

      <title>Approximate Tree Completion and Learning-Augmented Algorithms for Metric Minimum Spanning Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding a minimum spanning tree (MST) for $n$ points in an arbitrary metric space is a fundamental primitive for hierarchical clustering and many other ML tasks, but this takes $\Omega(n^2)$ time to even approximate. We introduce a framework for metric MSTs that first (1) finds a forest of disconnected components using practical heuristics, and then (2) finds a small weight set of edges to connect disjoint components of the forest into a spanning tree. We prove that optimally solving the second step still takes $\Omega(n^2)$ time, but we provide a subquadratic 2.62-approximation algorithm. In the spirit of learning-augmented algorithms, we then show that if the forest found in step (1) overlaps with an optimal MST, we can approximate the original MST problem in subquadratic time, where the approximation factor depends on a measure of overlap. In practice, we find nearly optimal spanning trees for a wide range of metrics, while being orders of magnitude faster than exact algorithms.</description>

      <title>Edge-Colored Clustering in Hypergraphs: Beyond Minimizing Unsatisfied Edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a framework for clustering edge-colored hypergraphs, where the goal is to cluster (equivalently, to color) objects based on the primary type of multiway interactions they participate in. One well-studied objective is to color nodes to minimize the number of unsatisfied hyperedges -- those containing one or more nodes whose color does not match the hyperedge color. We motivate and present advances for several directions that extend beyond this minimization problem. We first provide new algorithms for maximizing satisfied edges, which is the same at optimality but is much more challenging to approximate, with all prior work restricted to graphs. We develop the first approximation algorithm for hypergraphs, and then refine it to improve the best-known approximation factor for graphs. We then introduce new objective functions that incorporate notions of balance and fairness, and provide new hardness results, approximations, and fixed-parameter tractability results.</description>

      <title>Unique expansions in number systems via solutions of refinement equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the subdivision schemes theory, we develop a criterion to check if any natural number has at most one representation in the $n$-ary number system with a set of non-negative integer digits $A=\{a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n\}$ that contains zero. This uniqueness property is shown to be equivalent to a certain restriction on the roots of the trigonometric polynomial $\sum_{k=1}^n e^{-2\pi i a_k t}$. From this criterion, under a natural condition of irreducibility for $A$, we deduce that in case of prime~$n$ the uniqueness holds if and only if the digits of $A$ are distinct modulo $n$, whereas for any composite $n$ we show that the latter condition is not necessary. We also establish the connection of this uniqueness to the semigroup freeness problem for affine integer functions of equal integer slope; this together with the two criteria allows to fill the gap in the work of D$.$Klarner on Erd\"os question about densities of affine integer orbits and establish a simple algorithm to check the freeness and the positivity of density when the slope is a prime number.</description>

      <title>The Normal Play of the Domination Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2010, Bre\v{s}ar, Klav\v{z}ar and Rall introduced the optimization variant of the graph domination game and the game domination number. In 2024, Leo Versteegen obtained the celebrated proof of the Conjecture $\frac{3}{5}$ on this variant of the domination game, proposed by Kinnersley, West and Zamani in 2013. In this paper, we investigate for the first time the normal play of the domination game, which we call \textsc{Normal Domination Game}, that is an impartial game where the last to play wins. We first prove that this game is PSPACE-complete. We also use the Sprague-Grundy theory to prove that Alice (the first player) wins in the path $P_n$ if and only if $n$ is not a multiple of $4$, and wins in the cycle $C_n$ if and only if $n=4k+3$ for some integer $k$. Finally, we obtain a polynomial time algorithm to decide the winner for any disjoint union of paths and cycles in the \textsc{Normal Domination Game} and its natural partizan variant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.14624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of real-world phenomena require a computational scheme and a computational domain. In the context of haemodynamics, the computational domain is the blood vessel network through which blood flows. Such networks contain millions of vessels that are joined in series and in parallel. It is computationally unfeasible to explicitly simulate blood flow throughout the network. From a single porcine left coronary arterial tree, we develop a data pipeline to obtain computational domains for haemodynamic simulations in the myocardium from a graph representing a partial coronary arterial tree. In addition, we develop a method to ascertain which subregions of the left-ventricular wall are more likely to be perfused via a given artery, using a comparison with the American Heart Association division of the left ventricle for validation.</description>

      <title>1-in-3 vs. Not-All-Equal: Dichotomy of a broken promise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03456v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 1-in-3 and Not-All-Equal satisfiability problems for Boolean CNF formulas are two well-known NP-hard problems. In contrast, the promise 1-in-3 vs. Not-All-Equal problem can be solved in polynomial time. In the present work, we investigate this constraint satisfaction problem in a regime where the promise is weakened from either side by a rainbow-free structure, and establish a complexity dichotomy for the resulting class of computational problems.</description>

      <title>Holey graphs: very large Betti numbers are testable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the graph property of having a (very) large $k$-th Betti number $\beta_k$ for constant $k$ is testable with a constant number of queries in the dense graph model. More specifically, we consider a clique complex defined by an underlying graph and prove that for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there exists $\delta(\varepsilon,k)&gt;0$ such that testing whether $\beta_k \geq (1-\delta) d_k$ for $\delta \leq \delta(\varepsilon,k)$ reduces to tolerantly testing $(k+2)$-clique-freeness, which is known to be testable. This complements a result by Elek (2010) showing that Betti numbers are testable in the bounded-degree model. Our result combines the Euler characteristic, matroid theory and the graph removal lemma.</description>

      <title>Reducing Matroid Optimization to Basis Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04118v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Much energy has been devoted to developing a matroid's computational properties, yet parallel algorithm design for matroid optimization seems less understood. Specifically, the current state of the art is a folklore reduction from optimization to the search based on methods originating in [KUW88]. However, while this reduction adds only constant overhead in terms of \emph{adaptive complexity}, it imposes a high cost in \emph{query complexity}. In response, we present a new reduction from optimization to search within the class of \emph{binary matroids} which, when $n$ and $r$ take the size of the ground set and matroid rank respectively, implies a novel optimization algorithm terminating in $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n}\cdot\log r)$ parallel rounds using only $\mathcal{O}(rn\cdot\log r)$ independence queries. This is a significant improvement in query complexity when the matroid is sparse, meaning $r \ll n$, while trading off only a logarithmic factor of the rank in the adaptive complexity. At a technical level, our method begins by observing that a basis is optimal if and only if it is the set of points of minimum weight in any cocircuit. Importantly, this certificate reveals that simultaneous tests for \emph{local optimality} in cocircuits is a general paradigm for parallel matroid optimization. By combining this idea with connections between bases and cocircuits we obtain our reduction, whose efficiency follows by analyzing the lattice of flats. A primary goal of our study is initiating a finer understanding of parallel matroid optimization. And so, since many of our techniques begin with observations about general matroids and their flats, we hope that our efforts aid the future design of parallel matroid algorithms and applications of lattice theory thereof.</description>
