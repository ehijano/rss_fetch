      <title>Expected performance of the ALPIDE pixel layers in ALICE FoCal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ALICE experiment is designed to study ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). As part of its major upgrades for Run 4, the Forward Calorimeter (FoCal) will be installed during Long Shutdown 3 (LS3). FoCal enables precise measurements of direct photon production at forward rapidity, providing a sensitive probe of the gluon distribution in protons and nuclei.
  This paper introduces the expected performance of the forward electromagnetic calorimeter (FoCal-E) and presents several potential strategies for mitigating occupancy and BUSY violation challenges in the pixel layers of FoCal-E. Beam test results demonstrate that back biasing effectively reduces pixel occupancy. Meanwhile, SystemC simulations explore additional mitigation strategies-such as grid masking and a regional trigger-to further minimize BUSY violations and enhance detector performance under high-luminosity conditions.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the Response to Electrons and Pions in the Scintillating Fiber and Lead Calorimeter for the Future Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of the Baby Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (Baby BCAL) - a small-scale lead-scintillating-fiber (Pb/ScFi) prototype of the GlueX Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (BCAL) - was tested in a dedicated beam campaign at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility (FTBF). This study provides a benchmark for the Pb/ScFi component of the future Barrel Imaging Calorimeter (BIC) in the ePIC detector at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). The detector response to electrons and pions was studied at beam energies between 4 and 10 GeV, extending previous GlueX tests [NIM A 596 (2008) 327-337 and arXiv:1801.03088] to a higher energy regime.
  The calibrated detector exhibits good linearity within uncertainties, and its electron energy resolution meets EIC requirements. The data further constrain the constant term in the energy resolution to below 1.9%, improving upon previous constraints at lower energies. Simulations reproduce key features of the electron and pion data within the limitations of the collected dataset and the FTBF test environment. Electron-pion separation in the test beam setup was analyzed using multiple methods, incorporating varying degrees of beam-related effects. The inclusion of longitudinal shower profile information enhanced the separation performance, underscoring its relevance for the full-scale BIC in ePIC. These results provide essential benchmarks for the Pb/ScFi section of the future BIC, validating detector simulations and guiding optimization strategies for electron-pion discrimination.</description>

      <title>Investigating irradiation effects and space charge sign inversion in n-type Low Gain Avalanche Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Gain Avalanche Detectors built on n-type substrate (nLGADs) have been developed by IMB-CNM to enhance the detection of low-penetrating particles, with a wide range of applications from medicine, industry to synergies with developments for high-energy physics (HEP). In this work, irradiation effects on nLGADs were investigated through proton irradiation at the CERN PS-IRRAD facility up to proton fluences of $10^{14}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. Electrical characterization before and after irradiation reveals space charge sign inversion of the n-type bulk, leading to significant modifications in the depletion behavior and electric field distribution. Utilizing UV TCT and TPA-TCT measurements, the impact of irradiation on the electric fields and the gain are studied in more detail, confirming a change of sensor depletion and a reduced electric field in the gain layer. The results suggest that donor removal in nLGADs is stronger pronounced already at lower fluences compared to acceptor removal in traditional p-type LGADs. These findings provide not only first insights into the effects of irradiation on nLGADs but also contribute to the development of methods to quantify the donor removal.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the upgraded 3-inch Hamamatsu photomultiplier for the KM3NeT Neutrino Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 3-inch Hamamatsu R14374-02 photomultiplier tube is an improved version of the R12199-02 model and its successor in the construction of the KM3NeT neutrino telescope. A total of 1000 photomultipliers were analysed to assess their dark count rate, transit time spread, and spurious pulses. A subset of 200 photomultipliers were further evaluated to determine their quantum efficiency which is an essential parameter for Monte Carlo simulations of the detector response. The measurements show that R14374-02 model has better quantum efficiency homogeneity over the photocatode and better time properties than the R12199-02.</description>

      <title>First Demonstration of Underground Muon Imaging at an Archaeological Site in Ancient Jerusalem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel underground imaging system that utilizes cosmic-ray muons to explore the subsurface environment at the City of David archaeological site in ancient Jerusalem. This report details the initial findings from measurements conducted at a large cistern, commonly called "Jeremiah's cistern" (referenced in Jeremiah 38:6). The system aims to locate and map hidden voids and structural anomalies within the overburden. Our primary outcome is the derivation of the angular ground depth, which serves as a proxy for understanding the integrated density distribution of the overburden. This work represents a significant interdisciplinary effort to deepen our understanding of this historically important site.</description>

      <title>Technology developments for LHCb Upgrade II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major LHCb detector upgrade will be installed during long shutdown~4 (LS4) of the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The experiment will operate at a maximum luminosity of up to $1.5\times 10^{34}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, with acceptance covering a pseudorapidity range close to the beamline. The detector will therefore experience extremely high particle fluences. In order to carry out the LHCb physics programme, technologies are being developed that can withstand the high rates and associated radiation damage while also providing excellent resolution in both space and time. The amount of data to be processed in the online computing and trigger system is also unprecedented. In this document, the technology developments that are necessary to realise this programme are summarised.</description>

      <title>One Way of Parameter-based Calculation and Comparison of Sensitivities in $0\nu\beta\beta$ Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Worldwide efforts are underway to detect neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay using experiments based on various technologies and target isotopes. Future experiments in this regard aim to exclude the inverted order (IO) condition or explore the normal order (NO) band. Consequently, comparing the sensitivities of proposed $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay experiments with promising prospects is essential. The current study adopts sensitivity metrics, including exclusion and discovery sensitivities, half-life sensitivities, and $m_{\beta\beta}$ sensitivities, to provide a comprehensive evaluation of 9 typical promising experiments: LEGEND, CDEX, nEXO, XLZD, PandaX, KamLAND-Zen, JUNO, SNO+, and CUPID, and highlight their unique features. Based on reported experimental parameters, the concept of a ``technical line'' is introduced to determine the location that each experiment may realize in the $\xi$ and $\lambda_{b}$ space, where $\xi$ represents the sensitive exposure per year, and $\lambda_{b}$ denotes the expected annual rate of background events. Half-life sensitivities for the selected experiments are calculated, some of them in multiple phases while others in conservative or aggressive condition. The results indicate that increasing the operation time is more beneficial for zero-background experiments, which also demonstrate greater competitiveness in discovery sensitivity. $m_{\beta\beta}$ sensitivities are presented as uncertainty bands arising from the nuclear matrix element uncertainties. Additionally, half-life and $m_{\beta\beta}$ sensitivities are estimated under ideal conditions, where only irreducible $2\nu\beta\beta$ background remains. The upper limits of background reduction achievable with current experimental setups are also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Constraints on dark matter boosted by supernova shock within the effective field theory framework from the CDEX-10 experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernova shocks can boost dark matter (DM) particles to high, yet nonrelativistic, velocities, providing a suitable mechanism for analysis within the framework of the nonrelativistic effective field theory (NREFT). These accelerated DM sources extend the experimental ability to scan the parameter space of light DM into the sub-GeV region. In this study, we specifically analyze DM accelerated by the Monogem Ring supernova remnant, whose age ($\sim 68000$ yr) and distance to Earth ($\sim 300$ parsecs) are strategically matched to enable detection with current terrestrial detectors. Utilizing the 205.4 kg$\cdot$day data obtained from the CDEX-10 experiment at the China Jinping Underground Laboratory (CJPL), we derive new constraints on boosted DM within the NREFT framework. The NREFT coupling constant exclusion regions now penetrate the sub-GeV mass range, with optimal sensitivity achieved for operators $\mathcal{O}_{3}$, $\mathcal{O}_{6}$, $\mathcal{O}_{15}$ in the 0.4--0.6 GeV mass range.</description>

      <title>Low Energy Backgrounds and Excess Noise in a Two-Channel Low-Threshold Calorimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe observations of low energy excess (LEE) events, background events observed in all light dark matter direct detection calorimeters, and noise in a Transition Edge Sensor based two-channel silicon athermal phonon detector with 375 meV baseline energy resolution. We measure two distinct LEE populations: ``shared'' multichannel events with a pulse shape consistent with substrate athermal phonon events, and sub-eV events that couple nearly exclusively to a single channel with a significantly faster pulse shape. These ``singles'' are consistent with events occurring within the aluminum athermal phonon collection fins. Similarly, our measured detector noise is higher than the theoretical expectation. Measured noise can be split into an uncorrelated component, consistent with shot noise from small energy depositions within the athermal phonon sensor itself, and a correlated component, consistent with shot noise from energy depositions within the silicon substrate's phonon system.</description>

      <title>Testing the limits of ITkPixV2: the ATLAS inner tracker pixel detector readout chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ITkPixV2 chip is the final production readout chip for the ATLAS Phase 2 Inner Tracker (ITk) upgrade at the upcoming High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). Due to the extraordinarily high peak luminosity at the HL-LHC of $5 \times 10^{34}$ cm$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, ITkPixV2 must meet significant increases in nearly all design requirements, including a 10x increase in trigger rate, a 7.5x increase in hit rate, a 3x increase in radiation tolerance, and a 12.5x decrease in pixel current draw per unit area, all while maintaining a similar power per unit area as present pixel detectors. Here we present the first measurements of the ITkPixV2 chip operated at the limits of the full chip design requirements, including in particular a measurement of the activity-induced current of the chip as a function of increasing hit rate.</description>

      <title>Dual axis atomic magnetometer and gyroscope enabled by nuclear spin perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05319v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alkali-noble-gas comagnetometers have become an essential tool for tests of fundamental physics and offer a compact platform for precision gyroscopy. They are, however, limited by technical noise at low frequencies, commonly due to their limited suppression of magnetic noise. Here we investigate a new method for co-magnetometry between a single noble gas and alkali species. While similar to well-known devices using self-compensation, our scheme introduces magnetic pulses that controllably perturb the noble gas and pulsed optical pumping to polarise the alkali atoms. These applied pulses allow our scheme to measure, rather than just suppress, the effect of magnetic noise thereby offering reduced cross-talk. We show numerically that our scheme retrieves four signals (rotations and magnetic fields on two transverse axes) with similar sensitivity to a single axis device. We also present a proof-of-principle experiment based on a 87Rb-129Xe cell. Our data shows a low magnetic-rotation cross-talk of $0.2 \pm 0.1\mu$Hz$/$pT, which is already on par with the most sensitive devices relying on self-compensation.</description>
