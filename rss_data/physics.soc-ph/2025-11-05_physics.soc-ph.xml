      <title>Dynamic Estimates of Displacement in Disaster Regions: A Policy-driven framework triangulating data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While traditional data systems remain fundamental to humanitarian response, they often lack the real-time responsiveness and spatial precision needed to capture increasingly complex patterns of displacement. Internal displacement reached an unprecedented 83.4 million people by the end of 2024, underscoring the urgent need for innovative, data driven approaches to monitor and understand population movements. This report examines how integrating traditional data sources with emerging digital trace data, such as mobile phone GPS and social media activity, can enhance the accuracy, responsiveness, and granularity of displacement monitoring. Drawing on lessons from recent crises, including the escalation of the war in Ukraine and the 2022 floods in Pakistan, the report presents a structured pilot effort that tests the triangulation of multiple data streams to produce more robust and reliable displacement estimates. Statistical indicators derived from digital trace data are benchmarked against the International Organisation for Migration, Displacement Tracking Matrix datasets, to assess their validity, transparency, and scalability. The findings demonstrate how triangulated data approaches can deliver real-time, high-resolution insights into population movements, improving humanitarian resource allocation and intervention planning. The report includes a scalable framework for crisis monitoring that leverages digital innovation to strengthen humanitarian data systems and support evidence-based decision-making in complex emergencies.</description>

      <title>Complete asymptotic type-token relationship for growing complex systems with inverse power-law count rankings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth dynamics of complex systems often exhibit statistical regularities involving power-law relationships. For real finite complex systems formed by countable tokens (animals, words) as instances of distinct types (species, dictionary entries), an inverse power-law scaling $S \sim r^{-\alpha}$ between type count $S$ and type rank $r$, widely known as Zipf's law, is widely observed to varying degrees of fidelity. A secondary, summary relationship is Heaps' law, which states that the number of types scales sublinearly with the total number of observed tokens present in a growing system. Here, we propose an idealized model of a growing system that (1) deterministically produces arbitrary inverse power-law count rankings for types, and (2) allows us to determine the exact asymptotics of the type-token relationship. Our argument improves upon and remedies earlier work. We obtain a unified asymptotic expression for all values of $\alpha$, which corrects the special cases of $\alpha = 1$ and $\alpha \gg 1$. Our approach relies solely on the form of count rankings, avoids unnecessary approximations, and does not involve any stochastic mechanisms or sampling processes. We thereby demonstrate that a general type-token relationship arises solely as a consequence of Zipf's law.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Redistribution of Indistinguishable Items in Shared Habitation: A Multi-Agent Simulation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a discrete-event stochastic model for the redistribution of indistinguishable personal items, exemplified by socks, among multiple cohabitants sharing a communal laundry system. Drawing on concepts from ecological population dynamics, diffusion processes, and stochastic exchange theory, the model captures the probabilistic mechanisms underlying item mixing, recovery, and loss. Each cohabitant is represented as an autonomous agent whose belongings interact through iterative cycles of collective washing, sorting, and partial correction. The system's evolution is characterized by random mixing events, selective recollection, and attrition over time. Implemented using the SimPy discrete-event simulation framework, the model demonstrates that even minimal exchange probabilities can generate emergent asymmetries, quasi-equilibrium distributions, and long-term disorder. The findings illustrate how stochastic processes inherent to shared domestic systems can produce persistent imbalances, offering a quantitative perspective on an everyday social phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Scaling laws of human mobility persist during extreme floods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although a number of studies have investigated human mobility patterns during natural hazards, mechanistic models that capture mobility dynamics under large-scale perturbations, such as extreme floods, remain scarce. Leveraging mobile phone data and building upon recent insights into universal mobility patterns, we assess whether the general structure of population flows persists during the extreme floods that struck Emilia-Romagna, Italy, in 2023. Our analysis reveals that the relationship between visitor density, distance, and visitation frequency remains robust even under extreme flooding conditions. To disentangle the effects of distance and visitation frequency, we define two aggregated visitor densities: the marginal density over frequency and the aggregated density over distance. We find that the marginal density over frequency exhibits a time-invariant power-law exponent, indicating resilience to flooding disturbances. In contrast, the aggregated density over distance displays more complex behavior: an exponential decay over biweekly periods and a power-law decay over a monthly interval. We propose that the observed power law emerges from the superposition of exponential distributions across shorter timescales. These findings provide new insights into human mobility scaling laws under extreme perturbations, highlighting the robustness of visitation patterns and suggesting avenues for improved mechanistic modeling during natural disasters.</description>

      <title>The exponential distribution of the order of demonstrative, numeral, adjective and noun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The frequency of the preferred order for a noun phrase formed by demonstrative, numeral, adjective and noun has received significant attention over the last two decades. We investigate the actual distribution of the 24 possible orders. There is no consensus on whether it is well-fitted by an exponential or a power law distribution. We find that an exponential distribution is a much better model. This finding and other circumstances where an exponential-like distribution is found challenge the view that power-law distributions, e.g., Zipf's law for word frequencies, are inevitable. We also investigate which of two exponential distributions gives a better fit: an exponential model where the 24 orders have non-zero probability (a geometric distribution truncated at rank 24) or an exponential model where the number of orders that can have non-zero probability is variable (a right-truncated geometric distribution). When consistency and generalizability are prioritized, we find higher support for the exponential model where all 24 orders have non-zero probability. These findings strongly suggest that there is no hard constraint on word order variation and then unattested orders merely result from undersampling, consistently with Cysouw's view.</description>
