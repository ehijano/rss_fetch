      <title>Following the Tidal Trail: A History of Modeling the Magellanic Stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of the Magellanic Stream has puzzled astronomers for decades. In this review, we outline the history of our understanding of the Magellanic System highlighting key observations that have revolutionized thinking of its evolution. We also walk through the major models and theoretical advances that have led to our current paradigm - (1) the LMC and SMC have just had their first pericentric passage around the Milky Way, having approached recently as a bound pair; (2) the LMC and SMC have had several tidal interactions in which material has been stripped out into the Trailing Stream and Leading Arm; (3) the LMC hosted an ionized gas circumgalactic medium which envelops the Clouds and the neutral Stream today, providing the bulk of the associated mass; and (4) the MW's circumgalactic gas provides strong ram pressure and hydrodynamic forces to shape the morphology of the Magellanic System including the formation of a bow shock due to the LMC's supersonic approach.</description>

      <title>The abundance and nature of high-redshift quiescent galaxies from JADES spectroscopy and the FLAMINGO simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use NIRSpec/MSA spectroscopy and NIRCam imaging to study a sample of 18 massive ($\log\; M_{*}/M_{\odot} \gt 10\;$dex), central quiescent galaxies at $2\leq z \leq 5$ in the GOODS fields, to investigate their number density, star-formation histories, quenching timescales, and incidence of AGN. The depth of our data reaches $\log M_*/M_\odot \approx 9\;$dex, yet the least-massive central quiescent galaxy found has $\log M_*/M_\odot \gt 10\;$dex, suggesting that quenching is regulated by a physical quantity that scales with $M_*$. With spectroscopy as benchmark, we assess the completeness and purity of photometric samples, finding number densities 10 times higher than predicted by galaxy formation models, confirming earlier photometric studies. We compare our number densities to predictions from FLAMINGO, the largest-box full-hydro simulation suite to date. We rule out cosmic variance at the 3-$\sigma$ level, providing spectroscopic confirmation that galaxy formation models do not match observations at $z&gt;3$. Using FLAMINGO, we find that the vast majority of quiescent galaxies' stars formed in situ, with these galaxies not having undergone multiple major dry mergers. This is in agreement with the compact observed size of these systems and suggests that major mergers are not a viable channel for quenching most massive galaxies. Several of our observed galaxies are particularly old, with four galaxies displaying 4000-\r{A} breaks; full-spectrum fitting infers formation and quenching redshifts of $z\geq8$ and $z\geq6$. Using all available AGN tracers, we find that 8 massive quiescent galaxies host AGN, including in old systems. This suggests a high duty cycle of AGN and a continued trickle of gas to fuel accretion.</description>

      <title>Beyond Causal Discovery for Astronomy: Learning Meaningful Representations with Independent Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first steps toward applying causal representation learning to astronomy. Following up on previous work that introduced causal discovery to the field for the first time, here we solve a long standing conundrum by identifying the direction of the causal relation between supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass and their host galaxy properties. This leverages a score-based causal discovery approach with an exact posterior calculation. Causal relations between SMBHs and their host galaxies are further clarified by Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The astrophysical problem we focus on is one of the most important open issues in the field and one that has not seen a definitive resolution in decades. We consider the space of six physical properties of galaxies, subdivided by morphology: elliptical, lenticular, and spiral, plus SMBH mass. We calculate an exact posterior over the space of directed acyclic graphs for these variables based on a flat prior and the Bayesian Gaussian equivalent score. The nature of the causal relation between galaxy properties and SMBH mass is found to vary smoothly with morphology, with galaxy properties determining SMBH mass in ellipticals and vice versa in spirals. This settles a long-standing debate and is compatible with our theoretical understanding of galaxy evolution. ICA reveals a decreasing number of meaningful Independent Components (ICs) from ellipticals and lenticular to spiral. Moreover, we find that only one IC correlates with SMBH mass in spirals while multiple ones do in ellipticals, further confirming our finding that SMBH mass causes galaxy properties in spirals, but the reverse holds in ellipticals.</description>

      <title>Deep kiloparsec view of the molecular gas in a massive star-forming galaxy at cosmic noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present deep ($\sim$ 20 hr), high-angular resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the CO(4-3) and [CI](1-0) transitions, along with the rest-frame 630 $\mu$m dust continuum, in BX610 --a massive, main-sequence galaxy at the peak epoch of cosmic star formation $(z = 2.21)$. Combined with deep Very Large Telescope (VLT) SINFONI observations of the H$\alpha$ line, we characterize the molecular gas and star formation activity on kiloparsec scales. Our analysis reveals that the excitation of the molecular gas, as traced by the $L'_{\rm CO(4-3)} / L'_{\rm [CI](1-0)}$ line luminosity ratio, decreases with increasing galactocentric radius. While the line luminosity ratios in the outskirts are similar to those typically found in main-sequence galaxies at $z \sim 1$, the ratios in the central regions of BX610 are comparable to those observed in local starbursts. There is also a giant extra-nuclear star-forming clump in the southwest of BX610 that exhibits high star formation activity, molecular gas abundance, and molecular gas excitation. Furthermore, the central region of BX610 is rich in molecular gas $(M_{\rm mol} / M_{\rm \star} \approx 1)$; however, at the current level of star formation activity, such molecular gas is expected to be depleted in $\sim$ 450 Myr. This, along with recent evidence for rapid inflow toward the center, suggests that BX610 may be experiencing an evolutionary phase often referred to as wet compaction, which is expected to lead to central gas depletion and subsequent inside-out quenching of star formation activity.</description>

      <title>Resolving turbulence drivers in luminous obscured quasars with JWST/NIRSpec IFU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, we investigate the turbulence and energy injection in the extended nebulae surrounding two luminous obscured quasars, WISEA J100211.29$+$013706.7 ($z=1.5933$) and SDSS J165202.64$+$172852.3 ($z=2.9489$). Utilizing high-resolution data from the NIRSpec IFU onboard the James Webb Space Telescope, we analyze the velocity fields of line-emitting gas in and around these quasars and construct the second-order velocity structure functions (VSFs) to quantify turbulent motions across different spatial scales. Our findings reveal a notable flattening in the VSFs from $\approx\!3$ kpc up to a scale of 10--20 kpc, suggesting that energy injection predominantly occurs at a scale $\lesssim$10 kpc, likely powered by quasar outflows and jet-driven bubbles. The extended spatial range of flat VSFs may also indicate the presence of multiple energy injection sources at these scales. For J1652, the turbulent energy in the host interstellar medium (ISM) is significantly higher than in tidally stripped gas, consistent with the expectation of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activities stirring up the host ISM. Compared to the VSFs observed on spatial scales of 10--50 kpc around lower-redshift UV-bright quasars, these obscured quasars exhibit higher turbulent energies in their immediate surroundings, implying different turbulence drivers between the ISM and halo-scale gas. Future studies with an expanded sample are essential to elucidate further the extent and the pivotal role of AGNs in shaping the gas kinematics of host galaxies and beyond.</description>

      <title>SMILES: Discovery of Higher Ionizing Photon Production Efficiency in Overdense Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topology of reionization and the environments where galaxies efficiently produce ionizing photons are key open questions. For the first time, we investigate the correlation between ionizing photon production efficiency, $\xi_{\rm ion}$, and galaxy overdensity, $\log(1+\delta)$. We analyze the ionizing properties of 93 galaxies between $0.7 &lt; z &lt; 6.9$ using JWST NIRSpec medium-resolution spectra from the Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument (MIRI) Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES) program. Among these, 67 galaxies have H$\alpha$ coverage, spanning $0.7 &lt; z &lt; 3.7$. The galaxy overdensity, $\log(1+\delta)$, is measured using the JADES photometric catalog, which covers the SMILES footprint. For the subset with H$\alpha$ coverage, we find that $\log\xi_{\rm ion}$ is positively correlated with $\log(1+\delta)$, with a slope of $0.94_{-0.46}^{+0.46}$. Additionally, the mean $\xi_{\rm ion}$ for galaxies in overdense regions ($\log(1+\delta) &gt; 0.1$) is 2.43 times that of galaxies in lower density regions ($\log(1+\delta) &lt; 0.1$). This strong correlation is found to be independent of redshift evolution. Furthermore, our results confirm the robust correlations between $\xi_{\rm ion}$ and the rest-frame equivalent widths of the [O III] or H$\alpha$ emission lines. Our results suggest that galaxies in high-density regions are efficient producers of ionizing photons.</description>

      <title>Early Bright Galaxies from Helium Enhancements in High-Redshift Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first few cycles of JWST have identified an overabundance of UV-bright galaxies and a general excess of UV luminosity density at $z\gtrsim10$ compared to expectations from most (pre-JWST) theoretical models. Moreover, some of the brightest high-redshift spectroscopically confirmed galaxies exhibit peculiar chemical abundance patterns, most notably extremely high N/O ratios. Since N/O has been empirically shown to scale strongly with He/H, as expected for hot hydrogen burning, these same bright high-redshift galaxies are likely also helium-enhanced. Under simplistic assumptions for stellar evolution, the bolometric luminosity of a star scales as $L\propto (4-\frac{9}{2}Y+\frac{5}{4}Y^{2})^{-1}$ -- hence a higher He/H leads to brighter stars. In this Letter, we evolve a series of MESA models to the zero-age main-sequence and highlight that the helium enhancements at the levels measured and inferred for high-redshift galaxies can boost the 1500 $\mathring{\rm A}$ UV luminosity by up to $\sim50\%$, while simultaneously increasing the stellar effective temperature. The combination of helium enhancements with nebular continuum emission expected for intense bursts of star formation have the potential to help reduce the tension between JWST observations and certain galaxy formation models.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Velocity Dispersion-Size Relation in Molecular Cloud Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structures in molecular ISM are observed to follow a power-law relation between the velocity dispersion and spatial size, known as Larson's first relation, which is often attributed to the turbulent nature of molecular ISM and imprints the dynamics of molecular cloud structures. Using the ${}^{13}\mathrm{CO}~(J=1-0)$ data from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting survey, we built a sample with 360 structures having relatively accurate distances obtained from either the reddened background stars with Gaia parallaxes or associated maser parallaxes, spanning from $0.4$ to $\sim 15~\mathrm{kpc}$. Using this sample and about 0.3 million pixels, we analyzed the correlations between velocity dispersion, surface/column density, and spatial scales. Our structure-wise results show power-law indices smaller than 0.5 in both the $\sigma_v$-$R_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and $\sigma_v$-$R_{\mathrm{eff}} \cdot \Sigma$ relations. In the pixel-wise results, the $\sigma_v^{\mathrm{pix}}$ is statistically scaling with the beam physical size ($R_{\mathrm{s}} \equiv \Theta D/2$) in form of $\sigma_v^{\mathrm{pix}} \propto R_{\mathrm{s}}^{0.43 \pm 0.03}$. Meanwhile, $\sigma_v^{\mathrm{pix}}$ in the inner Galaxy is statistically larger than the outer side. We also analyzed correlations between $\sigma_v^{\mathrm{pix}}$ and the $\mathrm{H_2}$ column density $N(\mathrm{H_2})$, finding that $\sigma_v^{\mathrm{pix}}$ stops increasing with $N(\mathrm{H_2})$ after $\gtrsim 10^{22}~{\mathrm{cm^{-2}}}$. The structures with and without high-column-density ($&gt; 10^{22}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$) pixels show different $\sigma_v^{\mathrm{pix}} \propto N(\mathrm{H_2})^{\xi}$ relations, where the mean (std) $\xi$ values are $0.38~(0.14)$ and $0.62~(0.27)$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Star-forming Galaxies in a Massive Structure at \lowercase{$z\sim$} 2.2: Evidence for Galaxy Harassment in high-$z$ Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We spectroscopically confirm a new protocluster in the COSMOS field at $z$=2.24430 with Keck/MOSFIRE, dubbed CC2.2B, which is in the immediate vicinity of CC2.2A protocluster, originally presented in \cite{Darvish20}. CC2.2B and CC2.2A centroids are separated by $\sim$5.5 Mpc(angular) and $\sim$16 comoving Mpc(radial). CC2.2B and CC2.2A have similar properties, with CC2.2B having a line-of-sight velocity dispersion and estimated total mass of $\sigma_{los}$=693$\pm$65 km s$^{-1}$ and $M_{total}$=($\sim$2-3)$\times$10$^{14}$ $M_{\odot}$, respectively. These two similar overdensities are likely still in the merging process and will likely collapse into a more massive structure at lower redshifts. We combine CC2.2A and CC2.2B data to investigate the role of high-$z$ protocluster environments on the dynamics of star-forming (SF) galaxies compared to a similarly selected field sample. We find that on average, protocluster SF galaxies have $\sim$0.1 dex (at $\sim$1.8$\sigma$ significance) lower gas velocity dispersions, $\sim$0.2 dex (at $\sim$2.2$\sigma$ significance) lower dynamical masses, and $\sim$0.2 dex lower dynamical-to-stellar mass ratio than the field SF galaxies. We argue that galaxy harassment and galaxy-galaxy interactions can potentially explain these differences. We also find a factor of $\sim$2-3 lower scatter around the mean $\sigma$-$M_{*}$, $M_{dyn}$-$M_{*}$, and $M_{dyn}$/$M_{*}$ vs. $M_{*}$ relations for protocluster SF galaxies than the field. This could be due to a more uniform formation for protocluster galaxies than their field counterparts. Our results have potential implications for the physics of preprocessing in early environments.</description>

      <title>Orbits and vertical height distribution of 4006 open clusters in the Galactic disk using Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open clusters (OCs) in the Galaxy are excellent probes for tracing the structure and evolution of the Galactic disk. We present an updated catalog of parameters for 1,145 OCs, estimated using the Gaia DR3 data earlier listed in Cantat-Gaudin et al. (2020). This sample is complemented by 3,677 OCs from the catalog by Hunt &amp; Reffert (2023). Using the Galaxy potential and the space velocities, orbits of 4,006 OCs were computed. We provide a catalog with orbital parameters such as eccentricity, perigalactic and apogalactic distance, and the maximum vertical height traced by OCs from the Galactic disk. The OCs were found to be distributed between 5-16 kpc from the Galactic center, with older OCs showing a radially extended distribution. The low number of old OCs in the inner Solar circle region likely suggests their destruction in this area. We derive a quantitative expression for the dependency of the maximum vertical height (Z_max) OCs can reach with the cluster's age and Galactocentric radius for the first time. The young and intermediate-age OCs show similar values of Z_max till 9 kpc, with the latter group having higher values beyond. OCs older than 1 Gyr show larger values of Z_max at all Galactocentric radii and significantly larger values beyond 9 kpc. Higher values of Z_max are found in the third Galactic quadrant, suggesting a link between these higher values and the Galactic warp. This sample shows that young OCs are also involved in the diagonal ridge formation in the solar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>The ALMA-QUARKS Survey: Fibers' role in star formation unveiled in an intermediate-mass protocluster region of the Vela D cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the IRS 17 filament within the intermediate-mass protocluster IRAS 08448-4343 (of $\sim\,10^3\,\rm M_{\odot}$), using ALMA data from the ATOMS 3-mm and QUARKS 1.3-mm surveys. The IRS 17 filament, which spans $\sim$54000 au ($0.26\,\rm pc$) in length and $\sim$4000 au ($0.02\,\rm pc$) in width, exhibits a complex, multi-component velocity field, and harbours hierarchical substructures. These substructures include three bundles of seven velocity-coherent fibers, and 29 dense ($n\sim 10^8\,\rm cm^{-3}$) condensations. The fibers have a median length of $\sim 4500\,\rm au$ and a median width of $\sim 1400\,\rm au$. Among these fibers, four are identified as ``fertile", each hosting at least three dense condensations, which are regarded as the ``seeds" of star formation. While the detected cores are randomly spaced within the IRS\,17 filament based on the 3-mm dust continuum image, periodic spacing ($\sim1600\,\rm au$) of condensations is observed in the fertile fibers according to the 1.3-mm dust map, consistent with the predictions of linear isothermal cylinder fragmentation models. These findings underscore the crucial role of fibers in star formation and suggest a hierarchical fragmentation process that extends from the filament to the fibers, and ultimately, to the smallest-scale condensations.</description>

      <title>Partial suppression of chaos in relativistic 3-body problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent numerical results seem to suggest that in certain regimes of typical particle velocities the gravitational $N-$body problem (for $3\leq N\lesssim 10^3$) is intrinsically less chaotic when the post-Newtonian (PN) force terms are included, with respect to its classical counterpart that exhibits a slightly larger maximal Lyapunov exponent $\Lambda_{\rm max}$. In this work we explore the dynamics of wildly chaotic, regular and nearly regular configurations of the 3-body problem with and without the PN corrective terms aiming at shedding some light on the behaviour of the Lyapunov spectra under the effect of said corrections. Because the interaction of the tangent-space dynamics in gravitating systems, needed to evaluate the Lyapunov exponents, becomes rapidly computationally heavy due to the complexity of the higher order force derivatives involving multiple powers of $v/c$, we introduce a technique to compute a proxy of the Lyapunov spectrum based on the time-dependent diagonalization of the inertia tensor of a cluster of trajectories in phase-space. We find that, for a broad range of orbital configurations, the relativistic 3-body problem has a smaller $\Lambda_{\rm max}$ than its classical counterpart starting with the exact same initial condition. However, the rest of the Lyapunov spectrum can be either lower or larger in the classical case, suggesting that the relativistic precession effectively reduces chaos only along one (or few) directions in phase-space. As a general trend, the dynamical entropy of the relativistic simulations as function of the rescaled speed of light always has a regime in which falls below the classical value.} We observe that, the sole analysis of $\Lambda_{\rm max}$ could induce possibly misleading conclusions on the chaoticity of systems with small (and possibly large $N$.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Investigation of Environmental Influences on Galaxies in Group Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environment has long been known to impact the evolution of galaxies, but disentangling its effects from mass evolution requires careful analysis of statistically significant samples. By implementing advanced visualisation methods to test group-finding algorithms, we utilise a mass-complete sample of galaxies to z &lt; 0.1, comprising spectroscopic redshifts from prominent surveys such as the 2dFGRS and GAMA. Our group-finding methods identify 1,413 galaxy groups made up of 8,990 galaxies, corresponding to 36% of galaxies associated with group environments. We also search for close pairs, with separations of $r_{sep}$ &lt; 50 h$^{-1}$ kpc and $v_{sep}$ &lt; 500 km/s, and classify them into major ($M_{sec}/M_{prim} \leq$ 0.25) and minor ($M_{sec}/M_{prim}$ &gt; 0.25) pairs. To examine the impact of environmental factors, we employ bespoke WISE photometry to derive a star-forming main sequence relation that shows star-formation (SF) within galaxies is pre-processed as a function of group membership. Our analysis reveals that SF in galaxies is pre-processed as a function of group membership. We observe an increase in the fraction of quiescent galaxies relative to the field as group membership rises, quantified using the environmental quenching efficiency metric ($\epsilon_{env}$). Within the star-forming population, we detect pre-processing with the relative difference in specific SF rates (${\Delta} sSFR$), showing a net decrease in SF as group membership increases, particularly at larger stellar masses. Our sample of close pairs at low stellar masses shows enhanced SF efficiencies compared to the field, while at larger masses, deficiencies are evident. Our results indicate that the small-scale environments of galaxies influence SF properties, demonstrating that galaxies do not evolve in isolation over cosmic time but are shaped by complex interactions between internal dynamics and external influences.</description>

      <title>Dormancy and Reawakening Over Years: Eight New Recurrent Changing-Look AGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of eight new recurrent changing-look (CL) active galactic nuclei (AGNs), including seven re-brightening turn-off AGNs and one fading turn-on AGN. These systems are valuable for placing constraints on the duration of dim and bright states, which may be linked to the AGN duty cycle or disk instability. Long-term optical light curve analysis reveals that many objects in our sample exhibit a prolonged plateau during the dim states lasting 4 to 7 years, with gradual turn-on/off process. We observe no significant difference between the turn-on and turn-off timescales, and this timescale is broadly consistent with the heating/cooling front propagation timescale. The comparison between optical and infrared variations supports that these transitions are driven by changes in accretion disk emission rather than dust obscuration. Our discovery significantly increases the previously identified recurrent CL AGN sample from eleven objects to nineteen, demonstrating that some AGNs can enter dormancy and reawaken on timescales of a few years, which provides useful information for understanding AGN episodic accretion.</description>

      <title>New stellar age estimates using SPInS based on Gaia DR3 photometry and LAMOST DR8 abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable stellar age estimates are fundamental for testing several problems in modern astrophysics, in particular since they set the time scales of Galactic dynamical and chemical evolution. In this study, we determine ages using only Gaia DR3 photometry and parallaxes, in combination with interstellar extinction maps, spectroscopic metallicities and $\alpha$ abundances from the latest data release (DR8) of the LAMOST survey. In contrast with previous age estimates, we do not use spectroscopic effective temperatures or surface gravities, thus relying on the excellent precision and accuracy of the Gaia photometry. We use a new version of the publicly available SPInS code with improved features, including the on-the-fly computation of the autocorrelation time and the automatic convergence evaluation. We determine reliable age estimates for 35,096 and 243,768 sub-giant and main-sequence turn-off stars in the LAMOST DR8 low- and medium-resolution surveys with typical uncertainties smaller than 10%. In addition, we successfully test our method on more than 4,000 stars of 14 well-studied open and globular star clusters covering a wide range of ages, confirming the reliability of our age and uncertainty estimates.</description>

      <title>The magnetic field in quiescent star-forming filament G16.96+0.27</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 850 {\mu}m thermal dust polarization observations with a resolution of 14.4"(~ 0.13 pc) towards an infrared dark cloud G16.96+0.27 using JCMT/POL-2. The average magnetic field orientation, which roughly agrees with the larger-scale magnetic field orientation traced by the Planck 353 GHz data, is approximately perpendicular to the filament structure. The estimated plane-of-sky magnetic field strength is ~ 96 {\mu}G and ~ 60 {\mu}G using two variants of the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi methods. We calculate the virial and magnetic critical parameters to evaluate the relative importance of gravity, the magnetic field, and turbulence. The magnetic field and turbulence are both weaker than gravity, but magnetic fields and turbulence together are equal to gravity, suggesting that G16.96+0.27 is in a quasi-equilibrium state. The cloud-magnetic-field alignment is found to have a trend moving away from perpendicularity in the dense regions, which may serve as a tracer of potential fragmentation in such quiescent filaments.</description>

      <title>Size and kinematics of the low-ionization broad emission line region from microlensing-induced line profile distortions in gravitationally lensed quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MgII or H$\alpha$ line profile distortions observed in five gravitationally lensed quasars have been compared with simulated ones. The simulations are based on three BLR models, a Keplerian disk (KD), an equatorial wind (EW), and a polar wind (PW). We find that the wide variety of observed line profile distortions can be reproduced with microlensing-induced distortions of line profiles generated by our BLR models. For three quasars, the most likely model is either KD or EW, depending on the orientation of the magnification map with respect to the BLR axis. This shows that the line profile distortions depend on the position and orientation of the BLR with respect to the caustic network, and not only on their different effective sizes. In the other quasars, the EW model is preferred. For all objects, the PW model has a lower probability. We conclude that disk geometries with kinematics dominated by either Keplerian rotation or equatorial outflow best reproduce the microlensing effects on the MgII and H$\alpha$ emission lines. The half-light radii of the MgII and H$\alpha$ BLRs are measured in the range of 3 to 25 light-days. The size of the region emitting the low-ionization lines is larger than the region emitting the high-ionization lines, with a factor of four measured between the sizes of the MgII and CIV emitting regions. The microlensing radii of the BLRs are found to be systematically below the radius-luminosity ($R -L$) relations derived from reverberation mapping, confirming that the intrinsic dispersion of the BLR radii with respect to the $R-L$ relations is large, but also revealing a selection bias that affects microlensing-based BLR size measurements.</description>

      <title>Hubble Space Telescope Observations of Nearby Type 1 Quasars. I. Characterisation of the Extended [O III] 5007{\AA} Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Hubble Space Telescope to analyse the extended [O III] 5007A emission in seven bright radio-quiet type 1 quasars (QSO1s), focusing on the morphology and physical conditions of their extended Narrow-Line Regions (NLRs). We find NLRs extending 3-9 kpc, with four quasars showing roughly symmetrical structures (b/a=1.2-1.5) and three displaying asymmetric NLRs (b/a=2.4-5.6). When included with type 1 and type 2 AGNs from previous studies, the sizes of the extended [O III] regions scale with luminosity as $R[O III] \sim L[O III]^{0.5}$, consistent with photoionisation. However, when analysed separately, type 1s exhibit a steeper slope ($\gamma=0.57\pm0.05$) compared to type 2 AGNs ($\gamma=0.48\pm0.02$). We use photoionisation modeling to estimate the maximum NLRs sizes, assuming a minimum ionisation parameter of $\log(U) = -3$, an ionising luminosity based on the $L[O III]$-derived bolometric luminosity, and a minimum gas number density $n_H \sim 100\,\text{cm}^{-3}$, assuming that molecular clouds provide a reservoir for the ionised gas. The derived sizes agree well with direct measurements for a sample of type 2 quasars, but are underestimated for the current sample of QSO1s. A better agreement is obtained for the QSO1s using bolometric luminosities derived from the 5100A continuum luminosity. Radial mass profiles for the QSO1s show significant extended mass in all cases, but with less [O III]-emitting gas near the central AGN compared to QSO2s. This may suggest that the QSO1s are in a later evolutionary stage than QSO2s, further past the blow-out stage.</description>

      <title>The impact of the local stellar radiation on the formation and evolution of dwarfs in and near Milky Way analogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the effect of local stellar radiation on the formation and evolution of the dwarf galaxies near the Milk Way(MW) analogues. Using five simulations from the Auriga project, both with and without local stellar radiation, we find that the local stellar radiation, as a pre-reionization source, is quite effective to photoionize and heat the gas around the proto-MW analogues. As a result, the formation of surrounding dwarf galaxies in dark matter halos with halo masses below approximately $10^{9.5}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ are significantly suppressed. After the reionization, the intensity of the local stellar radiation eventually becomes comparable to that of UVB, consequently the impact of local stellar radiation on the surrounding dwarf galaxy formation decreases with decreasing redshift, and almost vanishes after redshift $z=4$. At present day, the bright satellite population in the simulations with and without local stellar radiation is nearly identical. While our simulation have no enough resolution to resolve the fainest satellite galaxies which are most prone to the local stellar radiation, we use accreted galaxy mass function to assess the impact, and find that the reduction in the faintest satellite is around $13$ percent in case of the local stellar radiation, a factor not negligible to constrain dark matter models using the precise abundance of MW satellite galaxies.</description>

      <title>The period-luminosity relation of long-period variables in the Large Magellanic Cloud observed with ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Period-luminosity relations of long period variables (LPVs) are a powerful tool to map the distances of stars in our galaxy, and are typically calibrated using stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Recent results demonstrated that these relations show a strong dependence on the amplitude of the variability, which can be used to greatly improve distance estimates. However, one of the only highly sampled catalogs of such variables in the LMC is based on OGLE photometry, which does not provide all-sky coverage. Here, we provide the first measurement of the period-luminosity relation of long-period variables in the LMC using photometry from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). We derive conversions between ugriz, Gaia, and ATLAS c and o passbands with a precision of approximately 0.02 mag, which enable the measurement of reliable amplitudes with ATLAS for crowded fields. We successfully reproduce the known PL sequences A through E, and show evidence for sequence F using the ratios of amplitudes observed in both ATLAS pass-bands. Our work demonstrates that the ATLAS survey can recover variability in evolved red giants and lays the foundation for an all-sky distance map of the Milky Way using long-period variables.</description>

      <title>Origin of the metal-rich vs. metal-poor globular clusters dichotomies in the Milky Way: A sign of low black hole natal kicks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bimodal metallicity distribution of globular clusters (GCs) in massive galaxies implies two distinct sub-populations: metal-poor and metal-rich. Using the recent data of \textit{Gaia} we highlighted three distinct dissimilarities between metal-poor and metal-rich GCs in the Milky Way (MW). Half-mass (light) radii of metal-poor GCs exhibit, on average, $\simeq 52 \pm$5 ($60 \pm$3) per cent more expansion than metal-rich ones. Furthermore, the lack of metal-poor GCs at low Galactocentric distances ($R_\mathrm{G}$) follows a triangular pattern in $R_\mathrm{G}$-[Fe/H] space, indicating that GCs with lower metallicities appear further away from the Galactic center. Metal-poor GCs are more susceptible to destruction by the tidal field in the inner part of the MW. We perform a series of \Nbody simulations of star clusters, to study the impact of the BHs' natal kicks on the long-term evolution of low- and high-metallicity GCs to explain these observational aspects. We found that the retention of BHs inside the cluster is crucial to reproducing the observed dissimilarities. The heavier and less expanded BH sub-system (BHSub) in metal-poor clusters leads to more intense few-body encounters, injecting more kinetic energy into the stellar population. Consequently, they experience larger expansion and higher evaporation rates rather than metal-rich clusters. The higher energy production within the BHSub of metal-poor GCs causes them to dissolve before a Hubble time near the Galactic center, leading to a triangular pattern in $R_\mathrm{G}$-[Fe/H] space.</description>

      <title>The High-resolution Accretion Disks of Embedded protoStars (HADES) simulations. I. Impact of Protostellar Magnetic Fields on the Accretion Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How embedded, actively accreting low-mass protostars accrete their mass is still greatly debated. Observations are now piecing together the puzzle of embedded protostellar accretion, in particular with new facilities in the near-infrared. However, high-resolution theoretical models are still lacking, with a stark paucity of detailed simulations of these early phases. Here we present high-resolution non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of a Solar mass protostar accreting at rates exceeding 10$^{-6} M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. We show the results of the accretion flow for four different protostellar magnetic fields, 10 G, 500 G, 1 kG, and 2 kG, combined with a disk magnetic field. For weaker (10 G and 500 G) protostar magnetic fields, accretion occurs via a turbulent boundary layer mode, with disk material impacting across the protostellar surface. In the 500 G model, the presence of a magnetically dominated outflow focuses the accretion towards the equator, slightly enhancing and ordering the accretion. For kG magnetic fields, the disk becomes truncated due to the protostellar dipole and exhibits magnetospheric accretion, with the 2 kG model having accretion bursts induced by the interchange instability. We present bolometric light curves for the models and find that they reproduce observations of Class I protostars from YSOVAR, with high bursts followed by an exponential decay possibly being a signature of instability-driven accretion. Finally, we present the filling fractions of accretion and find that 90\% of the mass is accreted in a surface area fraction of 10-20\%. These simulations will be extended in future work for a broader parameter space, with their high resolution and high temporal spacing able to explore a wide range of interesting protostellar physics.</description>

      <title>Classification of Wolf Rayet stars using Ensemble-based Machine Learning algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a robust Machine Learning classifier model utilizing the eXtreme-Gradient Boosting (XGB) algorithm for improved classification of Galactic Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars based on Infrared (IR) colors and positional attributes. For our study, we choose an extensive dataset of 6555 stellar objects (from 2MASS and AllWISE data releases) lying in the Milky Way (MW) with available photometric magnitudes of different types including WR stars. Our XGB classifier model can accurately (with an 86\% detection rate) identify a sufficient number of WR stars against a large sample of non-WR sources. The XGB model outperforms other ensemble classifier models such as the Random Forest. Also, using the XGB algorithm, we develop a WR sub-type classifier model that can differentiate the WR subtypes from the non-WR sources with a high model accuracy ($&gt;60\%$). Further, we apply both XGB-based models to a selection of 6457 stellar objects with unknown object types, detecting 58 new WR star candidates and predicting sub-types for 10 of them. The identified WR sources are mainly located in the Local spiral arm of the MW and mostly lie in the solar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive Stars at low metallicity IX: Empirical constraints on mass-loss rates and clumping parameters for OB supergiants in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Current implementations of mass loss for hot, massive stars in stellar evolution models include a sharp increase in mass loss when blue supergiants become cooler than Teff 20-22kK. This drastic mass-loss jump has been motivated by the potential presence of a so-called bistability ionisation effect, which may occur for line-driven winds in this temperature region due to recombination of important line-driving ions. Aims. We perform quantitative spectroscopy using UV (ULLYSES program) and optical (XShootU collaboration) data for 17 OB-supergiant stars in the LMC (covering the range Teff 14-32kK), deriving absolute constraints on global stellar, wind, and clumping parameters. We examine whether there are any empirical signs of a mass-loss jump in the investigated region, and we study the clumped nature of the wind. Methods. We use a combination of the model atmosphere code fastwind and the genetic algorithm code Kiwi-GA to fit synthetic spectra of a multitude of diagnostic spectral lines in the optical and UV. Results. We find no signs of any upward mass loss jump anywhere in the examined region. Standard theoretical comparison models, which include a strong bistability jump thus severely over predict the empirical mass-loss rates on the cool side of the predicted jump. Additionally, we find that on average about 40% of the total wind mass seems to reside in the diluted medium in between dense clumps. Conclusions. Our derived mass-loss rates suggest that for applications like stellar evolution one should not include a drastic bistability jump in mass loss for stars in the temperature and luminosity region investigated here. The derived high values of interclump density further suggest that the common assumption of an effectively void interclump medium (applied in the vast majority of spectroscopic studies of hot star winds) is not generally valid in this parameter regime.</description>

      <title>Interpolation techniques for reconstructing Galactic Faraday rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The line-of-sight structure of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) can be studied using Faraday rotation measure (RM) grids. We analyze how the choice of interpolation kernel can affect the accuracy and reliability of reconstructed RM maps. We test the following kernels: inverse distance weighting (IDW), natural neighbour interpolation (NNI), inverse multiquadric interpolation (IM), thin-plate spline interpolation (TPS), and a Bayesian rotation measure sky (BRMS); all techniques were tested on two simulated Galactic foreground RMs (one assuming the GMF has patchy structures and the other assuming it has filamentary structures) using magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Both foregrounds were sampled to form RM grids with densities of $\sim$40 sources deg$^{-2}$ and area $\sim$144 deg$^2$. The techniques were tested on data sets with different noise levels and Gaussian random extragalactic RM contributions. The data set that most closely emulates expected data from current surveys, such as the POlarization Sky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism (POSSUM), had extragalactic contributions and a noise standard deviation of $\sim 1.5$ rad m$^{-2}$. For this data set, the accuracy of the techniques for the patchy structures from best to worst was: BRMS, NNI, TPS, IDW and IM; while in the filamentary simulate foreground it was: BRMS, NNI, TPS, and IDW. IDW is the most computationally expensive technique, while TPS and IM are the least expensive. BRMS and NNI have the same, intermediate computational cost. This analysis lays the groundwork for Galactic RM studies with large radio polarization sky surveys, such as POSSUM.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry in galaxy spin directions: a fully reproducible experiment using HSC data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The asymmetry in the large-scale distribution of the directions towards spiral galaxies rotate has been observed by multiple telescopes, all show a consistent asymmetry in the distribution of galaxy spin directions as observed from Earth. Here, galaxies with redshift from HSC DR3 are annotated by their direction of rotation, and their distribution is analyzed. The results show that galaxies that rotate in the opposite direction relative to the Milky Way as observed from Earth are significantly more prevalent compared to galaxies that rotate in the same direction relative to the Milky Way. The asymmetry also forms a dipole axis that becomes stronger when the redshift gets higher. These results are aligned with observations from virtually all premier digital sky surveys, as well as space telescopes such as HST and JWST. That shows that the distribution of galaxy spin directions as observed from Earth is not symmetric, and has a possible link to the rotational velocity of the Milky Way. The experiment is provided with data, code, and a full protocol that allows to easily reproduce the results in a transparent manner. That practice is used to overcome the ``reproducibility crisis" in science.</description>

      <title>HCN and HNC in the Disk of an Outbursting Young Star, V883 Ori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and hydrogen isocyanide (HNC) are isomers with similar chemical properties. However, HNC can be converted into other molecules by reactions with atomic hydrogen (H) and atomic oxygen (O), resulting in a variation of the HCN/HNC abundance ratio. These reaction rates are sensitive to gas temperature, resulting in different abundance ratios in different temperature environments. The emission of HCN and HNC was found to distribute along ring structures in the protoplanetary disk of V883 Ori. HCN exhibits a multi-ring structure consisting of inner and outer rings. The outer ring represents a genuine chemical structure, whereas the inner ring appears to display such characteristics due to the high dust continuum optical depth at the center. However, HNC is entirely depleted in the warmer inner ring, while its line intensity is similar to that of HCN in the colder outer ring. In this study, we present a chemical calculation that reproduces the observed HCN/HNC abundance ratio in the inner and outer rings. This calculation suggests that the distinct emission distribution between HCN and HNC results from a currently ongoing outburst in V883 Ori. The sublimation of HCN and HNC from grain surfaces and the conversion of HNC to HCN determine their chemical distribution in the heated, warm inner disk.</description>

      <title>Galactic and extragalactic probe of dark matter with LISA's binary black holes near their galactic center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upcoming LISA mission will be able to detect gravitational waves from galactic and extragalactic compact binaries. Here, we report on LISA's capability to probe dark matter around these binaries if the latter constitute black holes. By analyzing the variation in the chirp mass of the binary, we show that depending on the black hole masses, LISA should be able to probe their surrounding dark matter to a luminosity distance of $\approx 1$ Gpc if such binaries are observed within the inner $\approx 10$ pc of their galactic center for particle-like dark matter or near the galactic solitonic core for wave-like dark matter. In the case a null result is recorded during the course of observation of \emph{well-localized} binaries, one can still rule out certain parameter spaces of dark matter as being the dominant contributor to the matter budget of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Estimating Gamma-Ray Flux from Millisecond Pulsars Originating in Globular Clusters Near the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the contribution of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) to the gamma-ray excess observed in the Galactic Center by analyzing data from high-resolution direct N-body simulations of six globular clusters (GCs) that experience close encounters with the nuclear star cluster. Using the {\phi}-GPU code, we tracked the orbits of individual neutron stars (NSs) formed during the simulations, assuming a fraction of these NSs evolve into MSPs. Our model includes state-of-the-art single stellar evolution code including prescription for neutron star formation. We estimated the gamma-ray flux from these MSPs, considering known values for their gamma-ray emission. Our results show that MSPs originating from the six modeled GCs contribute a small but non-negligible fraction of the observed gamma-ray flux. This finding suggests that the actual gamma-ray flux from MSPs could be much higher when considering the entire population of GCs, potentially significantly contributing to the gamma-ray excess. This study highlights the importance of considering MSPs in the Galactic Center, originating from nearby globular clusters, as a potential source of the observed gamma-ray excess. Future work will involve more sophisticated simulations incorporating binary stellar evolution and comparing the fraction of MSPs in observed GCs to refine our models and improve the accuracy of our estimates.</description>

      <title>Identifying new high-confidence polluted white dwarf candidates using Gaia XP spectra and Self-Organizing Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification of new white dwarfs (WDs) polluted with heavy elements is important since they provide a valuable tool for inferring chemical properties of putative planetary systems accreting material on their surfaces. The Gaia space mission has provided us with an unprecedented amount of astrometric, photometric, and low resolution (XP) spectroscopic data for millions of newly discovered stellar sources, among them thousands of WDs. In order to find WDs among this data and to identify which ones have metals in their atmospheres, we propose a methodology based on an unsupervised artificial intelligence technique called Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). In our approach a nonlinear high-dimensional dataset is projected on a 2D grid map where similar elements fall into the same neuron.
  By applying this method, we obtained a clean sample of 66,337 WDs. We performed an automatic spectral classification analysis to them, obtaining 143 bona fide polluted WD candidates not previously classified in the literature. The majority of them are cool WDs and we identify in their XP spectra several metallic lines such as Ca, Mg, Na, Li, and K. The fact that we obtain similar precision metrics than those achieved with recent supervised techniques highlights the power of our unsupervised approach to mine the Gaia archives for hidden treasures to follow-up spectroscopically with higher resolution.</description>

      <title>Deep Multimodal Representation Learning for Stellar Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, contrastive learning (CL), a technique most prominently used in natural language and computer vision, has been used to train informative representation spaces for galaxy spectra and images in a self-supervised manner. Following this idea, we implement CL for stars in the Milky Way, for which recent astronomical surveys have produced a huge amount of heterogeneous data. Specifically, we investigate Gaia XP coefficients and RVS spectra. Thus, the methods presented in this work lay the foundation for aggregating the knowledge implicitly contained in the multimodal data to enable downstream tasks like cross-modal generation or fused stellar parameter estimation. We find that CL results in a highly structured representation space that exhibits explicit physical meaning. Evaluating Using this representation space to perform cross-modal generation and stellar label regression results in excellent performance with high-quality generated samples as well as accurate and precise label predictions.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Energy Extraction in Kerr Black Holes through Frame-Dragging Magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12684v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is argued that the zero-angular-momentum-observers (ZAMOs) circulating with the frame-dragging-angular-velocity $\omega$ plays a leading part in energy extraction. When the condition $\Omega_{\rm F}&lt;\Omega_{\rm H}$ is satisfied, where $\Omega_{\rm H}$ and $\Omega_{\rm F}$ are the horizon and field-line (FL) angular-velocities (AVs), they will see that the null surface S$_{\rm N}$ with $\omega_{\rm N}=\Omega_{\rm F}$ always exists in the force-free magnetosphere. The pivotal ZAMO-measured FLAV $\Omega_{\rm ZF} \equiv \Omega_{\rm F} - \omega$ changes sign on this surface S$_{\rm N}$ where the force-free and freezing-in conditions break down. The force-free magnetosphere is divided on this surface, with particle-current sources on it. The outer domain ${D}_{\rm (out)}$ outside S$_{\rm N}$ spins forward ($\Omega_{\rm ZF}&gt;0$), whereas the inner domain ${D}_{\rm (in)}$ inside spins backward ($\Omega_{\rm ZF}&lt;0$).
  Because the electric field ${\bf E}_{\rm p}$ reverses direction there, the Poynting flux reverses direction as well from outward to inward, though the positive angular momentum always flows outwardly.
  Electromagnetic self-extraction of energy will be possible only through the frame-dragged magnetosphere, with the inner domain ${D}_{\rm (in)}$ nested between the horizon and the surface S$_{\rm N}$, when $\Omega_{\rm F}&lt;\Omega_{\rm H}$ is ensured by the 1st and 2nd laws of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Galaxy clustering at cosmic dawn from JWST/NIRCam observations to redshift z$\sim$11</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report measurements of the galaxy two-point correlation function at cosmic dawn, using photometrically-selected sources from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). The JWST/NIRCam dataset comprises approximately $N_g \simeq 7000$ photometrically-selected Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs), spanning in the redshift range $5\leq z&lt;11$. The primary objective of this study is to extend clustering measurements beyond redshift $z&gt;10$, finding a galaxy bias $b=9.6\pm1.7$ for the sample at $\overline{z} = 10.6$. The result suggests that the observed sources are hosted by dark matter halos of approximately $M_{h}\sim 10^{10.6}~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, in broad agreement with theoretical and numerical modelling of early galaxy formation during the epoch of reionization. Furthermore, the JWST JADES dataset enables an unprecedented investigation of clustering of dwarf galaxies two orders of magnitude fainter than the characteristic $L_*$ luminosity (i.e. with $M_{F200W}\simeq-15.8$) during the late stages of the epoch of reionization at $z\sim 6$. By analyzing clustering as a function of luminosity, we find that $b(M_{F200W})$ aligns with previous results for brighter galaxies and then decreases with $M_{F200W}$, as theoretically expected for fainter candidates. These initial results demonstrate the potential for further quantitative characterisation of the interplay between assembly of dark matter and light during cosmic dawn that the growing samples of JWST observations are enabling.</description>

      <title>An Edge-on Regular Disk Galaxy at z=5.289</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While rotation-supported gas disks are known to exist as early as at z ~ 7, it is still a general belief that stellar disks form late in the Universe. This picture is now being challenged by the observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which have revealed a large number of disk-like galaxies that could be at z &gt; 3, with some being candidates at z &gt; 7. As an early formation of stellar disks will greatly impact our theory of galaxy formation and evolution, it is important to determine when such systems first emerged. Here we present D-CEERS-RUBIES-z5289 at z=5.289+-0.001, the second confirmed stellar disk at z &gt; 5, discovered using the archival JWST NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec spectroscopic data. This galaxy has a highly regular edge-on disk morphology, extends to ~6.2 kpc along its major axis, and has an effective radius of ~1.3--1.4 kpc. Such a large stellar disk is yet to be produced in numerical simulations. By analyzing its 10-band spectral energy distribution using four different tools, we find that it has a high stellar mass of 10^{9.5-10.0} M_sun. Its age is in the range of 330--510 Myr, and it has a mild star formation rate of 10--30 M_sun/yr. While the current spectroscopic data do not allow the derivation of its rotation curve, the width of its Halpha line from the partial slit coverage on one side of the disk reaches ~345 km/s, which suggests that it could have a significant contribution from rotation.</description>

      <title>A photo-z cautionary tale: Redshift confirmation of COSBO-7 at z=2.625</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photometric redshifts are widely used in studies of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs), but catastrophic photo-$z$ failure can undermine all redshift-dependent results. Here we report the spectroscopic redshift confirmation of COSBO-7, a strongly lensed DSFG in the COSMOS-PRIMER field. Recently, a photometric redshift solution of $z\gtrsim7.0$ was reported for COSBO-7 based on ten bands of {\it James Webb} Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam and MIRI imaging data. This $z$ value was favored by four independent spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes, and the result provided an appealing candidate for the most distant massive DSFG known to date. This photo-$z$ solution was also supported by a single line detection in Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) Band 3 consistent with CO(7-6) at $z=7.46$. However, our new ALMA observations robustly detect two lines in Band 6 identified as CO(7-6) and [CI](2-1) at $z_{\rm spec}=2.625$, and thus the Band 3 line as CO(3-2). These three robust line detections decidedly place COSBO-7 at $z=2.625$, refuting the photo-$z$ solution. We derive physical parameters by fitting near-infrared(NIR)-to-millimeter(mm) photometry and lens modeling, revealing that COSBO-7 is a main sequence galaxy. We examine possible reasons for this photo-$z$ failure and attribute it to (1) the likely underestimation of photometric uncertainties at 0.9\,$\mu$m and 1.15 \,$\mu$m; and (2) the lack of photometry at wavelengths beyond 20\,$\mu$m. Notably, we recover a bona fide $z_{\rm phot}\sim 2.3$ by including the existing MIPS $24\,\mu$m photometry, demonstrating the critical importance of mid-infrared (MIR) data in bolstering photo-$z$ measurements. This work highlights a common challenge in modeling the SEDs of DSFGs, and provides a cautionary tale regarding the reliability of photometric redshifts as well as pseudo-spectroscopic redshifts based on single line detection.</description>

      <title>Cloud Collision Signatures in the Central Molecular Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular cloud collisions are a prominent theory for the formation of stars. Observational studies into cloud collisions identify the collision via a bridging feature: a continuous strip of line emission that connects two intensity peaks that are related in position space and separated in velocity space. Currently, most observations of collisions and these bridging features take place in the Milky Way disc. They are also theorized to take place in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), where temperatures and densities are both significantly higher than in the disc. For studies in the Milky Way Disc, the most commonly-used tracer tends to be CO. However, for studies in the CMZ, where the density and temperature are significantly higher, low-J CO lines lose their ability to adequately highlight the bridging feature of cloud collisions. As a result, studies have begun using other tracers, whose physical and chemical behavior has not been studied under CMZ conditions. We perform combined hydrodynamical, chemical and radiative transfer simulations of cloud collisions under both disc- and CMZ-like conditions, and investigate collision signatures in a number of commonly-observed molecular lines. Under the Milky Way disc conditions CO has the standard bridging feature; however, the other tracers, CS, HCO$^+$, N$_2$H$^+$ only emit in the intermediate-velocity bridge region, making the feature itself challenging to detect. In the CMZ, the higher density and temperature make the bridging feature far more indistinct for CO, but the other tracers have morphologically similar bridging features to the CO disc model, validating their use as tracers of cloud collisions under these conditions.</description>

      <title>Apostle--Auriga: Effects of stellar feedback subgrid models on the evolution of angular momentum in disc galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing the Apostle--Auriga simulations, which start from the same zoom-in initial conditions of Local Group-like systems but run with different galaxy formation subgrid models and hydrodynamic solvers, we study the impact of stellar feedback models on the evolution of angular momentum in disc galaxies. At $z = 0$, Auriga disc galaxies tend to exhibit higher specific angular momenta compared to their cross-matched Apostle counterparts. By tracing the evolution history of the Lagrangian mass tracers of the in-situ star particles in the $z = 0$ galaxies, we find that the specific angular momentum distributions of the gas tracers from the two simulations at the halo accretion time are relatively similar. The present-day angular momentum difference is mainly driven by the physical processes occurring inside dark matter haloes, especially galactic fountains. Due to the different subgrid implementations of stellar feedback processes, Auriga galaxies contain a high fraction of gas that has gone through recycled fountain (${\sim} 65$ per cent) which could acquire angular momentum through mixing with the high angular momentum circumgalactic medium (CGM). In Apostle, however, the fraction of gas that has undergone the recycled fountain process is significantly lower (down to ${\sim} 20$ per cent for Milky Way-sized galaxies) and the angular momentum acquisition from the CGM is marginal. As a result, the present-day Auriga galaxies overall have higher specific angular momenta.</description>

      <title>Orbital Support and Evolution of CX/OX Structures in Boxy/Peanut Bars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Barred galaxies exhibit boxy/peanut or X-shapes (BP/X) protruding from their disks in edge-on views. Two types of BP/X morphologies exist depending on whether the X-wings meet at the center (CX) or are off-centered (OX). Orbital studies indicate that various orbital types can generate X-shaped structures. Here, we provide a classification approach that identifies the specific orbit families responsible for generating OX and CX-shaped structures. Applying this approach to three different N-body bar models, we show that both OX and CX structures are associated with the x1 orbit family, but OX-supporting orbits possess higher angular momentum (closer to x1 orbits) than orbits in CX structures. Consequently, as the bar slows down the contribution of higher angular momentum OX-supporting orbits decreases and that of lower angular momentum orbits increases resulting in an evolution of the morphology from OX to CX. If the bar does not slow down, the shape of the BP/X structure and the fractions of OX/CX supporting orbits remain substantially unchanged. Bars that do not undergo buckling but that do slow down initially show the OX structure and are dominated by high angular momentum orbits, transitioning to a CX morphology. Bars that buckle exhibit a combination of both OX and CX supporting orbits immediately after the buckling, but become more CX dominated as their pattern speed decreases. This study demonstrates that the evolution of BP/X morphology and orbit populations strongly depends on the evolution of the bar angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Probing the high frequency variability of NGC 5044: the key to AGN feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The active galactic nucleus (AGN) feeding and feedback process in the centers of galaxy clusters and groups is still not well understood. NGC 5044 is the ideal system in which to study AGN feedback. It hosts the largest known reservoir of cold gas in any cool-core galaxy group, and features several past epochs of AGN feedback imprinted as cavities in the X-ray bright intragroup medium (IGrM), as well as parsec scale jets. We present Submillimeter Array (SMA), Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) high frequency observations of NGC 5044 to assess the time variability of the mmwaveband emission from the accretion disk, and quantify the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) from the radio to sub-millimeter band. The SED is well described by advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model and self-absorbed jet emission from an aging plasma with tau = 1kyr. We find a characteristic variability timescale of 150 days, which constrains the ADAF emission region to about 0.1pc, and the magnetic field to 4.7mG in the jets and and 870G in the accretion disk. A longer monitoring/sampling will allow to understand if the underlying process is truly periodic in nature.</description>

      <title>Transverse clues on the kpc-scale structure of the circumgalactic medium as traced by C IV absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present VLT/MUSE integral-field spectroscopy ($R\approx 1\,800$) of four giant gravitational arcs exhibiting strong C IV absorption at 8 intervening redshifts, $z_{abs}\approx 2.0$--$2.5$. We detect C IV absorption in a total of 222 adjacent and seeing-uncorrelated sightlines, whose spectra sample beams of ("de-lensed") linear size $\approx 1$ kpc. Our data show that (1) absorption velocities cluster at all probed transverse scales, $\Delta r_\perp\approx0$--$15$ kpc, depending on system; (2) the (transverse) velocity dispersion never exceeds the mean (line-of-sight) absorption spread; and (3) the (transverse) velocity autocorrelation function does not resolve kinematic patterns at the above spatial scales, but its velocity projection, $\xi^{arc}(\Delta v)$, exhibits a similar shape to the known two-point correlation function toward quasars, $\xi^{QSO}(\Delta v)$. An empirical kinematic model suggests that these results are a natural consequence of wide-beam observations of an unresolved clumpy medium. Our model recovers both the underlying velocity dispersion of the clumps ($70$--$170$ \kms) and the mean number of clumps per unit area ($2$--$13$ kpc$^{-2}$). The latter constrains the projected mean inter-clump distance to within $\approx0.3$--$0.8$ kpc, which we argue is a measure of clump size for near-unity covering fraction. The model is also able to predict $\xi^{arc}(\Delta v)$ from $\xi^{QSO}(\Delta v)$, suggesting that the strong systems that shape the former and the line-of-sight velocity components that define the latter trace the same kinematic population. Consequently, the clumps must possess an internal density structure that generates both weak and strong components. We discuss how our interpretation is consistent with previous observations using background galaxies and multiple quasars.</description>

      <title>Observations of pre- and proto-brown dwarfs in nearby clouds: paving the way to further constraining theories of brown dwarf formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brown Dwarfs (BDs) are crucial objects in our understanding of both star and planet formation. However, there is still an unconcluded debate about which is the dominant formation mechanism of these objects. For this, it is mandatory to study BDs in their earliest evolutionary stages (what we call pre- and proto-BDs), comparable to the `pre-stellar' and `Class 0/I' stages well characterized for the formation of low-mass stars. In this review, the recent efforts aimed at searching, identifying and characterising pre- and proto-BD candidates in nearby star-forming regions are presented, and revised requirements for an object to be a promising proto-BD or pre-BD candidate are provided, based on a new, unexplored so far, relation between the internal luminosity and the accreted mass. By applying these requirements, a list of 67 promising proto-BD candidates is presented, along with a compilation of possible pre-BDs from the literature. Updated correlations of protostellar properties such as mass infall rate or outflow momentum rate with bolometric luminosity are provided down to the low-mass BD regime, where no significant deviations are apparent. Furthermore, the number of proto-BD candidates in different clouds of the Solar Neighborhood seem to follow the known relations of number of protostars with cloud properties. In addition, proto(star-to-BD) ratios for the different clouds are also explored, unveiling a particular underproduction of low-mass proto-BD candidates in Ophiuchus compared to Lupus and Taurus. Possible explanations for this behavior are discussed, including heating of the Ophiuchus cloud by the nearby OB stars. The overall results of this work tend to favor a star-like process for BD formation down to the planetary boundary, of about 10 Mjup, below which other mechanisms might be at work.</description>

      <title>Super-Jeans fragmentation in massive star-forming regions revealed by triangulation analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the fragmentation of the gas cloud and the formation of massive stars remains one of the most challenging questions of modern astrophysical research. Either the gas fragmentation in a Jeans-like fashion, after which the fragments grow through accretion, or the fragmentation length is larger than the Jeans length from the start. Despite significant observational efforts, a consensus has not been reached. The key is to infer the initial density distribution upon which gravitational fragmentation occurs. Since cores are the products of the fragmentation process, the distances between adjacent cores serve as a scale indicator. Based on this observation, we propose a Delaunay triangulation-based approach to infer the density structure before the fragmentation and establish the link between density distribution and gas fragmentation length. We find that at low density, the fragmenting is Jeans-like, and at high densities, the core separations are larger than the prediction of the Jeans fragmentation. This super-Jeans fragmentation, which often occurs in groups, is responsible for the clustered formation of massive stars.</description>

Abstract: The study of the entire population of SNRs in a galaxy helps us to understand the underlying stellar populations, the environments, in which the SNRs are evolving, and the stellar feedback on the ISM. The all-sky survey carried out by the extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) on board Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (Spektr-RG, SRG) has provided us with spatially and spectrally resolved X-ray data of the entire Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and its immediate surroundings in the soft X-ray band down to 0.2 keV. We performed a multiwavelength analysis of previously known SNR candidates and newly detected SNRs and SNR candidates. We applied the Gaussian gradient magnitude (GGM) filter to the eROSITA images of the LMC to highlight the edges of the shocked gas in order to find new SNRs. We compared the X-ray images with those of their optical and radio counterparts to investigate the true nature of the extended emission. We used the Magellanic Cloud Emission Line Survey (MCELS) for the optical data. For the radio comparison, we used data from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) survey of the LMC. Using the VISTA survey of the Magellanic Clouds (VMC) we have investigated the possible progenitors of the new SNRs and SNR candidates in our sample. We present the most updated catalogue of SNRs in the LMC. The eROSITA data have allowed us to confirm 1 of the previous SNR candidates and discover 16 new extended sources. We confirm 3 of them as new SNRs, while we propose the remaining 13 as new X-ray SNR candidates. We also present the first analysis of the follow-up XMM-Newton observation of MCSNR J0456-6533 discovered with eROSITA. Among the new candidates, we propose J0614-7251 (4eRASSU J061438.1-725112) as the first X-ray SNR candidate in the outskirts of the LMC.</description>

      <title>The rate of extreme coronal line emitting galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and their relation to tidal disruption events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-ionization iron coronal lines (CLs) are a rare phenomenon observed in galaxy and quasi-stellar object spectra that are thought to be created by high-energy emission from active galactic nuclei and certain types of transients. In cases known as extreme coronal line emitting galaxies (ECLEs), these CLs are strong and fade away on a timescale of years. The most likely progenitors of these variable CLs are tidal disruption events (TDEs), which produce sufficient high-energy emission to create and sustain the CLs over these timescales. To test the possible connection between ECLEs and TDEs, we present the most complete variable ECLE rate calculation to date and compare the results to TDE rates from the literature. To achieve this, we search for ECLEs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We detect sufficiently strong CLs in 16 galaxies, more than doubling the number previously found in SDSS. We find that none of the nine new ECLEs evolve in a manner consistent with that of the five previously discovered variable ECLEs. Using this sample of five variable ECLEs, we calculate the galaxy-normalized rate of variable ECLEs in SDSS to be $R_\mathrm{G}=3.6~^{+2.6}_{-1.8}~(\mathrm{statistical})~^{+5.1}_{-0.0} (\mathrm{systematic})\times10^{-6}~\mathrm{galaxy}^{-1}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. The mass-normalised rate is $R_\mathrm{M}=3.1~^{+2.3}_{-1.5}~(\mathrm{statistical})~^{+4.4}_{-0.0}~(\mathrm{systematic})\times10^{-17}~\mathrm{M_\odot^{-1}}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and the volumetric rate is $R_\mathrm{V}=7~^{+20}_{-5}~(\mathrm{statistical})~^{+10}_{-0.0}~(\mathrm{systematic})\times10^{-9}~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Our rates are one to two orders of magnitude lower than TDE rates from the literature, which suggests that only 10 to 40 per cent of all TDEs produce variable ECLEs. Additional uncertainties in the rates arising from the structure of the interstellar medium have yet to be included.</description>

      <title>Dark Photon Dark Matter and Low-Frequency Gravitational Wave Detection with Gaia-like Astrometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrometric surveys offer us a method to search for elusive cosmic signatures, such as ultralight dark photon dark matter and gravitational waves, by observing the deflection to the apparent positions of the stars. The detection capabilities of such surveys rapidly decrease at low frequencies, because the signals become hardly distinguishable from the background motion of stars. In this work, we find that the background motion can be well described by a linear model over time, based on which we propose a linear background subtraction scheme. Compared to the conventional quadratic subtraction, the advantage of linear subtraction emerges within the frequency range below $6 \times 10^{-9}~{\rm Hz}$. Taking dark photons with purely gravitational interactions, dark photons with additional $U(1)_{B}$ or $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge interactions, and low-frequency gravitational waves as examples, we illustrate that the linear subtraction scheme can result in an enhancement of more than one order of magnitude in the exclusion limits of Gaia-like experiments in the low-frequency range.</description>
