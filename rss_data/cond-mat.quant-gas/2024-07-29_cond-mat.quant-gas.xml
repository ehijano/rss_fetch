      <title>Vortex to Rotons Transition in Dipolar Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental advancements enabled the creation of various systems exhibiting superfluid behavior, with one notable achievement being the development of Dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (dBECs) characterized by long-range dipole-dipole interactions. When confined along one or more spatial dimensions, these condensates exhibit a low-dimensional dispersion relation reminiscent of superfluid liquid helium, featuring a roton minimum. This study investigates the existence of two-dimensional solitary waves characterized by topological defects (quantized vorticity) and their transition to vortex-free Jones-Roberts solitons. The explicit connection between solitary waves and roton excitations is demonstrated for the first time, providing support for Feynman's hypothesis regarding the nature of rotons as fading vortex excitations.</description>

      <title>Absence of gapless Majorana edge modes in few-leg bosonic flux ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for Majorana excitations has seen tremendous efforts in recent years, ultimately aiming for their individual controllability in future topological quantum computers. A promising framework to realize such exotic Majorana fermions are topologically ordered non-Abelian phases of matter, such as certain fractional quantum Hall states. Quantum simulators provide unprecedented controllability and versatility to investigate such states, and developing experimentally feasible schemes to realize and identify them is of immediate relevance. Motivated by recent experiments, we consider bosons on coupled chains, subjected to a magnetic flux and experiencing Hubbard repulsion. At magnetic filling factor $\nu=1$, similar systems on cylinders have been found to host the non-Abelian Moore-Read Pfaffian state in the bulk. Here, we address the question whether more realistic few-leg ladders can host this exotic state and its chiral Majorana edge states. To this end, we perform extensive DMRG simulations and determine the central charge of the ground state. While we do not find any evidence of gapless Majorana edge modes in systems of up to six legs, exact diagonalization of small systems reveals evidence for the Pfaffian state in the entanglement structure. By systematically varying the number of legs and monitoring the appearance and disappearance of this signal, our work highlights the importance of finite-size effects for the realization of exotic states in experimentally realistic systems.</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek Behavior in the Boundary-obstructed Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nonadiabatic dynamics of a two-dimensional higher-order topological insulator when the system is slowly quenched across the boundary-obstructed phase transition, which is characterized by edge band gap closing.
  We find that the number of excitations produced after the quench exhibits power-law scaling behaviors with the quench rate. Boundary conditions can drastically modify the scaling behaviors: The scaling exponent is found to be $\alpha=1/2$ for hybridized and fully open boundary conditions, and $\alpha=2$ for periodic boundary condition. We argue that the exponent $\alpha=1/2$ cannot be explained by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism unless we adopt an effective dimension $d^{\rm eff}=1$ instead of the real dimension $d=2$. For comparison, we also investigate the slow quench dynamics across the bulk-obstructed phase transitions and a single multicritical point, which obeys the Kibble-Zurek mechanism with dimension $d=2$.</description>

      <title>Non-chiral non-Bloch invariants and topological phase diagram in non-unitary quantum dynamics without chiral symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Bloch topology leads to the emergence of various counter-intuitive phenomena in non-Hermitian systems under the open boundary condition (OBC), which can not find a counterpart in Hermitian systems. However, in the non-Hermitian system without chiral symmetry, being ubiquitous in nature, exploring its non-Bloch topology has so far eluded experimental effort. Here by introducing the concept of non-chiral non-Bloch invariants, we theoretically predict and experimentally identify the non-Bloch topological phase diagram of a one-dimensional (1D) non-Hermitian system without chiral symmetry in discrete-time non-unitary quantum walks of single photons. Interestingly, we find that such topological invariants not only can distinguish topologically distinct gapped phases, but also faithfully capture the corresponding gap closing in open-boundary spectrum at the phase boundary. Different topological regions are experimentally identified by measuring the featured discontinuities of the higher moments of the walker's displacement, which amazingly match excellently with our defined non-Bloch invariants. Our work provides a useful platform to study the interplay among topology, symmetries and the non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Superfluid Spin-up: 3D Simulations of Postglitch Dynamics in Neutron Stars Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following a glitch, a neutron star interior undergoes a transfer of angular momentum from the star's crust to the core, resulting in the spin-up of the latter. The crust-core coupling, which determines how quickly this spin-up proceeds, can be achieved through various physical processes, including Ekman pumping, superfluid vortex-mediated mutual friction, and magnetic fields. While the complexity of the problem has hindered studies of the mechanisms' combined action, analytical work on individual processes suggests different spin-up timescales depending on the relative strength of Coriolis, viscous, and mutual friction forces, and the magnetic field, respectively. However, experimental and numerical validations of these results are limited. In this paper, we focus on viscous effects and mutual friction and conduct non-linear hydrodynamical simulations of the spin-up problem in a two-component fluid by solving the incompressible Hall$-$Vinen$-$Bekarevich$-$Khalatnikov (HVBK) equations in the full sphere (i.e., including $r=0$) for the first time. We find that the viscous (normal) component accelerates due to Ekman pumping, although the mutual friction coupling to the superfluid component alters the spin-up dynamics compared to the single-fluid scenario. Close to the sphere's surface, the response of the superfluid is accurately described by the mutual friction timescale irrespective of its coupling strength with the normal component. However, as we move deeper into the sphere, the superfluid accelerates on different timescales due to the slow viscous spin-up of the internal normal fluid layers. We discuss potential implications for neutron stars and requirements for future work to build more realistic models.</description>

      <title>Collective flow of fermionic impurities immersed in a Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interacting mixtures of bosons and fermions are ubiquitous in nature. They form the backbone of the standard model of physics, provide a framework for understanding quantum materials and are of technological importance in helium dilution refrigerators. However, the description of their coupled thermodynamics and collective behaviour is challenging. Bose-Fermi mixtures of ultracold atoms provide a platform to investigate their properties in a highly controllable environment, where the species concentration and interaction strength can be tuned at will. Here we characterize the collective oscillations of spin-polarized fermionic impurities immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate as a function of the interaction strength and temperature. For strong interactions, the Fermi gas perfectly mimics the superfluid hydrodynamic modes of the condensate, from low-energy quadrupole modes to high-order Faraday excitations. With an increasing number of bosonic thermal excitations, the dynamics of the impurities cross over from the collisionless to the hydrodynamic regime, reminiscent of the emergence of hydrodynamics in two-dimensional electron fluids.</description>

      <title>Controlling Nonequilibrium Bose-Einstein Condensation with Engineered Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02170v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Out of thermal equilibrium, bosonic quantum systems can Bose-condense away from the ground state, featuring a macroscopic occupation of an excited state or even of multiple states in the so-called Bose-selection scenario. In previous work, a theory was developed that predicts, in which states a driven-dissipative ideal Bose gas condenses. Here, we address the inverse problem: Given a target state with desired condensate fractions in certain single-particle states, how can this configuration be achieved by tuning available control parameters? Which type of experimental setup allows for flexible condensation control? We solve these problems, on the one hand, by proposing a Bose `condenser', experimentally implementable in a superconducting circuit, where targeted Bose condensation into eigenstates of a chain of resonators is driven through the coupling to artificial quantum baths, realized via auxiliary two-level systems. On the other, we develop a theory to solve the inverse problem based on linear programming methods. We further discuss the engineering of transition points between different Bose condensation configurations, which may find application for amplification, heat-flow control, and the design of highly-structured quantum baths.</description>

      <title>From Architectures to Applications: A Review of Neural Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09402v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space dimension with system size, the simulation of quantum many-body systems has remained a persistent challenge until today. Here, we review a relatively new class of variational states for the simulation of such systems, namely neural quantum states (NQS), which overcome the exponential scaling by compressing the state in terms of the network parameters rather than storing all exponentially many coefficients needed for an exact parameterization of the state. We introduce the commonly used NQS architectures and their various applications for the simulation of ground and excited states, finite temperature and open system states as well as NQS approaches to simulate the dynamics of quantum states. Furthermore, we discuss NQS in the context of quantum state tomography.</description>
