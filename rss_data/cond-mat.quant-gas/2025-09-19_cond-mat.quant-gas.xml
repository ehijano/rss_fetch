      <title>Dipole condensates in synthetic rank-2 electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dipole condensates, formed from particle-hole pairs, represent a unique class of charge-neutral quantum fluids that evade conventional vector gauge fields, making their electrodynamic responses difficult to probe in natural materials. Here, we propose a tunable platform using strongly interacting two-component ultracold atoms to realize dipole condensates and probe their coupling to rank-2 electric fields. By applying spin-dependent forces and treating spin as a synthetic dimension, we engineer a synthetic rank-2 electric field that induces measurable electrodynamic responses. We identify the atomic analog of perfect Coulomb drag: increasing intercomponent interactions leads to equal and opposite displacements of the centers of mass of the two spin components. Furthermore, a rank-2 electric field imprints a phase twist in the dipole condensate and generates a supercurrent of dipoles that obeys the dipolar Josephson relation -- a smoking gun for dipole condensation. Our results establish a powerful platform for exploring dipolar superfluidity under tensor gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Zero-energy resonances in ultracold hydrogen sticking to liquid helium films of finite thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated quantum states of ultracold hydrogen atoms in a combined potential comprising the H-He film interaction in the presence of a substrate and the Earth gravitational field. We show that the shift and width of the gravitational quantum states are determined by the complex scattering length for the H-He film-substrate potential. We demonstrate that for specific helium film thicknesses above a substrate, zero-energy resonances occur if the combined potential supports a bound state exactly at the threshold. This effect leads to a complete restructuring of the bound states spectrum. The dynamics of gravitational levels as a function of the van der Waals interaction depth controlled by the helium film thickness is analyzed. It reveals the critical thicknesses at about 6.1 and 1.8 nm, at which resonances appear in the case of the conductive substrate. With imaginary integral operators, we incorporate non-perturbatively the inelastic effects originating from the ripplon coupling. The inelastic effects show dramatic changes in the sticking-coefficient behavior near the critical points. The enhanced sticking coefficients provide a probe for studying critical phenomena and measuring atom-surface interaction parameters with unprecedented sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Modulational instability of inter-spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in deep optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of modulational instability (MI) in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate with spin-orbit coupling, confined to a deep optical lattice. The system is modeled by a set of discrete Gross-Pitaevskii equations. Using linear stability analysis, we derive the explicit MI conditions for the system, elucidating the critical and distinct roles played by spin-orbit coupling, inter-species nonlinearity, and intra-species nonlinearity. Our analysis, conducted for both unstaggered and staggered fundamental modes, reveals markedly different instability landscapes for these two configurations. The analytical predictions are confirmed by extensive numerical simulations of the full nonlinear dynamics, which vividly illustrate the spatiotemporal evolution of wave amplitudes, phase coherence, and energy localization during the instability process. The numerical results, obtained via a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, show excellent agreement with the linear stability theory and provide a complete picture of the MI-induced pattern formation.</description>

      <title>Bloch oscillations of helicoidal spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in deep optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider helicoidal spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in deep optical lattice and study the dynamics of Bloch oscillation. We show that the variation of helicoidal gauge potential with spin-orbit coupling is different in zero-momentum and plane-wave phases. The characteristic of Bloch oscillation are different in the two phases. In the zero-momentum phase, the Bloch oscillation harmonic while it is anharminic in plane-wave phase. The amplitude of Bloch oscillation are found to be affected by the relative value of helicoidal gauge potential and spin-orbit coupling, and mean-field interaction. We examined that the decay of Bloch oscillation caused by mean-field interaction can be managed by helicoidal spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Controlled Polarization Switch in a Polariton Josephson Junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction between a particle's spin and momentum -- known as spin-orbit (SO) coupling -- is the cornerstone of modern spintronics. In Bose-Einsten condensates of ultracold atoms, SO coupling can be implemented and precisely controlled experimentally; photonic systems, on the other hand, possess an intrinsic SO interaction due to the longitudinal-transverse splitting of the photon modes. In this work, we focus on such spinor, SO-coupled exciton-polariton condensates on a ring, where the strength of the synthetic magnetic field is controlled by the geometrical dimensions of the structure. Inspired by recent experiments, we investigate the dynamics of a weakly-nonlinear four-mode bosonic Josephson junction within this geometry. We discover a narrow parameter range in which the interplay of the tunneling dynamics with polariton-specific SO coupling leads to a new regime, with dynamical switching of the fluid's circular polarization degree to the opposite, along the entire ring or on just one of its halves. Our results demonstrate polariton condensates in ring configurations as excellent candidates for all-optical controllable spin-switch applications, with prospects for scalability and observing non-trivial polarization patterns.</description>

      <title>Precise correspondence between the p-wave chiral superfluid and the spinless bosonic superfluid in the lowest Landau level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a precise formal correspondence between a spinless p-wave chiral fermionic superfluid and a spinless bosonic superfluid in a strong magnetic field by correctly accounting for superfluid vorticity in the effective theory of the former. In the literature, this vorticity term incompletely manifests as the magnetic field. This paper demonstrates this substitution can be understood as a truncation within the relevant expansion scheme, accompanied by field redefinitions. The components discarded in this truncation are critical for restoring the Berry phase term in the effective theory, encapsulating both systems in the same master Lagrangian. Beyond clarifying the structure of the Berry phase, this formalism allows for solving the bosonic system in the lowest Landau level (LLL) by analogy. Specifically, we show that, in the linear regime, the Maxwell equations governing these systems are identical when the vortex crystal is reformulated using an auxiliary electromagnetic field. This approach offers a unified perspective on these systems and yields solutions that are rotationally covariant, gauge invariants, and physically interpretable.</description>
