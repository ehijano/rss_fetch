      <title>Scalable Speed-ups for the SMS-EMOA from a Simple Aging Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different from single-objective evolutionary algorithms, where non-elitism is an established concept, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms almost always select the next population in a greedy fashion. In the only notable exception, Bian, Zhou, Li, and Qian (IJCAI 2023) proposed a stochastic selection mechanism for the SMS-EMOA and proved that it can speed up computing the Pareto front of the bi-objective jump benchmark with problem size $n$ and gap parameter $k$ by a factor of $\max\{1,2^{k/4}/n\}$. While this constitutes the first proven speed-up from non-elitist selection, suggesting a very interesting research direction, it has to be noted that a true speed-up only occurs for $k \ge 4\log_2(n)$, where the runtime is super-polynomial, and that the advantage reduces for larger numbers of objectives as shown in a later work. In this work, we propose a different non-elitist selection mechanism based on aging, which exempts individuals younger than a certain age from a possible removal. This remedies the two shortcomings of stochastic selection: We prove a speed-up by a factor of $\max\{1,\Theta(k)^{k-1}\}$, regardless of the number of objectives. In particular, a positive speed-up can already be observed for constant $k$, the only setting for which polynomial runtimes can be witnessed. Overall, this result supports the use of non-elitist selection schemes, but suggests that aging-based mechanisms can be considerably more powerful than stochastic selection mechanisms.</description>

      <title>PASCAL: Precise and Efficient ANN- SNN Conversion using Spike Accumulation and Adaptive Layerwise Activation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been put forward as an energy-efficient alternative to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) since they perform sparse Accumulate operations instead of the power-hungry Multiply-and-Accumulate operations. ANN-SNN conversion is a widely used method to realize deep SNNs with accuracy comparable to that of ANNs.~\citeauthor{bu2023optimal} recently proposed the Quantization-Clip-Floor-Shift (QCFS) activation as an alternative to ReLU to minimize the accuracy loss during ANN-SNN conversion. Nevertheless, SNN inferencing requires a large number of timesteps to match the accuracy of the source ANN for real-world datasets. In this work, we propose PASCAL, which performs ANN-SNN conversion in such a way that the resulting SNN is mathematically equivalent to an ANN with QCFS-activation, thereby yielding similar accuracy as the source ANN with minimal inference timesteps. In addition, we propose a systematic method to configure the quantization step of QCFS activation in a layerwise manner, which effectively determines the optimal number of timesteps per layer for the converted SNN. Our results show that the ResNet-34 SNN obtained using PASCAL achieves an accuracy of $\approx$74\% on ImageNet with a 64$\times$ reduction in the number of inference timesteps compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Meta-Black-Box-Optimization through Offline Q-function Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in Meta-Black-Box-Optimization (MetaBBO) has demonstrated that using RL to learn a meta-level policy for dynamic algorithm configuration (DAC) over an optimization task distribution could significantly enhance the performance of the low-level BBO algorithm. However, the online learning paradigms in existing works makes the efficiency of MetaBBO problematic. To address this, we propose an offline learning-based MetaBBO framework in this paper, termed Q-Mamba, to attain both effectiveness and efficiency in MetaBBO. Specifically, we first transform DAC task into long-sequence decision process. This allows us further introduce an effective Q-function decomposition mechanism to reduce the learning difficulty within the intricate algorithm configuration space. Under this setting, we propose three novel designs to meta-learn DAC policy from offline data: we first propose a novel collection strategy for constructing offline DAC experiences dataset with balanced exploration and exploitation. We then establish a decomposition-based Q-loss that incorporates conservative Q-learning to promote stable offline learning from the offline dataset. To further improve the offline learning efficiency, we equip our work with a Mamba architecture which helps long-sequence learning effectiveness and efficiency by selective state model and hardware-aware parallel scan respectively. Through extensive benchmarking, we observe that Q-Mamba achieves competitive or even superior performance to prior online/offline baselines, while significantly improving the training efficiency of existing online baselines. We provide sourcecodes of Q-Mamba at https://github.com/MetaEvo/Q-Mamba.</description>

      <title>A brain-inspired generative model for EEG-based cognitive state identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article proposes a brain-inspired generative (BIG) model that merges an impulsive-attention neural network and a variational autoencoder (VAE) for identifying cognitive states based on electroencephalography (EEG) data. A hybrid learning method is presented for training the model by integrating gradient-based learning and heteroassociative memory. The BIG model is capable of achieving multi-task objectives: classification, generating new EEG, and brain network interpretation, alleviating the limitations of excessive data training and high computational cost in conventional approaches. Experimental results on two public EEG datasets demonstrate that the BIG model achieves a classification accuracy above 89\%, comparable with state-of-the-art methods, while reducing computational cost by nearly 11\% over the baseline EEGNet. Incorporating the generated EEG data for training, the BIG model exhibits comparative performance in a few-shot pattern.Ablation studies justify the poised brain-inspired characteristic regarding the impulsive-attention module and the hybrid learning method. Thanks to the performance advantages with interpretable outputs, this BIG model has application potential for building digital twins of the brain.</description>

      <title>Cognition without neurons: modelling anticipation in a basal reservoir computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How do non-neural organisms, such as the slime mould \textit{Physarum polycephalum}, anticipate periodic events in their environment? We present a minimal, biologically inspired reservoir model that demonstrates simple temporal anticipation without neurons, spikes, or trained readouts. The model consists of a spatially embedded hexagonal network in which nodes regulate their energy through local, allostatic adaptation. Input perturbations shape energy dynamics over time, allowing the system to internalize temporal regularities into its structure. After being exposed to a periodic input signal, the model spontaneously re-enacts those dynamics even in the absence of further input -- a form of unsupervised temporal pattern completion. This behaviour emerges from internal homeodynamic regulation, without supervised learning or symbolic processing. Our results show that simple homeodynamic regulation can support unsupervised prediction, suggesting a pathway to memory and anticipation in basal organisms.</description>

      <title>Heterosynaptic Circuits Are Universal Gradient Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a design principle for the learning circuits of the biological brain. The principle states that almost any dendritic weights updated via heterosynaptic plasticity can implement a generalized and efficient class of gradient-based meta-learning. The theory suggests that a broad class of biologically plausible learning algorithms, together with the standard machine learning optimizers, can be grounded in heterosynaptic circuit motifs. This principle suggests that the phenomenology of (anti-) Hebbian (HBP) and heterosynaptic plasticity (HSP) may emerge from the same underlying dynamics, thus providing a unifying explanation. It also suggests an alternative perspective of neuroplasticity, where HSP is promoted to the primary learning and memory mechanism, and HBP is an emergent byproduct. We present simulations that show that (a) HSP can explain the metaplasticity of neurons, (b) HSP can explain the flexibility of the biology circuits, and (c) gradient learning can arise quickly from simple evolutionary dynamics that do not compute any explicit gradient. While our primary focus is on biology, the principle also implies a new approach to designing AI training algorithms and physically learnable AI hardware. Conceptually, our result demonstrates that contrary to the common belief, gradient computation may be extremely easy and common in nature.</description>

      <title>Sharpness-Aware Minimization with Z-Score Gradient Filtering for Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02369v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalizing well in deep neural networks remains a core challenge, particularly due to their tendency to converge to sharp minima that degrade robustness. Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) mitigates this by seeking flatter minima but perturbs parameters using the full gradient, which can include statistically insignificant directions. We propose ZSharp, a simple yet effective extension to SAM that applies layer-wise Z-score normalization followed by percentile-based filtering to retain only statistically significant gradient components. This selective perturbation aligns updates with curvature-sensitive directions, enhancing generalization without requiring architectural changes. ZSharp introduces only one additional hyperparameter, the percentile threshold, and remains fully compatible with existing SAM variants. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet using ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers show that ZSharp consistently outperforms SAM and its variants in test accuracy, particularly on deeper and transformer-based models. These results demonstrate that ZSharp is a principled and lightweight improvement for sharpness-aware optimization.</description>

      <title>Giving Simulated Cells a Voice: Evolving Prompt-to-Intervention Models for Cellular Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Guiding biological systems toward desired states, such as morphogenetic outcomes, remains a fundamental challenge with far-reaching implications for medicine and synthetic biology. While large language models (LLMs) have enabled natural language as an interface for interpretable control in AI systems, their use as mediators for steering biological or cellular dynamics remains largely unexplored.
  In this work, we present a functional pipeline that translates natural language prompts into spatial vector fields capable of directing simulated cellular collectives. Our approach combines a large language model with an evolvable neural controller (Prompt-to-Intervention, or P2I), optimized via evolutionary strategies to generate behaviors such as clustering or scattering in a simulated 2D environment.
  We demonstrate that even with constrained vocabulary and simplified cell models, evolved P2I networks can successfully align cellular dynamics with user-defined goals expressed in plain language. This work offers a complete loop from language input to simulated bioelectric-like intervention to behavioral output, providing a foundation for future systems capable of natural language-driven cellular control.</description>

      <title>Covariant spatio-temporal receptive fields for spiking neural networks</title>

Abstract: Biological nervous systems constitute important sources of inspiration towards computers that are faster, cheaper, and more energy efficient. Neuromorphic disciplines view the brain as a coevolved system, simultaneously optimizing the hardware and the algorithms running on it. There are clear efficiency gains when bringing the computations into a physical substrate, but we presently lack theories to guide efficient implementations. Here, we present a principled computational model for neuromorphic systems in terms of spatio-temporal receptive fields, based on affine Gaussian kernels over space and leaky-integrator and leaky integrate-and-fire models over time. Our theory is provably covariant to spatial affine and temporal scaling transformations, and with close similarities to the visual processing in mammalian brains. We use these spatio-temporal receptive fields as a prior in an event-based vision task, and show that this improves the training of spiking networks, which otherwise is known as problematic for event-based vision. This work combines efforts within scale-space theory and computational neuroscience to identify theoretically well-founded ways to process spatio-temporal signals in neuromorphic systems. Our contributions are immediately relevant for signal processing and event-based vision, and can be extended to other processing tasks over space and time, such as memory and control.</description>

      <title>SSTFormer: Bridging Spiking Neural Network and Memory Support Transformer for Frame-Event based Recognition</title>

Abstract: Event camera-based pattern recognition is a newly arising research topic in recent years. Current researchers usually transform the event streams into images, graphs, or voxels, and adopt deep neural networks for event-based classification. Although good performance can be achieved on simple event recognition datasets, however, their results may be still limited due to the following two issues. Firstly, they adopt spatial sparse event streams for recognition only, which may fail to capture the color and detailed texture information well. Secondly, they adopt either Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) for energy-efficient recognition with suboptimal results, or Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for energy-intensive, high-performance recognition. However, seldom of them consider achieving a balance between these two aspects. In this paper, we formally propose to recognize patterns by fusing RGB frames and event streams simultaneously and propose a new RGB frame-event recognition framework to address the aforementioned issues. The proposed method contains four main modules, i.e., memory support Transformer network for RGB frame encoding, spiking neural network for raw event stream encoding, multi-modal bottleneck fusion module for RGB-Event feature aggregation, and prediction head. Due to the scarce of RGB-Event based classification dataset, we also propose a large-scale PokerEvent dataset which contains 114 classes, and 27102 frame-event pairs recorded using a DVS346 event camera. Extensive experiments on two RGB-Event based classification datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework. We hope this work will boost the development of pattern recognition by fusing RGB frames and event streams. Both our dataset and source code of this work will be released at https://github.com/Event-AHU/SSTFormer</description>

      <title>Backpropagation through space, time, and the brain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16933v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How physical networks of neurons, bound by spatio-temporal locality constraints, can perform efficient credit assignment, remains, to a large extent, an open question. In machine learning, the answer is almost universally given by the error backpropagation algorithm, through both space and time. However, this algorithm is well-known to rely on biologically implausible assumptions, in particular with respect to spatio-temporal (non-)locality. Alternative forward-propagation models such as real-time recurrent learning only partially solve the locality problem, but only at the cost of scaling, due to prohibitive storage requirements. We introduce Generalized Latent Equilibrium (GLE), a computational framework for fully local spatio-temporal credit assignment in physical, dynamical networks of neurons. We start by defining an energy based on neuron-local mismatches, from which we derive both neuronal dynamics via stationarity and parameter dynamics via gradient descent. The resulting dynamics can be interpreted as a real-time, biologically plausible approximation of backpropagation through space and time in deep cortical networks with continuous-time neuronal dynamics and continuously active, local synaptic plasticity. In particular, GLE exploits the morphology of dendritic trees to enable more complex information storage and processing in single neurons, as well as the ability of biological neurons to phase-shift their output rate with respect to their membrane potential, which is essential in both directions of information propagation. For the forward computation, it enables the mapping of time-continuous inputs to neuronal space, effectively performing a spatio-temporal convolution. For the backward computation, it permits the temporal inversion of feedback signals, which consequently approximate the adjoint variables necessary for useful parameter updates.</description>
