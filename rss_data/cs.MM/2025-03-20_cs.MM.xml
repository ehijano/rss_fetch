      <title>Revival: Collaborative Artistic Creation through Human-AI Interactions in Musical Creativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Revival is an innovative live audiovisual performance and music improvisation by our artist collective K-Phi-A, blending human and AI musicianship to create electronic music with audio-reactive visuals. The performance features real-time co-creative improvisation between a percussionist, an electronic music artist, and AI musical agents. Trained in works by deceased composers and the collective's compositions, these agents dynamically respond to human input and emulate complex musical styles. An AI-driven visual synthesizer, guided by a human VJ, produces visuals that evolve with the musical landscape. Revival showcases the potential of AI and human collaboration in improvisational artistic creation.</description>

      <title>LLaVA-MORE: A Comparative Study of LLMs and Visual Backbones for Enhanced Visual Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has highlighted the critical roles of both the visual backbone and the underlying language model. While prior work has primarily focused on scaling these components to billions of parameters, the trade-offs between model size, architecture, and performance remain underexplored. Additionally, inconsistencies in training data and evaluation protocols have hindered direct comparisons, making it difficult to derive optimal design choices. In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-MORE, a new family of MLLMs that integrates recent language models with diverse visual backbones. To ensure fair comparisons, we employ a unified training protocol applied consistently across all architectures. Our analysis systematically explores both small- and medium-scale LLMs -- including Phi-4, LLaMA-3.1, and Gemma-2 -- to evaluate multimodal reasoning, generation, and instruction following, while examining the relationship between model size and performance. Beyond evaluating the LLM impact on final results, we conduct a comprehensive study of various visual encoders, ranging from CLIP-based architectures to alternatives such as DINOv2, SigLIP, and SigLIP2. Additional experiments investigate the effects of increased image resolution and variations in pre-training datasets. Overall, our results provide insights into the design of more effective MLLMs, offering a reproducible evaluation framework that facilitates direct comparisons and can guide future model development. Our source code and trained models are publicly available at: https://github.com/aimagelab/LLaVA-MORE.</description>

      <title>PromptHash: Affinity-Prompted Collaborative Cross-Modal Learning for Adaptive Hashing Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-modal hashing is a promising approach for efficient data retrieval and storage optimization. However, contemporary methods exhibit significant limitations in semantic preservation, contextual integrity, and information redundancy, which constrains retrieval efficacy. We present PromptHash, an innovative framework leveraging affinity prompt-aware collaborative learning for adaptive cross-modal hashing. We propose an end-to-end framework for affinity-prompted collaborative hashing, with the following fundamental technical contributions: (i) a text affinity prompt learning mechanism that preserves contextual information while maintaining parameter efficiency, (ii) an adaptive gated selection fusion architecture that synthesizes State Space Model with Transformer network for precise cross-modal feature integration, and (iii) a prompt affinity alignment strategy that bridges modal heterogeneity through hierarchical contrastive learning. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the first investigation into affinity prompt awareness within collaborative cross-modal adaptive hash learning, establishing a paradigm for enhanced semantic consistency across modalities. Through comprehensive evaluation on three benchmark multi-label datasets, PromptHash demonstrates substantial performance improvements over existing approaches. Notably, on the NUS-WIDE dataset, our method achieves significant gains of 18.22% and 18.65% in image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval tasks, respectively. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/ShiShuMo/PromptHash.</description>

      <title>PromptMobile: Efficient Promptus for Low Bandwidth Mobile Video Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional video compression algorithms exhibit significant quality degradation at extremely low bitrates. Promptus emerges as a new paradigm for video streaming, substantially cutting down the bandwidth essential for video streaming. However, Promptus is computationally intensive and can not run in real-time on mobile devices. This paper presents PromptMobile, an efficient acceleration framework tailored for on-device Promptus. Specifically, we propose (1) a two-stage efficient generation framework to reduce computational cost by 8.1x, (2) a fine-grained inter-frame caching to reduce redundant computations by 16.6\%, (3) system-level optimizations to further enhance efficiency. The evaluations demonstrate that compared with the original Promptus, PromptMobile achieves a 13.6x increase in image generation speed. Compared with other streaming methods, PromptMobile achives an average LPIPS improvement of 0.016 (compared with H.265), reducing 60\% of severely distorted frames (compared to VQGAN).</description>

      <title>Do image and video quality metrics model low-level human vision?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image and video quality metrics, such as SSIM, LPIPS, and VMAF, are aimed to predict the perceived quality of the evaluated content and are often claimed to be "perceptual". Yet, few metrics directly model human visual perception, and most rely on hand-crafted formulas or training datasets to achieve alignment with perceptual data. In this paper, we propose a set of tests for full-reference quality metrics that examine their ability to model several aspects of low-level human vision: contrast sensitivity, contrast masking, and contrast matching. The tests are meant to provide additional scrutiny for newly proposed metrics. We use our tests to analyze 33 existing image and video quality metrics and find their strengths and weaknesses, such as the ability of LPIPS and MS-SSIM to predict contrast masking and poor performance of VMAF in this task. We further find that the popular SSIM metric overemphasizes differences in high spatial frequencies, but its multi-scale counterpart, MS-SSIM, addresses this shortcoming. Such findings cannot be easily made using existing evaluation protocols.</description>

      <title>VerbDiff: Text-Only Diffusion Models with Enhanced Interaction Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent large-scale text-to-image diffusion models generate photorealistic images but often struggle to accurately depict interactions between humans and objects due to their limited ability to differentiate various interaction words. In this work, we propose VerbDiff to address the challenge of capturing nuanced interactions within text-to-image diffusion models. VerbDiff is a novel text-to-image generation model that weakens the bias between interaction words and objects, enhancing the understanding of interactions. Specifically, we disentangle various interaction words from frequency-based anchor words and leverage localized interaction regions from generated images to help the model better capture semantics in distinctive words without extra conditions. Our approach enables the model to accurately understand the intended interaction between humans and objects, producing high-quality images with accurate interactions aligned with specified verbs. Extensive experiments on the HICO-DET dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to previous approaches.</description>

      <title>MagicMotion: Controllable Video Generation with Dense-to-Sparse Trajectory Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have led to remarkable improvements in visual quality and temporal coherence. Upon this, trajectory-controllable video generation has emerged to enable precise object motion control through explicitly defined spatial paths. However, existing methods struggle with complex object movements and multi-object motion control, resulting in imprecise trajectory adherence, poor object consistency, and compromised visual quality. Furthermore, these methods only support trajectory control in a single format, limiting their applicability in diverse scenarios. Additionally, there is no publicly available dataset or benchmark specifically tailored for trajectory-controllable video generation, hindering robust training and systematic evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce MagicMotion, a novel image-to-video generation framework that enables trajectory control through three levels of conditions from dense to sparse: masks, bounding boxes, and sparse boxes. Given an input image and trajectories, MagicMotion seamlessly animates objects along defined trajectories while maintaining object consistency and visual quality. Furthermore, we present MagicData, a large-scale trajectory-controlled video dataset, along with an automated pipeline for annotation and filtering. We also introduce MagicBench, a comprehensive benchmark that assesses both video quality and trajectory control accuracy across different numbers of objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicMotion outperforms previous methods across various metrics.

      <title>Image is All You Need to Empower Large-scale Diffusion Models for In-Domain Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-domain generation aims to perform a variety of tasks within a specific domain, such as unconditional generation, text-to-image, image editing, 3D generation, and more. Early research typically required training specialized generators for each unique task and domain, often relying on fully-labeled data. Motivated by the powerful generative capabilities and broad applications of diffusion models, we are driven to explore leveraging label-free data to empower these models for in-domain generation. Fine-tuning a pre-trained generative model on domain data is an intuitive but challenging way and often requires complex manual hyper-parameter adjustments since the limited diversity of the training data can easily disrupt the model's original generative capabilities. To address this challenge, we propose a guidance-decoupled prior preservation mechanism to achieve high generative quality and controllability by image-only data, inspired by preserving the pre-trained model from a denoising guidance perspective. We decouple domain-related guidance from the conditional guidance used in classifier-free guidance mechanisms to preserve open-world control guidance and unconditional guidance from the pre-trained model. We further propose an efficient domain knowledge learning technique to train an additional text-free UNet copy to predict domain guidance. Besides, we theoretically illustrate a multi-guidance in-domain generation pipeline for a variety of generative tasks, leveraging multiple guidances from distinct diffusion models and conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in domain-specific synthesis and its compatibility with various diffusion-based control methods and applications.</description>

      <title>LongVALE: Vision-Audio-Language-Event Benchmark Towards Time-Aware Omni-Modal Perception of Long Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19772v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite impressive advancements in video understanding, most efforts remain limited to coarse-grained or visual-only video tasks. However, real-world videos encompass omni-modal information (vision, audio, and speech) with a series of events forming a cohesive storyline. The lack of multi-modal video data with fine-grained event annotations and the high cost of manual labeling are major obstacles to comprehensive omni-modality video perception. To address this gap, we propose an automatic pipeline consisting of high-quality multi-modal video filtering, semantically coherent omni-modal event boundary detection, and cross-modal correlation-aware event captioning. In this way, we present LongVALE, the first-ever Vision-Audio-Language Event understanding benchmark comprising 105K omni-modal events with precise temporal boundaries and detailed relation-aware captions within 8.4K high-quality long videos. Further, we build a baseline that leverages LongVALE to enable video large language models (LLMs) for omni-modality fine-grained temporal video understanding for the first time. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and great potential of LongVALE in advancing comprehensive multi-modal video understanding.</description>
