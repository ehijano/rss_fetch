      <title>Fourier Series Guided Design of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks for Enhanced Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we apply 1D quantum convolution to address the task of time series forecasting. By encoding multiple points into the quantum circuit to predict subsequent data, each point becomes a feature, transforming the problem into a multidimensional one. Building on theoretical foundations from prior research, which demonstrated that Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) can be expressed as multidimensional Fourier series, we explore the capabilities of different architectures and ansatz. This analysis considers the concepts of circuit expressibility and the presence of barren plateaus. Analyzing the problem within the framework of the Fourier series enabled the design of an architecture that incorporates data reuploading, resulting in enhanced performance. Rather than a strict requirement for the number of free parameters to exceed the degrees of freedom of the Fourier series, our findings suggest that even a limited number of parameters can produce Fourier functions of higher degrees. This highlights the remarkable expressive power of quantum circuits. This observation is also significant in reducing training times. The ansatz with greater expressibility and number of non-zero Fourier coefficients consistently delivers favorable results across different scenarios, with performance metrics improving as the number of qubits increases.</description>

      <title>The quantum adiabatic algorithm suppresses the proliferation of errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation of errors severely compromises the reliability of quantum computations. The quantum adiabatic algorithm is a physically motivated method to prepare ground states of classical and quantum Hamiltonians. Here, we analyze the proliferation of a single error event in the adiabatic algorithm. We give numerical evidence using tensor network methods that the intrinsic properties of adiabatic processes effectively constrain the amplification of errors during the evolution for geometrically local Hamiltonians. Our findings indicate that low energy states could remain attainable even in the presence of a single error event, which contrasts with results for error propagation in typical quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Proof of a Universal Speed Limit on Fast Scrambling in Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the time required for sustained information scrambling in any Hamiltonian quantum system is universally at least logarithmic in the entanglement entropy of scrambled states. This addresses two foundational problems in nonequilibrium quantum dynamics. (1) It sets the earliest possible time for the applicability of equilibrium statistical mechanics in a quantum system coupled to a bath at a finite temperature. (2) It proves a version of the fast scrambling conjecture, originally motivated in models associated with black holes, as a fundamental property of quantum mechanics itself. Our result builds on a refinement of the energy-time uncertainty principle in terms of the infinite temperature spectral form factor in quantum chaos. We generalize this formulation to arbitrary initial states of the bath, including finite temperature states, by mapping Hamiltonian dynamics with any initial state to nonunitary dynamics at infinite temperature. A regularized spectral form factor emerges naturally from this procedure, whose decay is universally constrained by analyticity in complex time. This establishes an exact speed limit on information scrambling by the most general quantum mechanical Hamiltonian, without any restrictions on locality or the nature of interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Walks on Simplicial Complexes and Harmonic Homology: Application to Topological Data Analysis with Superpolynomial Speedups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating higher-order interactions in information processing enables us to build more accurate models, gain deeper insights into complex systems, and address real-world challenges more effectively. However, existing methods, such as random walks on oriented simplices and homology, which capture these interactions, are not known to be efficient. This work investigates whether quantum walks on simplicial complexes exhibit quantum advantages. We introduce a novel quantum walk that encodes the combinatorial Laplacian, a key mathematical object whose spectral properties reflect the topology of the underlying simplicial complex. Furthermore, we construct a unitary encoding that projects onto the kernel of the Laplacian, representing the space of harmonic cycles in the complex's homology. Combined with the efficient construction of quantum walk unitaries for clique complexes that we present, this paves the way for utilizing quantum walks to explore higher-order interactions within topological structures. Our results achieve superpolynomial quantum speedup with quantum walks without relying on quantum oracles for large datasets.
  Crucially, the walk operates on a state space encompassing both positively and negatively oriented simplices, effectively doubling its size compared to unoriented approaches. Through coherent interference of these paired simplices, we are able to successfully encode the combinatorial Laplacian, which would otherwise be impossible. This observation constitutes our major technical contribution. We also extend the framework by constructing variant quantum walks. These variants enable us to: (1) estimate the normalized persistent Betti numbers, capturing topological information throughout a deformation process, and (2) verify a specific QMA$_1$-hard problem, showcasing potential applications in computational complexity theory.</description>

      <title>Inertial Torsion Noise in Matter-Wave Interferometers for Gravity Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matter-wave interferometry is susceptible to non-inertial noise sources, which can induce dephasing and a resulting loss of interferometric visibility. Here, we focus on inertial torsion noise (ITN), which arises from the rotational motion of the experimental apparatus suspended by a thin wire and subject to random external torques. We provide analytical expressions for the ITN noise starting from Langevin equations describing the experimental box in a thermal environment which can then be used together with the transfer function to obtain the dephasing factor. We verify the theoretical modelling and the validity of the approximations using Monte Carlo simulations obtaining good agreement between theory and numerics. As an application we estimate the size of the effects for the next-generation of interferometery experiments with femtogram particles, which could be used as the building block for entanglement-based tests of the quantum nature of gravity. We find that the ambient gas is a weak source of ITN, posing mild restrictions on the ambient pressure and temperature, and conclude with a discussion about the general ITN constrains by assuming a Langevin equation parameterized by three phenomenological parameters.</description>

      <title>The role of position momentum correlations in coherence freezing and purity behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the effects of Markovian bath coupling and initial position-momentum correlations on the coherence and purity of Gaussian quantum states. Our analysis focuses on the roles these factors play in the dynamics of quantum coherence, coherence lengths, and state purity. Our results reveal that initial position-momentum correlations have a remarkable impact on the quantum properties of the mixed state. These correlations lead to opposing behaviors in coherence and purity: as quantum coherence increases in response to stronger correlations, purity diminishes, and vice versa. This inverse relationship illustrates the phenomenon where, governed by these initial correlations, a state with greater mixing can display enhanced quantum coherence compared to a less mixed state. We also observe an unanticipated coherence freezing phenomenon, quantified by the relative entropy of coherence. Notably, this freezing is driven by initial position-momentum correlations, although the final frozen value is independent of these correlations.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in Quantum Dots: Insights from Dynamic Susceptibility and Quantum Fisher Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the entanglement properties of quantum dots (QDs) under a universal Hamiltonian where the Coulomb interaction between particles (electrons or holes) decouples into a charging energy and an exchange coupling term. While this formalism typically decouples the charge and spin components, the confinement-induced energy splitting can induce unexpected entanglement in the system. By analyzing the dynamic susceptibility and quantum Fisher information (QFI), we uncover intriguing behaviors influenced by exchange constants, temperature variations, and confinement effects. In Ising QDs, far below the Stoner instability point where the QD is in a disordered paramagnetic phase, temperature reductions unexpectedly lead to decreased entanglement, challenging conventional expectations. Conversely, anisotropic Heisenberg models exhibit enhanced entanglement near isotropic points. Our findings highlight the intricate interplay between exchange interactions and entanglement in QDs, laying the groundwork for future studies on topological entanglement and the influence of entanglement on material properties. Overall, this work contributes to advancing our understanding of entanglement in QDs and its potential applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependent spin-phonon coupling of boron-vacancy centers in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The negatively charged boron-vacancy center ($\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}^-$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently emerged as a highly promising quantum sensor. Compared to the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, the change with temperature of the spin transition energy of $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ is more than an order of magnitude larger, making it a potential nanoscale thermometer with superior sensitivity. However, the underlying mechanism of the observed large temperature dependence remains an open question. In this work, using isotopically purified $\mathrm{h}{}^{10}\mathrm{B}{}^{15}\mathrm{N}$, we systematically characterize the zero-field splitting, hyperfine interaction, and spin relaxation time of $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ from 10 to 350$~$K. We carry out first-principle calculations of the $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ spin-phonon interaction and show that a second-order effect from finite-temperature phonon excitations is responsible for the observed changes in experiments. By fitting our experimental results to a physically motivated model, we extract the dominant phonon mode which agrees well with our simulations. Finally, we investigate the dynamic nuclear spin polarization process at cryogenic temperatures. Our results provide key insights in $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ centers and their utilization as nanoscale thermometers and phonon sensors.</description>

      <title>Quantum metrology of rotations with mixed spin states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficiency of a quantum metrology protocol can be considerably reduced by the interaction of a quantum system with its environment, resulting in a loss of purity and, consequently, a mixed state for the probing system. In this paper we examine the potential of mixed spin-$j$ states to achieve sensitivity comparable, and even equal, to that of pure states in the measurement of infinitesimal rotations about arbitrary axes. We introduce the concept of mixed optimal quantum rotosensors based on a maximization of the Fisher quantum information and show that it is related to the notion of anticoherence of spin states and its generalization to subspaces. We present several examples of anticoherent subspaces and their associated mixed optimal quantum rotosensors. We also show that the latter maximize negativity for specific bipartitions, reaching the same maximum value as pure states. These results elucidate the interplay between quantum metrology of rotations, anticoherence and entanglement in the framework of mixed spin states.</description>

      <title>The extended Lipkin model: proposal for implementation in a quantum platform and machine learning analysis of its phase diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Extended Lipkin Model (ELM), whose phase diagram mirrors that of the Interacting Boson Approximation model (IBA). Unlike the standard Lipkin model, the ELM (as the IBA) features both first- and second-order quantum shape phase transitions depending on the model parameters. Our goal is to implement the ELM on a quantum platform, leveraging Machine Learning techniques to identify its quantum phase transitions and critical lines. To achieve this, we offer: i) ground state energy calculations using a variational quantum eigensolver; ii) a detailed formulation for ELM dynamics within quantum computing, facilitating experimental exploration of the IBA phase diagram; and iii) a phase diagram determination using various Machine Learning methods. We successfully replicate the ELM ground-state energy using the Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Pseudo-Trotter ansatz Variational Quantum Eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE) algorithm across the entire phase space. Our framework ensures ELM implementation on quantum platforms with controlled errors. Lastly, our ML predictions yield a meaningful phase diagram for the model.

      <title>Highly Squeezed States in Ring Resonators: Beyond the Undepleted Pump Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multimode theory of squeezed state generation in resonant systems valid for arbitrary pump power and including pump depletion. The Hamiltonian is written in terms of asymptotic-in and -out fields from scattering theory, capable of describing a general interaction. As an example we consider the lossy generation of a highly squeezed state by an effective second-order interaction in a silicon nitride ring resonator point-coupled to a waveguide. We calculate the photon number, Schmidt number, and the second-order correlation function of the generated state in the waveguide. The treatment we present provides a path forward to study the deterministic generation of non-Gaussian states in resonant systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a small quantum system open to a bath with thermostat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate dynamics of a small quantum system open to a bath with thermostat. We introduce another bath, called super bath, weakly coupled with the bath to provide it with thermostat, which has either the Lindblad or Redfield type. We treat the interaction between the system and bath via a rigorous perturbation theory. Due to the thermostat, the bath behaves dissipative and stochastic, for which the usual Born-Markov assumption is not needed. We consider a specific example of a harmonic oscillator system, and a photonic bath in a large container, and a super bath of the Caldeira-Legget oscillators distributed on the inner surface of the container. We use the $P$-representation for the total harmonic system. We derive the reduced time-evolution equation for the system by explicitly finding the correlation between the system and bath beyond the product state, that was not obtainable in the previous theory for the system and bath isolated from environment, and marginalizing bath degrees of freedom. Remarkably, the associated dynamic equation for the system density matrix is of the same form as the Redfield master equation with different coefficients depending on thermostat used. We find steady state does not depend on thermostat, but time-dependent state does, that agrees with common expectation. We expect to apply our theory to general systems. Unlike the usual quantum master equations, our reduced dynamics allows investigation for time-dependent protocols and non-equilibrium quantum stochastic dynamics will be investigated in future.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), which combines quantum systems with classical computational power, has been arisen as a promising candidate for near-term quantum computing applications. However, the experimental resources such as the number of measurements to implement VQE rapidly increases as the Hamiltonian problem size grows. Applying entanglement measurements to reduce the number of measurement setups has been proposed to address this issue, however, entanglement measurements themselves can introduce additional resource demands. Here, we apply entanglement measurements to the photonic VQE utilizing polarization and path degrees of freedom of a single-photon. In our photonic VQE, entanglement measurements can be deterministically implemented using linear optics, so it takes full advantage of introducing entanglement measurements without additional experimental demands. Moreover, we show that such a setup can mitigate errors in measurement apparatus for a certain Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Development of Pattern Recognition Validation for Boson Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boson sampling is one of the most attractive quantum computation models to demonstrate the quantum computational advantage. However, this aim may be hard to realize considering noise sources such as photon distinguishability. Inspired by the Bayesian validation developed to evaluate whether photon distinguishability is too high to demonstrate the quantum computational advantage, we develop the pattern recognition validation for boson sampling. Based on clusters constructed with the K means++ method, the distribution of test values is nearly monotonically changed with the photon indistinguishability, especially when photons are close to be indistinguishable. We analyze the intrinsic data structure through calculating probability distributions and mean 2-norm distances of the sorted outputs. Approximation algorithms are also used to show the data structure changes with photon distinguishability.</description>

      <title>Unitary Basis Transformations in Mixed Quantum-Classical Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common approach to minimizing the cost of quantum computations is by transforming a quantum system into a basis that can be optimally truncated. Here, we derive classical equations of motion subjected to similar unitary transformations, and propose their integration into mixed quantum-classical dynamics, enabling this class of methods to be applied within arbitrary bases for both the quantum and classical coordinates. To this end, canonical positions and momenta are combined into a set of complex-valued classical coordinates amenable to unitary transformations. We demonstrate the potential of the resulting approach by means of surface hopping calculations of an electronic carrier scattering onto a single impurity in the presence of phonons. Appropriate basis transformations, capturing both the localization of the impurity and the delocalization of higher-energy excitations, are shown to faithfully capture the dynamics within a fraction of the classical and quantum basis sets.</description>

      <title>A Bi-directional Quantum Search Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grover's search algorithms, including various partial Grover searches, experience scaling problems as the number of iterations rises with increased qubits, making implementation more computationally expensive. This paper combines Partial Grover's search algorithm and Bi-directional Search to create a fast Grover's quantum search algorithm, referred to as Bi-Directional Grover Search (BDGS). We incorporated a bi-directional search tactic with a partial Grover search, starting from an initial state and a single marked state in parallel. We have shown in this article that our novel approach requires $\frac{\pi}{4\sqrt{2}}\sqrt{N}(1-\sqrt{\frac{1}{b^{r/2k}}})$ iterations over regular Grover Search and Partial Grover Search (PGS), which takes $\frac{\pi}{4}\sqrt{N}\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{b}}$ (here, $N=2^r$ elements, $b$ is the branching factor of partial search, and $k= \lceil\log_2b \rceil$).

      <title>Identifying non-Hermitian critical points with quantum metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometric properties of quantum states is fully encoded by the quantum geometric tensor. The real and imaginary parts of the quantum geometric tensor are the quantum metric and Berry curvature, which characterize the distance and phase difference between two nearby quantum states in Hilbert space, respectively. For conventional Hermitian quantum systems, the quantum metric corresponds to the fidelity susceptibility and has already been used to specify quantum phase transitions from the geometric perspective. In this work, we extend this wisdom to the non-Hermitian systems for revealing non-Hermitian critical points. To be concrete, by employing numerical exact diagonalization and analytical methods, we calculate the quantum metric and corresponding order parameters in various non-Hermitian models, which include two non-Hermitian generalized Aubry-Andr\'{e} models and non-Hermitian cluster and mixed-field Ising models. We demonstrate that the quantum metric of eigenstates in these non-Hermitian models exactly identifies the localization transitions, mobility edges, and many-body quantum phase transitions, respectively. We further show that this strategy is robust against the finite-size effect and different boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Advance Sharing with Ogawa et al.'s Ramp Quantum Secret Sharing Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ramp quantum secret sharing proposed by Ogawa et al. has the highest possible coding rate given a threshold type access structure. On the other hand, in some quantum secret sharing schemes, it is known that some shares can be distributed to participants before a secret is given to the dealer. However, it is unclear whether some shares can be distributed before a secret is given in Ogawa et al.'s scheme. In this paper, we propose a method to distribute some shares before a secret is given in Ogawa et al.'s scheme, then determine a necessary and sufficient condition on sets of shares that can be distributed before a given secret.</description>

      <title>Purification phase transition in the central spin model: second R\'enyi entropy in dual space approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a numerical investigation of the dynamics of the central spin model in the presence of measurement processes. This model holds promise for experimental exploration due to its topology, which facilitates the natural distinction of a central particle and the quantum bath as different subsystems, allowing for the examination of entanglement phase transitions. To characterize the measurement-induced phase transition in this system, we employ a recently developed method based on second R\'enyi entropy in dual space. Our simulations account for decoherence, energy relaxation, and gate errors. We determine critical measurement rates and demonstrate that they significantly differ from those predicted by a simple approach based on mutual entropy.</description>

      <title>Guided-SPSA: Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation assisted by the Parameter Shift Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of variational quantum algorithms (VQCs) has received significant attention from the quantum computing community in recent years. These hybrid algorithms, utilizing both classical and quantum components, are well-suited for noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Though estimating exact gradients using the parameter-shift rule to optimize the VQCs is realizable in NISQ devices, they do not scale well for larger problem sizes. The computational complexity, in terms of the number of circuit evaluations required for gradient estimation by the parameter-shift rule, scales linearly with the number of parameters in VQCs. On the other hand, techniques that approximate the gradients of the VQCs, such as the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA), do not scale with the number of parameters but struggle with instability and often attain suboptimal solutions. In this work, we introduce a novel gradient estimation approach called Guided-SPSA, which meaningfully combines the parameter-shift rule and SPSA-based gradient approximation. The Guided-SPSA results in a 15% to 25% reduction in the number of circuit evaluations required during training for a similar or better optimality of the solution found compared to the parameter-shift rule. The Guided-SPSA outperforms standard SPSA in all scenarios and outperforms the parameter-shift rule in scenarios such as suboptimal initialization of the parameters. We demonstrate numerically the performance of Guided-SPSA on different paradigms of quantum machine learning, such as regression, classification, and reinforcement learning.</description>

Abstract: Diagonalization of matrix pencils provide a uniform technique to transcribe operator based violations of Boole's `conditions of possible experience' involving multipartite correllations into contextuality. They also provide structural analysis of the contexts involved, and thereby suggest compact forms of deviations of quantized systems from classical predictions.</description>

      <title>Robust Quantum Gate Complexity: Foundations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal control of closed quantum systems is a well studied geometrically elegant set of computational theory and techniques that have proven pivotal in the implementation and understanding of quantum computers. The design of a circuit itself corresponds to an optimal control problem of choosing the appropriate set of gates (which appear as control operands) in order to steer a qubit from an initial, easily prepared state, to one that is informative to the user in some sense, for e.g., an oracle whose evaluation is part of the circuit. However, contemporary devices are known to be noisy, and it is not certain that a circuit will behave as intended. Yet, although the computational tools exist in broader optimal control theory, robustness of adequate operation of a quantum control system with respect to uncertainty and errors has not yet been broadly studied in the literature. In this paper, we propose a new approach inspired by the closed quantum optimal control and its connection to geometric interpretations. To this end, we present the appropriate problem definitions of robustness in the context of quantum control, focusing on its broader implications for gate complexity.</description>

      <title>Energy-conversion device using a quantum engine with the work medium of two-atom entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although entanglement is considered as an essential resource for quantum information processing, whether entanglement helps for energy conversion or output in the quantum regime is still lack of experimental witness. Here we report on an energy-conversion device operating as a quantum engine with the working medium acted by two entangled ions confined in a harmonic potential. The two ions are entangled by virtually coupling to one of the vibrational modes shared by the two ions, and the quantum engine couples to a quantum load, which is another shared vibrational mode. We explore the energy conversion efficiency of the quantum engine and investigate the useful energy (i.e., the maximum extractable work) stored in the quantum load by tuning the two ions in different degrees of entanglement as well as detecting the change of the phonons in the load. Our observation provides, for the first time, quantitative evidence that entanglement fuels the useful energy produced by the quantum engine, but not helpful for the energy conversion efficiency. We consider that our results may be useful to the study of quantum batteries for which one of the most indexes is the maximum extractable energy.</description>

      <title>QOPTLib: a Quantum Computing Oriented Benchmark for Combinatorial Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a quantum computing oriented benchmark for combinatorial optimization. This benchmark, coined as QOPTLib, is composed of 40 instances equally distributed over four well-known problems: Traveling Salesman Problem, Vehicle Routing Problem, one-dimensional Bin Packing Problem and the Maximum Cut Problem. The sizes of the instances in QOPTLib not only correspond to computationally addressable sizes, but also to the maximum length approachable with non-zero likelihood of getting a good result. In this regard, it is important to highlight that hybrid approaches are also taken into consideration. Thus, this benchmark constitutes the first effort to provide users a general-purpose dataset. Also in this paper, we introduce a first full solving of QOPTLib using two solvers based on quantum annealing. Our main intention with this is to establish a preliminary baseline, hoping to inspire other researchers to beat these outcomes with newly proposed quantum-based algorithms.</description>

      <title>The genuinely multipartite nonlocality of graph states is model-dependent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell's theorem proves that some quantum state correlations can only be explained by bipartite non-classical resources. The notion of genuinely multipartite nonlocality (GMNL) was later introduced to conceptualize the fact that nonclassical resources involving more than two parties in a nontrivial way may be needed to account for some quantum correlations. In this letter, we first recall the contradictions inherent to the historical definition of GMNL. Second, we turn to one of its redefinitions, called Local-Operations-and-Shared-Randomness GMNL (LOSR-GMNL), proving that all caterpillar graph states (including cluster states) have this second property. Finally, we conceptualize a third, alternative definition, which we call Local-Operations-and-Neighbour-Communication GMNL (LONC-GMNL), that is adapted to situations in which short-range communication between some parties might occur. We show that cluster states do not have this third property, while GHZ states do. Beyond its technical content, our letter illustrates that rigorous conceptual work is needed before applying the concepts of genuinely multipartite nonlocality, genuine multipartite entanglement or entanglement depth to benchmark the nonclassicality of some experimentally-produced quantum system. We note that most experimental works still use witnesses based on the historical definitions of these notions, which fail to reject models based on bipartite resources.</description>

      <title>Addendum to "Power-law decay of the fraction of the mixed eigenstates in kicked top model with mixed-type classical phase space"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using the Krylov subspace technique to generate the spin coherent states in kicked top model, a prototype model for studying quantum chaos, the accessible system size for studying the Husimi functions of eigenstates can be much larger than that reported in the literature and our previous study Phys. Rev. E 108, 054217 (2023) [arXiv:2308.04824]. In the fully chaotic kicked top, we find that the mean Wehrl entropy localization measure approaches the prediction given by the Circular Unitary Ensemble. In the mixed-type case, we identify mixed eigenstates by the overlap of the Husimi function with regular and chaotic regions in classical compact phase space. Numerically, we show that the fraction of mixed eigenstates scales as $j^{-\zeta}$, a power-law decay as the system size $j$ increases, across nearly two orders of magnitude. This provides supporting evidence for the principle of uniform semiclassical condensation of Husimi functions and the Berry-Robnik picture in the semiclassical limit.</description>

      <title>Simulating unsteady fluid flows on a superconducting quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements of intermediate-scale quantum processors have triggered tremendous interest in the exploration of practical quantum advantage. The simulation of fluid dynamics, a highly challenging problem in classical physics but vital for practical applications, emerges as a good candidate for showing quantum utility. Here, we report an experiment on the digital simulation of unsteady flows, which consists of quantum encoding, evolution, and detection of flow states, with a superconducting quantum processor. The quantum algorithm is based on the Hamiltonian simulation using the hydrodynamic formulation of the Schr\"odinger equation. With the median fidelities of 99.97% and 99.67% for parallel single- and two-qubit gates respectively, we simulate the dynamics of a two-dimensional (2D) compressible diverging flow and a 2D decaying vortex with ten qubits. The experimental results well capture the temporal evolution of averaged density and momentum profiles, and qualitatively reproduce spatial flow fields with moderate noises. This work demonstrates the potential of quantum computing in simulating more complex flows, such as turbulence, for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Non-onsite symmetries and quantum teleportation in split-index matrix product states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a class of spin chains with new physical and computational properties. On the physical side, the spin chains give examples of symmetry-protected topological phases that are defined by non-onsite symmetries, i.e. symmetries that are not a tensor product of single-site operators. These phases can be detected by string-order parameters, but notably do not exhibit entanglement spectrum degeneracy. On the computational side, the spin chains represent a new class of states that can be used to deterministically teleport information across long distances, with the novel property that the necessary classical side processing is a non-linear function of the measurement outcomes. We also give examples of states that can serve as universal resources for measurement-based quantum computation, providing the first examples of such resources without entanglement spectrum degeneracy. The key tool in our analysis is a new kind of tensor network representation which we call split-index matrix product states (SIMPS). We develop the basic formalism of SIMPS, compare them to matrix product states, show how they are better equipped to describe certain kinds of non-onsite symmetries and quantum teleportation, and discuss how they are also well-suited to describing constrained spin chains.</description>

      <title>Quantum metrology in a driven-dissipation down-conversion system beyond the parametric approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum metrology in a degenerate down-conversion system composed of a pump mode and two degenerate signal modes. In the conventional parametric approximation, the pump mode is assumed to be constant, not a quantum operator. We obtain the measurement precision of the coupling strength between the pump mode and two degenerate signal modes beyond the parametric approximation. Without a dissipation, the super-Heisenberg limit can be obtained when the initial state is the direct product of classical state and quantum state. This does not require the use of entanglement resources which are not easy to prepare. When the pump mode suffers from a single-photon dissipation, the measurement uncertainty of the coupling strength is close to 0 as the coupling strength approaches 0 with a coherent driving. The direct photon detection is proved to be the optimal measurement. This result has not been changed when the signal modes suffer from the two-photon dissipation. When the signal modes also suffer from the single-mode dissipation, the information of the coupling strength can still be obtained in the steady state. In addition, the measurement uncertainty of the coupling strength can also be close to 0 and become independent of noise temperature as the critical point between the normal and superradiance phase approaches. Finally, we show that a driven-dissipation down-conversion system can be used as a precise quantum sensor to measure the driving strength.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for quantum-light generation in a nonlinear cavity hybridized with a 2-level system. We theoretically show that, when excited by a series of controlled pump pulses, the hybrid source can generate various Fock states with high probabilities, such as near-on-demand generation of 1- and 2-photon states, and above 50% probability for generation of Fock states with up to 7 photons. More importantly, the tailorable nature of the nonlinear cavity and its pumping allows for generating Fock states with arbitrary frequencies, even with a fixed 2-level system, creating fundamentally new opportunities in all areas of quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The focus is on understanding the quantum thermodynamics of strongly coupled non-Markovian quantum systems. To this end, a non-trivial, non-Markovian model of a central spin surrounded by a spin bath is taken up, and its exact evolution is derived for arbitrary system-bath couplings. The fundamental quantum thermodynamic quantities, such as system and bath internal energies, work, heat, entropy production, and ergotropy, are calculated using the dynamics and original system (bath) Hamiltonian. An explicit expression for the work, a mismatch between the system and bath internal energies, is derived. Further, an interesting observation relevant to the spin bath acting as a charger is made in a scenario where the central spin is envisaged as a quantum battery. The role of a canonical Hamiltonian in calculating the above thermodynamic quantities, a recently developed technique, is also investigated.</description>

      <title>Single-Atom Verification of the Optimal Trade-Off Between Speed and Cost in Shortcuts to Adiabaticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The approach of shortcuts to adiabaticity enables the effective execution of adiabatic dynamics in quantum information processing with enhanced speed. Owing to the inherent trade-off between dynamical speed and the cost associated with the transitionless driving field, executing arbitrarily fast operations becomes impractical. To understand the accurate interplay between speed and energetic cost in this process, we propose theoretically and verify experimentally a new trade-off, which is characterized by a tightly optimized bound within $s$-parameterized phase spaces. Our experiment is carried out in a single ultracold $^{40}$Ca$^{+}$ ion trapped in a harmonic potential. By exactly operating the quantum states of the ion, we execute the Landau-Zener model as an example, where the quantum speed limit as well as the cost are governed by the spectral gap. We witness that our proposed trade-off is indeed tight in scenarios involving both initially pure and initially mixed states. Our work helps understanding the fundamental constraints in shortcuts to adiabaticity and illuminates the potential of under-utilized phase spaces that have been traditionally overlooked.</description>

Abstract: Parity-time (PT ) symmetric systems are gain-loss systems whose dynamics are governed by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with degeneracies at exceptional-points (EPs) and has been studied in various photonic, electrical, mechanical systems, and so on. However, it is still an open question how to capture PT symmetry phase transition in electronic system where the transport properties of electron will be dramatically effected. Fortunately, the hybridization between photon and electron offers a novel way not only to control but also probe material properties. Here, we investigate a cavity coupled to a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain within mean-field ansatzs. We find that Squeezed Displaced Schrodinger cat (SDSc) will emerge with high fidelity in cavity ground state when PT -symmetry is broken and the fidelity will experience a sharp drop from almost 1 to 0 as PT symmetry recovers. Additionally, in semiclassical limit, we find that there exists local extrema at two sides of $x=0$ in semiclassical photon Hamiltonian $H_{\rm eff}(x, p)$, a clear signature of the emergence of SDSc state in cavity ground state. Thus, the appearance of SDSc state can be used to capture PT-symmetry phase transition which can not be modified by cavity mode. Besides, we exploit the cavity ground state to estimate the phase in the optical interferometer, and show that the quantum Fisher information and nonclassicality will sharply decline at EPs. This reveals that PT-symmetry breaking in electronic materials can also be captured by the quantum Fisher information and nonclassicality in phase estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have expanded the use of the stochastic Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) equation to include complex variables for deriving quantum mechanical equations. However, these studies typically assume that it is valid to apply the HJB equation directly to complex numbers, an approach that overlooks the fundamental problem of comparing complex numbers to find optimal controls. This paper addresses how to properly apply the HJB equation in the context of complex variables. Our findings significantly reevaluate the stochastic movement of quantum particles, directly influenced by the Cauchy Riemann theorem. These insights not only deepen our understanding of quantum dynamics but also enhance the mathematical rigor of the framework for applying stochastic optimal control in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Detecting entanglement from macroscopic measurements of the electric field and its fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the outstanding task of detecting entanglement in large quantum systems, entanglement witnesses have emerged, addressing the separable nature of a state. Yet optimizing witnesses, or accessing them experimentally, often remains a challenge. We here introduce a family of entanglement witnesses for open quantum systems, based on the electric field -- its quadratures and the total fluorescence. More general than spin-squeezing inequalities, it can detect new classes of entangled states, as changing the direction for far-field observation opens up a continuous family of witnesses, without the need for a state tomography. Their efficiency is demonstrated by detecting, from almost any direction, the entanglement of collective single-photon states, such as long-lived states generated by cooperative spontaneous emission. Able to detect entanglement in large quantum systems, these electric-field-based witnesses can be used on any set of emitters described by the Pauli group, such as atomic systems (cold atoms and trapped ions), giant atoms, color centers, and superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Creating entangled logical qubits in the heavy-hex lattice with topological codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designs for quantum error correction depend strongly on the connectivity of the qubits. For solid state qubits, the most straightforward approach is to have connectivity constrained to a planar graph. Practical considerations may also further restrict the connectivity, resulting in a relatively sparse graph such as the heavy-hex architecture of current IBM Quantum devices. In such cases it is hard to use all qubits to their full potential. Instead, in order to emulate the denser connectivity required to implement well-known quantum error correcting codes, many qubits remain effectively unused. In this work we show how this bug can be turned into a feature. By using the unused qubits of one code to execute another, two codes can be implemented on top of each other, allowing easy application of fault-tolerant entangling gates and measurements. We demonstrate this by realizing a surface code and a Bacon-Shor code on a 133 qubit IBM Quantum device. Using transversal CX gates and lattice surgery we demonstrate entanglement between these logical qubits with code distance up to $d = 4$ and five rounds of stabilizer measurement cycles. The nonplanar coupling between the qubits allows us to simultaneously measure the logical $XX$, $YY$, and $ZZ$ observables. With this we verify the violation of Bell's inequality for both the $d=2$ case with post selection featuring a fidelity of $94\%$, and the $d=3$ instance using only quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking a heuristic Floquet adiabatic algorithm for the Max-Cut problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics, a system initially in the ground state of a Hamiltonian remains in the ground state if one slowly changes the Hamiltonian. This can be used in principle to solve hard problems on quantum computers. Generically, however, implementation of this Hamiltonian dynamics on digital quantum computers requires scaling Trotter step size with system size and simulation time, which incurs a large gate count. In this work, we argue that for classical optimization problems, the adiabatic evolution can be performed with a fixed, finite Trotter step. This "Floquet adiabatic evolution" reduces by several orders of magnitude the gate count compared to the usual, continuous-time adiabatic evolution. We give numerical evidence using matrix-product-state simulations that it can optimally solve the Max-Cut problem on $3$-regular graphs in a large number of instances, with surprisingly low runtime, even with bond dimensions as low as $D=2$. Extrapolating our numerical results, we estimate the resources needed for a quantum computer to compete with classical exact or approximate solvers for this specific problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study extensions of the mappings arising in usual Channel-State duality to the case of Hilbert spaces with a direct sum structure. This setting arises in representations of algebras with centers, which are commonly associated with constraints, and it has many physical applications from quantum many-body theory to holography and quantum gravity. We establish that there is a general relationship between non-separability of the state and the isometric properties of the induced channel. We also provide a generalisation of our approach to algebras of trace-class operators on infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state preparation and measurement of photonic and phononic Schr\"odinger cat states have gathered significant interest due to their implications for alternative encoding schemes in quantum computation. These scheme employ coherent state superpositions, leveraging the expanded Hilbert space provided by cavity or mechanical resonators in contrast to two-level systems. Moreover, such cat states also serve as a platform for testing fundamental quantum phenomena in macroscopic systems. In this study, we generate four bipartite phononic Bell cat states using an entanglement swapping scheme achieved through projective Bell state measurements on two superconducting qubits. Subsequently, we conduct a Bell inequality test on the bipartite cat state using the CHSH formulation. Given that the entangled cat states are generated through entanglement swapping, our approach could hold promising applications for the advancement of complex quantum network processors based on continuous variable systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spin-photon interface based on the luminescence of a singly charged quantum dot in a micropillar cavity allows for the creation of photonic entangled states. Current devices suffer from cavity birefringence, which limits the generation of spin-photon entanglement. In this paper, we theoretically study the light absorption and emission by the interface with an anisotropic cavity and derive the maximal excitation and spin-photon entanglement conditions. We show that the concurrence of the spin-photon state equal to one and complete quantum dot population inversion can be reached for a micropillar cavity with any degree of birefringence by tuning the quantum dot resonance strictly between the cavity modes. This sweet spot is also valid for generating a multiphoton cluster state, as we demonstrate by calculating the three-tangle and fidelity with the maximally entangled state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems of cooperation and interaction are usually studied in the context of real or complex vector spaces. Additional insight, however, is gained when such systems are represented in vector spaces with multiplicative structures, i.e., in algebras. Algebras, on the other hand, are conveniently viewed as polynomial algebras. In particular, basic interpretations of natural numbers yield natural polynomial algebras and offer a new unifying view on cooperation and interaction. For example, the concept of Galois transforms and zero-dividends of cooperative games is introduced as a nonlinear analogue of the classical Harsanyi dividends. Moreover, the polynomial model unifies various versions of Fourier transforms. Tensor products of polynomial spaces establish a unifying model with quantum theory and allow to study classical cooperative games as interaction activities in a quantum-theoretic context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy centers are spatially resolved probes of current noise. So far, current noise sensing with NV centers has primarily been used as a way to probe equilibrium transport coefficients. We develop a framework for computing the spatiotemporal correlations of nonequilibrium current noise in the Boltzmann regime, and apply it to two-dimensional metals in current-biased steady states. We argue that the spatial structure of the noise reveals the nonequilibrium nature of the electron distribution function, and more generally reveals the nature and lifetimes of the excitations responsible for transport. We estimate the visibility of these signatures in near-term experiments.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution imaging based on active optical intensity interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long baseline diffraction-limited optical aperture synthesis technology by interferometry plays an important role in scientific study and practical application. In contrast to amplitude (phase) interferometry, intensity interferometry -- which exploits the quantum nature of light to measure the photon bunching effect in thermal light -- is robust against atmospheric turbulence and optical defects. However, a thermal light source typically has a significant divergence angle and a low average photon number per mode, forestalling the applicability over long ranges. Here, we propose and demonstrate active intensity interferometry for super-resolution imaging over the kilometer range. Our scheme exploits phase-independent multiple laser emitters to produce the thermal illumination and uses an elaborate computational algorithm to reconstruct the image. In outdoor environments, we image two-dimension millimeter-level targets over 1.36 kilometers at a resolution of 14 times the diffraction limit of a single telescope. High-resolution optical imaging and sensing are anticipated by applying long-baseline active intensity interferometry in general branches of physics and metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While traditionally considered a deleterious effect in quantum dot spin qubits, the spin-orbit interaction is recently being revisited as it allows for rapid coherent control by on-chip AC electric fields. For electrons in bulk silicon, SOC is intrinsically weak, however, it can be enhanced at surfaces and interfaces, or through atomic placement. Here we show that the strength of the spin-orbit coupling can be locally enhanced by more than two orders of magnitude in the manybody wave functions of multi-donor quantum dots compared to a single donor, reaching strengths so far only reported for holes or two-donor system with certain symmetry. Our findings may provide a pathway towards all-electrical control of donor-bound spins in silicon using electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For quantum observables $H$ truncated on the range of orthogonal projections $\Pi_N$ of rank $N$, we study the corresponding Weyl symbol in the phase space in the semiclassical limit of vanishing Planck constant $\hbar\to0$ and large quantum number $N\to\infty$, with $\hbar N$ fixed. Under certain assumptions, we prove the $L^2$- convergence of the Weyl symbols to a symbol truncated (hence, in general discontinuous) on the classically permitted region in phase space. As an illustration of the general theorems we analyse truncated observables for the harmonic oscillator and for a free particle in a one-dimensional box. In the latter case, we also compute the microscopic pointwise limit of the symbols near the boundary of the classically permitted region.</description>

Abstract: We introduce new diagnostics of the transition between the ergodic and many-body localization phases, which are based on complexity measures defined via the probability distribution function of the Lanczos coefficients of the tri-diagonalized Hamiltonian. We use these complexity measures to analyze the power-law random banded matrix model as a function of the correlation strength and show that the moments and the entropy of the distribution diagnose the ergodic to many-body transition, as well as the distinctive feature of the phases concerning the memory of the initial conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum systems with SU($N$) symmetry are paradigmatic settings for quantum many-body physics. They have been studied for the insights they provide into complex materials and their ability to stabilize exotic ground states. Ultracold alkaline-earth atoms were predicted to exhibit SU($N$) symmetry for $N=2I+1=1,2,\ldots,10$, where $I$ is the nuclear spin. Subsequent experiments have revealed rich many-body physics. However, alkaline-earth atoms realize this symmetry only for fermions with repulsive interactions. In this paper, we predict that ultracold molecules shielded from destructive collisions with static electric fields or microwaves exhibit SU($N$) symmetry, which holds because deviations of the s-wave scattering length from the spin-free values are only about 3\% for CaF with static-field shielding and are estimated to be even smaller for bialkali molecules. They open the door to $N$ as large as $32$ for bosons and $36$ for fermions. They offer important features unachievable with atoms, including bosonic systems and attractive interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Order parameters represent a fundamental resource to characterize quantum matter. We show that pair superfluids can be rigorously defined in terms of a nonlocal order parameter, named odd parity, which derivation is experimentally accessible by local density measurements. As a case of study, we first investigate a constrained Bose-Hubbard model at different densities, both in one and two spatial dimensions. Here, our analysis finds pair superfluidity for relatively strong attractive interactions. The odd parity operator acts as the unique order parameter for such phase irrespectively to the density of the system and its dimensionality. In order to enforce our finding, we confirm the generality of our approach also on a two-component Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, which experimental realization represents a timely topic in ultracold atomic systems. Our results shed new light on the role of correlated density fluctuations in pair superfluids. In addition, they provide a powerful tool for the experimental detection of such exotic phases and the characterization of their transition to the normal superfluid phase.</description>

      <title>Minimizing the Number of Teleportations in Distributed Quantum Computing Using Alloy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for minimizing the number of teleportations in Distributed Quantum Computing (DQC) using formal methods. Quantum teleportation plays a major role in communicating quantum information. As such, it is desirable to perform as few teleportations as possible when distributing a quantum algorithm on a network of quantum machines. Contrary to most existing methods which rely on graph-theoretic or heuristic search techniques, we propose a drastically different approach for minimizing the number of teleportations through utilizing formal methods. Specifically, the contributions of this paper include: the formal specification of the teleportation minimization problem in Alloy, the generalizability of the proposed Alloy specifications to quantum circuits with $n$-ary gates, the reusability of the Alloy specifications for different quantum circuits and networks, the simplicity of specifying and solving other problems such as load balancing and heterogeneity, and the compositionality of the proposed approach. We also develop a software tool, called qcAlloy, that takes as input the textual description of a quantum circuit, generates the corresponding Alloy model, and finally solves the minimization problem using the Alloy analyzer. We have experimentally evaluated qcAlloy for some of the circuits in the RevLib benchmark with more than 100 qubits and 1200 layers, and have demonstrated that qcAlloy outperforms one of the most efficient existing methods for most benchmark circuits in terms of minimizing the number of teleportations.</description>

Abstract: Bell nonlocality and steering are archetypal characteristics of quantum mechanics that mark a significant departure from conventional classical notions. They basically refer to the presence of quantum correlations between separated systems which violate a nonlocal inequality, the violation otherwise not possible if we restrict ourselves only to classical correlations. In view of the importance of such unique correlations one may be interested to generate more states exhibiting nonlocality starting from a few, a protocol which is termed as broadcasting. However, in the present submission, we show using universal Buzek-Hillary(BH) quantum cloning machine that, if one restricts to broadcasting through local quantum cloning, then such nonlocality cannot be broadcasted. Our study is done in the purview of the Bell-CHSH inequality and the CJWR (E.G.Cavalcanti,S.J. Jones,H.M Wiseman and M.D. Reid, Phys.Rev.A 80,032112(2009)) steering inequality. It is observed that when number of measurement settings is greater than 6, some of the output states are steerable after the application of local optimal B-H cloners. We find that, under some restrictions, if the Werner and Bell diagonal states are subjected to such procedures, then the resultant state is rendered unsteerable. We extend this study to three qubit systems and find that genuine tripartite nonlocality cannot be broadcasted using universal BH local quantum cloners, when we consider the Svetlichny's inequality. For two qubit systems, we have considered $10^5$ simulated general local unitaries over Werner and Bell-diagonal states and find that for none of these states broadcasting on nonlocality and 3-steerability is possible.</description>

      <title>Late time dynamics in SUSY saddle-dominated scrambling through higher-point OTOC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.07089v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the scrambling dynamics in supersymmetric quantum mechanical systems. The eigenstate representation of such supersymmetric systems allows us to present an explicit form of the $2N$-point out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) using two equivalent formalisms viz. "Tensor Product formalism" and "Partner Hamiltonian formalism". We analytically compute the $2N$-point OTOC for the supersymmetric 1D harmonic oscillator and find that the result is in exact agreement with that of the OTOC of the 1D bosonic harmonic oscillator system. The higher-point OTOC is a more sensitive measure of scrambling than the usual 4-point OTOC. To demonstrate this feature, we consider a supersymmetric sextic 1D oscillator for which the bosonic partner system has an unstable saddle in the phase space, which is absent in the fermionic counterpart. For such a system we show that the bosonic, the fermionic as well as the supersymmetric OTOC exhibit similar dynamics due to supersymmetry constraints. Finally, we illustrate the late-time oscillatory behaviour of higher-point OTOC for saddle-dominated scrambling and anharmonic oscillator systems and propose it to be a probe of late-time dynamics in non-chaotic systems that exhibit fast early-time scrambling.</description>

      <title>Maxwell Demon and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Steering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.05656v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of Maxwell demon and quantum entanglement is important because of its foundational significance in physics and its potential applications in quantum information. Previous research on the Maxwell demon has primarily focused on thermodynamics, taking into account quantum correlations. Here we consider from another perspective and ask whether quantum non-locality correlations can be simulated by performing work. The Maxwell demon-assisted Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering is thus proposed, which implies a new type of loophole. The application of Landauer's erasure principle suggests that the only way to close this loophole during a steering task is by continuously monitoring the heat fluctuation of the local environment by the participant. We construct a quantum circuit model of Maxwell demon-assisted EPR steering, which can be demonstrated by current programmable quantum processors, such as superconducting quantum computers. Based on this quantum circuit model, we obtain a quantitative formula describing the relationship between energy dissipation due to the work of the demon and quantum non-locality correlation. The result is of great physical interest because it provides a new way to explore and understand the relationship between quantum non-locality, information, and thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Shortcut to Multipartite Entanglement Generation: A Graph Approach to Boson Subtractions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.04042v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a graph method for systematically searching for schemes that can generate multipartite entanglement in linear bosonic systems with heralding. While heralded entanglement generation offers more tolerable schemes for quantum tasks than postselected ones, it is generally more challenging to find appropriate circuits for multipartite systems. We show that our graph mapping from boson subtractions provides handy tactics to overcome the limitations in circuit designs. We present a practical strategy to mitigate the limitation through the implementation of our graph technique. Our physical setup is based on the sculpting protocol, which utilizes an $ N$ spatially overlapped subtractions of single bosons to convert Fock states of evenly distributed bosons into entanglement. We have identified general schemes for qubit N-partite GHZ and W states, which are significantly more efficient than previous schemes. In addition, our scheme for generating the superposition of $N=3$ GHZ and W entangled states illustrates that our approach can be extended to derive more generalized forms of entangled states. Furthermore, we have found an N-partite GHZ state generation scheme for qudits, which requires substantially fewer particles than previous proposals. These results demonstrate the power of our approach in discovering optimized solutions for the generation of intricate heralded entangled states. As a proof of concept, we propose a linear optical scheme for the generation of the Bell state by heralding detections. We expect our method to serve as a promising tool in generating diverse entanglement.</description>

      <title>Kerr-effect-based quantum logical gates in decoherence-free subspace</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decoherence effect caused by the coupling between the system and the environment undoubtedly leads to the errors in efficient implementations of two (or three) qubit logical gates in quantum information processing. Fortunately, decoherence-free subspace (DFS) introduced can effectively decrease the influence of decoherence effect. In this paper, we propose some schemes for setting up a family of quantum control gates, including controlled-NOT (CNOT), Toffoli, and Fredkin gates for two or three logical qubits by means of cross-Kerr nonlinearities in DFS. These three logical gates require neither complicated quantum computational circuits nor auxiliary photons (or entangled states). The success probabilities of three logical gates are approximate 1 by performing the corresponding classical feed-forward operations based on the different measuring results of the X-homodyne detectors, and their fidelities are robust against the photon loss with the current technology. The proposed logical gates rely on only simple linear-optics elements, available single-qubit operations, and mature measurement methods, making our proposed gates be feasible and efficient in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance of Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond under Weak Laser Excitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As promising quantum sensors, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have been widely used in frontier studies in condensed matter physics, material sciences, and life sciences. In practical applications, weak laser excitation is favorable as it reduces the side effects of laser irradiation, for example, phototoxicity and heating. Here we report a combined theoretical and experimental study of optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of NV-center ensembles under weak 532-nm laser excitation. In this regime, both the width and splitting of ODMR spectra decrease with increasing laser power. This power dependence is reproduced with a model considering laser-induced charge neutralization of NV--N+ pairs, which alters the local electric field environment. These results are important for understanding and designing NV-based quantum sensing in light-sensitive applications.</description>

Abstract: The Toffoli gate takes a special place in the quantum information theory. It opens up a path for efficient implementation of complex quantum algorithms. Despite tremendous progress of the quantum processors based on the superconducting qubits, realization of a high-fidelity three-qubit operation is still a challenging problem. Here, we propose a novel way to perform a high-fidelity CCZ gate on fluxoniums capacitively connected via a transmon qubit, activated by a microwave pulse on the coupler. The main advantages of the approach are relative quickness, simplicity of calibration and significant suppression of the unwanted longitudinal ZZ interaction. We provide numerical simulation of 95-ns long gate of higher than 99.99% fidelity with realistic circuit parameters in the noiseless model and estimate an error of about 0.25% under the conventional decoherence rates.</description>

      <title>Classifying fermionic states via many-body correlation measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the structure of quantum correlations in a many-body system is key to its computational treatment. For fermionic systems, correlations can be defined as deviations from Slater determinant states. The link between fermionic correlations and efficient computational physics methods is actively studied but remains ambiguous. We make progress in establishing this connection mathematically. In particular, we find a rigorous classification of states relative to $k$-fermion correlations, which admits a computational physics interpretation. Correlations are captured by a measure $\omega_k$, a function of $k$-fermion reduced density matrix that we call twisted purity. Vanishing of $\omega_k$ for a given $k$ puts the state in a class $G_k$ of correlated states. Sets $G_k$ are nested in $k$, Slater determinants correspond to $k = 1$. Various physically relevant states are in or close to $G_{k=O(1)}$, including truncated configuration-interaction states, perturbation series around Slater determinants, and some nonperturbative eigenstates of the 1D Hubbard model. For each $k = O(1)$, we give an explicit ansatz with a polynomial number of parameters that covers all states in $G_k$. Potential applications of this ansatz and its connections to the coupled-cluster wavefunction are discussed.</description>

Abstract: The manipulation and metrology of light beams are pivotal for optical science and applications. In particular, achieving ultra-high precision in the measurement of light beam rotations has been a long-standing challenge. Instead of utilizing quantum probes like entangled photons, we address this challenge by incorporating a quantum strategy called "indefinite time direction" into the parameterizing process of quantum parameter estimation. Leveraging this quantum property of the parameterizing dynamics allows us to maximize the utilization of OAM resources for measuring ultra-small angular rotations of beam profile. Notably, a nanoradian-scale precision of light rotation measurement is finally achieved in the experiment, which is the highest precision by far to our best knowledge. Furthermore, this scheme holds promise in various optical applications due to the diverse range of manipulable resources offered by photons.</description>

      <title>Certifying long-range quantum correlations through routed Bell tests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07484v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Losses in the transmission channel, which increase with distance, pose a major obstacle to photonics demonstrations of quantum nonlocality and its applications. Recently, Chaturvedi, Viola, and Pawlowski (CVP) [arXiv:2211.14231] introduced a variation of standard Bell experiments with the goal of extending the range over which quantum nonlocality can be demonstrated. In these experiments, which we call 'routed Bell experiments', Bob can route his quantum particle along two possible paths and measure it at two distinct locations - one near and another far from the source. The idea is that a Bell violation in the short-path should weaken the conditions required to detect nonlocal correlations in the long-path. Indeed, CVP showed that there are quantum correlations in routed Bell experiments such that the outcomes of the remote device cannot be classically predetermined, even when its detection efficiency is arbitrarily low. In this paper, we show that the correlations considered by CVP, though they cannot be classically predetermined, do not require the transmission of quantum systems to the remote device. This leads us to define the concept of 'short-range' and 'long-range' quantum correlations in routed Bell experiments. We show that these correlations can be characterized through standard semidefinite programming hierarchies for non-commutative polynomial optimization. We then explore the conditions under which short-range quantum correlations can be ruled out. We point out that there exist fundamental lower-bounds on the critical detection efficiency of the distant device, implying that routed Bell experiments cannot demonstrate long-range quantum nonlocality at arbitrarily large distances. However, we do find that routed Bell experiments allow for reducing the detection efficiency threshold. The improvements, though, are significantly smaller than those suggested by CVP's analysis.</description>

Abstract: We show that many-body fermionic non-Hermitian systems require two distinct sets of topological invariants to describe the topology of energy bands and quantum states respectively, with the latter yet to be explored. We identify 10 symmetry classes -- determined by particle-hole, linearized time-reversal, and linearized chiral symmetries. Each class has topological invariant associated with each dimension, dictating the topology of quantum states. These findings pave the way for deeper understanding of the topological phases of many-body non-Hermitian systems.</description>

Abstract: Forecasting chaotic systems is a notably complex task, which in recent years has been approached with reasonable success using reservoir computing (RC), a recurrent network with fixed random weights (the reservoir) used to extract the spatio-temporal information of the system. This work presents a hybrid quantum reservoir-computing (HQRC) framework, which replaces the reservoir in RC with a quantum circuit. The modular structure and measurement feedback in the circuit are used to encode the complex system dynamics in the reservoir states, from which classical learning is performed to predict future dynamics. The noiseless simulations of HQRC demonstrate valid prediction times comparable to state-of-the-art classical RC models for both the Lorenz63 and double-scroll chaotic paradigmatic systems and adhere to the attractor dynamics long after the forecasts have deviated from the ground truth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04915v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cavity magnonics, which studies the interaction of light with magnetic systems in a cavity, is a promising platform for quantum transducers and quantum memories. At microwave frequencies, the coupling between a cavity photon and a magnon, the quasi-particle of a spin wave excitation, is a consequence of the Zeeman interaction between the cavity's magnetic field and the magnet's macroscopic spin. For each photon/magnon interaction, a coupling phase factor exists, but is often neglected in simple systems. However, in "loop-coupled" systems, where there are at least as many couplings as modes, the coupling phases become relevant for the physics and lead to synthetic gauge fields. We present experimental evidence of the existence of such coupling phases by considering two spheres made of Yttrium-Iron-Garnet and two different re-entrant cavities. We predict numerically the values of the coupling phases, and we find good agreement between theory and the experimental data. These results show that in cavity magnonics, one can engineer synthetic gauge fields, which can be useful for cavity-mediated coupling and engineering dark mode physics.</description>

Abstract: In [Phys. Rev. A 107, 012427 (2023)], A. J. Baldwin and J. A. Jones proved that Uhlmann-Jozsa's fidelity between two quantum states $\rho$ and $\sigma$, i.e., $F(\rho,\sigma)~:=~(Tr\sqrt{\sqrt{\rho}\sigma\sqrt{\rho}})^2$, can be written in a simplified form as $F(\rho,\sigma) = (Tr\sqrt{\rho\sigma})^2$. In this article, we give an alternative proof of this result, using a function power series expansion and the properties of the trace function. Our approach not only reinforces the validity of the simplified expression but also facilitates the exploration of novel dissimilarity functions for quantum states and more complex trace functions of a density operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17657v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a matrix product state (MPS) extension for the Fermionic Quantum Emulator (FQE) software library. We discuss the theory behind symmetry adapted matrix product states for approximating many-body wavefunctions of spin-1/2 fermions, and we present an open-source, MPS-enabled implementation of the FQE interface (MPS-FQE). The software uses the open-source pyblock3 and block2 libraries for most elementary tensor operations, and it can largely be used as a drop-in replacement for FQE that allows for more efficient, but approximate, emulation of larger fermionic circuits. Finally, we show several applications relevant to both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum algorithms where approximate emulation of larger systems is expected to be useful: characterization of state preparation strategies for quantum phase estimation, the testing of different variational quantum eigensolver Ans\"atze, the numerical evaluation of Trotter errors, and the simulation of general quantum dynamics problems. In all these examples, approximate emulation with MPS-FQE allows us to treat systems that are significantly larger than those accessible with a full statevector emulator.</description>

Abstract: The fascinating concept of coherent quantum absorber - which can absorb any photon emitted by another system while maintaining entanglement with that system - has found diverse implications in open quantum system theory and quantum metrology. This work generalizes the concept by proposing the so-called reversal conditions for the two systems, in which a "reverser" coherently reverses any effect of the other system on a field. The reversal conditions are rigorously boiled down to concise formulas involving the Petz recovery map and Kraus operators, thereby generalizing as well as streamlining the existing treatments of coherent absorbers.</description>

      <title>A de Finetti theorem for quantum causal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What does it mean for a causal structure to be `unknown'? Can we even talk about `repetitions' of an experiment without prior knowledge of causal relations? And under what conditions can we say that a set of processes with arbitrary, possibly indefinite, causal structure are independent and identically distributed? Similar questions for classical probabilities, quantum states, and quantum channels are beautifully answered by so-called "de Finetti theorems", which connect a simple and easy-to-justify condition -- symmetry under exchange -- with a very particular multipartite structure: a mixture of identical states/channels. Here we extend the result to processes with arbitrary causal structure, including indefinite causal order and multi-time, non-Markovian processes applicable to noisy quantum devices. The result also implies a new class of de Finetti theorems for quantum states subject to a large class of linear constraints, which can be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Theory of time-bin entangled photons from quantum emitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entangled photon pairs form the foundation for many applications in the realm of quantum communication. For fiber-optic transfer of entangled photon pairs, time-bin encoding can potentially offer an improved stability compared to polarization encoded qubits. Here, we lay the theoretical foundations to describe the measurement of time-bin entangled photons. We derive multi-time correlation functions of the time-bin encoded photon pairs, corresponding to quantum state tomographic measurements. Our theory can be the starting point to extend the simulations to include all kinds of loss or decoherence effects that apply in a specific quantum system for realistic simulation for time-bin entanglement from quantum emitters.</description>

      <title>Purification of Noisy Measurements and Faithful Distillation of Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider entanglement distillation in a realistic scenario with noisy operations in which quantum measurements that constitute a general quantum operation are particularly noisy. We present a protocol for purifying noisy measurements and show that with the help of the purification, imperfect local operations can be used to distill entanglement. We show that the purification protocol is robust against noise in implementation and analyze the purification in a practical realization: for measurement and gate errors up to 10%, we suggest that the purification with two additional qubits is cost-effective for distilling entanglement. The purification protocol is feasible with currently available quantum technologies and readily applied to entanglement applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the Fokker-Planck equation via Schrodingerization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a quantum simulation technique for solving the Fokker-Planck equation. Traditional semi-discretization methods often fail to preserve the underlying Hamiltonian dynamics and may even modify the Hamiltonian structure, particularly when incorporating boundary conditions. We address this challenge by employing the Schrodingerization method-it converts any linear partial and ordinary differential equation with non-Hermitian dynamics into systems of Schrodinger-type equations. We explore the application in two distinct forms of the Fokker-Planck equation. For the conservation form, we show that the semi-discretization-based Schrodingerization is preferable, especially when dealing with non-periodic boundary conditions. Additionally, we analyze the Schrodingerization approach for unstable systems that possess positive eigenvalues in the real part of the coefficient matrix or differential operator. Our analysis reveals that the direct use of Schrodingerization has the same effect as a stabilization procedure. For the heat equation form, we propose a quantum simulation procedure based on the time-splitting technique. We discuss the relationship between operator splitting in the Schrodingerization method and its application directly to the original problem, illustrating how the Schrodingerization method accurately reproduces the time-splitting solutions at each step. Furthermore, we explore finite difference discretizations of the heat equation form using shift operators. Utilizing Fourier bases, we diagonalize the shift operators, enabling efficient simulation in the frequency space. Providing additional guidance on implementing the diagonal unitary operators, we conduct a comparative analysis between diagonalizations in the Bell and the Fourier bases, and show that the former generally exhibits greater efficiency than the latter.</description>

      <title>Unitary Synthesis of Clifford+T Circuits with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning approach for synthesizing unitaries into quantum circuits. Unitary synthesis aims to identify a quantum circuit that represents a given unitary while minimizing circuit depth, total gate count, a specific gate count, or a combination of these factors. While past research has focused predominantly on continuous gate sets, synthesizing unitaries from the parameter-free Clifford+T gate set remains a challenge. Although the time complexity of this task will inevitably remain exponential in the number of qubits for general unitaries, reducing the runtime for simple problem instances still poses a significant challenge. In this study, we apply the tree-search method Gumbel AlphaZero to solve the problem for a subset of exactly synthesizable Clifford+T unitaries. Our approach can synthesize unitaries for up to five qubits generated from the set of randomized quantum circuits with up to 60 gates. Furthermore, our inference times are around 30 seconds on a single GPU on average, surpassing state-of-the-art algorithms QuantumCircuitOpt and MIN-T-SYNTH for higher qubit numbers. Our work provides a competitive baseline for synthesis algorithms to be developed in the upcoming years.</description>

      <title>Tunable Entanglement in Cavity-Magnon Optomechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cavity optomechanics, providing an inherently nonlinear interaction between photons and phonons, have shown enomerous potential in generating macroscopic quantum entanglement. Here we propose to realize diverse bipartite and tripartite entanglement in cavity-magnon optomechanics. By introducing magnons to standard cavity optomechanics, not only tunable optomechanical entanglement and magnon-magnon entanglement can be achieved, but also flexible tripartite entanglement including magnon-photon-phonon entanglement, magnon-magnon-photon and -phonon entanglement can be generated. Moreover, optimal bipartite and tripartite entanglement can be achieved by tuning parameters. We further show that all entanglement can be enhanced via engineering the magnon-photon coupling,and is proven to be robust against the bath temperature within the survival temperature. Besides, we find that the optomechanical entanglement can be protected or restored by bad magnons with large decay rate, while other entanglement is severely reduced. The results indicate that our proposal provides a novel avenue to explore and control tunable macroscopic quantum effects in hybrid cavity-magnon optomechanics.</description>

      <title>Confinement in 1+1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Theories at Finite Temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Confinement is a paradigmatic phenomenon of gauge theories, and its understanding lies at the forefront of high-energy physics. Here, we study confinement in a simple one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory at finite temperature and filling, which is within the reach of current cold-atom and superconducting-qubit platforms. By employing matrix product states (MPS) calculations, we investigate the decay of the finite-temperature Green's function and uncover a smooth crossover between the confined and deconfined regimes. Furthermore, using the Friedel oscillations and string length distributions obtained from snapshots sampled from MPS, both of which are experimentally readily available, we verify that confined mesons remain well-defined at arbitrary finite temperature. This phenomenology is further supported by probing quench dynamics of mesons with exact diagonalization. Our results shed new light on confinement at finite temperature from an experimentally relevant standpoint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15349v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a model of Pauli spin operators with all-to-all 4-local interactions by replacing Majorana fermions in the SYK model with spin operators. Equivalently, we replace fermions with hard-core bosons. We study this model numerically and compare the properties with those of the SYK model. We observe a striking quantitative coincidence between the spin model and the SYK model, which suggests that this spin model is strongly chaotic and, perhaps, can play some role in holography. We also discuss the path-integral approach with multi-local fields and the possibility of quantum simulations. This model may be an interesting target for quantum simulations because Pauli spins are easier to implement than fermions on qubit-based quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Dynamical separation of charge and energy transport in one-dimensional Mott insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One-dimensional Mott insulators can be described using the sine-Gordon model, an integrable quantum field theory that provides the low-energy effective description of several one-dimensional gapped condensed matter systems, including recent realizations with trapped ultra-cold atoms. Employing the theory of Generalized Hydrodynamics, we demonstrate that this model exhibits separation of the transport of topological charge vs. energy. Analysis of the quasiparticle dynamics reveals that the mechanism behind the separation is the reflective scattering between topologically charged kinks/antikinks. The effect of these scattering events is most pronounced at strong coupling and low temperatures, where the distribution of quasiparticles is narrow compared to the reflective scattering amplitude. This effect results in a distinctively shaped "arrowhead" light cone for the topological charge.</description>

      <title>Amorphous quantum magnets in a two-dimensional Rydberg atom array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Amorphous solids, i.e., systems which feature well-defined short-range properties but lack long-range order, constitute an important research topic in condensed matter. While their microscopic structure is known to differ from their crystalline counterpart, there are still many open questions concerning the emergent collective behavior in amorphous materials. This is particularly the case in the quantum regime, where the numerical simulations are extremely challenging. In this article, we instead propose to explore amorphous quantum magnets with an analog quantum simulator. To this end, we first present an algorithm to generate amorphous quantum magnets, suitable for Rydberg simulators of the Ising model. Subsequently, we use semiclassical approaches to get a preliminary insight of the physics of the model. In particular, for ferromagnetic interactions, we calculate mean-field phase diagrams, and use the linear-spin-wave theory to study localization properties and dynamical structure factors of the excitations. For antiferromagnetic interactions, we show that amorphous magnets exhibit a complex classical energy landscape by means of simulated annealing. Finally, we outline an experimental proposal based on Rydberg atoms in programmable tweezer arrays, thus opening the road towards the study of amorphous quantum magnets in regimes difficult to simulate classically.</description>

Abstract: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement, superposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial processing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help solve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing methods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics, chemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy, banking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few years have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm creation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the prospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have comprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and find outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research community working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand quantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on current research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum computer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography, quantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential challenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and development are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.</description>

      <title>Ultralow-loss integrated photonics enables bright, narrow-band, photon-pair sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photon-pair sources are critical building blocks for photonic quantum systems. Leveraging Kerr nonlinearity and cavity-enhanced spontaneous four-wave mixing, chip-scale photon-pair sources can be created using microresonators built on photonic integrated circuit. For practical applications, a high microresonator quality factor $Q$ is mandatory to magnify photon-pair sources' brightness and reduce their linewidth. The former is proportional to $Q^4$, while the latter is inversely proportional to $Q$. Here, we demonstrate an integrated, microresonator-based, narrow-band photon-pair source. The integrated microresonator, made of silicon nitride and fabricated using a standard CMOS foundry process, features ultralow loss down to $3$ dB/m and intrinsic $Q$ factor exceeding $10^7$. The photon-pair source has brightness of $1.17\times10^9$ Hz/mW$^2$/GHz and linewidth of $25.9$ MHz, both of which are record values for silicon-photonics-based quantum light source. It further enables a heralded single-photon source with heralded second-order correlation $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{h}(0)=0.0037(5)$, as well as a time-bin entanglement source with a raw visibility of $0.973(9)$. Our work evidences the global potential of ultralow-loss integrated photonics to create novel quantum light sources and circuits, catalyzing efficient, compact and robust interfaces to quantum communication and networks.</description>
