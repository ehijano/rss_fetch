      <title>A critical analysis of the recent OGLE limits on stellar mass primordial black holes in the halo of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a response to recent claims that a population of primordial black holes in the Galactic halo has been ruled out by the OGLE collaboration. This claim was based on the latest results from the OGLE microlensing survey towards the Large Magellanic Cloud which failed to detect even the number of events expected from known stellar populations. In particular, their results are completely inconsistent with the results of the MACHO survey which detected a population of compact bodies in the Galactic halo which could not be accounted for by any known stellar population. The discrepancy between the results of these two groups has a long history, and includes problems such as different choice of photometric passbands, quality of light curves, microlensing event selection, detection efficiency, self lensing and halo models. In this paper it is demonstrated that these issues not only account for the discrepancy between the OGLE and MACHO results, but imply that the OGLE observations can put no meaningful constraints on a population of primordial black holes in the Galactic halo.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen-Alpha as a Tracer of Star Formation in the SPHINX Cosmological Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hydrogen-alpha (Ha) emission line in galaxies is a powerful tracer of their recent star formation activity. With the advent of JWST, we are now able to routinely observe Ha in galaxies at high redshifts (z &gt; 3) and thus measure their star-formation rates (SFRs). However, using "classical" SFR(Ha) calibrations to derive the SFRs leads to biased results because high-redshift galaxies are commonly characterized by low metallicities and bursty star-formation histories, affecting the conversion factor between the Ha luminosity and the SFR. In this work, we develop a set of new SFR(Ha) calibrations that allow us to predict the SFRs of Ha-emitters at z &gt; 3 with minimal error. We use the SPHINX cosmological simulations to select a sample of star-forming galaxies representative of the Ha-emitter population observed with JWST. We then derive linear corrections to the classical SFR(Ha) calibrations, taking into account variations in the physical properties (e.g., stellar metallicities) among individual galaxies. We obtain two new SFR(Ha) calibrations that, compared to the classical calibrations, reduce the root mean squared error (RMSE) in the predicted SFRs by $\Delta$RMSE $\approx$ 0.04 dex and $\Delta$RMSE $\approx$ 0.06 dex, respectively. Using the recent JWST NIRCam/grism observations of Ha-emitters at z ~ 6, we show that the new calibrations affect the high-redshift galaxy population statistics: (i) the estimated cosmic star-formation density decreases by $\Delta\rho$(SFR) $\approx$ 12%, and (ii) the observed slope of the star-formation main sequence increases by $\Delta$ $\partial$log SFR / $\partial$log M* = 0.08 $\pm$ 0.02.</description>

      <title>The Light Echo of a High-Redshift Quasar mapped with Lyman-$\alpha$ Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-violet (UV) radiation from accreting black holes ionizes the intergalactic gas around early quasars, carving out highly ionized bubbles in their surroundings. Any changes in a quasar's luminosity are therefore predicted to produce outward-propagating ionization gradients, affecting the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) absorption opacity near the quasar's systemic redshift. This "proximity effect" is well-documented in rest-UV quasar spectra but only provides a one-dimensional probe along our line-of-sight. Here we present deep spectroscopic observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) of galaxies in the background of a super-luminous quasar at $z_{\rm QSO}\approx6.3$, which reveal the quasar's "light echo" with Ly$\alpha$ tomography in the transverse direction. This transverse proximity effect is detected for the first time towards multiple galaxy sightlines, allowing us to map the extent and geometry of the quasar's ionization cone. We obtain constraints on the orientation and inclination of the cone, as well as an upper limit on the obscured solid angle fraction of $f_{\rm obsc}&lt;91\%$. Additionally, we find a timescale of the quasar's UV radiation of $t_{\rm QSO}=10^{5.6^{+0.1}_{-0.3}}$ years, which is significantly shorter than would be required to build up the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) with conventional growth models, but is consistent with independent measurements of the quasars' duty cycle. Our inferred obscured fraction disfavors a scenario where short quasar lifetimes can be explained exclusively by geometric obscuration, and instead supports the idea that radiatively inefficient accretion or growth in initially heavily enshrouded cocoons plays a pivotal role in early SMBH growth. Our results pave the way for novel studies of quasars' ionizing geometries and radiative histories at early cosmic times.</description>

      <title>Another view into JWST-discovered X-ray weak AGNs via radiative dusty feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has revealed a previously unknown population of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early Universe. These JWST-AGN at high redshifts are characterised by a set of peculiar properties, including unusually weak X-ray emission. Here we investigate the apparent lack of X-ray emission in the framework of the ``AGN radiative dusty feedback'' scenario based on the effective Eddington limit for dust. We analyse how the boundary in the $N_\mathrm{H} - \lambda$ plane, defined by the column density versus the Eddington ratio, is modified as a function of the dusty gas parameters (metallicity, dust grain size and composition). Low metallicity gas with little dust content tends to survive against radiation pressure, and likely accumulates in the nuclear region. We suggest that such dust-poor gas can provide long-lived absorption and may lead to heavy X-ray obscuration, as observed in early JWST-AGN. The blowout vs. stalling condition of the obscuring clouds indicates that higher metallicities are required to eject heavier column densities, while large columns of gas can stall in low metallicity environments. Therefore the metallicity may play a key role in the AGN radiative dusty feedback scenario. We discuss how other peculiar properties of JWST-AGN -- such as Balmer absorption features and weak radio emission -- may be naturally interpreted within the same physical framework.</description>

      <title>What you see is what you get: empirically measured bolometric luminosities of Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New populations of red active galactic nuclei (known as ``Little Red Dots'') discovered by JWST exhibit remarkable spectral energy distributions. Leveraging X-ray through far-infrared observations of two of the most luminous known Little Red Dots, we directly their bolometric luminosities. We find evidence that more than half of the bolometric luminosity likely emerges in the rest-frame optical, with $L_{\rm bol}/L_{5100} = 5$, roughly half the value for ``standard'' Active Galactic Nuclei. Meanwhile, the X-ray emitting corona, UV-emitting black-body, and reprocessed mid to far-infrared emission are all considerably sub-dominant, assuming that the far-infrared luminosity is well below current measured limits. We present new bolometric corrections that dramatically lower inferred bolometric luminosities by a factor of ten compared to published values in the literature. These bolometric corrections are in accord with expectations from models in which gas absorption and reprocessing are responsible for the red rest-frame optical colors of Little Red Dots. We discuss how this lowered luminosity scale suggests a lower mass scale for the population by at least an order of magnitude {\bf (e.g., $\sim 10^5-10^7~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ black holes, and $\sim 10^8~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ galaxies)}, alleviating tensions with clustering, overmassive black holes, and the integrated black hole mass density in the Universe.</description>

      <title>The MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey -- II. Catalogue of the diffuse radio emission in MeerKAT-GCLS clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a follow-up study focused on cluster-scale diffuse radio emissions in 115 galaxy clusters in the Southern sky, using full-resolution (7.8") and tapered low-resolution (15") images from the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey (MGCLS). In this MGCLS follow-up paper, we update and quantitatively characterise the presence of diffuse radio emission and provide detailed catalogue information on its radio properties at 1.28 GHz. As the MGCLS sample is heterogeneous and was initially used as a test bed to reveal the scientific potential of MeerKAT, the reported numbers are subject to this special case. More than half ($\sim$54%; 62/115) of the observed MGCLS clusters present diffuse cluster radio emission, with the total number of diffuse radio sources or candidates detected being 103. Including candidates, we find that radio relics are the most frequently detected diffuse sources in MGCLS at 53% (55/103), followed by halos at 32% (33/103) and mini-halos at 10% (11/103), with only 3% (3/103) being Phoenixes. The sizes of the diffuse radio structures and candidates range from 55 kpc to over 2 Mpc, with $P_{1.28GHz}$ radio power ranging from $10^{22}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ to greater than $10^{25}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. In-band radio spectral index estimates reveal revived radio plasma emissions that exhibit steep radio spectral indices down to $\alpha^{1656}_{908} \sim -3.5$. Mini-halos and their respective candidates are detected mainly in low-mass ($M_{500}$ $\leq$ 5$\times10^{14}$ M$_\odot$) and low-power ($P_{1.4GHz}$ $\leq$ $10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$) systems. We suggest the presence of a statistically significant correlation between the 1.4 GHz radio power and the cluster mass for mini-halo (and candidate) systems.</description>

      <title>The possible accretion discs of GN-z11 at redshift z = 10.6, MoM-z14 at z = 14.44 and other high redshift objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The JWST has enabled the discovery of Active Galactic Nuclei at high redshifts. The intrinsic UV spectrum of GN-z11 at redshift z = 10.6 has a spectral slope compatible with a standard accretion disc. By fitting a disc model to its spectrum, we find that the mass of the black hole must be above 1.6e7 Msun in order that it lies below the Eddington limit. We define this mass as the Eddington mass of the black hole. We note that the spectral shape is consistent with that of accreting stellar mass black holes sources in their soft state, for which no variability is expected. Mom-z14 is a more distant object at z = 14.44 and has a similar UV slope. Disc model-fitting gives a similar result but lower mass accretion rate. We also examine 3 further high redshift objects: GS z14-1, GHZ2 and GS-z11-1 at z = 13.86, 12.34 and 11.28, again obtaining similar results. If sub-Eddington accretion discs are indeed the origin of much of the UV emission from these objects, then the existence of massive black holes less than 440 and 290 Myr after the Big Bang point either to exceptional black hole seeds or to primordial black holes. The observed spread of UV spectral slopes in high redshift objects suggests that our approach may be relevant to about half of that population.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Photometric and Spectroscopic Labels in Classifying Dusty Stellar Sources Using Machine Learning in the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dusty stellar sources, including young stellar objects (YSOs) and evolved stars such as oxygen- and carbon-rich AGBs (OAGBs, CAGBs), red supergiants (RSGs), and post-AGB stars (PAGBs), play a key role in the chemical enrichment of galaxies. Photometric surveys in the Magellanic Clouds have cataloged many such objects, but their classifications are often uncertain due to overlaps between populations. We trained machine learning models on spectroscopically labeled data from the SAGE project and applied them to photometric catalogs. The spectroscopic model achieves about 89\% accuracy. Applied to photometric labels, nearly all OAGBs are correctly identified, and YSOs have a 95\% confirmation rate. In contrast, 16\% of CAGBs are reclassified as OAGBs, only 8\% of RSGs retain their labels, and fewer than half of PAGBs are confirmed. Photometry is thus reliable for abundant populations with distinct signatures, but spectroscopic confirmation remains essential for rare or overlapping stellar classes.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the Physical Properties of the Most Massive Galaxies in Clusters and their Protohalos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the evolution of the physical properties of the brightest galaxies in clusters and their protohalos from $z = 4$ to $z = 0$. Galaxy clusters and groups are identified using a halo-based group finder applied to the COSMOS2020 galaxy catalog. We construct evolution chains from low redshift clusters to higher redshift groups via the abundance matching method. The region of protohalos corresponding to clusters is defined on the basis of a characteristic radius. Our analysis encompasses a wide range of physical properties, including stellar mass, luminosity, star formation rate (SFR), specific star formation rate (sSFR), color ($g - r$), and stellar age. The evolution trends of the most massive galaxies (MMGs) in higher redshift groups and their corresponding protohalos are generally consistent. The stellar mass of MMGs shows an increasing trend across the entire redshift range. By considering the stellar mass growth as in-situ and ex-situ components, we find that in-situ star formation is efficient at $z \sim 2$, while ex-situ accretion becomes the primary growth channel at later times. At $z \gtrsim 2$, MMGs undergo an intense star formation phase of approximately $10^{2}\ \rm M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$, but are generally quenched at lower redshifts. Stellar age analysis suggests that most stars in MMGs formed at $z &gt; 2$. Our results present a coherent picture of MMG evolution across cosmic epochs, which is broadly consistent with the current theoretical framework of galaxy formation and evolution. Moreover, our work provides an intriguing way to trace galaxy evolution through the construction of cluster evolutionary chains in observations.</description>

      <title>Searching for the Largest Radio Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origins of radio astronomy and the discovery of the first radio galaxies are described which showed that the radio emission of active galaxies is very diverse in shape and can reach a size of many times their optical extent. In 1974 the first "giant" radio galaxy (GRG) was discovered, several times larger than any previously known one. Since 2012, when about 100 such GRGs larger than 1 Megaparsec (3.3 million light years) had been reported in literature, the author is performing his own search for GRGs and maintains a list of currently nearly 7000 GRGs, with more than half of these found on his own or his students at the Departamento de Astronom\'ia of Universidad de Guanajuato. An analysis of the very largest GRGs does not reveal any single property of these that would explain why they could grow to such large sizes. Recent advances in radio telescopes have led to vast amounts of images rich in GRGs, but due to the complexity of identifying their host galaxies only a fraction of these images can be searched with visual inspection by humans. Currently available machine algorithms and citizen science projects are prone to erroneous identifications and also leave unnoticed a substantial fraction of GRGs, such that supervision of the results by experts is essential to produce reliable results.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Aspects of Geophysical and Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics: Magnetic buoyancy instability in galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear evolution of the magnetic buoyancy instability in rotating and non-rotating gas layers using numerical solutions of non-ideal, isothermal MHD equations. The unstable magnetic field is either imposed through the boundary conditions or generated by an imposed $\alpha$-effect. In the case of an imposed field, we solve for the deviations from the background state with periodic boundary conditions. We also include cosmic rays as a weightless fluid which exerts a dynamically significant pressure and amplifies magnetic buoyancy, known as the Parker instability. Without rotation, systems with an imposed magnetic field evolve to a state with a very weak magnetic field, very different from the marginally stable eigenfunction, where the gas layer eventually becomes very thin as it is supported by thermal and turbulent pressures alone. However, this does not happen when the $\alpha$-effect maintains the magnetic field. Rotation fundamentally changes the development of the instability. A rotating system develops nonlinear oscillations, and the magnetic field direction changes even with an imposed magnetic field. We demonstrate that the cause is a secondary $\alpha$-effect at large altitudes as the gas flow produced by the instability becomes helical. The secondary $\alpha$-effect has an anomalous sign with the $\alpha$-coefficient being negative in the northern hemisphere, whereas the Coriolis force produces a positive $\alpha$. The mean-field dynamo action outside the original gas layer can also lead to a switch in the magnetic field parity from quadrupolar to dipolar. Altogether, the magnetic buoyancy instability and the mean-field dynamo action become separated as distinct physical effects in a nonlinear rotating system. We show that none of the assumptions used in analytic studies of the Parker instability is corroborated by numerical results.</description>

      <title>HST Proper Motions of Andromeda V and VI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the absolute proper motions of Andromeda V (And V) and Andromeda VI/Pegasus (And VI) dwarf galaxies, satellites of M31 located near its galactic plane. And VI is located the farthest from M31 among the six satellites with currently measured proper motions. A combination of ACS/WFC and WFPC2 exposures are utilized, spanning a 20-year time baseline.
  The WFPC2 exposures are processed using a recently developed deep-learning centering procedure as well as the most up-to-date astrometric calibration of the camera. We use on the order of 100 background galaxies per satellite to determine the correction to absolute proper motion. For And V we obtain an absolute proper motion of $(\mu_{\alpha} , \mu_{\delta})_{And\,V} = (26.1\pm21.5, -74.2\pm19.1)~\mu$as yr$^{-1}$. For And VI we obtain an absolute proper motion of $(\mu_{\alpha} , \mu_{\delta})_{And\,VI} = (-1.6\pm12.3, -52.6\pm11.2)~\mu$as yr$^{-1}$.
  Orbit integrations and analyses are made for these two Andromeda satellites using two estimates of both the mass and proper motion of M31. It is found that And V has an orbit consistent within errors with alignment with M31's disk and counter orbiting it, although this alignment is not well constrained. And VI's orbit is better determined and is very much consistent with co-orbiting with M31's disk. While currently at a distance of ~280 kpc from M31, And VI will remain beyond a distance of ~ 90 kpc from M31, thus experiencing low tidal influence compared to the other M31 satellites with known orbits. Both satellites are determined to be well-bound to M31.</description>

      <title>The Molecular Inventory of TMC-1 with GOTHAM Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral line surveys of the Taurus Molecular Cloud-1 (TMC-1) have led to the detection of more than 100 new molecular species, making it the most prolific source of interstellar molecular discoveries. These wide-band, high-sensitivity line surveys have been enabled by advances in telescope and receiver technology, particularly at centimeter and millimeter wavelengths. In this work, we present a statistical analysis of the molecular inventory of TMC-1 as probed by the GOTHAM large program survey from 3.9 to 36.4 GHz. To fully unlock the potential of the $\sim$29 GHz spectral bandwidth, we developed an automated pipeline for data reduction and calibration. We applied a Bayesian approach with Markov-Chain Monte Carlo fitting to the calibrated spectra and constrained column densities for 102 molecular species detected in TMC-1, including 75 main isotopic species, 20 carbon-13 substituted species, and seven deuterium-substituted species. This list of the detected gas-phase molecules is populated by unsaturated hydrocarbons, in stark contrast to the oxygen-rich organics found in sublimated ices around protostars. Of note, ten individual aromatic molecules were identified in the GOTHAM observations, contributing 0.011% of the gas-phase carbon budget probed by detected molecules when including CO and 6% when excluding CO. This work provides a reference set of observed gas-phase molecular abundances for interstellar clouds, offering a new benchmark for astrochemical theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Discovery of giant bubbles in the hot gaseous halo of the massive disk galaxy NGC 6286</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on archival Chandra X-ray observation, optical integral-field spectroscopic data and radio interferometric data, we report the discovery of a pair of giant bubbles (with a projected radius ~ 5 kpc) of ionized gas emerging from a highly inclined starburst galaxy NGC 6286, which is undergoing strong tidal interactions with its close neighbor NGC 6285. The bubbles are manifested by extraplanar soft X-ray emission with an X-shaped morphology, which is tightly co-spatial with $\rm H\alpha$ line emission and partially coincident with radio continuum. Low surface brightness diffuse X-ray emission can be traced out to ~ 90 kpc from the galactic center, revealing the presence of an extended hot gaseous halo. X-ray spectral analysis of the bubbles yields a gas temperature of $0.70^{+0.16}_{-0.18}$ keV, a relatively high value among known galactic-scale bubbles in the local universe. An average energy injection rate of ~ $10^{43}$ erg $\rm s^{-1}$ is required to inflate the bubbles within an estimated dynamical age of ~ 6.4 Myr. The multi-wavelength properties of the bubbles can be understood with the conventional superwind scenario, in which disk/halo gas is swept up into an expanding, cooling shell by a hot tenuous wind. The current starburst in NGC 6286 is energetically sufficient to launch the superwind, although we cannot rule out the possibility of a more violent AGN in the recent past as the driving source. Future high-resolution spectroscopic observations will help to shed light on the origin of the superwind and its role as an important galactic feedback process.</description>

      <title>The Shape of AGN-Driven Winds in the Seyfert Galaxy NGC 3516</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are known to drive ionized gas into their host galaxies, which may affect the evolution of both the central supermassive black holes and their hosts. In the case of NGC 3516, a nearby Seyfert 1 galaxy, these AGN winds have historically proven difficult to disentangle from galactic rotation. Using long slit spectroscopy at multiple position angles from the Hubble Space Telescope Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and the Apache Point Observatory Kitt Peak Ohio State Multi Object Spectrograph, we separate these kinematic components by fitting multiple Gaussians to the H{\alpha}, N II, H{\beta}, and O III emission lines along the slits. We present a biconical outflow model that agrees well with the observed kinematics of the outflowing gas in the narrow-line region (NLR). Our results indicate that the structure of the O III emission is explained by dusty gas spirals in the galactic disk that are illuminated by the ionizing bicone, which is viewed along one edge, resulting in the complex nuclear kinematics. Our view into the bicone edge is consistent with the multiple, deep components of ionized absorption lines seen in UV and X-ray spectra of NGC 3516. The observed turnover in the velocity of the NLR clouds matches that from a simple dynamical model of radiative acceleration by the AGN and gravitational deceleration by the AGN and galaxy, indicating they are the principal forces at work on the gas clouds. Finally, the model launch radii indicate that the outflowing clouds originate primarily from the inner dusty spirals near the AGN.</description>

      <title>Metallicity differences between Type IIP and stripped-envelope supernova environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents measurements of local HII environment metallicities of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) in hosts with redshifts up to z$\sim$0.025. 139 SNe environments were observed at the Isaac Newton Telescope and data of an additional 268 SNe environments were found in archival data of MUSE, MaNGA and PISCO. The project focuses on SNe with clean Type IIP, Type Ib and Type Ic classifications. We present the largest spectroscopic sample to date, evaluating environment metallicities of 79 Type Ib, 66 Type Ic and 93 Type IIP by N2 and O3N2 strong emission line methods. The cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the SN environment metallicities show Type Ib and Type Ic SNe tending towards higher metallicity than Type IIP. We test the null hypothesis that Type Ib/Ic/IIP progenitors are drawn from the same parent population. There is no statistically significant difference between progenitors of Type Ib and Type Ic SNe. However, when comparing Ib/Ic with IIP SNe, the tests indicate strong statistical significance (significance level better than 1\%) to reject our null hypothesis suggesting that the samples are not drawn from the same parent population. The significance is even higher (level better 0.1\%) when testing Type IIP vs. the combined Type Ib+Ic sample. These results support a different physical nature of Type IIP and Types Ib/Ic progenitors. It challenges stellar evolution and SNe explosion models to reproduce the distinct CDFs found.</description>

      <title>MARTA: The connection between chemical enrichment, feedback, and dust in a Wolf-Rayet galaxy at z${\sim}$2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the analysis of the stellar and interstellar medium (ISM) properties of MARTA-4327, a star-forming galaxy at z=2.224 observed by means of deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy in both medium- and high-resolution gratings as part of the "Measuring Abundances at high Redshift with the Te Approach" (MARTA) programme. We report one of the highest-redshift detections of the Wolf-Rayet (WR) blue and red bumps in a non-lensed system. The broad He ii${\lambda}$4686 feature is consistent with a young (${\sim 5-6}$ Myr) burst dominated by WN stars, although both SSP models and empirical templates struggle to reproduce the nitrogen stellar features at ${\approx}$ 4640 A. Based on the relative strength of the available optical stellar features, we disfavor the presence of very massive stars (VMS) in this system. Elemental abundance ratios such as Ne/O, N/O, and Ar/O align with observations of local star-forming galaxies (including WR galaxies), suggesting that any impact of the WR population on the chemical enrichment of the ISM is strongly localized. However, the gas-phase Fe/O ratio appears enhanced compared to local galaxies of similar metallicity, which we interpret as evidence for reduced Fe depletion onto dust grains, possibly linked to localized destruction in WR-driven wind environments. In addition, we detect a broad and blueshifted (~70 km/s) H${\alpha}$ component, revealing the presence of an ionized outflow with a mass loading factor ${\eta \sim 0.2}$. Finally, we report the robust detection of O I${\lambda}$8446 emission (among the first at high redshift), which we interpret as originating from Ly${\beta}$ fluorescence and/or collisional excitation in dense clumps. Overall, MARTA-4327 represents a unique system for studying the role of massive stars in shaping the ISM in galaxies at Cosmic Noon.</description>

      <title>Evidence for inverse Compton scattering in high-redshift Lyman-break galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio continuum emission provides a unique opportunity to study star-formation unbiased by dust obscuration. However, if radio observations are to be used to accurately trace star-formation to high redshifts, it is crucial that the physical processes which affect the radio emission from star-forming galaxies are well understood. While inverse Compton (IC) losses from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are negligible in the local universe, the rapid increase in the strength of the CMB energy density with redshift [$\sim (1+z)^4$] means that this effect becomes increasingly important at $z\gtrsim3$. Using a sample of ~200,000 high-redshift (3 &lt; z &lt; 5) Lyman-break galaxies selected in the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV), we have stacked radio observations from the MIGHTEE survey to estimate their 1.4-GHz flux densities. We find that for a given rest-frame UV magnitude, the 1.4-GHz flux density and luminosity decrease with redshift. We compare these results to the theoretical predicted effect of energy losses due to inverse Compton scattering off the CMB, and find that the observed decrease is consistent with this explanation. We discuss other possible causes for the observed decrease in radio flux density with redshift at a given UV magnitude, such as a top-heavy initial mass function at high redshift or an evolution of the dust properties, but suggest that inverse Compton scattering is the most compelling explanation.</description>

      <title>ALMA-IMF XX: Core fragmentation in the W51 high-mass star-forming region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of core fragmentation in the W51-E and W51-IRS2 protoclusters in the W51 high-mass star-forming region. The identification of core fragmentation is achieved by the spatial correspondence of cores and compact sources which are detected in the short (low resolution) and the long baseline (high resolution) continuum images with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Bands 3 (3 mm) and 6 (1.3 mm), respectively. We characterize the compact sources found in the long baseline image, and conclude that the compact sources are pre/protostellar objects (PPOs) that are either prestellar dust cores or dust disks or envelopes around protostars. The observed trend of core fragmentation in W51 is that (i) massive cores host more PPOs, (ii) bright PPOs are preferentially formed in massive cores, (iii) equipartition of flux between PPOs is uncommon. Thermal Jeans masses of parent cores are insufficient to explain the masses of their fragments, and this trend is more prominent at high-mass cores. We also find that unfragmented cores are large, less massive, and less dense than fragmented cores.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Milky Way halo populations at low metallicities using [Al/Fe]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentiating between in-situ and accreted populations in the Milky Way halo is a challenging task. Various kinematic spaces are often used to identify distinct accreted populations from the in-situ Milky Way halo. However, this approach has limitations, especially at low orbital energies. To overcome this ambiguity, elemental abundances are typically used to distinguish between the populations. Yet, for many elemental abundance ratios, it remains difficult to make this distinction at low metallicities. Aluminium abundances, on the other hand, have been empirically found to be an effective discriminator, allowing for the separation of accreted and in-situ populations in the Milky Way halo even at low metallicities and low orbital energies. We aim to test the discriminating power of [Al/Fe] using a well-studied sample of high-velocity stars in the solar vicinity with high-quality spectra. With these stars, we explore the [Al/Fe] ability to separate the in-situ from accreted stars and test its limitations. We derived aluminium abundances from the Al I 3944 and 3961 {\rm \AA} lines for 45 stars observed in two ESO programmes, along with 11 stars with archival spectra. Aluminium abundances were determined using 1D LTE and 1D NLTE spectral synthesis and line profile fitting. We confirm that the low-$\alpha$ population systematically has lower [Al/Fe] compared to high-$\alpha$ stars. Aluminium abundances, when carefully measured and NLTE effects taken into account, are effective tracers of the chemical history of halo stars. They provide an independent constraint on origin, complementing $\alpha$-element abundances trends, and help us to disentangle subpopulations within the accreted halo, especially in the metal-poor regime.</description>

      <title>Detection of a septuple stellar system in formation via disk fragmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar multiple systems play a pivotal role in cluster dynamics and stellar evolution, leading to intense astronomical phenomena like X-ray binaries, gamma-ray bursts, Type Ia supernova, and stellar mergers, which are prime sources of gravitational waves. However, their origin remains poorly understood. Here we report the discovery of a septuple protostellar system embedded in a Keplerian disk within the high-mass star-forming region NGC\,6334IN, with close separations of 181-461 AU. The stability analysis reveals that the disk surrounding the septuple system is dynamically unstable, indicating that the septuple system formed via disk fragmentation. Previous studies have typically found only 2--3 members forming via disk fragmentation in both low- and high-mass star-forming regions. Our findings provide compelling observational evidence that the fragmentation of a gravitationally unstable disk is a viable mechanism for the formation of extreme high-order multiplicity, confirming what was previously only a theoretical concept. The results shed new light on the formation of extreme high-order multiplicity in cluster environments.</description>

      <title>Large eddy simulations in astrophysics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review, the methodology of large eddy simulations (LES) is introduced and applications in astrophysics are discussed. As theoretical framework, the scale decomposition of the dynamical equations for compressible neutral fluids by means of spatial filtering is explained. For cosmological applications, the filtered equations in co-moving coordinates are formulated. Moreover, the decomposition is extended to magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). While energy is dissipated through numerical diffusivities in implicit large eddy simulations (ILES), explicit subgrid-scale (SGS) models are applied in LES to compute energy dissipation, mixing, and dynamo action due to numerically unresolved turbulent eddies. The most commonly used models in astrophysics are the Smagorinsky model, the hydrodynamical SGS turbulence energy equation model, and the non-linear structural model for both non-relativistic and relativistic MHD. Model validation is carried out a priori by testing correlations between model and data for specific terms or a posteriori by comparing turbulence statistics in LES and ILES. Since most solvers in astrophysical simulation codes have significant numerical diffusion, the additional effect of SGS models is generally small. However, convergence with resolution increases in some cases. A recent example is magnetic field amplification in binary neutron star mergers. For mesh-free codes, it has been shown that explicit modelling of turbulent diffusion of metals has a significant impact. Moreover, SGS models can help to compute the turbulent velocity dispersion consistently and to parameterize sub-resolution processes that are influenced by turbulence, such as the star formation efficiency in galaxy simulations.</description>

      <title>New kinematic map of the Milky Way bulge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinematics of the Milky Way bulge is known to be complex, reflecting the presence of multiple stellar components with distinct chemical and spatial properties. In particular, the bulge hosts a bar structure exhibiting cylindrical rotation, and a central velocity dispersion peak extending vertically along the Galactic latitude. However, due to severe extinction and crowding, observational constraints near the Galactic plane are sparse, underscoring the need for additional data to improve the completeness and accuracy of existing kinematic maps, and enabling robust comparison with dynamical models. This work aimed to refine the existing analytical models of the Galactic bulge kinematics by improving constraints in the innermost regions. We present updated maps of the mean velocity and velocity dispersion by incorporating new data near the Galactic plane. We combined radial velocity measurements from the GIBS and APOGEE surveys with both previously published and newly acquired MUSE observations. A custom\ -- developed Python\ -- based tool, {\tt PHOTfun}, was used to extract spectra from MUSE datacubes using PSF photometry based on DAOPHOT-II, with an integrated GUI for usability. The method included a dedicated extension, {\tt PHOTcube}, optimized for IFU datacubes. We applied Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques to identify and correct for foreground contamination and to derive new analytical fits for the velocity and velocity dispersion distributions. Our analysis included nine new MUSE fields located close to the Galactic plane, bringing the total number of mapped fields to 57 including ~23000 individual RV measured. The updated kinematic maps confirm the cylindrical rotation of the bulge and reveal a more boxy morphology in the velocity dispersion distribution, while preserving a well\ -- defined central peak.</description>

Abstract: Context. The mass-metallicity relation is a fundamental galaxy scaling law that has been extended to the faintest systems in the Local Group. The small scatter in this relation has been used to argue against severe tidal mass loss in Local Group satellites. Aims. We aim to show that the observed scatter is consistent with tidal mass loss seen in cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations, using simulated Milky Way-mass haloes from the Auriga project as an example. Methods. We analyze the stellar masses and mean metallicites for all accreted systems in Auriga. We compute these quantities two ways: considering the total system (bound + lost material) and only considering the bound progenitor. For both cases we fit the mass-metallicity relation and consider properties that drive scatter about these relations. Results. Accreted systems in Auriga have a tight relation between total stellar mass and metallicity, with scatter at a fixed stellar mass driven by age. When only considering the bound progenitor, the tidally evolved mass-metallicity relation has similar scatter ($\sim$0.27 dex) as observed for the Milky Way and M31 satellites ($\sim$0.23 dex). Satellites that lie above the relation have experienced substantial mass loss and typically have low metallicity for their total stellar mass. Even satellites that fall exactly on the evolved relation can lose over half of their stellar mass. Only satellites that are substantially below the evolved relation are reliably intact. Conclusions. The small scatter in the observed mass-metallicity relation is compatible with tidal mass loss. Based on their offset from the observed relation, we predict which Milky Way and M31 satellites have experienced substantial mass loss. These predictions will be tested with deep resolved-star observations from upcoming facilities including Rubin LSST, Euclid, and Roman.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Threads: Interlinking the Stellar Initial Mass Function from Star-Birth to Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar initial mass function (sIMF) describes the distribution of stellar masses formed in a single star formation event in a molecular cloud clump. It is fundamental to astrophysics and cosmology, shaping our understanding of unresolved stellar populations, galactic chemical enrichment and habitable zones, and black hole growth. This White Paper reviews studies on the core mass function, stellar multiplicity, and dynamical processes affecting sIMF determinations, as well as the link between star-forming clumps and the galaxy-wide IMF (gIMF). The evidence gleaned from observed systems for the dependency of the sIMF on the metallicity and density of the clump is portrayed. We examine evidence from gravitational lensing, stellar and gas kinematics, and spectral diagnostics to assess environmental dependencies of the gIMF. Theoretical perspectives provide further insights into the sIMF's variability. Beyond summarizing current knowledge, this work aims to establish a shared framework and define strategies for studying a variable IMF in the era of near-infrared integral-field spectroscopy, 30m-class telescopes and major space-based observatories.</description>

      <title>PRIMER &amp; JADES reveal an abundance of massive quiescent galaxies at 2 &lt; z &lt; 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We select a mass-complete sample of 225 quiescent galaxies at $z&gt;2$ with $M_* &gt; 10^{10}\ \mathrm{M}_\odot$ from PRIMER and JADES photometry spanning a total area of $\simeq320$ sq. arcmin. We restrict our analysis to only area with optical coverage in three $HST$ ACS filters, and provide evidence that this is important for selecting the most complete and clean samples of $z&gt;2$ massive quiescent galaxy candidates. We investigate the contamination in our sample via $JWST$ NIRSpec spectroscopic validation, $Chandra$ X-ray imaging, and ALMA interferometry, calculating a modest total contamination fraction of $12.9_{-3.1}^{+4.0}$ per cent. The removal of $HST$ data increases star-forming galaxy contamination by $\simeq10$ per cent and results in a $\simeq20$ per cent loss of candidates recovered from $HST$+$JWST$ data combined. We calculate massive quiescent galaxy number densities at $2&lt;z&lt;5$, finding values three times larger than pre-$JWST$ estimates, but generally in agreement with more-recent and larger-area $JWST$ studies. In comparison with galaxy evolution simulations, we find that most can now reproduce the observed massive quiescent galaxy number density at $2&lt;z&lt;3$, however they still increasingly fall short at $z&gt;3$, with discrepancies of up to $\simeq 1$ dex. We place 14 of our $z&gt;3$ massive quiescent galaxies on the BPT and WHaN diagrams using medium-resolution spectroscopic data from the EXCELS survey. We find a very high incidence of faint AGN in our sample, at a level of $\simeq50$ per cent, consistent with recent results at cosmic noon. This is interesting in the context of maintenance-mode feedback, which is invoked in many simulations to prevent quenched galaxies from re-igniting star formation. To properly characterise the evolution of early massive quiescent galaxies, greater coverage in optical filters and significantly larger spectroscopic samples will be required.</description>

      <title>The Ly$\alpha$ and Continuum Origins Survey. III. Investigating the link between galaxy morphology, merger properties and LyC escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the mechanisms and galaxy properties conducive to the emission and escape of ionizing (LyC) emission is necessary to accurately model the Epoch of Reionization, and identify the sources that powered it. The Lyman-alpha and Continuum Origins Survey (LaCOS) is the first program to obtain uniform, multi-wavelength sub-kpc imaging for a sufficiently large sample (42) of galaxies observed in LyC to enable statistically robust studies between LyC and resolved galaxy properties. Here, we characterize the morphology and galaxy merger properties of LaCOS galaxies and investigate their connection with the escape fraction of LyC emission $f_{esc}^{LyC}$. We find strong anti-correlations between $f_{esc}^{LyC}$ and radii ($r_{20}$, $r_{50}$, and $r_{80}$) measured in filters containing emission from star-forming regions, and with the asymmetry and clumpiness in F150LP, the bluest filter in our dataset, tracing UV continuum and Ly$\alpha$. We find that $\geq48\%$ of LaCOS galaxies are visually classified as galaxy mergers. In LyC-emitters, $\geq41\%$ of the galaxies are galaxy mergers, LyC-emitting mergers have $f_{esc}^{LyC}=0-16\%$. Galaxies robustly identified as mergers in LaCOS are all at advanced stages of interaction, close to coalescence. The $f_{esc}^{LyC}$ properties of mergers and non-mergers cannot be differentiated statistically, and we only find significant difference between the two populations in terms of their sizes, with mergers having larger sizes. We conclude that $f_{esc}^{LyC}$ tends to be larger in galaxies with a small number of compact, centrally-located, UV-emitting star-forming regions, that merger represent a sizable fraction of LyC-emitting samples at $z\sim0$, and that mergers at advanced stages of interaction can facilitate the escape of LyC photons from galaxies.</description>

      <title>Black hole accretion, star formation, and chemical evolution with PRIMA/FIRESS spectroscopy: toward the cosmic noon and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) will deliver the first comprehensive view of the obscured side of star formation and black hole accretion that dominates galaxy growth at cosmic noon. Around 90% of UV/optical photons from young stars and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are absorbed by dust and reradiated in the mid- to far-infrared, where key diagnostic lines trace accretion, star formation, and the physical and chemical conditions of galaxies. PRIMA will conduct blind spectroscopic surveys out to $z \sim 3-4$, enabling an unbiased determination of the co-evolution of star formation and black hole growth with cosmic time.
  We simulate a 200 arcmin$^2$ blind spectroscopic survey with FIRESS to measure star formation and black hole accretion rates for hundreds of galaxies at cosmic noon. Follow-up observations will provide relative N/O abundances and N/O-independent metallicities from multiple mid-IR lines. In its high-resolution mode, FIRESS will probe feedback processes through P-Cygni profiles, blueshifted OH absorption, and emission-line wings from highly ionised gas.
  Beyond cosmic noon, PRIMA will pioneer rest-frame mid-IR spectroscopy of galaxies during reionisation. Bright high-ionisation lines will constrain the primary ionising continuum of luminous Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters and low-metallicity AGN, revealing the conditions that shaped the first galaxies and black holes. By bridging the gap between optical and radio facilities, PRIMA will deliver an unobscured, end-to-end view of the processes driving galaxy evolution from the earliest epochs to the peak of activity.</description>

      <title>Beyond Hierarchical Mergers: Accretion-Driven Origins of Massive, Highly Spinning Black Holes in Dense Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GW231123, the most massive binary black hole (BBH) merger detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA, highlights the need to understand the origins of massive, high-spin stellar black holes (BHs). Dense star clusters provide natural environments for forming such systems, beyond the limits of standard massive star evolution to core collapse. While repeated BBH mergers can grow BHs through dynamical interactions (the so-called "hierarchical merger" channel), most star clusters with masses $\lesssim 10^6\,M_\odot$ have escape speeds too low to retain higher-generation BHs, limiting growth into or beyond the mass gap. In contrast, BH--star collisions with subsequent accretion of the collision debris can grow and retain BHs irrespective of the cluster escape speed. Using $N$-body (Cluster Monte Carlo) simulations, we study BH growth and spin evolution through this process and we find that accretion can drive BH masses up to at least $\sim200\,M_\odot$, with spins set by the details of the growth history. BHs up to about $150\,M_\odot$ can reach dimensionless spins $\chi \gtrsim 0.7$ via single coherent episodes, while more massive BHs form through multiple stochastic accretion events and eventually spin down to $\chi \lesssim 0.4$. These BHs later form binaries through dynamical encounters, producing BBH mergers that contribute up to $\sim10\%$ of all detectable events, comparable to predictions for the hierarchical channel. However, the two pathways predict distinct signatures: hierarchical mergers yield more unequal mass ratios, whereas accretion-grown BHs preferentially form near-equal-mass binaries. The accretion-driven channel allows dense clusters with low escape speeds, such as globular clusters, to produce highly spinning BBHs with both components in or above the mass gap, providing a natural formation pathway to GW231123-like systems.</description>

      <title>Six microlensing planets detected via sub-day signals during the 2023 -- 2024 season</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present analyses of six microlensing events: KMT-2023-BLG-0548, KMT-2023-BLG-0830, KMT-2023-BLG-0949, KMT-2024-BLG-1281, KMT-2024-BLG-2059, and KMT-2024-BLG-2242. These were identified in KMTNet data from the 2023 -- 2024 seasons, selected for exhibiting anomalies shorter than one day -- potential signatures of low-mass planetary companions. Detailed modeling of the light curves reveals that the anomalies in all six events are caused by planetary companions to the lenses. The brief durations of the anomalies are attributed to various factors: a low planet-to-host mass ratio (KMT-2024-BLG-2059, KMT-2024-BLG-2242), a wide planet-host separation (KMT-2023-BLG-0548), small and elongated caustics restricting the source's interaction region (KMT-2023-BLG-0830, KMT-2024-BLG-1281), and a partial caustic crossing (KMT-2023-BLG-0949). { For KMT-2023-BLG-0548, the Bayesian posterior distribution of the lens mass shows two distinct peaks: a low-mass solution indicating a sub-Jovian planet orbiting an M dwarf in the Galactic disk, and a high-mass solution suggesting a super-Jovian planet around a K-type dwarf in the bulge. KMT-2023-BLG-0830 hosts a Neptune-mass planet orbiting an M dwarf in the Galactic bulge. KMT-2023-BLG-0949 involves a super-Jovian planet orbiting a $\sim 0.5~M_\odot$ host located at $\sim 6$ kpc. KMT-2024-BLG-2059Lb is a super-Earth with a mass about seven times that of Earth, orbiting an early M dwarf of $\sim 0.5~M_\odot$. KMT-2024-BLG-1281L hosts a planet slightly more massive than Neptune, orbiting an M dwarf of $\sim 0.3~M_\odot$. The short timescale and small angular Einstein radius of KMT-2024-BLG-2242 suggest a $\sim 0.07~M_\odot$ primary, likely a brown dwarf, with a Uranus/Neptune-mass planet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05562v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present calibrated ATLAS photometry of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) from 28 March through 29 Aug 2025, obtained with the five-site, robotic ATLAS network in the c (420-650~nm), o (560-820~nm), and Teide w (420-720~nm) bands. Stacked difference images yield reliable light curves measured in four fixed apertures that capture the evolving coma. We observe 3I/ATLAS transitioning in color from red (c-o)~0.7 before MJD 60860 to near-solar (c-o)~0.3 after MJD 60870, coincident with the appearance of a prominent anti-solar tail. The absolute magnitude curve H(t) shows a slope break near MJD 60890 at r~3.3 au from -0.035 to -0.014 mag/day, or in terms of coma cross section as a function of heliocentric distance, r^{-3.9} to r^{-1.2}. We interpret the evolution as a shift from dust lifted from a reddened surface to production of small, optically bright icy grains and changing coma optical depth. We release the aperture photometry with geometry and uncertainties to enable cross-instrument synthesis of 3I/ATLAS activity and color evolution.</description>

      <title>Robust variational neural posterior estimation for simulation-based inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in neural density estimation have enabled powerful simulation-based inference (SBI) methods that can flexibly approximate Bayesian inference for intractable stochastic models. Although these methods have demonstrated reliable posterior estimation when the simulator accurately represents the underlying data generative process (GDP), recent work has shown that they perform poorly in the presence of model misspecification. This poses a significant problem for their use on real-world problems, due to simulators always misrepresenting the true DGP to a certain degree. In this paper, we introduce robust variational neural posterior estimation (RVNP), a method which addresses the problem of misspecification in amortised SBI by bridging the simulation-to-reality gap using variational inference and error modelling. We test RVNP on multiple benchmark tasks, including using real data from astronomy, and show that it can recover robust posterior inference in a data-driven manner without adopting tunable hyperparameters or priors governing the misspecification.</description>

      <title>Millimetre continuum from LBV stars and their environs. NIKA2 observations and Virtual Observatory data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-wavelength studies of their circumstellar environments around LBVs are essential to quantify their feedback at Galactic scales. Dominant emission mechanisms at millimetre wavelengths are, however, still poorly understood. Stellar winds, circumstellar dust, and ionised gas have not been explored together in the case of LBVs. We aim to study the millimetre continuum emission of Galactic LBVs to disclose the presence of these components, to describe their morphology and to measure their relevance in the mass and energy injection to the interstellar medium. We have used the NIKA2 continuum camera at the IRAM 30-m radio telescope to observe and analyse 1.15 and 2 mm continuum from the LBVs HD168607, HD168625, MN87, MN101, and G79.29+0.46. We used Virtual Observatory to complement our observations with archival data from optical, infrared, mm- and cm-wavelengths. With this information, we have built complete SEDs for the five sources, covering six decades of the electromagnetic spectrum. All targets except MN87 were detected at both wavelengths, with features including compact sources, extended nebular emission, shells, and unrelated background structures. Spectral indices of compact sources are consistent with thermal emission from stellar winds. We modelled the SEDs and successfully reproduced the emission from stellar photospheres, circumstellar dust, thermal stellar winds and enshrouding HII regions. Our models, in agreement with previous literature results, reveal the presence of unresolved hot dust very close to the stars and provide the first estimates for the fundamental parameters of MN101. This pilot study highlights the great potential of millimetre continuum studies of LBVs and possibly other evolved massive stars. The mm spectral window bridges the far-IR and radio regimes and can disclose the relative contribution of dust and free-free emission in this kind of sources.</description>

      <title>Probing baryonic feedback and cosmology with 3$\times$2-point statistic of FRBs and galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of galaxy formation processes on the matter power spectrum is uncertain and may bias cosmological parameters inferred by large-scale structure surveys. Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), through their dispersion measures (DMs) encoding the integrated column density of baryons, offer a unique window into the distribution of gas. In this work, we investigate the constraining power of a 3x2-point correlation statistic of FRB DMs and galaxies. We present the correlation formalism, derive covariance matrices and forecast signal-to-noise ratios and Fisher parameter constraints. Assuming host galaxy DM variance of 90 pc cm$^{-3}$, for $10^4$ ($10^5$) FRBs across 35% of the sky, the angular DM power spectrum is noise dominated at multipoles $\ell \gtrsim 20$ ($\ell \gtrsim 100$), which implies that the analysis can be conducted using arcmin-scale localizations, where the redshift distribution of the FRB population can be modeled through the FRB luminosity function or FRB position cross-correlations with galaxies. We show that while $10^4$ ($10^5$) FRB DM correlations can constrain cosmological parameters at 40-70% (30-40%) level, this is a factor of 2-3 (1.5-2) weaker than the precision attainable with galaxy clustering alone due to shot noise from the limited FRB number density, variance of the field and host DMs. On the contrary, feedback-sensitive scales are not accessible in galaxy surveys. We demonstrate that combining FRB DMs and galaxies auto- and cross-correlations in a 3x2-point analysis breaks feedback-cosmology degeneracies, yielding 10-18% (7-13%) precision on cosmological parameters and 3% (2%) constraints on feedback using $10^4$ ($10^5$) FRBs. This work positions the 3x2-point statistic of FRB DMs and galaxies as a promising multi-probe strategy, bridging the gap between constraining astrophysical feedback models and precise measurement of cosmological parameters.</description>

Abstract: Interstellar objects (ISOs) can become gravitationally bound to the solar system, enabling multiple observations. If these bound ISOs exist, they provide valuable opportunities to generalize models of planetesimal formation, composition, and ejection beyond our solar system. We explore two mechanisms for ISO capture: gravitational braking (primarily with Jupiter) and the Hills mechanism with the Sun. Using N-body simulations, we investigate ISO capture rates, ejection probabilities, and the resulting orbital elements. Our simulations suggest that approximately 10 ISOs may currently be bound to the solar system, with the vast majority captured through gravitational braking by Jupiter. These objects are bound by a Tisserand parameter with respect to Jupiter less than three, tend to have high eccentricities, semi-major axes larger than Jupiter's, and inclinations modestly biased toward the prograde direction. This region is sparsely populated by observed solar system objects. By comparing known solar system objects to the most probable orbital elements of our simulated ISOs, we identify 18 candidate objects in the current solar system population that may be bound ISOs captured by Jupiter. For the Hills mechanism, we find it to be a viable but less common capture pathway, typically producing isotropic inclinations and perihelia less than one au. Based on these characteristics, we identify seven additional candidate objects for ISOs captured through the Hills mechanism.</description>

      <title>Shadow Formation Conditions Beyond the Kerr Black Hole Paradigm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A compact object illuminated by background radiation produces a dark silhouette. The edge of the silhouette or shadow (alternatively, the apparent boundary or the critical curve) is commonly determined by the presence of the photon sphere (or photon shell in the case of rotating spacetime), corresponding to the maximum of the effective potential for null geodesics. While this statement stands true for Kerr black holes, here we remark that the apparent boundary (as defined by Bardeen) forms under a more general condition. We demonstrate that a shadow forms if the effective potential of null geodesics has a positive finite upper bound and includes a region where photons are trapped or scattered. Our framework extends beyond conventional solutions, including but not limited to naked singularities. Furthermore, we clarify the difference between the apparent boundary of a dark shadow and the bright ring on the screen of a distant observer. These results provide a unified theoretical basis for interpreting observations from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and guiding future efforts towards extreme-resolution observations of compact objects.</description>

Abstract: The recent discovery of a third interstellar object (ISO) 3I/ATLAS, following 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, has raised questions about the nature and origin of these enigmatic objects. With the Vera C. Rubin Observatory expected to discover dozens of new ISOs over the next decade, it is timely to use a classification scheme for their nature in the context of the recently proposed Loeb scale. Here, we provide a formalism for ranking ISOs quantitatively on the Loeb Scale in analogy to Sagan's formalism for mapping the Kardashev scale based on the energy output of technological civilizations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Constraints on a Population of Massive Interstellar Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate dynamical constraints on the population of large interstellar objects (ISOs) by combining encounter rate analysis, Eddington inversion, and Liouville mapping. Encounter rate scaling demonstrates that detections of kilometer-scale ISOs require flux enhancements beyond natural Maxwellian expectations. Using Eddington inversion, we show how steep density profiles imply phase-space biases consistent with strong gravitational focusing and we then develop a Liouville mapping formalism that propagates the interstellar velocity distribution inward under conservation of energy and angular momentum, revealing that low-angular momentum anisotropies can reproduce the observed size dependent detection rates. These results provide a self consistent dynamical framework for interpreting the observed population of ISOs and for assessing whether the required anisotropies arise from natural or artificial origins. The main results are framed in the context of the parameters for 3I/ATLAS, but the implications are general and go on to sharpen the distinction between natural dynamical mechanisms and potential artificial origins for ISOs.</description>

      <title>Carbon-Enhanced Dwarf Stars Are Predominantly a Halo Population</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reports a Galactic kinematical and dynamical analysis of 1003 main-sequence carbon stars. The sample is drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and cross-matched with Gaia DR3 to obtain 6-dimensional positions and velocities using a Bayesian framework. The study provides the first reliable distances for a large sample of dwarf carbon stars, which are then analyzed using both space motions and actions. The results are combined with dynamical equilibrium models for the three primary Galactic components to assign membership, finding that around 60 per cent belong to the halo, and over 30 per cent originate in the thick disc. Therefore, the results indicate dwarf carbon stars are dominated by a metal-poor halo population, and are thus an excellent resource for stellar archaeology. These stars remain on the main sequence and are relatively nearby, but atmospheric modelling is challenged by their cool effective temperatures and strong molecular features. In light of this, efforts should be made to improve C/O &gt;1 atmospheric modelling, as the subset of low-mass dwarf carbon stars may numerically dominate the Galactic population of carbon-enriched, metal-poor stars.</description>

Abstract: The 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen is a promising probe of the early Universe, yet extracting astrophysical parameters from its power spectrum remains a major challenge. We present a beginner-friendly PyTorch pipeline for Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (MNRE), a Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) method that bypasses explicit likelihoods. Using 21cmFAST simulations, we show that MNRE can recover key astrophysical parameters such as the ionizing efficiency $\zeta$ and X-ray luminosity $L_X$ directly from power spectra. Our implementation prioritizes transparency and accessibility, offering a practical entry point for new researchers in 21-cm cosmology.</description>

      <title>Stochastic modelling of cosmic-ray sources for Galactic diffuse emissions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galactic diffuse emissions in gamma rays and neutrinos arise from interactions of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium and probe the cosmic-ray intensity away from the Solar system. Model predictions for those are influenced by the properties of cosmic-ray sources, and understanding the impact of cosmic-ray sources on Galactic diffuse emissions is key for interpreting measurements by LHAASO, Tibet AS-gamma, IceCube, and the upcoming SWGO. We consider supernova remnants as prototypical cosmic-ray sources and study the impact of their discreteness on the Galactic diffuse emissions in different source injection and near-source transport models in a stochastic Monte Carlo study. Three lessons exemplify the results of our simulations: First, the distributions of Galactic diffuse emission intensities can be described by a mixture model of stable laws and Gaussian distributions. Second, the maximal deviations caused by discrete sources across the sky depend on energy, reaching typically tens of percent in burst-like and energy-dependent escape scenarios but order unity or larger in a time-dependent diffusion scenario. Third, the additional model uncertainty from source stochasticity is subdominant in burst-like and energy-dependent escape scenarios, but becomes sizeable above some tens of TeV in the time-dependent diffusion scenario, where it can help reconcile model predictions with LHAASO measurements. With increased spatial resolution, especially at energies beyond tens of TeV, measurements of Galactic diffuse emissions can be expected to constrain source models and locate cosmic ray sources.</description>

      <title>Revealing Unresolved White Dwarf-Main Sequence Binaries using Gaia DR3 and GALEX I. A Volume limited study of 100 pc</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Understanding the demographics of white dwarf - main sequence (WDMS) binaries is key to uncovering the formation of various stellar exotica and refining the details of binary stellar evolution. Despite several dedicated efforts to identify unresolved WDMS binaries, their population remains incomplete, even within a 100 pc volume-limited sample. Aims. This study aims to identify WDMS binaries hidden within the main sequence of the optical color-magnitude diagram (CMD), improving the completeness of WDMS binaries within a volume-limited sample of 100 pc. Methods. We use NUV-optical CMDs to distinguish unresolved WDMS binaries from the rest of the populations. High-precision astrometric and photometric data from Gaia DR3 and NUV data from GALEX GR6/7 are combined to construct CMDs. Using the binary spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting algorithm within the Virtual Observatory SED Analyzer (VOSA) tool, we estimate stellar parameters such as effective temperature, bolometric luminosity, and radii. The masses of the WD companions are determined using white dwarf evolutionary models. As we use the sources which are detected only in NUV band of GALEX, this study directly complements to majority of the previous studies. Results. We identify 596 WD-MS binary candidates within 100 pc, with 497 newly reported. Our method predominantly identifies binaries with cooler WD companions (median ~7,000 K) compared to previous studies. The WD masses range from ~0.2 and 1.3 M$_\odot$, and most MS companions are of M spectral type.</description>

      <title>Black-hole mass estimation through accretion disk spectral fitting for high-redshift blazars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-redshift ($z&gt;2$) blazars, with relativistic jets aligned toward us, probe the most powerful end of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) population. We aim at determining the black hole masses and mass accretion rates of high-$z$ blazars in a common framework that utilizes a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting method and the Shakura-Sunayev multi-temperature accretion disk model, accounting also for attenuation due to neutral hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM). We compiled a sample of 23 high-redshift blazars from the literature with publicly available infrared-to-ultraviolet photometric data. We performed a Bayesian fit to the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the accretion disk, accounting for upper limits, and determined the black hole masses and mass accretion rates with their uncertainties. We also examined the impact of optical-ultraviolet attenuation due to gas in the IGM. We find that neglecting IGM attenuation in SED fits leads to systematically larger black-hole mass estimates and correspondingly lower Eddington ratios, with the bias becoming more severe at higher redshift. Our MCMC fits yield median black-hole masses in the range $\sim (10^{8}-10^{10})\,M_{\odot}$ and a broad distribution of median Eddington ratios ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.04 - 1$). Comparison with previous literature shows no clear method-dependent systematic offsets, although individual mass estimates can differ by up to a factor of a few. We also demonstrate that assumptions about black-hole spin introduce a systematic degeneracy. This work is to our knowledge the first systematic study to model the accretion-disk emission of a large sample of high-$z$ blazars within a single, consistent statistical framework. Our results emphasize the importance of accounting for IGM attenuation and of using uniform fitting methods when comparing disk-based black hole estimates across samples.</description>

Abstract: A method for investigating the sensitivity of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) I band magnitude $M_I$ to stellar input physics is presented.~We compute a grid of $\sim$125,000 theoretical stellar models with varying mass, initial helium abundance, and initial metallicity, and train a machine learning emulator to predict $M_I$ as a function of these parameters.~First, our emulator can be used to theoretically predict $M_I$ in a given galaxy using Monte Carlo sampling.~As an example, we predict $M_I = -3.87^{+0.11}_{-0.08}$ in the Large Magellanic Cloud (F20).~Second, our emulator enables a direct comparison of theoretical predictions for $M_I$ with empirical calibrations to constrain stellar modeling parameters using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.~We demonstrate this by using empirical TRGB calibrations to obtain new independent measurements of the metallicity in three galaxies.~We find $\log_{10}(Z)=-2.167^{+0.404}_{-0.492}$ and $\log_{10}(Z)=-2.098^{+0.388}_{-0.528}$ in the Large Magellanic Cloud (F20 and Y19 respectively), $\log_{10}(Z)=-2.146^{+0.400}_{-0.505}$ in NGC 4258, and $\log_{10}(Z)=-2.143^{+0.401}_{-0.508}$ in $\omega$-Centauri.~The LMC and NGC 4258 measurements are consistent with other measurements within $&lt;1\sigma$ errors, and the $\omega$-Centauri measurement are within $&lt;2\sigma$ errors.</description>

Abstract: Nebular spectral lines provide insight into the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) and the ionizing radiation within galaxies. The presence of high-energy ionization lines such as \heii indicates the existence of ionizing photons with energies exceeding the second ionization energy of helium ($54 \mathrm{eV})$. There is an enigma surrounding the origin of these lines observed in star-forming galaxies because stellar ionization cannot account for such high energy emission. This paper proposes that supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) may produce the \heii ionization lines in star-forming galaxies. We model the spectra of SSSs using blackbody radiation and add them to the young stellar population spectra to represent the overall spectra of galaxies. Using a photoionization model, we predict the resulting \heiioptic and \hbeta line fluxes and inspect the contribution of SSSs to the elevation of the \heiioptic/\hbeta ratio in star-forming galaxies, both at low and high redshifts. We find that incorporating a blackbody with temperatures between $kT = 10-100 \mathrm{eV}$ can boost the \heiioptic/\hbeta line ratio to the levels observed in local galaxies by SDSS and in early galaxies by NIRSpec. This blackbody temperature range aligns with the observed temperatures of SSSs. The number of SSSs in spiral galaxies listed in Chandra catalogues, and our estimates of the total population, confirms that SSSs are promising candidates for the source of the \heii ionization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stellar halo of the Milky Way comprises an abundance of chemical signatures from accretion events and \textit{in-situ} evolution, that form an interweaving tapestry in kinematic space. To untangle this, we consider the mixtures of chemical information, in a given region of integral of motion space, as a variant of the blind source separation problem using non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF). Specifically, we examine the variation in [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], and [Al/Fe] distributions of APOGEE DR17 stars across the $(E,L_z)$ plane of the halo. When 2 components are prescribed, the NMF algorithm splits stellar halo into low- and high-energy components in the $(E,L_z)$ plane which approximately correspond to the accreted and \textit{in-situ} halo respectively. We use these components to define a boundary between the \textit{in-situ} and the accreted stellar halo, and calculate their fractional contribution to the stellar halo as a function of energy, galactocentric spherical radius ($r$), height ($z$), and galactocentric cylindrical radius ($R$). Using a stellar halo defined by kinematic cuts, we derive a boundary in $(E,L_z)$ space where the halo transitions from \textit{in-situ} dominated to accretion dominated. Spatially, we find that this transition happens at $(r,z,R) \approx (8.7, 3.0, 8.1)$ kpc. We find that between 34\% to 53\% of the stellar halo's content is of accreted origin. Upon prescribing more components to the NMF model, we find evidence for overlapping chemical evolution sequences. We examine features within these components that resemble known substructures in the halo, such as \textit{Eos} and \textit{Aurora}.</description>

      <title>Weak lensing constraints on the stellar-to-halo mass relation of galaxy groups with simulation-informed scatter</title>

Abstract: Understanding the scaling relation between baryonic observables and dark matter halo properties is crucial not only for studying galaxy formation and evolution, but also for deriving accurate cosmological constraints from galaxy surveys. In this paper, we constrain the stellar-to-halo mass relation of galaxy groups identified by the Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey, using weak lensing signals measured by the Kilo-Degree Survey. We compare our measured scaling relation with predictions from the FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulations and the L-Galaxies semi-analytical model. We find a general agreement between our measurements and simulation predictions for halos with masses ${\gtrsim}10^{13.5}\ h_{70}^{-1}{\rm M}_{\odot}$, but observe slight discrepancies with the FLAMINGO simulations at lower halo masses. We explore improvements to the current halo model framework by incorporating simulation-informed scatter in the group stellar mass distribution as a function of halo mass. We find that including a simulation-informed scatter model tightens the constraints on scaling relations, despite the current data statistics being insufficient to directly constrain the variable scatter. We also test the robustness of our results against different statistical models of miscentring effects from selected central galaxies. We find that accounting for miscentring is essential, but our current measurements do not distinguish among different miscentring models.</description>

      <title>Radiation-driven dusty outflows from early galaxies</title>

Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered an overabundance of UV-bright ($M_{\rm UV} \lesssim -20$), massive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 10$ in comparison to pre-JWST theoretical predictions. Among the proposed interpretations, such excess has been explained by negligible dust attenuation conditions following radiation-driven outflows launched by young stars when a galaxy goes through a super-Eddington phase. Dust opacity decreases the classical Eddington luminosity by a (boost) factor $A$, thus favoring the driving of outflows by stellar radiation in compact, initially dusty galaxies. Here, we compute $A$ as a function of the galaxy stellar mass, gas fraction, galaxy size, and metallicity (a total of 8 parameters). We find that the main dependence is on metallicity and, for the fiducial model, $A \sim 1800(Z/Z_\odot)/(1+N_{\rm H}/10^{23.5}\, {\rm cm^2})$. We apply such results to 20 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at $z \gtrsim 10$ and evaluate their modified Eddington ratio. We predict that three galaxies are in the outflow phase. Their outflows have relatively low velocities ($60 -100 \,{\rm km\ s^{-1}}$), implying that they are unlikely to escape from the system. For the remaining 17 galaxies that are not currently in the outflow phase, we calculate the past evolution of the modified Eddington ratio from their star formation history. We find that 15 of them experienced an outflow phase prior to observation during which they effectively displaced their dust to larger radii. Thus, dusty outflows driven by stellar radiation appear to contribute to the observed bright UV galaxies at $z &gt; 10$.</description>

      <title>FOGGIE X: Characterizing the Small-Scale Structure of the CGM and its Imprint on Observables</title>

Abstract: One of the main unknowns in galaxy evolution is how gas flows into and out of galaxies in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Studies observing the CGM in absorption using multiple or extended background objects suggest a high degree of variation on relatively small ($\lesssim 1$ kpc) spatial scales. Similarly, high-resolution simulations generally exhibit small-scale substructure in the gas around galaxies. We examine the small-scale structure of the $z = 1$ CGM using simulations from the FOGGIE (Figuring Out Gas &amp; Galaxies in Enzo) project. We select gaseous substructures ("clumps") by their local overdensity and investigate their physical properties, including temperature, metallicity, and kinematics with respect to the galaxy and the nearby surroundings. FOGGIE resolves clumps down to sphericalized radii $R \sim 0.25$ kpc at $z = 1$. The distribution of clumps peaks at $\sim 10^5$ $\rm M_{\odot}$ and $10^{4}$ K, consistent with relatively condensed, cool gas with a slight preference for inflow-like velocities. Many clumps show internal temperature and density variations, and thus internally varying ionization levels for key diagnostic ions such as HI, MgII, and OVI. The average metallicity in clumps is about a factor 1.5--2$\times$ lower in metallicity than nearby gas, suggesting that the metals are not well-mixed between structured and diffuse CGM, which may have implications for observational metallicity estimations of dense CGM clouds. We estimate the survivability of CGM clumps and find that structures larger than 0.5 kpc are generally long-lived. Finally, we qualitatively compare the simulated cloud properties to Milky Way high-velocity clouds.</description>

      <title>Star Formation Rates, Metallicities, and Stellar Masses on kpc-scales in TNG50</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integral field units (IFU) have extended our knowledge of galactic properties to kpc (or, sometimes, even smaller) patches of galaxies. These scales are where the physics driving galaxy evolution (feedback, chemical enrichment, etc.) take place. Quantifying the spatially-resolved properties of galaxies, both observationally and theoretically, is therefore critical to our understanding of galaxy evolution. To this end, we investigate spatially-resolved scaling relations within galaxies of $M_\star&gt;10^{9.0}$ at $z=0$ in IllustrisTNG. We examine both the resolved star-forming main sequence (rSFMS) and the resolved mass-metallicity relation (rMZR) using $1~{\rm kpc}\times1~{\rm kpc}$ maps. We find that the rSFMS in IllustrisTNG is well-described by a power-law, but is significantly shallower than the observed rSFMS. However, the disagreement between the rSFMS of IllustrisTNG and observations is likely driven by an overestimation of AGN feedback in IllustrisTNG for the higher mass hosts. Conversely, the rMZR for IllustrisTNG has very good agreement with observations. Furthermore, we argue that the rSFMS is an indirect result of the Schmidt-Kennicutt (SK) law and local gas relation, which are both independent of host galaxy properties. Finally, we expand upon a localized leaky-box model to study the evolution of idealized spaxels and find that it provides a good description of these resolved relations. The degree of agreement, however, between idealized spaxels and simulated spaxels depends on the `net' outflow rate for the spaxel, and the IllustrisTNG scaling relations indicate a preference for a low net outflow rate.</description>

      <title>Fe Abundances of Early Galaxies at $z=9-12$ Derived with Deep JWST Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11457v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive Fe-abundance ratios of 7 galaxies at $z=9-12$ with $-22&lt;M_{\mathrm{UV}}&lt;-19$ whose JWST/NIRSpec spectra achieve very high signal-to-noise ratios, $\mathrm{SNR}=60-320$, at the rest-frame UV wavelength. We fit stellar population synthesis model spectra to these JWST spectra, masking out nebular emission lines, and obtain Fe-abundance ratios of $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}=-1-0$ dex for 5 galaxies and upper limits of $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}\sim-2-0$ dex for 2 galaxies. We compare these [Fe/H] values with the oxygen abundances of these galaxies ($7.4&lt;12+\log{\mathrm{(O/H)}}&lt;8.4$) in the same manner as previous studies of $z\sim2-6$ galaxies, and derive oxygen-to-iron abundance ratios [O/Fe]. We find that 2 out of 7 galaxies, GS-z11-0 and GN-z11, show Fe enhancements relative to O ($\mathrm{[O/Fe]}&lt;0$ dex), especially GS-z11-0 ($z=11.12$) with a Fe enhancement ($\mathrm{[O/Fe]}=-0.68_{-0.55}^{+0.37}$ dex) beyond the solar-abundance ratio at $\sim2\sigma$. Because, unlike GS-z11-0, GN-z11 ($z=10.60$) may be an AGN, we constrain [O/Fe] via FeII emission under the assumption of AGN and confirm that the Fe enhancement is consistent even in the case of AGN. While [O/Fe] values of most galaxies are comparable to those of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) yields, the Fe enhancements of GS-z11-0 and GN-z11 are puzzling. We develop chemical evolution models, and find that the Fe enhancements in GS-z11-0 and GN-z11 can be explained by 1) pair-instability supernovae/bright hypernovae with little contribution of CCSNe or 2) Type-Ia supernovae with short delay time ($\sim30-50$ Myr) with a top-light initial mass function.</description>

      <title>Quasar lifetime measurements from extended Ly$\alpha$ nebulae at $z\sim 6$</title>

Abstract: The existence of billion-solar-mass black holes hosted in luminous quasars within the first gigayear of cosmic history poses a challenge to our understanding of supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. The problem is further exacerbated by the very short quasar lifetimes of $t_{\rm Q}\lesssim 10^6$ years, as derived from the extent of their proximity zone (PZ) sizes observed in the quasars' rest-UV spectra. However, the quasar lifetime estimates based on the extents of the proximity zones may be underestimated, as time-variable obscuration effects might have limited the quasars' emission along our sightline in the past. In this work, we present independent quasar lifetime measurements for six quasars at $z \sim 6$ leveraging the extended nebular emission perpendicular to our line-of-sight. We use observations from the Very Large Telescope/Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) to search for extended Ly$\alpha$ emission in the circumgalactic medium around quasars with small proximity zones and estimate their lifetimes as the light travel time between the SMBH and the outer edge of the nebula. We find agreement between the independent lifetime estimates. For one object we find a proximate absorption system prematurely truncating the extent of the quasar's proximity zone, which thus results in an expected discrepancy between the lifetime estimates. Our results provide further evidence that the quasars' current accretion episode has only recently begun, challenging our models of SMBH growth.</description>

Abstract: Observations and high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations indicate that massive star clusters form through a complex hierarchical assembly. We use simulations including post-Newtonian dynamics (the BIFROST code) and stellar evolution (the SEVN module) to investigate this collisional assembly. With a full initial stellar mass function, we study the effect of initial binary, triple and massive single stars (450 $M_\odot$) on the assembly, structure, and kinematics of massive ($M_\mathrm{cl}\sim10^6 M_\odot$, $N=1.8 \times 10^6$) star clusters. Simultaneously, intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs), potential seeds for supermassive black holes, can form and grow in our models by stellar collisions, tidal disruption events (TDEs) and black hole (BH) mergers. At a fixed cluster mass, stellar multiplicity or a high mass limit increase the numbers (up to $\sim$ 10) and masses (up to $10^4 M_\odot$) of the formed IMBHs within the first 10 Myr of cluster evolution. The TDE rates peak at $\Gamma_\mathrm{tde}\sim 5 \times 10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$ after IMBH formation at $\sim 2$ Myr. In all simulations, we find gravitational wave driven mergers involving stellar BHs and IMBHs. Initial multiplicity or a high mass limit also result in IMBH-IMBH mergers. The IMBH masses correlate with the initial cluster masses, surface densities and velocity dispersions approximately as $M_\bullet \propto M_\mathrm{cl}$, $M_\bullet\propto\Sigma_\mathrm{h}^\mathrm{3/2}$ and $M_\bullet\propto\sigma^\mathrm{3}$. Our results suggest the dense $z\sim10$ star clusters recently observed by the James Webb Space Telescope host IMBHs with masses above $M_\bullet \gtrsim 10^4 M_\odot$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06696v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the detection of a gravitationally lensed galaxy by the nearby spiral galaxy CGCG 012-070 ($z = 0.048$) using Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations with the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) instrument on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The lensed galaxy is identified through the flux distributions of emission lines in the rest-frame optical, consistent with a source located at a redshift of $z\sim2.89$. The system is detected in [O III]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$, H$\beta$, and H$\alpha$ emission lines, exhibiting line ratios typical of a star-forming galaxy. The emission-line flux distributions reveal three distinct components, which are modeled using an elliptical power-law (EPL) mass profile for the lens galaxy. This model provides a good characterization of the source and reveals a disturbed star-forming morphology consistent with those of galaxies at cosmic noon. This serendipitous discovery of a rare low-redshift strong lens highlights the critical role of IFU observations in expanding the lens census and advancing our understanding of galaxy mass profiles and evolution.</description>

      <title>Semi-supervised classification of stars, galaxies and quasars using K-means and random-forest approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14072v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classifying stars, galaxies, and quasars is essential for understanding cosmic structure and evolution; however, the vast data from modern surveys make manual classification impractical, while supervised learning methods remain constrained by the scarcity of labeled spectroscopic data. We aim to develop a scalable, label-efficient method for astronomical classification by leveraging semi-supervised learning (SSL) to overcome the limitations of fully supervised approaches. We propose a novel SSL framework combining K-means clustering with random forest classification. Our method partitions unlabeled data into 50 clusters, propagates labels from spectroscopically confirmed centroids to 95% of cluster members, and trains a random forest on the expanded pseudo-labeled dataset. We applied this to the CPz catalog, containing multi-survey photometric and spectroscopic data, and compared performance with a fully supervised random forest. Our SSL approach achieves F1 scores of 98.8%, 98.9%, and 92.0% for stars, galaxies, and quasars, respectively, closely matching the supervised method with F1 scores of 99.1%, 99.1%, and 93.1%, while outperforming traditional color-cut techniques. The method demonstrates robustness in high-dimensional feature spaces and superior label efficiency compared to prior work. This work highlights SSL as a scalable solution for astronomical classification when labeled data is limited, though performance may be degraded in lower dimensional settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of dark matter annihilation on objects with masses close to the sub-stellar limit, finding that the minimum mass for stable hydrogen burning is larger than the $\sim0.075 M_\odot $ value predicted in the Standard Model. Below this limit, cooling brown dwarfs evolve into stable dark matter-powered objects that we name dark dwarfs. The timescale of this transition depends on the ambient dark matter density $\rho_{\rm DM}$ and circular velocity $v_{\rm DM}$ but is independent of the dark matter mass. We predict a population of dark dwarfs close to the galactic center, where the dark matter density is expected to be $\rho_{\rm DM}\gtrsim 10^{3}$ GeV/cm$^3$. At larger galactic radii the dark matter density is too low for these objects to have yet formed within the age of the universe. Dark dwarfs retain their initial lithium-7 in mass ranges where brown/red dwarfs would destroy it, providing a method for detecting them.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Tidal Disruption Events and Changing-look Active Galactic Nuclei via Variation of Mid-infrared Color</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10053v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At present, there is a lack of effective probes to distinguish between mid-infrared (MIR) outbursts induced by tidal disruption events (TDEs) and changing-look active galactic nuclei (CLAGNs) based on only MIR data. Here, we propose that the time variation of MIR color (K-corrected W1-W2 after subtracting the quiescent fluxes) is a promising probe. With an optically selected sample containing TDEs, ambiguous nuclear transients (ANTs), and CLAGNs, we studied the MIR color variation of their MIR counterparts using NEOWISE-R data. We found that the MIR color of TDEs and ANTs turns red faster than CLAGNs during the rising phase, and TDEs have a redder color than ANTs at the earliest phase. The former may be caused by the difference between the ultraviolet light curves of TDEs/ANTs and CLAGNs, or be related to no or relatively weak underlying AGN in TDEs/ANTs, while the latter may be related to the difference in the dust geometry. Based on color variation rate, we selected high-probability TDE, ANT, and CLAGN candidates from MIR outbursts in samples of Jiang et al. (2021) and Masterson et al. (2024). We found that both samples are mixtures of TDEs/ANTs and CLAGNs. For MIR outbursts whose hosts are not Seyfert galaxies, we estimated that $\sim50\%-80\%$ are TDEs and inferred a rate of infrared TDEs of $1.5-2.8\times10^{-5}$ galaxy$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparable with that of optical TDEs. The rest are CLAGNs, suggesting the presence of weak AGNs that cannot be identified using common diagnoses. We predicted that with our method, a large amount of dust-obscured TDEs could be selected from future infrared surveys with higher data quality and cadence.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Eddington and Malmquist Biases in Latent-Inclination Inference of the Tully-Fisher Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10589v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Tully-Fisher relation is a vital distance indicator, but its precise inference is challenged by selection bias, statistical bias, and uncertain inclination corrections. This study presents a Bayesian framework that simultaneously addresses these issues. To eliminate the need for individual inclination corrections, inclination is treated as a latent variable with a known probability distribution. To correct for the distance-dependent Malmquist bias arising from sample selection, the model incorporates Gaussian scatter in the dependent variable, the distribution of the independent variable, and the observational selection function into the data likelihood. To mitigate the statistical bias -- termed the ``general Eddington bias'' -- caused by Gaussian scatter and the non-uniform distribution of the independent variable, two methods are introduced: (1) analytical bias corrections applied to the dependent variable before likelihood computation, and (2) a dual-scatter model that accounts for Gaussian scatter in the independent variable within the likelihood function. The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated using simulated datasets. By rigorously addressing selection and statistical biases in a latent-variable regression analysis, this work provides a robust approach for unbiased distance estimates from standardizable candles, which is critical for improving the accuracy of Hubble constant determinations.</description>

      <title>JWST Discovery of a High-Redshift Tidal Disruption Event Candidate in COSMOS-Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13248v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rates and properties of tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide valuable insights into their host galaxy central stellar densities and the demographics of their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). TDEs have been observed only at low redshifts ($z \lesssim 1$), due to the difficulty in conducting deep time-domain surveys. In this work, we present the discovery of a high-redshift TDE candidate, HZTDE-1, in the COSMOS-Web survey with JWST's NIRCam, using a novel selection technique based on color and morphology. We first outline a methodology for identifying high-z TDEs in deep infrared imaging surveys, leveraging their unique spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and morphologies of these transients. We apply this technique to COSMOS-Web in filters F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W, and identify HZTDE-1, a transient point source relative to archival UltraVISTA infrared observations. If we assume it is a TDE, we estimate its photometric redshift to be $z=5.02^{+1.32}_{-1.11}$. HZTDE-1 cannot be explained by reasonable supernova or AGN models. However, we cannot rule out a superluminous supernova at $z\gtrsim3$. If confirmed with follow-up observations, HZTDE-1 would represent the highest-redshift TDE discovery to date, and would suggest an enhancement of the TDE rate in the high-redshift universe. Our method, which can be applied to future deep surveys with JWST and Roman, offers a pathway to identify TDEs at $z&gt;4$ and probe black hole demographics at early cosmic times.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scheduled for launch in 2030, the enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarization (eXTP) telescope is a Chinese space-based mission aimed at studying extreme conditions and phenomena in astrophysics. eXTP will feature three main payloads: Spectroscopy Focusing Arrays (SFAs), Polarimetry Focusing Arrays (PFAs), and a Wide-field Camera (W2C). This white paper outlines observatory science, incorporating key scientific advances and instrumental changes since the publication of the previous white paper [1]. We will discuss perspectives of eXTP on the research domains of flare stars, supernova remnants, pulsar wind nebulae, cataclysmic variables, X-ray binaries, ultraluminous X-ray sources, AGN, and pulsar-based positioning and timekeeping.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Time-Domain and Multi-Messenger Science with eXTP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this new era of time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy, various new transients and new phenomena are constantly being discovered thanks to the rapid advances in observations, which provide the excellent opportunity to study the physics in the extreme environments. The enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry mission (eXTP), planned to be launched in 2030, has several key advantages, including advanced polarimetry, high sensitivity &amp; large effective area, and wide energy range coverage, which make it a groundbreaking project in high-energy astrophysics. In this article, we briefly introduce the potential time-domain and multi-messenger targets for eXTP, including gravitational-wave (GW) counterparts, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), magnetars and fast radio bursts (FRBs), tidal disruption events (TDEs), supernovae, high energy neutrinos and TeV active galactic nucleus (AGNs), and so on. We discuss the advantages of future eXTP observations for detecting these sources, their detection capabilities, the abilities to distinguish theoretical models, and their applications in gravity and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Periapsis shift in the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the periapsis shift of timelike bound orbits in the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime, which is an exact, static, axisymmetric, and vacuum solution characterized by the deformation parameter $\gamma$, including the Schwarzschild spacetime as $\gamma = 1$. We newly derive the formula for the periapsis shift by the post-Newtonian (PN) expansion and show that the quadrupole moment contributes to the periapsis shift apparently as in the 2PN order. Applying this formula, we show that the non-dimensional quadrupole moment $\tilde{M}_2$ of the supermassive compact object at Sagittarius A* is constrained to $\tilde{M}_2 \lesssim 9.7 \times 10^2$ or equivalently $\gamma \gtrsim 1.9 \times 10^{-2}$ from observational data on S2, whereas $-1/3 \leq \tilde{M}_2$ is required from this solution. Finally, we derive a new series representation in this spacetime using a recently proposed prescription, which shows fast convergence not only in the weak-field regime with not necessarily small eccentricity but also in the strong-field regime with small eccentricity.</description>

      <title>The infrared jet of M87 observed with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first JWST+NIRCam images of the giant elliptical active galaxy M87 and its jet at 0.90, 1.50, 2.77 and 3.56 $\mu$m. We analysed the large-scale jet structure, identifying prominent components, and determined the near-infrared spectral index. The data were calibrated using the standard JWST pipeline. We subtracted a constant background level and a smooth model of the galaxy surface brightness to isolate the jet. The total image fluxes measured in the NIRCam filters follow the infrared bump pattern seen near 1.6 $\mu$m in the spectral energy distribution of M87, caused by the surrounding stellar population in the galaxy. The residual jet images broadly agree with the radio to optical synchrotron power law $S_\lambda\propto\lambda^\alpha$ with $\alpha=$0.7-1.0. We identified the most upstream knot L at a distance of (320$\pm$50) mas from the core. The component HST-1, at (950$\pm$50) mas from the core, is transversely resolved, and both the individual images and the spectral index map clearly indicate its double-component substructure with two elements of similar size and flux density, with centroids separated by (150$\pm$20) mas and with a significantly larger spectral index $\alpha$ observed in the downstream component ($\alpha_{\rm do}=0.3$) than in the upstream one ($\alpha_{\rm up}= -0.15$). We also observe the counter-jet component located about 24 arcsec away from the nucleus.</description>
