      <title>Suppressing Trapped-Electron-Mode-Driven Turbulence via Optimization of Three-Dimensional Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent transport driven by trapped electron modes (TEMs) is believed to drive significant heat and particle transport in quasihelically symmetric stellarators. Two three-dimensionally-shaped magnetic configurations with suppressed trapped-electron-mode (TEM)-driven turbulence were generated through optimization that targeted quasihelical symmetry and the available energy of trapped electrons. Initial equilibria have flux surface shapes with a helically rotating negative triangularity (NT) and positive triangularity (PT). In gyrokinetic simulations, TEMs are suppressed in the reduced-TEM NT and PT configurations, showing that negative triangularity does not have the same beneficial turbulence properties over positive triangularity as seen in tokamaks. Heat fluxes from TEMs are also suppressed. Without temperature gradients and with a strong density gradient, the most unstable modes at low $k_y$ were consistent with toroidal universal instabilities (UIs) in the NT case and slab UIs in the PT case. Nonlinear simulations show that UIs drive substantial heat flux in both the NT and PT configurations. A moderate increase in $\beta$ halves the heat flux in the NT configuration, while suppressing the heat flux in the PT geometry. Based on the present work, future optimizations aimed at reducing electrostatic drift wave-driven turbulent transport will need to consider UIs if $\beta$ is sufficiently small.</description>

      <title>Attosecond electron bunch generation by an intense laser propagation in conical channel with a curved wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, attosecond electron bunches with high density, high energy and small divergence angle can be obtained by p-polarized laser irradiation in conical channel with curved wall. We find that some electrons in the wall are pulled into the channel by the transverse electric field and are directly accelerated. Meanwhile, they move steadily along the conical wall via laser pondermotive force. The results show that the focusing effect of the curved wall conical channel is stronger than that of the traditional flat wall conical channel, and the density of the attosecond electron bunches is increased by nearly 175% as well as the maximum energy is increased by 36%. We also find that the quality of the electron bunches is affected by the geometry of the concial channel wall. Interestingly it is found that the attosecond electron bunches obtained from the specific concial channel with the hyperbolic geometry of the curved wall can keep stable around the maximum electron energy within 10T0 even if they have left the channel.</description>

      <title>Numerical solutions of resistive finite-pressure magnetohydrodynamic equilibria for non-axisymmetric toroidal plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hybrid spectral/finite-element code is developed to numerically solve the resistive finite-pressure magnetohydrodynamic equilibria without the necessity of postulating nested magnetic flux surfaces in the non-axisymmetric toroidal systems. The adopted approach integrates a hyperbolic parallel damping equation for pressure updating, along with a dynamic resistive relaxation for magnetic field. To address the nonaxisymmetry in toroidal geometry, a pseudo flux mapping is employed to relate the axisymmetric computational domain to the physical domain. On the computational mesh, an isoparametric C1-continuous triangular element is utilized to discretize the poloidal plane, which is complemented with a Fourier decomposition in the toroidal direction. The versatility of the code is demonstrated through its application to several different non-axisymmetric toroidal systems, including the inherently three-dimensional equilibria in stellarators, the helical-core equilibrium states in tokamak plasmas, and the quasi-single-helicity states in a reversed-field pinch.</description>

      <title>Compton photons at the GeV scale from self-aligned collisions with a plasma mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With today's multi-petawatt lasers, testing quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the strong field regime, where the electric field exceeds the Schwinger critical field in the rest frame of an electron, becomes within reach. Inverse Compton scattering of an intense laser pulse off a high-energy electron beam is the mainstream approach, resulting in the emission of high-energy photons that can decay into Breit-Wheeler electron-positron pairs. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that very high energy photons can be generated in a self-aligned single-laser Compton scattering setup, combining a laser-plasma accelerator and a plasma mirror. Reaching up to the GeV scale, photon emission via nonlinear Compton scattering exhibits a nonclassical scaling in the experiment that is consistent with electric fields reaching up to a fraction $\chi\simeq0.3$ of the Schwinger field in the electron rest frame. These foolproof collisions guaranteed by automatic laser-electron overlap provide a new approach for precise investigations of strong-field QED processes.</description>

      <title>On the proper treatment of magnetic fluctuations in full-$f$ field-aligned turbulence codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma turbulence in the edge of magnetic confinement devices is customarily treated as full-$f$ due to large fluctuations. For computational efficiency, field-aligned coordinates are employed, separating the magnetic field into equilibrium $B_0$ and delta-f perturbations which are handled by the magnetic flutter operators. Evolving the full-$f$ pressure with delta-$f$ magnetic perturbations can cause inconsistency since the latter contain background components such as the Shafranov shift, which are actually parts of the equilibrium magnetic field. Such background components ($B_s$) contained in the magnetic perturbations undermine the field-aligned numerics when treated as flutter: errors arise if $B_s/B_0\ll l_\perp/h_\parallel$ is not satisfied, with the perpendicular turbulence scale $l_\perp$ and the parallel grid distance $h_\parallel$. We find that the commonly used removal of $B_s$ by subtracting the toroidal average of magnetic perturbations intervenes in the Alfv\'en dynamics, causing spurious $E\times B$ transport. Instead, we propose an improved method to dynamically filter out the evolving background from the turbulent magnetic fluctuations in the time domain. The filter is verified in both low and high confinement tokamak conditions, confirming its capability to preserve the turbulence fidelity, provided sufficient filter width.</description>

      <title>A Brief Overlook on Magnetoplasmadynamic Thrusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of Magnetoplasmadynamic Thrusters (MPDT), examining their working principles, performance characteristics, and potential applications in space propulsion. The study focuses on both self-field and applied-field MPDT variants, detailing the fundamental physics of plasma generation, acceleration mechanisms through Lorentz forces, and plasma detachment processes. Through mathematical modeling and experimental data analysis, the paper demonstrates MPDTs' capability to achieve high specific impulse and efficient propellant utilization compared to chemical propulsion systems. While highlighting their advantages for deep space missions and satellite operations, the study also addresses key challenges, including high power requirements and thermal management issues. The research concludes that despite current technological limitations, MPDTs show promising potential for future space exploration, particularly for long-duration missions requiring sustained thrust.</description>

      <title>Data-driven analysis of anomalous transport and three-wave-coupling effects in E x B plasma discharges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisionless cross-field electron transport in an E x B configuration relevant for electric propulsion is studied using data from a (z, {\theta}) full-PIC simulation. Higher-order spectral analysis shows that transport is dominated by the in-phase interaction of the oscillations of the azimuthal electric field and the electron density associated to the first electron cyclotron drift instability (ECDI) mode. A secondary contribution emanates from a lower-frequency mode, not predicted by linear ECDI theory, while higher modes have a minor direct impact on transport. However, a bicoherence analysis reveals that strong phase couplings exist among the ECDI modes, and a sparse symbolic regression spectral model, based on the three-wave coupling equations, suggests an inverse energy cascade as the most likely explanation, thus suggesting that higher modes contribute indirectly to transport by quadratic power transfer to the first mode. This work provides new insights into the dynamics of anomalous plasma transport in E x B sources and the underlying processes governing energy distribution across different scales, and supports the validity of weak turbulence theory to examine their behavior.</description>

      <title>Landau damping below survival threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish nonlinear Landau damping below survival threshold for collisionless charged particles following the meanfield Vlasov theory near general radial equilibria. In absence of collisions, the long-range Coulomb pair interaction between particles self-consistently gives rise to oscillations, known in the physical literature as plasma oscillations or Langmuir's oscillatory waves, that disperse in space like a Klein-Gordon's dispersive wave. As a matter of fact, there is a non-trivial survival threshold of wave numbers that characterizes the large time dynamics of a plasma: {\em phase mixing} above the threshold driven by the free transport dynamics and {\em plasma oscillations} below the threshold driven by the collective meanfield interaction. The former mechanism provides exponential damping, while the latter is much slower and dictated by Klein-Gordon's dispersion which gives decay of the electric field precisely at rate of order $t^{-3/2}$. Up to date, all the works in the mathematical literature on nonlinear Landau damping fall into the phase mixing regime, in which plasma oscillations were absent. The present work resolves the problem in the plasma oscillation regime. Our nonlinear analysis includes (1) establishing the existence and dispersion of Langmuir's waves, (2) decoupling oscillations from phase mixing in different time regimes, (3) detailing the oscillatory structure of particle trajectories in the phase space, (4) treating plasma echoes via a detailed analysis of particle-particle, particle-wave, and wave-wave interaction, and (5) designing a nonlinear iterative scheme in the physical space that captures both phase mixing and dispersion in low norms and allows growth in time in high norms. As a result, we establish nonlinear plasma oscillations and Landau damping below survival threshold for data with finite Sobolev regularity.</description>

      <title>A generative machine learning surrogate model of plasma turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence methods are employed for the first time to construct a surrogate model for plasma turbulence that enables long time transport simulations. The proposed GAIT (Generative Artificial Intelligence Turbulence) model is based on the coupling of a convolutional variational auto-encoder, that encodes precomputed turbulence data into a reduced latent space, and a recurrent neural network and decoder that generates new turbulence states 400 times faster than the direct numerical integration. The model is applied to the Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) plasma turbulence model, that is closely related to the quasigeostrophic model used in geophysical fluid dynamics. Very good agreement is found between the GAIT and the HW models in the spatio-temporal Fourier and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition spectra, and the flow topology characterized by the Okubo-Weiss decomposition. The GAIT model also reproduces Lagrangian transport including the probability distribution function of particle displacements and the effective turbulent diffusivity.</description>

      <title>A coordinate-free expression of plasma theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of plasmas, that is collectives of charged particles, is developed using the coordinate-free and geometric methods of exterior calculus. This dramatically simplifies the algebra and gives a geometric physical interpretation. The fundamental foundation on which the theory is built is the conservation of phase space volume expressed by the Generalized Liouville Equation in terms of the Lie derivative. The theory is expanded both in the order of the correlation and in the weakness of the correlation. This gives a Generalized BBGKY (Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon) Hierarchy. The derivation continues to give a new generalized formula for the Variational Theory of Reaction Rates (VTRR). Pullbacks of the generalized formulas to generic canonical coordinates and Poisson brackets are done. Where appropriate, the canonical coordinates are assumed to be "action-angle" coordinates that are generated by the solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, the action. Finally, generalized forms of all the common kinetic equations are derived: the Vlasov Equation, the Boltzmann Equation, the Master Equation, the Fokker-Planck Equation, the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (VFP) Equation, the Fluid Equations, and the MagnetoHydroDynamic (MHD) Equations. Specific examples are given of these equations. The application of the VTRR to three-body recombination in a strong magnetic field is shown.</description>
