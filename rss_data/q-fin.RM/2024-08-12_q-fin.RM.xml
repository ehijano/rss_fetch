      <title>Monotonic mean-deviation risk measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01034</link>

Abstract: Mean-deviation models, along with the existing theory of coherent risk measures, are well studied in the literature. In this paper, we characterize monotonic mean-deviation (risk) measures from a general mean-deviation model by applying a risk-weighting function to the deviation part. The form is a combination of the deviation-related functional and the expectation, and such measures belong to the class of consistent risk measures. The monotonic mean-deviation measures admit an axiomatic foundation via preference relations. By further assuming the convexity and linearity of the risk-weighting function, the characterizations for convex and coherent risk measures are obtained, giving rise to many new explicit examples of convex and nonconvex consistent risk measures. Further, we specialize in the convex case of the monotonic mean-deviation measure and obtain its dual representation. The worst-case values of the monotonic mean-deviation measures are analyzed under two popular settings of model uncertainty. Further, we establish asymptotic consistency and normality of the natural estimators of the monotonic mean-deviation measures.Finally, the monotonic mean-deviation measures are applied to a problem of portfolio selection using financial data.</description>

      <title>Endogenous distress contagion in a dynamic interbank model: how possible future losses may spell doom today</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15431v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a dynamic and stochastic interbank model with an endogenous notion of distress contagion, arising from rational worries about future defaults and ensuing losses. This entails a mark-to-market valuation adjustment for interbank claims, leading to a forward-backward approach to the equilibrium dynamics whereby future default probabilities are needed to determine today's balance sheets. Distinct from earlier models, the resulting distress contagion acts, endogenously, as a stochastic volatility term that exhibits clustering and down-market spikes. Furthermore, by incorporating multiple maturities, we provide a novel framework for constructing systemic interbank term structures, reflecting the intertemporal risk of contagion. We present the analysis in two parts: first, the simpler single maturity setting that extends the classical interbank network literature and, then, the multiple maturity setting for which we can examine how systemic risk materialises in the shape of the resulting term structures.</description>
