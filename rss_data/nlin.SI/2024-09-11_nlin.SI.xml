      <title>Bilinearization-reduction approach to the classical and nonlocal semi-discrete modified Korteweg-de Vries equations with nonzero backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi double Casoratian solutions are derived for a bilinear system reformulated from the coupled semi-discrete modified Korteweg-de Vries equations with nonzero backgrounds. These solutions, when applied with the classical and nonlocal reduction techniques, also satisfy the corresponding classical and nonlocal semi-discrete modified Korteweg-de Vries equations with nonzero backgrounds. They can be expressed explicitly, allowing for an easy investigation of the dynamics of systems. As illustrative examples, the dynamics of solitonic, periodic and rational solutions with a plane wave background are examined for the focusing semi-discrete Korteweg-de Vries equation and the defocusing reverse-space-time complex semi-discrete Korteweg-de Vries equation.</description>

      <title>Spherical and hyperbolic orthogonal ring patterns: integrability and variational principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce orthogonal ring patterns in the 2-sphere and in the hyperbolic plane, consisting of pairs of concentric circles, which generalize circle patterns. We show that their radii are described by a discrete integrable system. This is a special case of the master integrable equation Q4. The variational description is given in terms of elliptic generalizations of the dilogarithm function. They have the same convexity principles as their circle-pattern counterparts. This allows us to prove existence and uniqueness results for the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems. Some examples are computed numerically. In the limit of small smoothly varying rings, one obtains harmonic maps to the sphere and to the hyperbolic plane. A close relation to discrete surfaces with constant mean curvature is explained.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Nonhomogeneous Quasi-Linear Systems and Their Hamiltonian Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate multidimensional first-order quasi-linear systems and find necessary conditions for them to admit Hamiltonian formulation. The insufficiency of the conditions is related to the Poisson cohomology of the admissible Hamiltonian operators. We present in detail the examples of two-dimensional, two-components systems of hydrodynamic type and of a real reduction of the 3-waves system.</description>

      <title>The 't Hooft equation as a quantum spectral curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an attempt to establish a link between different quantization methods, I examine the massless 't Hooft equation, which governs meson bound state wavefunctions in 2d SU(N) gauge theory in the large-N limit. The integral equation can also be obtained by lightcone quantizing a folded string in flat space. The folded string is a limiting case of a more general setup: a four-segmented string moving in AdS$_3$. I compute its classical spectral curve by using celestial variables and planar bipartite graphs (on-shell diagrams/brane tilings). The adjugate of the Kasteleyn matrix vanishes at two special points, which ensures that the string segments form a closed loop in target space. The Hamiltonian takes on a Ruijsenaars-Schneider form and the phase space is a coadjoint SL(2) orbit whose middle region has been removed. In AdS, the 't Hooft equation acquires an extra term, which has previously been proposed as an effective confining potential in QCD. After an integral transform, the equation can be inverted in terms of a finite difference equation. I show that this difference equation can be interpreted as the quantized (non-analytic) spectral curve of the string. I calculate the spectrum numerically, which interpolates between $M^2=n(n+1)$ in the tensionless limit and 't Hooft's nearly linear Regge trajectory at infinite AdS radius.</description>

      <title>Heavenly metrics, hyper-Lagrangians and Joyce structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In \cite{B3}, Bridgeland defined a geometric structure, named a Joyce structure, conjectured to exist on the space $M$ of stability conditions of a $CY_3$ triangulated category. Given a non-degeneracy assumption, a feature of this structure is a complex hyper-K\"ahler metric with homothetic symmetry on the total space $X = TM$ of the holomorphic tangent bundle. \par Generalising the isomonodromy calculation which leads to the $A_2$ Joyce structure in \cite{BM}, we obtain an explicit expression for a hyper-K\"ahler metric with homothetic symmetry via construction of the isomonodromic flows of a Schr\"odinger equation with deformed polynomial oscillator potential of odd degree $2n+1$. The metric is defined on a total space $X$ of complex dimension $4n$ and fibres over a $2n$--dimensional manifold $M$ which can be identified with the unfolding of the $A_{2n}$-singularity. The hyper-K\"ahler structure is shown to be compatible with the natural symplectic structure on $M$ in the sense of admitting an \textit{affine symplectic fibration} as defined in \cite{BS}. \par Separately, using the additional conditions imposed by a Joyce structure, we consider reductions of Pleba\'nski's heavenly equations that govern the hyper-K\"ahler condition. We introduce the notion of a \textit{projectable hyper-Lagrangian} foliation and show that in dimension four such a foliation of $X$ leads to a linearisation of the heavenly equation. The hyper-K\"ahler metrics constructed here are shown to admit such a foliation.</description>
