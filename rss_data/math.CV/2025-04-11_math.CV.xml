      <title>Lipschitz continuity and composition operators in pluriharmonic Bloch spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Lipschitz continuity of pluriharmonic Bloch mappings in the unit ball $\mathbb{B}^n$ with respect to the Bergman metric. We apply this to obtain a sufficient condition such that the composition operator on the pluriharmonic Bloch space is bounded below. As a partial converse, we also give a necessary condition for the boundedness (from below) of the composition operator on the Bloch space of holomorphic mappings in $\mathbb{B}^n$.</description>

      <title>On convex domains maximizing the gradient of the torsion function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the solution of $-\Delta u = 1$ on convex domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions $u =0$ on $\partial \Omega$. Our main concern is the behavior of $\|\nabla u\|_{L^{\infty}}$, also known as the maximum shear stress in Elasticity Theory and first investigated by Saint Venant in 1856. We consider the two shape optimization problems $\| \nabla u\|_{L^{\infty}}/ |\Omega|^{1/2}$ and $\| \nabla u\|_{L^{\infty}}/ H^1( \partial \Omega)$. Numerically, the extremal domain for each functional looks a bit like the rounded letter `D'. We prove that (1) either the extremal domain does not have a $C^{2 + \varepsilon}$ boundary or (2) there exists an infinite set of points on $\partial \Omega$ where the curvature vanishes. Either scenario seems curious and is rarely encountered for such problems. The techniques are based on finding a representation of the functional using only conformal geometry and classic perturbation arguments.</description>

      <title>Period-Doubling Cascades Invariants: Braided Routes To Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By a classical result of Kathleen Alligood and James Yorke we know that as we isotopically deform a map $f:ABCD\to\mathbb{R}^2$ to a Smale horseshoe map we should often expect the dynamical complexity to increase via a period--doubling route to chaos. Inspired by this fact and by how braids force the existence of complex dynamics, in this paper we introduce three topological invariants that describe the topology of period--doubling routes to chaos. As an application, we use our methods to ascribe symbolic dynamics to perturbations of the Shilnikov homoclinic scenario and to study the dynamics of the Henon map.</description>

      <title>Oka-1 manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15855v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we begin a systematic study of the class of complex manifolds which are universal targets of holomorphic maps from open Riemann surfaces. We call them Oka-1 manifolds, by analogy with Oka manifolds that are universal targets of holomorphic maps from Stein manifolds of arbitrary dimension. We prove that every complex manifold which is dominable at most points by spanning tubes of complex lines in affine spaces is an Oka-1 manifold. In particular, a manifold dominable by $\mathbb{C}^n$ at most points is an Oka-1 manifold. We provide many examples of Oka-1 manifolds among compact complex surfaces, including all Kummer surfaces and all elliptic K3 surfaces. We show that the class of Oka-1 manifolds is invariant under Oka-1 maps inducing a surjective homomorphism of fundamental groups; this includes holomorphic fibre bundles with connected Oka fibres. In another direction, we prove that every bordered Riemann surface admits a holomorphic map with dense image in any connected complex manifold. The analogous result is shown for holomorphic Legendrian immersions in an arbitrary connected complex contact manifold.</description>

      <title>On geometric properties of holomorphic isometries between bounded symmetric domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study holomorphic isometries between bounded symmetric domains with respect to the Bergman metrics up to a normalizing constant. In particular, we first consider a holomorphic isometry from the complex unit ball into an irreducible bounded symmetric domain with respect to the Bergman metrics. In this direction, we show that images of (nonempty) affine-linear sections of the complex unit ball must be the intersections of the image of the holomorphic isometry with certain affine-linear subspaces. We also construct a surjective holomorphic submersion from a certain subdomain of the target bounded symmetric domain onto the complex unit ball such that the image of the holomorphic isometry lies inside the subdomain and the holomorphic isometry is a global holomorphic section of the holomorphic submersion. This construction could be generalized to any holomorphic isometry between bounded symmetric domains with respect to the \emph{canonical K\"ahler metrics}. Using some classical results for complex-analytic subvarieties of Stein manifolds, we have obtained further geometric results for images of such holomorphic isometries.</description>

      <title>Some new findings concerning value distribution of a pair of delay-differential polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paired Hayman's conjecture of different types are considered. More accurately speaking, the zeros of a pair of $f^n(z)L(z,g)-a_1(z)$ and $g^m(z)L(z,f)-a_2(z)$ are characterized using different methods from those previously employed, where $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ are both transcendental entire functions, $L(z,f)$ and $L(z,g)$ are non-zero linear delay-differential polynomials, $\min\{n,m\}\ge 2$, $a_1(z),a_2(z)$ are non-zero small functions with relative to $f$ and $g$, or to $f^n(z)L(z,g)$ and $g^m(z)L(z,f)$, respectively. These results give answers to three open questions raised by Gao, Liu\cite{Gao22} and Liu, Liu\cite{Liu25}.</description>
