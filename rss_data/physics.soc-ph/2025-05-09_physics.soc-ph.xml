      <title>Synthesis of innovation and obsolescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Innovation and obsolescence describe the dynamics of ever-churning social and biological systems, from the development of economic markets to scientific and technological progress to biological evolution. They have been widely discussed, but in isolation, leading to fragmented modeling of their dynamics. This poses a problem for connecting and building on what we know about their shared mechanisms. Here we collectively propose a conceptual and mathematical framework to transcend field boundaries and to explore unifying theoretical frameworks and open challenges. We ring an optimistic note for weaving together disparate threads with key ideas from the wide and largely disconnected literature by focusing on the duality of innovation and obsolescence and by proposing a mathematical framework to unify the metaphors between constitutive elements.</description>

      <title>Spline tie-decay temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasing amounts of data are available on temporal, or time-varying, networks. There have been various representations of temporal network data each of which has different advantages for downstream tasks such as mathematical analysis, visualizations, agent-based and other dynamical simulations on the temporal network, and discovery of useful structure. The tie-decay network is a representation of temporal networks whose advantages include the capability of generating continuous-time networks from discrete time-stamped contact event data with mathematical tractability and a low computational cost. However, the current framework of tie-decay networks is limited in terms of how each discrete contact event can affect the time-dependent tie strength (which we call the kernel). Here we extend the tie-decay network model in terms of the kernel. Specifically, we use a cubic spline function for modeling short-term behavior of the kernel and an exponential decay function for long-term behavior, and graft them together. This spline version of tie-decay network enables delayed and $C^1$-continuous interaction rates between two nodes while it only marginally increases the computational and memory burden relative to the conventional tie-decay network. We show mathematical properties of the spline tie-decay network and numerically showcase it with three tasks: network embedding, a deterministic opinion dynamics model, and a stochastic epidemic spreading model.</description>

      <title>Barrier induced stalemate-consensus transition of self-propelled participants subject to majority rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural or artificial barriers, such as the Himalayas, the Berlin Wall, or the Korean Demilitarized Zone, can significantly impede human migration. As a consequence, they may also hinder the dissemination of opinions within society, thereby contributing to divergent geopolitical landscapes and cultural developments. This raises a fundamental question: how do such barriers influence the opinion dynamics of mobile agents, such as human beings? In particular, can a barrier induce transitions in collective opinion states among spatially segregated groups? Here, we investigate the opinion dynamics governed by majority rule in a minimal model comprising self-propelled agents with binary opinions performing random walks within a closed space divided by a barrier. We focus on the conditions under which initially segregated clusters of agents with opposing opinions can reach consensus. Our results reveal the existence of a critical barrier size that marks a transition between stalemate and consensus states. Near this critical point, the relaxation time to reach consensus from an initial stalemate exhibits a power-law divergence. This barrier-induced stalemate-consensus transition in a simple agent-based model offers new insights into the role of physical or social barriers in shaping opinion dynamics and social structures.</description>
