      <title>Shallow Trap States Control Electrical Performance of Amorphous Oxide Semiconductor Thin-Film Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of n-type amorphous oxide semiconductor thin-film transistors (TFTs) is largely controlled by the density of states (DoS) near the conduction band mobility edge. Here, the full subgap DoS of amorphous InGaZnO (a-IGZO) TFTs, used in display panels and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) development, is measured by ultrabroadband photoconduction (UP-DoS) microscopy to within 0.1 eV of the mobility edge. The measured subgap DoS for 25 TFT processing conditions accurately predicts each transfer curve, showing how shallow defect states are electron traps that rigidly tune subthreshold swing, threshold voltage and drift mobility. For a set of TFTs, the subthreshold transfer characteristics can be independently simulated from the experimental shallow defect DoS, with no adjustable parameters. The full transfer curve is simulated by introducing a single parameter: the conduction band tail energy. Additionally, the simulation reveals that the shallow trap density controlling subthreshold behavior can be directly extracted from transfer curves. Finally, a systematic In-enrichment study, combined with DFT+U DoS simulations, enables identification of vacancy cation coordination environments for all experimentally observed subgap peaks. The dominant trap controlling conventional a-IGZO TFT performance is centered at ~0.32 eV below the conduction band mobility edge and is assigned to a Ga-Ga-In oxygen vacancy defect.</description>

      <title>Millimeter-scale rigid diamond probe for high sensitivity endoscopic-magnetometry applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetometry based on diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers has been extensively studied for applications requiring diverse capabilities, spanning from nanometer spatial resolution to subpicotesla sensitivity. Among various applications, diamond magnetometers can demonstrate high sensitivity magnetic sensing within millimeter-scale size for endoscopic applications. However, the trade-off between sensitivity and spatial resolution of diamond magnetometry makes it difficult to achieve such a probe. In this study, we present a millimeter-scale rigid diamond magnetometer probe with enhanced sensitivity via optimizing the optical design. By coupling the frustum diamond with the miniaturized compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) lens, we enhance the fluorescence collection efficiency by 37% within 4 mm diameter, and the achieved sensitivity is 200 pT/Hz1/2 based on the sample with the resonance linewidth of ~8 MHz. With this verified structure, endoscopes with mm-size probe and picotesla sensitivity can be projected for surgical and industrial applications in the future.</description>

      <title>Engineering altermagnetic symmetry to enable anomalous Hall response in Cr$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$Sb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets are a promising class of materials for spintronic applications. However, compounds that simultaneously combine the symmetry required to support an anomalous Hall effect with good metallic conductivity and magnetic ordering temperatures well above room temperature remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that partial substitution of Cr by Mn in epitaxial CrSb(100) thin films provides a viable route to engineer the combined structural and magnetic symmetry necessary to enable an otherwise symmetry-forbidden anomalous Hall effect. By systematically exploring the magnetic phase diagram Cr$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$Sb thin films, we identify a pronounced anomalous Hall effect in Cr$_{0.75}$Mn$_{0.25}$Sb. Guided by Landau theory, we model the field-driven reorientation of the N\'eel vector and the resulting anomalous Hall response, achieving good qualitative agreement with the experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Direct laser writing of high aspect ratio nanochannels for nanofluidics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanochannels with high width-to-height aspect ratios are desirable for many applications, particularly those requiring optical access, but remain challenging to fabricate. In this work, the direct laser writing of such channels between diamond films and glass substrates is introduced. As previously reported, laser light can transform a portion of diamond film into a nanostrip. The strip induces delamination of the surrounding film, causing the formation of two nanochannels with triangular cross-sections. Here, it is demonstrated that nanochannels with rectangular cross-sections and width-to-height aspect ratios exceeding fifty can form between pairs of nanostrips. With atomic force microscopy, the maximum strip spacing that produces these nanochannels is investigated, and it is demonstrated that the reflectance of the channels can be measured by microspectrophotometry. The microstructure of the nanochannels, including nanostrips, and processes that occur during laser writing are inferred from transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. By fabricating a nanofluidic device and using microspectrophotometry, it is found that the nanochannels fill with water through capillary action, are resistant to clogging, and are mechanically stable against water filling. A versatile platform for producing high-aspect-ratio nanochannels that are optically accessible and fluidically functional is presented, thereby expanding opportunities for advanced applications.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Kerr Soliton Self-Balancing from Kerr-Induced Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated frequency comb sources are a key enabling technology for frequency metrology applications. Their on-chip integration promises to bring metrology capacity outside of the lab, particularly since they can operate at low continuous-wave pump laser power in the dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) regime. Yet, such small foot-print and low power comes at a cost: higher noise and overall lower comb power. In particular, this translates to highly challenging detection and locking of the carrier-envelope offset, necessary for complete stabilization of the comb. Recently, Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) of a DKS to a reference laser has been demonstrated as a tool for passive all-optical stabilization of DKS microcombs, with fundamental modification to the DKS and microcomb properties. Here, we demonstrate that the combination of additional power from the reference laser (now part of the DKS) and the KIS phase locking that pins the repetition rate together fundamentally alter the DKS, forcing an energy redistribution to maintain its center of mass. We demonstrate this self-balancing effect theoretically, which in a pure quadratic dispersion resonator leads to reference-dependent recoil. With higher-order dispersion through which the DKS yields phase-matched dispersive waves (DWs), we demonstrate that self-balancing increases the DW radiation, experimentally showing a 22 dB increase of comb teeth at 780 nm in an octave-spanning microcomb for efficient deployable carrier-envelope offset detection.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Regression Modelling for Vertical Facade Surface Temperature: A Tropical Case Study on Solar-reflective Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban heat islands (UHIs) pose a critical challenge in densely populated cities and tropical climates where large amounts of energy are used to meet the cooling demand. To address this, Building and Construction Authority (BCA) of Singapore provides incentives for passive cooling such as using of solar-reflective material in its Green Mark guidelines. Thus, understanding about its real-world effectiveness in tropical urban environments is required. This study evaluated the effectiveness of solar-reflective cool paint using a hybrid modelling framework combining a transient physical model and data driven model through field measurements. Several machine learning algorithms were compared including multiple-linear regression (MLR), random forest regressor (RF), AdaBoost regressor (AB), extreme gradient boosting regressor (XGB), and TabPFN regressor (TPR). The results indicated that the transient physical model overestimated facade temperatures in the lower temperature ranges. The physics-informed MLR achieved best performance with improved accuracy for pre-cool paint (R2=0.96, RMSE=0.83C) and post-cool paint (R2=0.95, RMSE=0.65C) scenarios, reducing RMSE by 26% and 44%, respectively. The hybrid model also effectively predicted hourly heat fluxes revealing substantial reductions in surface temperature and heat storage with increasing albedo. The maximum net heat flux q_net was reduced by about 30-65 W/m2 in the post-cool paint stage (albedo = 0.73) compared to the pre-cool paint stage (albedo = 0.31). As albedo increases from 0.1 to 0.9, the sensitivity analysis predicts that the maximum daytime surface temperature will decrease by about 11C and the peak heat release of the net heat flux will decrease significantly from about 161 W/m2 to 27 W/m2.</description>

      <title>Quantum noise in a squeezed-light-enhanced multiparameter quantum sensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum enhancement of sensitivity using squeezed light in a multi-parameter quantum sensor, the hybrid dc-rf optically pumped magnetometer (hOPM) [Phys. Rev. Applied 21, 034054, (2024)]. Using a single spin ensemble, the hOPM acquires both the dc field strength (scalar magnetometry), and resonantly detects one quadrature of the ac magnetic field at a chosen frequency (rf magnetometry). In contrast to the Bell-Bloom scalar magnetometer [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193601 (2021)], the back-action evasion in the hOPM is incomplete, leading to a nontrivial interplay of the three quantum noise sources in this system: photon shot noise, spin projection noise, and measurement back-action noise. We observe these interactions using squeezed light as a tool to control the distribution of optical quantum noise between $S_2$ and $S_3$ polarization Stokes components, and the resulting effect on readout quantum noise and measurement back-action. These results demonstrate quantum-enhanced sensitivity in a continuously operating multi-parameter sensor and reveal fundamental trade-offs between sensitivity, back-action, and bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Corrosion-resistant and conductive Ti-Nb-O coatings tailored for ultra-low Pt-loaded BPPs and PTLs in PEM electrolyzers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop highly corrosion-resistant and conductive Ti-Nb-O coatings for metallic components -- bipolar plates (BPPs) and porous transport layers (PTLs) -- in PEM water electrolyzers. Using reactive high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS), we deposit compact 200 nm bilayer coatings onto SS316L substrates, systematically tailoring their composition. By precisely controlling oxygen partial pressure and Nb/Ti ratio, we adjust stoichiometry and structure, directly affecting electrical resistivity and corrosion resistance. We examine interfacial contact resistance (ICR) and electrochemical parameters before and after accelerated corrosion testing. Optimized coatings exhibit resistivity on the order of 10^-4 Ohmcm and extremely low corrosion current densities (J_corr = 0.01-0.08 uA/cm^2), well below the U.S. DOE 2026 target. Most importantly, these coatings enable the ICR target after accelerated corrosion testing with a Pt overlayer as thin as 5 nm, reducing Pt loading by up to two orders of magnitude compared to conventional approaches.</description>

      <title>Learning Nonlinear Heterogeneity in Physical Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15340v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical neural networks typically train linear synaptic weights while treating device nonlinearities as fixed. We show the opposite - by training the synaptic nonlinearity itself, as in Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architectures, we yield markedly higher task performance per physical resource and improved performance-parameter scaling than conventional linear weight-based networks, demonstrating ability of KAN topologies to exploit reconfigurable nonlinear physical dynamics.
  We experimentally realise physical KANs in silicon-on-insulator devices we term 'Synaptic Nonlinear Elements' (SYNEs), operating at room temperature, microampere currents, 2 MHz speeds and ~750 fJ per nonlinear operation, with no observed degradation over 10^13 measurements and months-long timescales.
  We demonstrate nonlinear function regression, classification, and prediction of Li-Ion battery dynamics from noisy real-world multi-sensor data. Physical KANs outperform equivalently-parameterised software multilayer perceptron networks across all tasks, with up to two orders of magnitude fewer parameters, and two orders of magnitude fewer devices than linear weight based physical networks. These results establish learned physical nonlinearity as a hardware-native computational primitive for compact and efficient learning systems, and SYNE devices as effective substrates for heterogenous nonlinear computing.</description>

      <title>Observation of Orbit-Orbit Torques: Highly Efficient Torques on Orbital Moments Induced by Orbital Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the current-induced torques in bilayers composed of a light 3d metal, chromium, and a rare-earth ferromagnet with finite orbital moments, terbium, utilizing second-harmonic Hall-response measurements. The dampinglike torque efficiency of chromium is found to be positive and reaches ~3.66 in this system, in sharp contrast to the negative and subtle dampinglike torque efficiency in general Cr/ferromagnet heterostructures with quenched orbital moment. We suggest that the orbital currents generated by the orbital Hall effect in Cr can be injected into Tb with negligible loss at the interface and then efficiently interact with the orbital moments. We term such an exotic effect as the orbit-orbit torque (OOT). Our work implies that orbital currents could be harnessed to manipulate the orbital magnetization of materials, which would advance the development of orbitronics.</description>

      <title>Self-aligned optical microcomb emerging between octave separated lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical frequency combs (OFCs) are frequency rulers essential for precision metrology, next generation navigation, and testing of fundamental physics. Despite intense efforts, chip-integrated OFCs remain laboratory-bound, unable to fulfill their promise of compact and cost-effective deployment. While improvement in fabrication and integration are important, a conceptual limitation has fundamentally stymied progress: on-chip OFC architectures have aimed to miniaturize their table-top counterparts and relied on cascading outward from (i.e., spectrally broadening) a single pump. In integrated platforms, this approach does not readily allow for the generation of strong and low-noise octave-spaced signals that are crucially needed for robust zero-frequency offset detection. Here, we overcome this limitation via an architectural inversion where an optical microcomb forms by filling the spectrum between two octave-separated pump lasers. The two pumps generate a parametrically driven cavity soliton (PDCS) in an integrated $\chi^{(3)}$ resonator, which robustly self-aligns to (i.e., synchronizes with) the pump lasers across multiple foundry-fabricated devices and operating configurations. This produces a single octave-spanning comb extending from telecom to visible wavelengths, whose zero-frequency offset is completely defined by the two harmonically-related pump lasers, and can therefore be reliably detected and stabilized. We showcase our platform's capabilities by executing all of the three core tasks of OFC metrology: optical frequency synthesis, low-noise millimeter-wave generation, and integrated optical clock readout, using the same self-aligned microcomb with only its input locks changed.</description>
