      <title>How do the professional players select their shot locations? An analysis of Field Goal Attempts via Bayesian Additive Regression Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Basketball analytics has significantly advanced our understanding of the game, with shot selection emerging as a critical factor in both individual and team performance. With the advent of player tracking technologies, a wealth of granular data on shot attempts has become available, enabling a deeper analysis of shooting behavior. However, modeling shot selection presents unique challenges due to the spatial and contextual complexities influencing shooting decisions. This paper introduces a novel approach to the analysis of basketball shot data, focusing on the spatial distribution of shot attempts, also known as intensity surfaces. We model these intensity surfaces using a Functional Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (FBART) framework, which allows for flexible, nonparametric regression, and uncertainty quantification while addressing the nonlinearity and nonstationarity inherent in shot selection patterns to provide a more accurate representation of the factors driving player performance; we further propose the Adaptive Functional Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (AFBART) model, which builds on FBART by introducing adaptive basis functions for improved computational efficiency and model fit. AFBART is particularly well suited for the analysis of two-dimensional shot intensity surfaces and provides a robust tool for uncovering latent patterns in shooting behavior. Through simulation studies and real-world applications to NBA player data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in quantifying shooting tendencies, improving performance predictions, and informing strategic decisions for coaches, players, and team managers. This work represents a significant step forward in the statistical modeling of basketball shot selection and its applications in optimizing game strategies.</description>

      <title>Improving Pedestrian Safety at Intersections Using Probabilistic Models and Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reported 7,345 pedestrian fatalities in the United States in 2022, making pedestrian safety a pressing issue in urban mobility. This study presents a novel probabilistic simulation framework integrating dynamic pedestrian crossing models and Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate safety under varying traffic conditions. The framework captures key influences on pedestrian decisions, such as traffic light states, vehicle proximity, and waiting times, while employing the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) to simulate realistic vehicle dynamics. Results from 500 trials show that pedestrians avoid crossing during green lights, reducing collision risks, while shorter waiting times during red lights encourage safer crossings. The risk is heightened during yellow lights, especially with nearby vehicles. This research emphasizes the importance of adaptive traffic control measures, such as pedestrian-triggered signals and enhanced traffic light timing, to mitigate risks and prioritize pedestrian safety. By modeling realistic interactions between pedestrians and vehicles, the study offers insights for designing safer and more sustainable urban intersections.</description>

      <title>Comorbidity Patterns and Temporal Associations of Multiple Long-Term Conditions in Adults with Intellectual Disability: an observational study in the United Kingdom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives: To examine the distribution, temporal associations, and age/sex-specific patterns of multiple long-term conditions (MLTCs) in adults with intellectual disability (ID).
  Study Design: Observational study using longitudinal healthcare data. Methods: Analysis of 18144 adults with ID (10168 males and 7976 females) identified in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, linked to Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care and Outpatient data (2000-2021). We used temporal analysis to establish directional associations among 40 long-term conditions, stratified by sex and age groups (under 45, 45-64, 65 and over).
  Results: The high prevalence of enduring mental illness across all age groups is an important finding unique to this population. In males, mental illness occurred along with upper gastrointestinal conditions (specifically reflux disorders), while in females, mental illness presented alongside reflux disorders, chronic pain, and endocrine conditions such as thyroid problems. Among young males with intellectual disability, the combination of cerebral palsy with dysphagia, epilepsy, chronic constipation, and chronic pneumonia represents a distinctive pattern. In those aged 45-64, we observed early onset of lifestyle conditions like diabetes and hypertension, though notably these conditions co-occurred with mental illness and anaemia at rates exceeding those in the general population. The health conditions in those aged 65 and over largely mirrored those seen in the general aging population.
  Conclusions: Our findings highlight the complex patterns of MLTCs in this population, revealing sex-specific associations across age groups, and identified temporal associations, thus providing insights into disease progression, which can inform targeted prevention strategies and interventions to prevent premature mortality.</description>

      <title>Leveraging national forest inventory data to estimate forest carbon density status and trends for small areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: National forest inventory (NFI) data are often costly to collect, which inhibits efforts to estimate parameters of interest for small spatial, temporal, or biophysical domains. Traditionally, design-based estimators are used to estimate status of forest parameters of interest, but are unreliable for small areas where data are sparse. Additionally, design-based estimates constructed directly from the survey data are often unavailable when sample sizes are especially small. Traditional model-based small area estimation approaches, such as the Fay-Herriot (FH) model, rely on these direct estimates for inference; hence, missing direct estimates preclude the use of such approaches. Here, we detail a Bayesian spatio-temporal small area estimation model that efficiently leverages sparse NFI data to estimate status and trends for forest parameters. The proposed model bypasses the use of direct estimates and instead uses plot-level NFI measurements along with auxiliary data including remotely sensed tree canopy cover. We produce forest carbon estimates from the United States NFI over 14 years across the contiguous US (CONUS) and conduct a simulation study to assess our proposed model's accuracy, precision, and bias, compared to that of a design-based estimator. The proposed model provides improved precision and accuracy over traditional estimation methods, and provides useful insights into county-level forest carbon dynamics across the CONUS.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Antibiotic Resistance Microbiology Dataset (ARMD) is a de-identified resource derived from electronic health records (EHR) that facilitates research into antimicrobial resistance (AMR). ARMD encompasses data from adult patients, focusing on microbiological cultures, antibiotic susceptibilities, and associated clinical and demographic features. Key attributes include organism identification, susceptibility patterns for 55 antibiotics, implied susceptibility rules, and de-identified patient information. This dataset supports studies on antimicrobial stewardship, causal inference, and clinical decision-making. ARMD is designed to be reusable and interoperable, promoting collaboration and innovation in combating AMR. This paper describes the dataset's acquisition, structure, and utility while detailing its de-identification process.</description>

      <title>Health Prognostics in Multi-sensor Systems Based on Multivariate Functional Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in big data analysis, machine learning, Industry 4.0, and IoT applications have enabled the monitoring and processing of multi-sensor data collected from systems, allowing for the prediction of the "Remaining Useful Life" (RUL) of system components. Particularly in the aviation industry, Prognostic Health Management (PHM) has become one of the most important practices for ensuring reliability and safety. Not only is the accuracy of RUL prediction important, but the implementability of techniques, domain adaptability, and interpretability of system degradation behaviors have also become essential. In this paper, the data collected from the multi-sensor environment of complex systems are processed using a Functional Data Analysis (FDA) approach to predict when the systems will fail and to understand and interpret the systems' life cycles. The approach is applied to the C-MAPSS datasets shared by National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the behaviors of the sensors in aircraft engine failures are adaptively modeled with Multivariate Functional Principal Component Analysis (MFPCA). While the results indicate that the proposed method predicts the RUL competitively compared to other methods in the literature, it also demonstrates how multivariate Functional Data Analysis is useful for interpretability in prognostic studies within multi-sensor environments.</description>

      <title>Causal Networks of Infodemiological Data: Modelling Dermatitis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Environmental and mental conditions are known risk factors for dermatitis and symptoms of skin inflammation, but their interplay is difficult to quantify; epidemiological studies rarely include both, along with possible confounding factors. Infodemiology leverages large online data sets to address this issue, but fusing them produces strong patterns of spatial and temporal correlation, missingness, and heterogeneity.
  In this paper, we design a causal network that correctly models these complex structures in large-scale infodemiological data from Google, EPA, NOAA and US Census (434 US counties, 134 weeks). Our model successfully captures known causal relationships between weather patterns, pollutants, mental conditions, and dermatitis. Key findings reveal that anxiety accounts for 57.4% of explained variance in dermatitis, followed by NO2 (33.9%), while environmental factors show significant mediation effects through mental conditions. The model predicts that reducing PM2.5 emissions by 25% could decrease dermatitis prevalence by 18%. Through statistical validation and causal inference, we provide unprecedented insights into the complex interplay between environmental and mental health factors affecting dermatitis, offering valuable guidance for public health policies and environmental regulations.</description>

      <title>DISTINGUISH Workflow: A New Paradigm of Dynamic Well Placement Using Generative Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The real-time process of directional changes while drilling, known as geosteering, is crucial for hydrocarbon extraction and emerging directional drilling applications such as geothermal energy, civil infrastructure, and CO2 storage. The geo-energy industry seeks an automatic geosteering workflow that continually updates the subsurface uncertainties and captures the latest geological understanding given the most recent observations in real-time.
  We propose "DISTINGUISH": a real-time, AI-driven workflow designed to transform geosteering by integrating Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for geological parameterization, ensemble methods for model updating, and global discrete dynamic programming (DDP) optimization for complex decision-making during directional drilling operations. The DISTINGUISH framework relies on offline training of a GAN model to reproduce relevant geology realizations and a Forward Neural Network (FNN) to model Logging-While-Drilling (LWD) tools' response for a given geomodel.
  This paper introduces a first-of-its-kind workflow that progressively reduces GAN-geomodel uncertainty around and ahead of the drilling bit and adjusts the well plan accordingly. The workflow automatically integrates real-time LWD data with a DDP-based decision support system, enhancing predictive models of geology ahead of drilling and leading to better steering decisions. We present a simple yet representative benchmark case and document the performance target achieved by the DISTINGUISH workflow prototype. This benchmark will be a foundation for future methodological advancements and workflow refinements.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Omics Framework for Survival Mediation Analysis of High-Dimensional Proteogenomic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Survival analysis plays a crucial role in understanding time-to-event (survival) outcomes such as disease progression. Despite recent advancements in causal mediation frameworks for survival analysis, existing methods are typically based on Cox regression and primarily focus on a single exposure or individual omics layers, often overlooking multi-omics interplay. This limitation hinders the full potential of integrated biological insights. In this paper, we propose SMAHP, a novel method for survival mediation analysis that simultaneously handles high-dimensional exposures and mediators, integrates multi-omics data, and offers a robust statistical framework for identifying causal pathways on survival outcomes. This is one of the first attempts to introduce the accelerated failure time (AFT) model within a multi-omics causal mediation framework for survival outcomes. Through simulations across multiple scenarios, we demonstrate that SMAHP achieves high statistical power, while effectively controlling false discovery rate (FDR), compared with two other approaches. We further apply SMAHP to the largest head-and-neck carcinoma proteogenomic data, detecting a gene mediated by a protein that influences survival time.</description>

      <title>Learning Patterns from Biological Networks: A Compounded Burr Probability Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex biological networks, encompassing metabolic reactions, gene interactions, and protein-protein interactions, often exhibit scale-free characteristics with power-law degree distributions. However, empirical evidence reveals significant deviations from ideal power-law fits, necessitating more flexible and accurate modeling approaches. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel Compounded Burr (CBurr) distribution, a novel probability model derived from the Burr family, designed to capture the intricate structural properties of biological networks. We rigorously establish its statistical properties, including moment analysis, hazard functions, and tail behavior, and provide a robust parameter estimation framework using the maximum likelihood method. The CBurr distribution is broadly applicable to networks with fat-tailed degree distributions, making it highly relevant for modeling biological, social, and technological networks. To validate its efficacy, we conduct an extensive empirical study on large-scale biological network datasets, demonstrating that CBurr consistently outperforms conventional power-law and alternative heavy-tailed models in fitting the entire range of node degree distributions. Our proposed CBurr probability distribution holds great promise for accurately capturing the complex nature of biological networks and advancing our understanding of their underlying mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Out-of-distribution robustness for multivariate analysis via causal regularisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a regularisation strategy of classical machine learning algorithms rooted in causality that ensures robustness against distribution shifts. Building upon the anchor regression framework, we demonstrate how incorporating a straightforward regularisation term into the loss function of classical multivariate analysis algorithms, such as (orthonormalized) partial least squares, reduced-rank regression, and multiple linear regression, enables out-of-distribution generalisation. Our framework allows users to efficiently verify the compatibility of a loss function with the regularisation strategy. Estimators for selected algorithms are provided, showcasing consistency and efficacy in synthetic and real-world climate science problems. The empirical validation highlights the versatility of anchor regularisation, emphasizing its compatibility with multivariate analysis approaches and its role in enhancing replicability while guarding against distribution shifts. The extended anchor framework advances causal inference methodologies, addressing the need for reliable out-of-distribution generalisation.</description>

      <title>Robust Bayesian approach for reliability prognosis of nondestructive one-shot devices under cumulative risk model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08867v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present study aims to determine the lifetime prognosis of highly durable nondestructive one-shot devices (NOSD) units under a step-stress accelerated life testing (SSALT) experiment applying a cumulative risk model (CRM). In an SSALT experiment, CRM retains the continuity of hazard function by allowing the lag period before the effects of stress change emerge. When prior information about the model parameters is available, Bayesian inference is crucial. In a Bayesian analysis of such lifetime data, conventional likelihood-based Bayesian estimation frequently fails in the presence of outliers in the dataset. This work incorporates a robust Bayesian approach utilizing a robustified posterior based on the density power divergence measure. The order restriction on shape parameters has been incorporated as a prior assumption to reflect the decreasing expected lifetime with increasing stress levels. In testing of hypothesis, a Bayes factor is implemented based on the robustified posterior. In Bayesian estimation, we exploit Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, which has certain advantages over the conventional Metropolis-Hastings algorithms. Further, the influence functions are examined to evaluate the robust behaviour of the estimators and the Bayes factor. Finally, the analytical development is validated through a simulation study and a real data analysis.</description>

      <title>Conditional diffusions for neural posterior estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural posterior estimation (NPE), a simulation-based computational approach for Bayesian inference, has shown great success in approximating complex posterior distributions. Existing NPE methods typically rely on normalizing flows, which approximate a distribution by composing many simple, invertible transformations. But flow-based models, while state of the art for NPE, are known to suffer from several limitations, including training instability and sharp trade-offs between representational power and computational cost. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of conditional diffusions coupled with high-capacity summary networks for amortized NPE. Conditional diffusions address many of the challenges faced by flow-based methods. Our results show that, across a highly varied suite of benchmarking problems for NPE architectures, diffusions offer improved stability, superior accuracy, and faster training times, even with simpler, shallower models. Building on prior work on diffusions for NPE, we show that these gains persist across a variety of different summary network architectures.

Abstract: Complex engineering systems are often subject to multiple failure modes. Developing a remaining useful life (RUL) prediction model that does not consider the failure mode causing degradation is likely to result in inaccurate predictions. However, distinguishing between causes of failure without manually inspecting the system is nontrivial. This challenge is increased when the causes of historically observed failures are unknown. Sensors, which are useful for monitoring the state-of-health of systems, can also be used for distinguishing between multiple failure modes as the presence of multiple failure modes results in discriminatory behavior of the sensor signals. When systems are equipped with multiple sensors, some sensors may exhibit behavior correlated with degradation, while other sensors do not. Furthermore, which sensors exhibit this behavior may differ for each failure mode. In this paper, we present a simultaneous clustering and sensor selection approach for unlabeled training datasets of systems exhibiting multiple failure modes. The cluster assignments and the selected sensors are then utilized in real-time to first diagnose the active failure mode and then to predict the system RUL. We validate the methodology using a simulated dataset of systems exhibiting two failure modes and on NASA turbofan degradation dataset.</description>
