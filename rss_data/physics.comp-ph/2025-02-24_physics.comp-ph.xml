      <title>PhyLiNO -- A Forward-Folding Likelihood-Fit Framework for Neutrino Oscillation Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for the analysis of data from neutrino oscillation experiments. The framework performs a profile likelihood fit and employs a forward folding technique to optimize its model with respect to the oscillation parameters. It is capable of simultaneously handling multiple datasets from the same or different experiments and their correlations. The code of the framework is optimized for performance and allows for convergence times of a few seconds handling hundreds of fit parameters, thanks to multi-threading and usage of GPUs. The framework was developed in the context of the Double Chooz experiment, where it was successfully used to fit three- and four-flavor models to the data, as well as in the measurement of the energy spectrum of reactor neutrinos. We demonstrate its applicability to other experiments by applying it to a study of the oscillation analysis of a medium baseline reactor experiment similar to JUNO.</description>

      <title>Accurate and efficient machine learning interatomic potentials for finite temperature modeling of molecular crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As with many parts of the natural sciences, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are revolutionizing the modeling of molecular crystals. However, challenges remain for the accurate and efficient calculation of sublimation enthalpies - a key thermodynamic quantity measuring the stability of a molecular crystal. Specifically, two key stumbling blocks are: (i) the need for thousands of ab initio quality reference structures to generate training data; and (ii) the sometimes unreliable nature of density functional theory, the main technique for generating such data. Exploiting recent developments in foundational models for chemistry and materials science alongside accurate quantum diffusion Monte Carlo benchmarks, offers a promising path forward. Herein, we demonstrate the generation of MLIPs capable of describing molecular crystals at finite temperature and pressure with sub-chemical accuracy, using as few as $\sim 200$ data structures; an order of magnitude improvement over the current state-of-the-art. We apply this framework to compute the sublimation enthalpies of the X23 dataset, accounting for anharmonicity and nuclear quantum effects, achieving sub-chemical accuracy with respect to experiment. Importantly, we show that our framework can be generalized to crystals of pharmaceutical relevance, including paracetamol and aspirin. Nuclear quantum effects are also accurately captured as shown for the case of squaric acid. By enabling accurate modeling at ambient conditions, this work paves the way for deeper insights into pharmaceutical and biological systems.</description>

      <title>Bispectral decomposition and energy transfer in a turbulent jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ bispectral mode decomposition (BMD) to investigate coherent triadic interactions and nonlinear energy transfer in a subsonic turbulent jet. BMD extracts the flow structures corresponding to the dominant triadic interactions. We find a strong triadic correlation among the Kelvin-Helmholtz wavepacket, its conjugate, and the streaks. The most energetic streaks occur at the azimuthal wavenumber $m=2$, with the dominant contributing azimuthal wavenumber triad being $[m_1,m_2,m_3]=[1,1,2]$. The spectral energy budget reveals that nonlinear triadic interactions represent an energy loss to the streaks. Analysis across a wide range of frequencies and azimuthal wavenumbers identifies the direction of nonlinear energy transfer and the spatial regions where these transfers are most active. The turbulent jet exhibits a forward energy cascade in a global sense, though the direction of energy transfer varies locally. In the shear layer near the nozzle exit, triadic interactions between relatively smaller scales are dominant, leading to an inverse energy cascade. Farther downstream, beyond the end of the potential core, triadic interactions between larger scales dominate, resulting in a forward energy cascade.</description>

      <title>Fermionic free energies from \textit{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo simulations of fictitious identical particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine the recent $\eta-$ensemble path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) approach to the free energy [T.~Dornheim \textit{et al.}, \textit{Phys.~Rev.~B} \textbf{111}, L041114 (2025)] with a recent fictitious partition function technique based on inserting a continuous variable that interpolates between the bosonic and fermionic limits [Xiong and Xiong, \textit{J.~Chem.~Phys.}~\textbf{157}, 094112 (2022)] to deal with the fermion sign problem. As a practical example, we apply our set-up to the warm dense uniform electron gas over a broad range of densities and temperatures. We obtain accurate results for the exchange--correlation free energy down to half the Fermi temperature, and find excellent agreement with the state-of-the-art parametrization by Groth \textit{et al.}~[\textit{Phys.~Rev.~Lett.}~\textbf{119}, 135001 (2017)]. Our work opens up new avenues for the future study of a host of interacting Fermi-systems, including warm dense matter, ultracold atoms, and electrons in quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Modal analysis of a domain decomposition method for Maxwell's equations in a waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-harmonic wave propagation problems, especially those governed by Maxwell's equations, pose significant computational challenges due to the non-self-adjoint nature of the operators and the large, non-Hermitian linear systems resulting from discretization. Domain decomposition methods, particularly one-level Schwarz methods, offer a promising framework to tackle these challenges, with recent advancements showing the potential for weak scalability under certain conditions. In this paper, we analyze the weak scalability of one-level Schwarz methods for Maxwell's equations in strip-wise domain decompositions, focusing on waveguides with general cross sections and different types of transmission conditions such as impedance or perfectly matched layers (PMLs). By combining techniques from the limiting spectrum analysis of Toeplitz matrices and the modal decomposition of Maxwell's solutions, we provide a novel theoretical framework that extends previous work to more complex geometries and transmission conditions. Numerical experiments confirm that the limiting spectrum effectively predicts practical behavior even with a modest number of subdomains. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the one-level Schwarz method can achieve robustness with respect to the wave number under specific domain decomposition parameters, offering new insights into its applicability for large-scale electromagnetic wave problems.</description>

      <title>Controlling curvature of self-assembling surfaces via patchy particle design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Curved structures in soft matter and biological systems commonly emerge as a result of self-assembly processes where building blocks aggregate in a controlled manner, giving rise to specific system structure and properties. Learning how to precisely tune the curved geometry of these assemblies can in turn elucidate new ways of controlling their functionality. We discuss how one can target self-assembly into surfaces with specified Gaussian curvature in a one-component system of model patchy particles. Given the vast design space of potential patch distributions, we address the problem using an inverse design approach based on automatic differentiation and develop an optimization scheme which solves the exploding gradients problem that arises when we differentiate through long molecular dynamics trajectories. We discuss the model requirements for successful optimization, determine the significant hyperparameter choices influencing algorithm performance and, finally, we demonstrate that we can consistently design patch patterns for assembly into clusters with different target curvature radii.</description>

      <title>Refined radial basis function-generated finite difference analysis of non-Newtonian natural convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.08095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a refined Radial Basis Function-generated Finite Difference (RBF-FD) solution for a non-Newtonian fluid in a closed differentially heated cavity. The non-Newtonian behaviour is modelled with the Ostwald-de Waele power law and the buoyancy with the Boussinesq approximation. The problem domain is discretised with scattered nodes without any requirement for a topological relation between them. This allows a trivial generalisation of the solution procedure to complex irregular three dimensional (3D) domains, which is also demonstrated by solving the problem in a two dimensional (2D) and 3D geometry mimicking a porous filter. The results in 2D are compared with two reference solutions that use the Finite volume method in a conjunction with two different stabilisation techniques, where we achieved good agreement with the reference data. The refinement is implemented on top of a dedicated meshless node positioning algorithm using piecewise linear node density function that ensures sufficient node density in the centre of the domain while maximising the node density in a boundary layer where the most intense dynamic is expected. The results show that with a refined approach, more than 5 times fewer nodes are required to obtain the results with the same accuracy compared to the regular discretisation. The paper also discusses the convergence with refined discretisation for different scenarios for up to $2 \cdot 10^5$ nodes, the impact of method parametres, the behaviour of the flow in the boundary layer, the behaviour of the viscosity and the geometric flexibility of the proposed solution procedure.</description>

      <title>Compositional phase stability in medium-entropy and high-entropy Cantor-Wu alloys from an ab initio all-electron, Landau-type theory and atomistic modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe implementation and analysis of a first-principles theory, derived in an earlier work, for the leading terms in an expansion of a Gibbs free energy of a multi-component alloy in terms of order parameters that characterize potential, compositional phases. The theory includes effects of rearranging charge and other electronics from changing atomic occupancies on lattice sites. As well as the rigorous description of atomic short-range order in the homogeneously disordered phase, pairwise interaction parameters suited for atomistic modelling in a multicomponent setting can be calculated. From our study of an indicative series of the Cantor-Wu alloys, NiCo, NiCoCr, NiCoFeCr, and NiCoFeMnCr, we find that the interactions are not approximated well either as pseudobinary or restricted to nearest neighbour range. Our computed order-disorder transition temperatures are low, consistent with experimental observations, and the nature of the ordering is dominated by correlations between Ni, Co, and Cr, while Fe and Mn interact weakly. Further atomistic modelling suggests that there is no true single-phase low-temperature ground state for these multicomponent systems. Instead the single-phase solid solution is kept stable to low temperatures by the large configurational entropy and the Fe, Mn dilution effects. The computationally cost-effectiveness of our method makes it a good candidate for further exploration of the space of multicomponent alloys.</description>

      <title>Revealing Symmetry-Broken Superconducting Configurations by Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00719v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A coherent theory for the superconductivity of both conventional and unconventional superconductors is currently lacking. Here we show that superconductivity arises from the formation of a symmetry-broken superconducting configuration (SCC) due to atomic perturbation of the normal conducting configuration (NCC). This perturbation creates straight one-dimensional tunnels (SODTs) for charge density of electrons and/or holes as revealed by the calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). The SODTs act as resistance-free superhighways and are correlated to the Cooper pairs in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. The formation of SODTs implies that the electron-phonon interaction in the BCS theory can be represented by the difference in charge densities between SCC and NCC predicted by DFT. The present work highlights that in conventional superconductors, SODTs are embedded within the bulk materials and are easily destroyed by phonon vibrations, resulting in a low critical superconducting temperature (T_C). Conversely, in unconventional superconductors such as YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO7), SODTs are protected by a layered pontoon structure with very weak bonding to the bulk materials, maintaining SODTs' stability at higher temperatures and leading to a much higher T_C. The present approach is validated for 13 conventional superconductors of 18 pure elements examined in this work, including the presently predicted superconductivity in Cu, Ag, Au, Sb, and Bi at 0 K and 0 GPa, and one unconventional superconductor of YBCO7. Our discovery indicates that DFT can be a practical tool for predicting superconductors, enabling a systematic search for new superconducting materials in the future.</description>

      <title>High-order limiting methods using maximum principle bounds derived from the Boltzmann equation I: Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of limiting methods for high-order numerical approximations of hyperbolic conservation laws generally requires defining an admissible region/bounds for the solution. In this work, we present a novel approach for computing solution bounds and limiting for the Euler equations through the kinetic representation provided by the Boltzmann equation, which allows for extending limiters designed for linear advection directly to the Euler equations. Given an arbitrary set of solution values to compute bounds over (e.g., numerical stencil) and a desired linear advection limiter, the proposed approach yields an analytic expression for the admissible region of particle distribution function values, which may be numerically integrated to yield a set of bounds for the density, momentum, and total energy. These solution bounds are shown to preserve positivity of density/pressure/internal energy and, when paired with a limiting technique, can robustly resolve strong discontinuities while recovering high-order accuracy in smooth regions without any ad hoc corrections (e.g., relaxing the bounds). This approach is demonstrated in the context of an explicit unstructured high-order discontinuous Galerkin/flux reconstruction scheme for a variety of difficult problems in gas dynamics, including cases with extreme shocks and shock-vortex interactions. Furthermore, this work presents a foundation for limiting techniques for more complex macroscopic governing equations that can be derived from an underlying kinetic representation for which admissible solution bounds are not well-understood.</description>

      <title>CNN-Based Vortex Detection in Atomic 2D Bose Gases in the Presence of a Phononic Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum vortices play a crucial role in both equilibrium and dynamical phenomena in two-dimensional (2D) superfluid systems. Experimental detection of these excitations in 2D ultracold atomic gases typically involves examining density depletions in absorption images, however the presence of a significant phononic background renders the problem challenging, beyond the capability of simple algorithms or the human eye. Here, we utilize a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect vortices in the presence of strong long- and intermediate-length scale density modulations in finite-temperature 2D Bose gases. We train the model on datasets obtained from ab initio Monte Carlo simulations using the classical-field method for density and phase fluctuations, and Gross-Pitaevskii simulation of realistic expansion dynamics. We use the model to analyze experimental images and benchmark its performance by comparing the results to the matter-wave interferometric detection of vortices, confirming the observed scaling of vortex density across the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) critical point. The combination of a relevant simulation pipeline with machine-learning methods is a key development towards the comprehensive understanding of complex vortex-phonon dynamics in out-of-equilibrium 2D quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09800v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next-generation reservoir computing (NG-RC) has attracted much attention due to its excellent performance in spatio-temporal forecasting of complex systems and its ease of implementation. This paper shows that NG-RC can be encoded as a kernel ridge regression that makes training efficient and feasible even when the space of chosen polynomial features is very large. Additionally, an extension to an infinite number of covariates is possible, which makes the methodology agnostic with respect to the lags into the past that are considered as explanatory factors, as well as with respect to the number of polynomial covariates, an important hyperparameter in traditional NG-RC. We show that this approach has solid theoretical backing and good behavior based on kernel universality properties previously established in the literature. Various numerical illustrations show that these generalizations of NG-RC outperform the traditional approach in several forecasting applications.</description>

      <title>Optimal multipole center for subwavelength acoustic scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multipole expansion is a powerful framework for analyzing how subwavelength-size objects scatter waves in optics or acoustics. The calculation of multipole moments traditionally uses the scatterer's center of mass as the reference point. The theoretical foundation of this heuristic convention remains an open question. Here, we challenge this convention by demonstrating that a different, optimal multipole center can yield superior results. The optimal center is crucial -- it allows us to accurately express the scattering response while retaining a minimum number of multipole moments. Our analytical technique for finding the optimal multipole centers of individual scatterers, both in isolation and within finite arrays, is validated through numerical simulations. Our findings reveal that such an optimized positioning significantly reduces quadrupole contributions, enabling more accurate monopole-dipole approximations in acoustic calculations. Our approach also improves the computational efficiency of the T-matrix method, offering practical benefits for metamaterial design and analysis.</description>

Abstract: We present a tensorization algorithm for constructing tensor train representations of functions, drawing on sketching and cross interpolation ideas. The method only requires black-box access to the target function and a small set of sample points defining the domain of interest. Thus, it is particularly well-suited for machine learning models, where the domain of interest is naturally defined by the training dataset. We show that this approach can be used to enhance the privacy and interpretability of neural network models. Specifically, we apply our decomposition to (i) obfuscate neural networks whose parameters encode patterns tied to the training data distribution, and (ii) estimate topological phases of matter that are easily accessible from the tensor train representation. Additionally, we show that this tensorization can serve as an efficient initialization method for optimizing tensor trains in general settings, and that, for model compression, our algorithm achieves a superior trade-off between memory and time complexity compared to conventional tensorization methods of neural networks.</description>
