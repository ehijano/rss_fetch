      <title>Rough SABR Forward Market Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper advances interest rate modeling in the post-LIBOR era by introducing rough stochastic volatility into the Forward Market Model (FMM). We establish a rigorous asymptotic expansion of swaption implied volatility, connecting the FMM to a rough Bergomi-type framework for forward swap rates. This contribution bridges the gap between Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM)-consistent forward term rate models and forward swap rate models with stochastic volatility, offering a parsimonious yet precise framework for modeling swaption volatility surfaces. Furthermore, we justify and generalize the widely used "freezing" approximation within a rigorous mathematical framework. The proposed approach enhances the representation of persistent skew and term structure, addressing key challenges in modern fixed income markets.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Convergence for Variational Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an approach to applying neural networks on linear parabolic variational inequalities. We use loss functions that directly incorporate the variational inequality on the whole domain to bypass the need to determine the stopping region in advance and prove the existence of neural networks whose losses converge to zero. We also prove the functional convergence in the Sobolev space. We then apply our approach to solving an optimal investment and stopping problem in finance. By leveraging duality, we convert the nonlinear HJB-type variational inequality of the primal problem into a linear variational inequality of the dual problem and prove the convergence of the primal value function from the dual neural network solution, an outcome made possible by our Sobolev norm analysis. We illustrate the versatility and accuracy of our method with numerical examples for both power and non-HARA utilities as well as high-dimensional American put option pricing. Our results underscore the potential of neural networks for solving variational inequalities in optimal stopping and control problems.</description>

      <title>Exponential Hedging for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process in the Presence of Linear Price Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study a continuous time exponential utility maximization problem in the presence of a linear temporary price impact. More precisely, for the case where the risky asset is given by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusion process we compute the optimal portfolio strategy and the corresponding value. Our method of solution relies on duality, and it is purely probabilistic.</description>

      <title>A discretization scheme for path-dependent FBSDEs and PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study develops a numerical scheme for path-dependent FBSDEs and PDEs. We introduce a Picard iteration method for solving path-dependent FBSDEs, prove its convergence to the true solution, and establish its rate of convergence. A key contribution of our approach is a novel estimator for the martingale integrand in the FBSDE, specifically designed to handle path-dependence more reliably than existing methods. We derive a concentration inequality that quantifies the statistical error of this estimator in a Monte Carlo framework. Based on these results, we investigate a supervised learning method with neural networks for solving path-dependent PDEs. The proposed algorithm is fully implementable and adaptable to a broad class of path-dependent problems.</description>
