      <title>Modeling the Far-Infrared Polarization Spectrum of a High-Mass Star Forming Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarization spectrum, or wavelength dependence of the polarization fraction, of interstellar dust emission provides important insights into the grain alignment mechanism of interstellar dust grains. We investigate the far-infrared polarization spectrum of a realistic simulated high-mass star forming cloud under various models of grain alignment and emission. We find that neither a homogeneous grain alignment model nor a grain alignment model that includes collisional dealignment is able to produce the falling spectrum seen in observations. On the other hand, we find that a grain alignment model with grain alignment efficiency dependent on local temperature is capable of producing a falling spectrum that is in qualitative agreement with observations of OMC-1. For the model most in agreement with OMC-1, we find no correlation between temperature and the slope of the polarization spectrum. However, we do find a positive correlation between column density and the slope of the polarization spectrum. We suggest this latter correlation to be the result of wavelength-dependent polarization by absorption.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen Abundance Distribution in the inner Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine a new Galactic plane survey of Hydrogen Radio Recombination Lines (RRLs) with far-infrared (FIR) surveys of ionized Nitrogen, N+, to determine Nitrogen abundance across Galactic radius. RRLs were observed with NASA DSS-43 70m antenna and the Green Bank Telescope in 108 lines-of-sight spanning -135 degrees &lt; l &lt; 60 degrees, at b=0 degrees. These positions were also observed in [N II] 122 um and 205 um lines with the Herschel Space Observatory. Combining RRL and [N II] 122 um and 205 um observations in 41 of 108 samples with high signal-to-noise ratio, we studied ionized Nitrogen abundance distribution across Galactocentric distances of 0-8 kpc. Combined with existing Solar neighborhood and Outer galaxy N/H abundance determinations, we studied this quantity's distribution within the Milky Way's inner 17 kpc for the first time. We found a Nitrogen abundance gradient extending from Galactocentric radii of 4-17 kpc in the Galactic plane, while within 0-4 kpc, the N/H distribution remained flat. The gradient observed at large Galactocentric distances supports inside-out galaxy growth with the additional steepening resulting from variable star formation efficiency and/or radial flows in the Galactic disk, while the inner 4 kpc flattening, coinciding with the Galactic bar's onset, may be linked to radial flows induced by the bar potential. Using SOFIA/FIFI-LS and Herschel/PACS, we observed the [N III] 57 um line to trace doubly ionized gas contribution in a sub-sample of sightlines. We found negligible N++ contributions along these sightlines, suggesting mostly singly ionized Nitrogen originating from low ionization H II region outskirts.</description>

      <title>Efficient and accurate force replay in cosmological-baryonic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct time-evolving gravitational potential models for a Milky Way-mass galaxy from the FIRE-2 suite of cosmological-baryonic simulations using basis function expansions. These models capture the angular variation with spherical harmonics for the halo and azimuthal harmonics for the disk, and the radial or meridional plane variation with splines. We fit low-order expansions (4 angular/harmonic terms) to the galaxy's potential for each snapshot, spaced roughly 25 Myr apart, over the last 4 Gyr of its evolution, then extract the forces at discrete times and interpolate them between adjacent snapshots for forward orbit integration. Our method reconstructs the forces felt by simulation particles with high fidelity, with 95% of both stars and dark matter, outside of self-gravitating subhalos, exhibiting errors $\leq4\%$ in both the disk and the halo. Imposing symmetry on the model systematically increases these errors, particularly for disk particles, which show greater sensitivity to imposed symmetries. The majority of orbits recovered using the models exhibit positional errors $\leq10\%$ for 2-3 orbital periods, with higher errors for orbits that spend more time near the galactic center. Approximate integrals of motion are retrieved with high accuracy even with a larger potential sampling interval of 200 Myr. After 4 Gyr of integration, 43% and 70% of orbits have total energy and angular momentum errors within 10%, respectively. Consequently, there is higher reliability in orbital shape parameters such as pericenters and apocenters, with errors $\sim10\%$ even after multiple orbital periods. These techniques have diverse applications, including studying satellite disruption in cosmological contexts.</description>

      <title>Lopsidedness in Early-Type Galaxies: the role of the $m=1$ multipole in Isophote Fitting and Strong Lens Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface brightness distribution of massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) often deviates from a perfectly elliptical shape. To capture these deviations in their isophotes during an ellipse fitting analysis, Fourier modes of order $m = 3, 4$ are often used. In such analyses the centre of each ellipse is treated as a free parameter, which may result in offsets from the centre of light, particularly for ellipses in the outer regions. This complexity is not currently accounted for in the mass models used in either strong gravitational lensing or galactic dynamical studies. In this work, we adopt a different approach, using the $m=1$ Fourier mode to account for this complexity while keeping the centres of all perturbed ellipses fixed, showing that it fits the data equally well. We applied our method to the distribution of light emission to a sample of ETGs from the MASSIVE survey and found that the majority have low $m_1$ amplitudes, below 2 percent. Five out of the 30 galaxies we analysed have high $m_1$ amplitudes, ranging from 2 to 10 percent in the outer parts ($R \gtrsim 3$ kpc), all of which have a physically associated companion. Based on our findings, we advocate the use of the $m=1$ multipole in the mass models used in strong lensing and dynamical studies, particularly for galaxies with recent or ongoing interactions.</description>

      <title>Examining partial ergodicity as a predictor of star formation departures from the galactic main sequence in isolated galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lacking the ability to follow individual galaxies on cosmological timescales, our understanding of individual galaxy evolution is broadly inferred from population trends and behaviours. In its most prohibitive form, this approach assumes that galactic star formation properties exhibit ergodicity, so that individual galaxy evolution can be statistically inferred via ensemble behaviours. The validity of this assumption is tested through the use of observationally motivated simulations of isolated galaxies. The suite of simulated galaxies is statistically constructed to match observed galaxy properties by using kernel density estimation to create structural parameter distributions, augmented by theoretical relationships where necessary. We also test the impact of different physical processes, such as stellar winds or the presence of halo substructure on the star formation behaviour. We consider the subtleties involved in constraining ergodic properties, such as the distinction between stationarity imposed by stellar wind feedback and truly ergodic behaviour. However, without sufficient variability in star formation properties, individual galaxies are unable to explore the full parameter space. While, as expected, full ergodicity appears to be ruled out, we find reasonable evidence for partial ergodicity, where averaging over mass-selected subsets of galaxies more broadly resembles time averages, where the average largest deviation across physical scenarios is 0.20 dex. As far as we are aware, this the first time partial ergodicity has been considered in an astronomical context, and provides a promising statistical concept. Despite morphological changes introduced by close encounters with dark matter substructure, subhaloes are not found to significantly increase deviations from ergodic assumptions.</description>

      <title>MC-BLOS: Determination of the Line-of-Sight Component of Magnetic Fields Associated with Molecular Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years a number of surveys and telescopes have observed the plane-of-sky component of magnetic fields associated with molecular clouds. However, observations of their line-of-sight magnetic field remain limited. To address this issue, Tahani et al. (2018) developed a technique based on Faraday rotation. The technique incorporates an ON-OFF approach to identify the rotation measure induced by the magnetic fields associated with the cloud. The upcoming abundance of Faraday rotation observations from the Square Kilometer Array and its pathfinders necessitates robustly-tested software to automatically obtain line-of-sight magnetic fields of molecular clouds. We developed software, called MC-BLOS (Molecular Cloud Line-of-Sight Magnetic Field), to carry out the technique in an automated manner. The software's input are Faraday rotation of point sources (extra-galactic sources or pulsars), extinction or column density maps, chemical evolution code results, and a text/CSV file, which allows the user to specify the cloud name or other parameters pertaining to the technique. For each cloud, the software invokes a set of predefined initial parameters such as density, temperature, and surrounding boundary, which the user can modify. The software then runs the technique automatically, outputting line-of-sight magnetic field maps and tables (including uncertainties) at the end of the process. This automated approach significantly reduces analysis time compared to manual methods. We have tested the software on previously-published clouds, and the results are consistent within the reported uncertainty range. This software will facilitate the analysis of forthcoming Faraday rotation observations, enabling a better understanding of the role of magnetic fields in molecular cloud dynamics and star formation.</description>

      <title>A hidden AGN powering bright [O III] nebulae in a protocluster core at $z=4.5$ revealed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of the J1000+0234 system at $z=4.54$, the dense core of a galaxy protocluster hosting a massive, dusty star forming galaxy (DSFG) with a low luminosity radio counterpart. The new data reveals two extended, high equivalent width (EW$_0 &gt; 1000$ {\AA}) nebulae at each side of the DSFG disk along its minor axis (namely O3-N and O3-S). On one hand, O3-N's spectrum shows a prominent FWHM $\sim1300$ km s$^{-1}$ broad and blueshifted component, suggesting an outflow origin. On the other hand, O3-S stretches over parsec and has a velocity gradient that spans $800$ km s$^{-1}$ but no evidence of a broad component. Both sources, however, seem to be powered at least partially by an active galactic nucleus (AGN), so we classify them as extended emission-line regions (EELRs). The strongest evidence comes from the detection of the high-ionization [Ne V] $\lambda3427$ line toward O3-N, which paired with the non-detection of hard X-rays implies an obscuring column density above the Compton-thick regime. In O3-S, the [Ne V] line is not detected, but we measure a He II well above the expectation for star formation. We interpret this as O3-S being externally irradiated by the AGN, akin to the famous Hanny's Voorwerp object in the local Universe. In addition, more classical line ratio diagnostics (e.g. [O III]/H$\beta$ vs [N II]/H$\alpha$) put the DSFG itself in the AGN region of the diagrams, and hence the most probable host of the AGN. These results showcase the ability of JWST of unveiling highly obscured AGN at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>Methane Formation Efficiency on Icy Gains: Role of Adsorption States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methane (CH4) is one of the major components of the icy mantle of cosmic dust prevalent in cold, dense regions of interstellar media, playing an important role in the synthesis of complex organic molecules and prebiotic molecules. Solid CH4 is considered to be formed via the successive hydrogenation of C atoms accreting onto dust: C + 4H -&gt; CH4. However, most astrochemical models assume this reaction on the ice mantles of dust to be barrierless and efficient, without considering the states of adsorption. Recently, we found that C atoms exist in either the physisorbed or chemisorbed state on compact amorphous solid water, which is analogous to an interstellar ice mantle. These distinct adsorption states considerably affect the hydrogenation reactivity of the C atom. Herein, we elucidate the reactivities of physisorbed and chemisorbed C atoms with H atoms via sequential deposition and co-deposition processes. The results indicate that only physisorbed C atoms can produce CH4 on ice. Combining this finding with a previous estimate for the fraction of physisorbed C atoms on ice, we determined the upper limit for the conversion of C atoms into CH4 to be 30%.</description>

      <title>Towards a complete picture of the Sco-Cen outflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies have shown strong evidence that the Sun is crossing an outflow originating from the Sco-Cen OB association. Understanding this outflow's origin and structure illuminates how massive star formation shapes the interstellar medium (ISM) and helps predict future Galactic conditions affecting our Solar System. We analysed H I emission and optical ISM absorption lines towards 47 early-type stars around the Upper Sco region to refine the map of the Sco-Cen outflow. Combined with data for nearby stars, we find that the outflow has at least two components: a faster, low-density component traced by Ca II, and a slower, possibly lower-density component traced by Mg II and Fe II in the UV that is passing through the Earth. A constant flow model successfully describes both components with $(l,b,|\vec{v}|) = (335.4^{\circ}, -6.8^{\circ}, 14.0 \,\,\textrm{km}\,\textrm{s}^{-1})$ and $(305.5^{\circ}, +17.6^{\circ}, 21.2\,\,\textrm{km}\,\textrm{s}^{-1})$, respectively. The origin of the faster component points towards the Sco-Cen 15 Myr population, which is consistent with the origin of the slower component within 2 $\sigma$. A simple model comparison indicates that a constant flow is favoured over a spherical flow geometry, implying an extended distribution of feedback sources within Sco-Cen. We also found that a poorly studied 25 pc long H I cloud at a distance of 107 pc belongs to the established Sco-Cen flow.</description>

      <title>Detection of maser emission at 183 and 380 GHz with ALMA in the gigamaser galaxy TXS2226-184</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LINER galaxy TXS2226-184 is known to host a very luminous 22 GHz water maser, labeled as 'gigamaser' at the time of its discovery. So far, the nature of this maser is still debated, in particular, if it is associated with a nuclear accretion disk, or with an ejection component, namely a jet or an outflow originating in the AGN. We have obtained multi-band (band 5, 6, and 7) ALMA observations during Cycle 9, with the purpose of investigating the maser nature and the nuclear molecular material in the innermost region of the galaxy. While the full data sets are still under study, a preliminary data reduction and analysis of the band 5 and 7 spectral line cubes, presented in this Letter, offer already a significant outcome. We observed, bright, possibly maser emission from the 183 GHz and 380 GHz transitions in TXS2226-184. This represents the first confident detection of 380 GHz (maser) emission in an extragalactic object. Emission features at both frequencies show a two-peaked line profiles resembling that of the 22 GHz maser features. The mm/sub-mm emission originates from a region coincident, within the errors, with that of the 22 GHz. The similarities in profile and position indicate that the emission at the three frequencies is likely produced by the same nuclear structure, although differences in line strengths and feature peak positions may hint a slightly different physical conditions of the emitting gas. A comparison with the few megamaser sources studied into high-enough details and sharing similarities with the water lines in TXS2226-184, favors a nature associated with amplification of a bright nuclear continuum (from a jet/outflow) through dense and hot gas in front of the nucleus (e.g., a disk or torus), however, a more comprehensive analysis of the available data is necessary to better assess this scenario.</description>

      <title>First Direct Evidence for Keplerian Rotation in Quasar Inner Broad Line Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method to derive rotation curves with light-day spatial resolution of the inner regions of lensed quasars. We aim to probe the kinematics of the inner part of the broad-line region (BLR) by resolving the microlensing response - a proxy for the size of the emitting region - in the wings of the broad emission lines (BELs). Specifically, we assess the strength of the microlensing effects in the wings of the high-ionization lines Si IV and C IV across various velocity bins in five gravitationally lensed quasars: SDSS J1001+5027, SDSS J1004+4112, HE 1104$-$1805, SDSS J1206+4332, and SDSS J1339+1310. Using Bayesian methods to estimate the dimensions of the corresponding emission regions and adopting a Keplerian model as our baseline, we examine the consistency of the hypothesis of disk-like rotation. Our results reveal a monotonic, smooth increase in microlensing magnification with velocity. The deduced velocity-size relationships inferred for the various quasars and emission lines closely conform to the Keplerian model of an inclined disk. This study provides the first direct evidence of Keplerian rotation in the innermost region of quasars across a range of radial distances spanning from $\sim$5 to 20 light-days.</description>

      <title>Processing of hydrocarbon dust in star-forming galaxies revealed with AKARI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrocarbon dust is one of the dominant components of interstellar dust, which mainly consists of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and aliphatic hydrocarbons. While hydrocarbon dust is thought to be processed in interstellar radiation fields or shocks, detailed processing mechanisms are not completely understood yet. We investigate the processing of hydrocarbon dust by analyzing the relation between the luminosities emitted by hydrocarbon dust and the total infrared luminosities $(L_{\mathrm{IR}})$ for 138 star-forming galaxies at redshift $z\ &lt;\ 0.3$. Using near-infrared 2.5-5 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ spectra obtained with AKARI, we derived the luminosities of the aromatic hydrocarbon feature at 3.3 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ ($L_\mathrm{aromatic}$) and the aliphatic hydrocarbon feature at 3.4-3.6 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ ($L_\mathrm{aliphatic}$). We also derived $L_\mathrm{IR}$ and the radiation field strength by modeling the spectral energy distributions of the 138 galaxies with AKARI, WISE and IRAS photometry data. We find that galaxies with higher $L_\mathrm{IR}$ tend to exhibit lower $L_\mathrm{aliphatic}/L_\mathrm{aromatic}$ ratios. Furthermore, we find that there is an anti-correlation between $L_\mathrm{aliphatic}/L_\mathrm{aromatic}$ ratios and the radiation field strength, and also that the galaxies with low $L_\mathrm{aliphatic}/L_\mathrm{aromatic}$ ratios are dominated by merger galaxies. These results support that hydrocarbon dust is processed through photodissociation in strong radiation fields and/or shocks during merging processes of galaxies; the $L_\mathrm{aliphatic}/L_\mathrm{aromatic}$ ratio is likely to decrease in such harsh interstellar conditions since the aliphatic bonds are known to be chemically weaker than the aromatic bonds.</description>

      <title>VLTI/GRAVITY Interferometric Measurements of Innermost Dust Structure Sizes around AGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new VLTI/GRAVITY near-infrared interferometric measurements of the angular size of the innermost hot dust continuum for 14 type 1 AGNs. The angular sizes are resolved on scales of ~0.7 mas and the inferred ring radii range from 0.028 to 1.33 pc, comparable to those reported previously and a factor 10-20 smaller than the mid-infrared sizes in the literature. Combining our new data with previously published values, we compile a sample of 25 AGN with bolometric luminosity ranging from $10^{42}$ to $10^{47} \rm erg~s^{-1}$, with which we study the radius-luminosity (R-L) relation for the hot dust structure. Our interferometric measurements of radius are offset by a factor 2 from the equivalent relation derived through reverberation mapping. Using a simple model to explore the dust structure's geometry, we conclude that this offset can be explained if the 2 um emitting surface has a concave shape. Our data show that the slope of the relation is in line with the canonical $R \propto L^{0.5}$ when using an appropriately non-linear correction for bolometric luminosity. In contrast, using optical luminosity or applying a constant bolometric correction to it results in a significant deviation in the slope, suggesting a potential luminosity dependence on the spectral energy distribution. Over four orders of magnitude in luminosity, the intrinsic scatter around the R-L relation is 0.2 dex, suggesting a tight correlation between innermost hot dust structure size and the AGN luminosity.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the full Spitzer microlensing sample I: Dark remnant candidates and Gaia predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the pursuit of understanding the population of stellar remnants within the Milky Way, we analyze the sample of $\sim 950$ microlensing events observed by the Spitzer Space Telescope between 2014 and 2019. In this study we focus on a sub-sample of nine microlensing events, selected based on their long timescales, small microlensing parallaxes and joint observations by the Gaia mission, to increase the probability that the chosen lenses are massive and the mass is measurable. Among the selected events we identify lensing black holes and neutron star candidates, with potential confirmation through forthcoming release of the Gaia time-series astrometry in 2026. Utilizing Bayesian analysis and Galactic models, along with the Gaia Data Release 3 proper motion data, four good candidates for dark remnants were identified: OGLE-2016-BLG-0293, OGLE-2018-BLG-0483, OGLE-2018-BLG-0662, and OGLE-2015-BLG-0149, with lens masses of $2.98^{+1.75}_{-1.28}~M_{\odot}$, $4.65^{+3.12}_{-2.08}~M_{\odot}$, $3.15^{+0.66}_{-0.64}~M_{\odot}$ and $1.4^{+0.75}_{-0.55}~M_{\odot}$, respectively. Notably, the first two candidates are expected to exhibit astrometric microlensing signals detectable by Gaia, offering the prospect of validating the lens masses. The methodologies developed in this work will be applied to the full Spitzer microlensing sample, populating and analyzing the time-scale ($t_{\rm E}$) vs. parallax ($\pi_{\rm E}$) diagram to derive constraints on the population of lenses in general and massive remnants in particular.</description>

      <title>On the consistency of rotation curves and spatially integrated HI flux profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resolved rotation curves (RCs) are the gold-standard measurements for inferring dark matter distributions in $\Lambda$CDM and testing alternative theories of dynamics in galaxies. However they are expensive to obtain, making them prohibitive for large galaxy samples and at higher redshift. Spatially integrated HI flux profiles are more accessible and present the information in a different form, but -- except in a highly compressed form, as linewidths -- have not so far been compared in detail with RCs or employed for dynamical inferences. Here we study the consistency of RCs and HI surface density profiles from SPARC with spatially integrated HI flux profiles from ALFALFA, by combining the resolved properties in a forward model for the flux profile. We define a new metric for asymmetry in the flux profiles, enabling us to cleanly identify those unsuitable for our axisymmetric method. Among all SPARC galaxies the agreement between RCs and flux profiles is satisfactory within the limitations of the data -- with most galaxies having an uncertainty normalised mean squared error (MSE) below 10 -- while no galaxy deemed symmetric has a MSE above 1.2. Most cases of good agreement prefer a HI gas dispersion $\sigma_{\mathrm{HI}}$ of ~13 km/s, consistent with resolved studies of gas dispersion from the literature. These results open the door for spatially integrated HI flux profiles to be used as proxies for spatially resolved dynamics, including a robust appraisal of the degree of asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Investigating the nuclear properties of highly accreting active galactic nuclei with XMM-Newton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our understanding of highly accreting AGNs is hampered by the lack of a complete systematic investigation in terms of their main spectral and variability properties, and by the relative paucity of them in the local Universe, especially those powered by supermassive black holes with $M_\mathrm{BH} &gt; 10^8\,M_\odot$. To overcome this limitation, we present here the X-ray spectral analysis of a new, large sample of 61 highly accreting AGNs named as the \emph{XMM-Newton} High-Eddington Serendipitous AGN Sample, or X-HESS, obtained by cross-correlating the 11th release of the \emph{XMM-Newton} serendipitous catalogue and the catalogue of spectral properties of quasars from the SDSS DR14. The X-HESS AGNs are spread across wide intervals with a redshift of $0.06&lt;z&lt;3.3$, a black hole mass of $6.8&lt;\log(M_\mathrm{BH}/M_\odot)&lt;9.8$, a bolometric luminosity of $44.7&lt;\log(L_\mathrm{bol}/\mathrm{erg\,s}^{-1})&lt;48.3$, and an Eddington ratio of $-0.2&lt;\log\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}&lt;0.5$, and more than one third of these AGNs can rely on multiple observations at different epochs, allowing us to investigate also their variability. We find a large scatter in the $\Gamma - \lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$ distribution of the highly accreting X-HESS AGNs. A significant correlation is only found by considering a sample of lower-\ledd\ AGNs with $\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}\lesssim0.3$. The $\Gamma - \lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$ relation appears to be more statistically sound for AGNs with lower $M_\mathrm{BH}$ and/or $L_\mathrm{bol}$. We investigate the possibility of transforming the $\Gamma - \lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$ plane into a fully epoch-dependent frame by calculating the Eddington ratio from the simultaneous optical/UV data from the optical monitor, $\lambda_\mathrm{Edd,O/UV}$. Finally, we also get a mild indication of a possible anti-correlation between $\Gamma$ and the strength of the soft excess.</description>

      <title>Detecting low-mass haloes with strong gravitational lensing II: constraints on the density profiles of two detected subhaloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing can detect the presence of low-mass haloes and subhaloes through their effect on the surface brightness of lensed arcs. We carry out an extended analysis of the density profiles and mass distributions of two detected subhaloes, intending to determine if their properties are consistent with the predictions of the cold dark matter (CDM) model. We analyse two gravitational lensing systems in which the presence of two low-mass subhaloes has been previously reported: SDSSJ0946+1006 and JVASB1938+66. We model these detections assuming four different models for their density profiles and compare our results with predictions from the IllustrisTNG50-1 simulation. We find that the detected subhaloes are well-modelled by steep inner density slopes, close to or steeper than isothermal. The NFW profile thus needs extremely high concentrations to reproduce the observed properties, which are outliers of the CDM predictions. We also find a characteristic radius within which the best-fitting density profiles predict the same enclosed mass. We conclude that the lens modelling can constrain this quantity more robustly than the inner slope. We find that the diversity of subhalo profiles in TNG50, consistent with tidally stripping and baryonic effects, is able to match the observed steep inner slopes, somewhat alleviating the tension reported by previous works even if the detections are not well fit by the typical subhalo. However, while we find simulated analogues of the detection in B1938+666, the stellar content required by simulations to explain the central density of the detection in J0946+1006 is in tension with the upper limit in luminosity estimated from the observations. New detections will increase our statistical sample and help us reveal more about the density profiles of these objects and the dark matter content of the Universe.</description>

      <title>LAMA: LAMOST Medium-Resolution Spectral Analysis Pipeline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) has obtained more than 23 million spectra, opening an unprecedented opportunity to study stellar physics, as well as the formation and evolution of our Milky Way. In order to obtain the accurate stellar parameters, we develop a LAMOST Medium-Resolution Spectral Analysis Pipeline (LAMA), which estimates the stellar parameters from the LAMOST medium-resolution spectra, including the effective temperature (Teff), surface gravity (logg), metallicity ([Fe/H]), radial velocity, and rotational velocity (vsini). LAMA estimates these parameters utilizing the template-matching method. The comparison between our results and those from the high-resolution ones, including APOGEE, GALAH, and PASTEL, shows no obvious bias, indicating the reliability of our results. The accuracy of Teff and [Fe/H] can reach 75 K and 0.12 dex, respectively, for the LAMOST Medium-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey (MRS) spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio higher than 10. For dwarfs, the uncertainty of logg is around 0.17 dex, while, for giants, it ranges from 0.18 to 0.30 dex, with the errors decreasing as logg increases. Using LAMA for the LAMOST-MRS spectra, we estimate the stellar parameters of 497,412 stars. This sample will be very helpful for investigating the formation and evolution of our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Circumbinary Disk Spectra Irradiated by Two Central Accretion Disks in a Binary Black Hole System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of irradiation from two accretion disks (minidisks) around respective black holes of stellar to intermediate masses in a circular binary on the spectrum of a circumbinary disk (CBD) surrounding them. We assume the CBD to be a standard disk and adopt the orbit-averaged irradiation flux because the viscous timescale is much longer than the orbital period. We then solve the energy equation both analytically and numerically to compute the CBD temperature distribution and the corresponding disk spectrum. We find that the analytically calculated spectra are in good agreement with the numerical ones. The CBD spectrum is almost independent of the binary mass ratio. We also find that the combined spectra of two minidisks and the CBD have double peaks, one peak in the soft X-ray band and the other in the infrared (IR) band. The former peak comes from the two minidisks, while the latter peak from the CBD. The observed flux density increases with frequency as $\nu^{1/3}$ towards the soft X-ray peak, while it decreases with frequency away from the IR peak as $\nu^{-5/3}$. The latter feature is testable with near-IR observations with Subaru and JWST.</description>

      <title>Kinematic constraints on the ages and kick velocities of Galactic neutron star binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The systems creating binary neutron stars (BNSs) experience systemic kicks when one of the components goes supernova. The combined magnitude of these kicks is still a topic of debate, and has implications for the eventual location of the transient resulting from the merger of the binary. For example, the offsets of short-duration gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) resulting from BNS mergers depend on the BNS kicks. We investigated Galactic BNSs, and traced their motion through the Galaxy. This enabled us to estimate their kinematic ages and construct a BNS kick distribution, based on their Galactic trajectories. We used the pulsar periods and their derivatives to estimate the characteristic spin-down ages of the binaries. Moreover, we used a Monte Carlo estimation of their present-day velocity vector in order to trace back their trajectory and estimate their kinematic ages. These trajectories, in turn, were used to determine the eccentricity of their Galactic orbit. Based on simulations of kicked objects in the Galactic potential, we investigated the relationship between this eccentricity and kick velocity, in order to constrain the kicks imparted to the binaries at birth. We find that the Galactic BNSs are likely older than $\sim40$ Myr, which means their current (scalar) galactocentric speeds are not representative of their initial kicks. However, we find a close relationship between the eccentricity of a Galactic trajectory and the experienced kick. Using this relation, we constrained the kicks of the Galactic BNSs, depending on the kind of isotropy assumed in estimating their velocity vectors. These kick velocities are well-described by a log-normal distribution peaking around $\sim40-50$ km/s, and coincide with the peculiar velocities of the binaries at their last disc crossing.</description>

      <title>Imaging the jet of MWC 349A with resolved Radio Recombination Line emission from ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jets and disk winds arise from materials with excess angular momentum ejected from the accretion disks in forming stars. How these structures are launched and how they impact the gas within the innermost regions of these objects remains poorly understood. MWC349A is a massive star that has a circumstellar disk which rotates in accord with Kepler's Law, with an ionized wind and a high-velocity jet launched from the disk surface. The strongly maser-amplified emission of hydrogen radio recombination lines (RRLs) observed toward this system provides a comprehensive picture of its ionized environment with exquisite detail. In this Letter, we present ALMA observations of the H26$\alpha$ RRL and continuum emission obtained with the highest angular resolution ever used toward this source (beam of $\sim$0.02"). The maser RRL emission is resolved for the first time and clearly delineates the ionized disk, wind and jet. We analyzed the RRL data cubes with the 3D non-LTE radiative transfer model MORELI, confirming that the jet is poorly collimated. We found that the jet orientation is closer to the rotation axis of the system than derived from spatially unresolved data. This study confirms that hydrogen RRL masers are powerful probes of the physical structure and kinematics of the innermost ionized material around massive stars.</description>

      <title>Predicting dark matter halo masses from simulated galaxy images and environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxies are theorized to form and co-evolve with their dark matter halos, such that their stellar masses and halo masses should be well-correlated. However, it is not known whether other observable galaxy features, such as their morphologies or large-scale environments, can be used to tighten the correlation between galaxy properties and halo masses. In this work, we train a baseline random forest model to predict halo mass using galaxy features from the Illustris TNG50 hydrodynamical simulation, and compare with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) trained respectively using galaxy image cutouts and galaxy point clouds. The best baseline model has a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.310 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.220, compared to the CNN (RSME=0.359, MAE=0.238), GNN (RMSE=0.248, MAE=0.158), and a novel combined CNN+GNN (RMSE=0.248, MAE=0.144). The CNN is likely limited by our small data set, and we anticipate that the CNN and CNN+GNN would benefit from training on larger cosmological simulations. We conclude that deep learning models can leverage information from galaxy appearances and environment, beyond commonly used summary statistics, in order to better predict the halo mass.</description>

      <title>A two-phase model of galaxy formation: I. The growth of galaxies and supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a model for galaxy formation and the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), based on the fact that cold dark matter (CDM) halos form their gravitational potential wells through a fast phase with rapid change in the potential, and that the high universal baryon fraction makes cooled gas in halos self-gravitating and turbulent before it can form rotation-supported disks. Gas fragmentation produces sub-clouds so dense that cloud-cloud collision and drag on clouds are not significant, producing a dynamically hot system of sub-clouds that form stars and move ballistically to feed the central SMBH. Active galactic nucleus (AGN) and supernova (SN) feedback is effective only in the fast phase, and the cumulative effects are to regulate star formation and SMBH growth, as well as to reduce the amount of cold gas in halos to allow the formation of globally stable disks. Using a set of halo assembly histories, we demonstrate that the model can reproduce a number of observations, including correlations among SMBH mass, stellar mass of galaxies and halo mass, the number densities of galaxies and SMBH, as well as their evolution over the cosmic time.</description>

      <title>The Heavy Metal Survey: Star Formation Constraints and Dynamical Masses of 21 Massive Quiescent Galaxies at $z=1.3-2.3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the Heavy Metal Survey, which obtained ultradeep medium-resolution spectra of 21 massive quiescent galaxies at $1.3&lt;z&lt;2.3$ with Keck/LRIS and MOSFIRE. With integration times of up to 16\,hr per band per galaxy, we observe numerous Balmer and metal absorption lines in atmospheric windows. We successfully derive spectroscopic redshifts for all 21 galaxies and for 19 we also measure stellar velocity dispersions ($\sigma_v$), ages, and elemental abundances, as detailed in an accompanying paper. Except for one emission-line active galactic nucleus, all galaxies are confirmed as quiescent through their faint or absent H$\alpha$ emission and evolved stellar spectra. For most galaxies exhibiting faint H$\alpha$, elevated [NII]/H$\alpha$ suggests a non-star-forming origin. We calculate dynamical masses ($M_{\rm dyn}$) by combining $\sigma_v$ with structural parameters obtained from HST/COSMOS(-DASH), and compare them with stellar masses ($M_*$) derived using spectrophotometric modeling, considering various assumptions. For a fixed initial mass function (IMF), we observe a strong correlation between $M_{\rm dyn}/M_*$ and $\sigma_v$. This correlation may suggest that a varying IMF, with high-$\sigma_v$ galaxies being more bottom heavy, was already in place at $z\sim2$. When implementing the $\sigma_v$-dependent IMF found in the cores of nearby early-type galaxies \textit{and} correcting for biases in our stellar mass and size measurements, we find a low scatter in $M_{\rm dyn}/M_*$ of 0.14 dex. However, these assumptions result in unphysical stellar masses, which exceed the dynamical masses by 34%. This tension suggests that distant quiescent galaxies do not simply grow inside-out into today's massive early-type galaxies and the evolution is more complicated.</description>

      <title>Measuring eccentricity and gas-induced perturbation from gravitational waves of LISA massive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We assess the possibility of detecting both eccentricity and gas effects (migration and accretion) in the gravitational wave (GW) signal from LISA massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) at redshift $z=1$. Gas induces a phase correction to the GW signal with an effective amplitude ($C_{\rm g}$) and a semi-major axis dependence (assumed to follow a power-law with slope $n_{\rm g}$). We use a complete model of the LISA response, and employ a gas-corrected post-Newtonian in-spiral-only waveform model TaylorF2Ecc By using the Fisher formalism and Bayesian inference, we constrain $C_{\rm g}$ together with the initial eccentricity $e_0$, the total redshifted mass $M_z$, the primary-to-secondary mass ratio $q$, the dimensionless spins $\chi_{1,2}$ of both component BHs, and the time of coalescence $t_c$. We find that simultaneously constraining $C_{\rm g}$ and $e_0$ leads to worse constraints on both parameters with respect to when considered individually. For a standard thin viscous accretion disc around $M_z=10^5~{\rm M}_\odot$, $q=8$, $\chi_{1,2}=0.9$, and $t_c=4$ years MBHB, we can confidently measure (with a relative error of $&lt;50 $ per cent) an Eddington ratio ${\rm f}_{\rm Edd}\sim0.1$ for a circular binary and ${\rm f}_{\rm Edd}\sim1$ for an eccentric system assuming ${O}(10)$ stronger gas torque near-merger than at the currently explored much-wider binary separations. The minimum measurable eccentricity is $e_0\gtrsim10^{-2.75}$ in vacuum and $e_0\gtrsim10^{-2}$ in gas. A weak environmental perturbation (${\rm f}_{\rm Edd}\lesssim1$) to a circular binary can be mimicked by an orbital eccentricity during in-spiral, implying that an electromagnetic counterpart would be required to confirm the presence of an accretion disc.</description>

      <title>The JWST-SUSPENSE Ultradeep Spectroscopic Program: Survey Overview and Star-Formation Histories of Quiescent Galaxies at 1 &lt; z &lt; 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an overview and first results from the Spectroscopic Ultradeep Survey Probing Extragalactic Near-infrared Stellar Emission (SUSPENSE), executed with NIRSpec on JWST. The primary goal of the SUSPENSE program is to characterize the stellar, chemical, and kinematic properties of massive quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon. In a single deep NIRSpec/MSA configuration, we target 20 distant quiescent galaxy candidates ($z=1-3$, $H_{AB}\le23$), as well as 53 star-forming galaxies at $z=1-4$. With 16~hr of integration and the G140M-F100LP dispersion-filter combination, we observe numerous Balmer and metal absorption lines for all quiescent candidates. We derive stellar masses (log$M_*/M_{\odot}\sim10.2-11.5$) and detailed star-formation histories (SFHs) and show that all 20 candidate quiescent galaxies indeed have quenched stellar populations. These galaxies show a variety of mass-weighted ages ($0.8-3.3$~Gyr) and star formation timescales ($\sim0.5-4$~Gyr), and four out of 20 galaxies were already quiescent by $z=3$. On average, the $z&gt;1.75$ $[z&lt;1.75]$ galaxies formed 50\% of their stellar mass before $z=4$ $[z=3]$. Furthermore, the typical SFHs of galaxies in these two redshift bins ($z_{\text{mean}}=2.2~[1.3]$) indicate that galaxies at higher redshift formed earlier and over shorter star-formation timescales compared to lower redshifts. Although this evolution is naturally explained by the growth of the quiescent galaxy population over cosmic time, number density calculations imply that mergers and/or late-time star formation also contribute to the evolution. In future work, we will further unravel the early formation, quenching, and late-time evolution of these galaxies by extending this work with studies on their chemical abundances, resolved stellar populations and kinematics.</description>

      <title>What halts the growth of galaxies?</title>

Abstract: The gas reservoir of galaxies can be altered by outflows driven by star-formation and luminous active galactic nuclei. Jets heating the surroundings of host galaxies can also prevent gas cooling and inflows. While spectacular examples for these three mass displacement channels have been observed, their importance in transforming the galaxy population depends on the occurance rates of outflow triggers. In an observation-driven approach, we combine distribution functions and scaling relations to empirically compare average outflow rates across the galaxy total stellar mass spectrum and across cosmic time. This hinges on local outflow studies which should be extended to systematic, large and diverse samples, and we do not yet consider a halo heating effect by radiation-driven outflows. Our results show, independent of simulations, the dominance of star formation-driven outflows in low-mass galaxies. Massive galaxies today are predominately prevented from growing further by jet heating, while at z=1-3 all three processes are approximately similarly important. Over the full mass spectrum and cosmic history, outflows driven by the radiation from active galactic nuclei is never the dominant process.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Constraints from the eBOSS Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest using the PRIYA Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new cosmological parameter constraints from the eBOSS Lyman-$\alpha$ forest survey. We use a new theoretical model and likelihood based on the PRIYA simulation suite. PRIYA is the first suite to resolve the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest in a ($120$~Mpc/h~)$^3$ volume, using a multi-fidelity emulation technique. We use PRIYA to predict Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observables with $\lesssim 1\%$ interpolation error over an $11$ dimensional ($9$ simulated, $2$ in post-processing) parameter space. We identify an internal tension within the flux power spectrum data. Once the discrepant data is removed, we find the primeval scalar spectral index measured at a pivot scale of $k_0 = 0.78$ Mpc$^{-1}$ to be $n_P = 1.009^{+0.027}_{-0.018}$ at 68\% confidence. This measurement from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest flux power spectrum alone is in reasonable agreement with Planck, and in tension with earlier eBOSS analyses. The amplitude of matter fluctuations is $\sigma_8 = 0.733^{+0.026}_{-0.029}$ at 68\% confidence, in agreement with Dark Energy Survey weak lensing measurements and other small-scale structure probes and in tension with CMB measurements from Planck and ACT. The effective optical depth to Lyman-$\alpha$ photons from our pipeline is in good agreement with earlier high resolution measurements. We find a linear power at $z=3$ and $k = 0.009$ s/km of $\Delta_L^2 = 0.302^{+0.024}_{-0.027}$ with a slope $n_\mathrm{eff} = -2.264^{+0.026}_{-0.018}$. Our flux power spectrum only chains prefer a low level of heating during helium reionization. When we add IGM temperature data we find $n_P = 0.983\pm 0.020$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.703^{+0.023}_{-0.027}$. Our chains prefer an early and long helium reionization event, as suggested by measurements from the helium Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. In the near future we will use our pipeline to infer cosmological parameters from the DESI Lyman-$\alpha$ data.</description>

      <title>Primordial magnetic fields: consistent initial conditions and impact on high-z structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) can enhance matter power spectrum on small scales ($\lesssim$ Mpc) and still agree with bounds from cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Faraday rotation measurements. As modes on scales smaller than Mpc have already become non-linear today, exploring PMFs' impact on small-scale structures requires dedicated cosmological simulations. Here, for the first time, we perform a suite of hydrodynamical simulations that take into account the different impacts of PMFs on baryons and dark matter. Specifically, in the initial conditions we displace particles according to the Lorentz force from PMFs. We also highlight the large theoretical uncertainty in the peak enhancement of the matter power spectrum due to PMFs, which was not considered in previous studies. We present halo mass functions and show that they can be accurately reproduced using Sheth-Torman formalism. Moreover, we show that PMFs can generate galaxies with baryon fraction several times larger than the cosmic average at high redshifts. This is simply a consequence of the fact that PMFs enhance baryon perturbations, causing them to be larger than dark matter perturbations. We argue that this scenario could be tested soon by obtaining accurate estimates of the baryon fraction in high redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>The hydrodynamic response of small-scale structure to reionization drives large IGM temperature fluctuations that persist to z = 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermal history and structure of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at $z \geq 4$ is an important boundary condition for reionization, and a key input for studies using the Ly$\alpha$ forest to constrain the masses of alternative dark matter candidates. Most such inferences rely on simulations that lack the spatial resolution to fully resolve the hydrodynamic response of IGM filaments and minihalos to HI reionization heating. In this letter, we use high-resolution hydrodynamic+radiative transfer simulations to study how these affect the IGM thermal structure. We find that the adiabatic heating and cooling driven by the expansion of initially cold gas filaments and minihalos sources significant small-scale temperature fluctuations. These likely persist in much of the IGM until $z \leq 4$. Capturing this effect requires resolving the clumping scale of cold, pre-ionized gas, demanding spatial resolutions of $\leq 2$ $h^{-1}$kpc. Pre-heating of the IGM by X-Rays can slightly reduce the effect. Our preliminary estimate of the effect on the Ly$\alpha$ forest finds that, at $\log(k /[{\rm km^{-1} s}]) = -1.0$, the Ly$\alpha$ forest flux power (at fixed mean flux) can increase $\approx 10\%$ going from $8$ and $2$ $h^{-1}$kpc resolution at $z = 4-5$ for gas ionized at $z &lt; 7$. These findings motivate more careful analyses of how the effects studied here affect the Ly$\alpha$ forest.</description>

      <title>E(2)-Equivariant Features in Machine Learning for Morphological Classification of Radio Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the growth of data from new radio telescope facilities, machine-learning approaches to the morphological classification of radio galaxies are increasingly being utilised. However, while widely employed deep-learning models using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are equivariant to translations within images, neither CNNs nor most other machine-learning approaches are equivariant to additional isometries of the Euclidean plane, such as rotations and reflections. Recent work has attempted to address this by using G-steerable CNNs, designed to be equivariant to a specified subset of 2-dimensional Euclidean, E(2), transformations. Although this approach improved model performance, the computational costs were a recognised drawback. Here we consider the use of directly extracted E(2)-equivariant features for the classification of radio galaxies. Specifically, we investigate the use of Minkowski functionals (MFs), Haralick features (HFs) and elliptical Fourier descriptors (EFDs). We show that, while these features do not perform equivalently well to CNNs in terms of accuracy, they are able to inform the classification of radio galaxies, requiring ~50 times less computational runtime. We demonstrate that MFs are the most informative, EFDs the least informative, and show that combinations of all three result in only incrementally improved performance, which we suggest is due to information overlap between feature sets.</description>

      <title>Roman FFP Revolution: Two, Three, Many Plutos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Roman microlensing stands at a crossroads between its originally charted path of cataloging a population of cool planets that has subsequently become well-measured down to super-Earths, and the path of free-floating planets (FFPs), which did not exist when Roman was chosen in 2010, but by now promises revolutionary insights into planet formation and evolution via their possible connection to a spectrum of objects spanning 18 decades in mass. Until now, it was not even realized that the 2 paths are in conflict: Roman strategy was optimized for bound-planet detections, and FFPs were considered only in the context of what could be learned about them given this strategy. We derive a simple equation that mathematically expresses this conflict and explains why the current approach severely depresses detection of 2 of the 5 decades of potential FFP masses, i.e., exactly the two decades, $M_{\rm Pluto}&lt; M &lt;2\,M_{\rm Mars}$, that would tie terrestrial planets to the proto-planetary material out of which they formed. FFPs can be either truly free floating or can be bound in "Wide", "Kuiper", and "Oort" orbits, whose separate identification will allow further insight into planet formation. In the (low-mass) limit that the source radius is much bigger than the Einstein radius, $\theta_*\gg\theta_{\rm E}$, the number of significantly magnified points on the FFP light curve is $N=2\Gamma\theta_*\sqrt{1-z^2}/\mu$ --&gt; 3.0, when normalized to the adopted Roman cadence $\Gamma=4/$hr, and to source radius $\theta_*=0.3\,\mu$as, lens-source proper motion $\mu=6\,$mas/yr, and source impact parameter $z=0.5$, which are all typical values. By contrast $N=6$ are needed for an FFP detection. Thus, unless $\Gamma$ is doubled, FFP detection will be driven into the (large-$\theta_*$, small-$\mu$) corner of parameter space, reducing the detections by a net factor of 2 and cutting off the lowest-mass FFPs.</description>

      <title>Efficient hybrid technique for generating sub-grid haloes in reionization simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating the distribution of cosmological neutral hydrogen (HI) during the epoch of reionization requires a high dynamic range and is hence computationally expensive. The size of the simulation is dictated by the largest scales one aims to probe, while the resolution is determined by the smallest dark matter haloes capable of hosting the first stars. We present a hybrid approach where the density and tidal fields of a large-volume, low-resolution simulation are combined with small haloes from a small-volume, high-resolution box. By merging these two boxes of relatively lower dynamic range, we achieve an effective high-dynamic range simulation using only 13% of the computational resources required for a full high-dynamic range simulation. Our method accurately reproduces the one- and two-point statistics of the halo field, its cross-correlation with the dark matter density field, and the two-point statistics of the HI field computed using a semi-numerical code, all within 10% accuracy at large scales and across different redshifts. Our technique, combined with semi-numerical models of reionization, provides a resource-efficient tool for modeling the HI distribution at high redshifts.</description>
