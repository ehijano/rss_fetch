      <title>Magnetic excitations from the hexagonal spin clusters in the S = 1/2 distorted honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet Cu2(pymca)3(ClO4)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cu2(pymca)3(ClO4) (pymca: pyrimidine-2-carboxylate) consists of a slightly distorted honeycomb lattice of Cu2+ spins, which shows no long-range magnetic order down to 0.6 K. A magnetization study revealed 1/3 and 2/3 plateau phases [A. Okutani et al., J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 88, 013703 (2019)], which is not expected for regular honeycomb antiferromagnets. Inelastic neutron scattering experiments were performed using a powder sample to investigate the exchange interactions of this material. The spin excitations from the singlet ground state to the first three triplet states, predicted from the antiferromagnetic hexagonal spin cluster interacting with 3.9 meV, were observed. Using the exact diagonalization mothods, the intercluster coupling was estimated from the excitation peak width to be about 20% of the intracluster interaction, which is consistent with the previously reported value. Our exchange path model explains the anisotropic exchange interactions in the distorted honeycomb plane.</description>

      <title>Higgs-mode electromagnon in the spin-spiral multiferroic CuBr${}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Below a continuous symmetry breaking phase transition, the relevant collective excitations are due to longitudinal and transverse fluctuations of the order parameter, which are referred to as Higgs and Goldstone modes, respectively. In solids, these modes may take on a different character than the equivalent excitations in particle physics due to the diverse vacuum states accessible in condensed matter. However, the Higgs mode in particular is quite difficult to observe experimentally as it decays quickly into the lower-energy Goldstone bosons and thus has a negligible lifetime in most systems. In this work, we report evidence for a novel Higgs mode in the multiferroic material CuBr${}_2$, which shows up as a coherent oscillation in the time-resolved second harmonic generation signal upon excitation with a femtosecond light pulse. Since the spiral spin order in CuBr${}_2$ induces a nonzero electric dipole moment in equilibrium, the Higgs mode--which is due to fluctuations in the amplitude of the on-site spin expectation value--is an electromagnon, and thus acquires an inversion quantum number of -1. This is in stark contrast to the Higgs boson of particle physics, which has even parity. Moreover, the excitation described here represents an entirely new type of electromagnon, distinct from the traditional electromagnon in linear spin wave theory which is due to the Goldstone mode.</description>

      <title>Slow ferromagnetic fluctuations in the kagome metal Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ revealed by $^{27}$Al NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Static and dynamical magnetic and electronic properties of the kagome metal Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ have been investigated by $^{27}$Al nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. The temperature dependence of Knight shift ($K$) shows a similar temperature dependence of the DC magnetic susceptibility $\chi$ except for the low-temperature region below $\sim$ 50 K where $K$ is almost constant while $\chi$ keeps increasing, which suggests that the increase in $\chi$ at low temperatures is not intrinsic. $^{27}$Al spin-lattice relaxation rate divided by temperature ($1/T_1T$) is found to be constant, confirming the metallic state of Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ from a microscopic point of view. Based on a Korringa ratio analysis using the $T_1$ and $K$ data, ferromagnetic spin fluctuations are found to dominate in Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$. These fluctuations are suggested to be very slow with frequencies on the order of kilohertz or lower.</description>

      <title>Charge and pair density waves in a spin and valley-polarized system at a Van-Hove singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a single component (i.e., single valley, spin-polarized) two-dimensional electron gas with $C_{3v}$ symmetry tuned to a Van-Hove (VH) singularity. Generically, there may be either three or six VH points at the Fermi level, related to each other by symmetry. Using a renormalization group analysis, we show that when the effective interactions between electrons at the VH points are positive, the system is stable. In contrast, if the effective interactions are negative, the system develops an instability toward either pair density wave (PDW) or charge density wave (CDW) orders, depending on the anisotropy of the dispersion at the VH points. The PDW may have either a single wavevector or multiple wavevectors. The PDW phase with three coexisting wavevectors can support fractional $\tfrac{h}{6e}$ vortices. The interplay between the geometry of the Fermi surface and the singularity of the density of states is the key that enables PDW formation.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Hund$'s$ metal physics in single-layered 3d transition metal oxide, $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory, we study the influence of Hund's coupling on the nature of electronic correlations in $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$. Our results suggest strong signatures of Hund's metal physics in this compound. The Co 3$d$ states show large orbital differentiation in the degree of correlations and mass enhancement. The imaginary-time correlation functions suggest the presence of spin-orbital separation and large local charge fluctuations in the system. Breakdown of the Fermi-liquid picture is observed at the lowest calculated temperature for various strengths of Hund's coupling, suggesting the Fermi-liquid coherence scale lower than $\sim$100 K. Interestingly, a sudden emergence of a gapped state is noted for $e_g$ orbitals in its spectral density of states at $\sim$200 K in the vicinity of Fermi-level. Among the Co 3$d$ states 3$d_{z^2}$ and 3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ foster enlarged correlations. This study conclusively identifies $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$ as the first single-layered 3$d$ transition metal oxide to be classified as Hund's metal.</description>

      <title>Gapped Boundaries of Kitaev's Quantum Double Models: A Lattice Realization of Anyon Condensation from Lagrangian Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The macroscopic theory of anyon condensation, rooted in the categorical structure of topological excitations, provides a complete classification of gapped boundaries in topologically ordered systems, where distinct boundaries correspond to the condensation of different Lagrangian algebras. However, an intrinsic and direct understanding of anyon condensation in lattice models, grounded in the framework of Lagrangian algebras, remains undeveloped. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for constructing all gapped boundaries of Kitaev's quantum double models directly from the data of Lagrangian algebras. Central to our approach is the observation that bulk interactions in the quantum double models admit two complementary interpretations: the anyon-creating picture and anyon-probing picture. Generalizing this insight to the boundary, we derive the consistency condition for boundary ribbon operators that respect the mathematical axiomatic structure of Lagrangian algebras. Solving these conditions yields explicit expressions for the local boundary interactions required to realize gapped boundaries. Our construction provides a microscopic characterization of the bulk-to-boundary anyon condensation dynamics via the action of ribbon operators. Moreover, all these boundary terms are supported within a common effective Hilbert space, making further studies on pure boundary phase transitions natural and convenient. Given the broad applicability of anyon condensation theory, we believe that our approach can be generalized to extended string-net models or higher-dimensional topologically ordered systems.</description>

      <title>Dimer in the Hubbard model. Exact and approximate solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the tight-binding model taking into account the Coulomb repulsion of electrons at one site (the Hubbard model), an exact calculation of the Fourier transform of the anticommutator Green's function of the C2 dimer as a structural element of fullerene, the poles of which determine the energy spectrum of the studied nanosystem, was performed. Graphic representations of the equation for the chemical potential and the density of state of electrons were obtained. A solution for the dimer was obtained within the approximation of static fluctuations. The Fourier transform of the anticommutator Green's function, obtained in the approximation of static fluctuations, coincided with a similar function obtained within the exact solution. The ionization energy and electron affinity were calculated and found to be 11.87 eV and 3.39 eV, respectively. It was concluded that the method for solving the Hubbard model for the C2 dimer in the approximation of static fluctuations proposed in the work can be a fairly adequate method for theoretical study of strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>$\eta $-pairing states in the Hubbard model with non-uniform Hubbard interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of $\eta $-pairing eigenstates in the fermionic Hubbard model is fundamentally rooted in the $\eta $-pairing symmetry, which may hold for systems with non-uniform Hubbard interaction $U$. In this work, we present a generalized Hubbard model containing a variety of pseudo-spin terms that break the SO$_{4}$ symmetry but retain the $\eta $-pairing symmetry. This allows us to construct a variety of correlated systems possessing $\eta $% -pairing eigenstates.\ We exemplify our findings by considering a modified Hubbard model associated with alternative magnetic fields and on-site repulsion. We find that the same quasi-$\eta $-pairing eigenstate exhibits two distinct dynamic behaviors in the two models. Numerical results of the time evolution driven by several typical Hamiltonians accord with the analytic predictions and provide a way of the control of an $\eta $-pairing wavepacket with the aid of a time-dependent Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Crystal field excitations in rattling clathrate CeBa$_7$Au$_6$Si$_{40}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the local crystal-field environment of cerium in the clathrate compound CeBa$_7$Au$_6$Si$_{40}$ (Ce-BAS) using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Ce-BAS is a rare example of a system where heavy-fermion physics coexists with low-energy rattling phonon modes, making it a candidate for enhanced thermoelectric performance. Magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal a temperature-dependent local moment that cannot be explained within a static crystal-field model. A fit to the susceptibility data requires strong mixing between the j = 5/2 and j = 7/2 crystal-field states, which implies large internal splittings inconsistent with RIXS spectra. In contrast, RIXS data are well described by a model with negligible j = 5/2 - j = 7/2 mixing and an energy separation of 12 meV between the ground and first excited crystal-field states. The inability to reconcile these two datasets within a static framework points to a dynamical modification of the crystal-field potential. We attribute this to coupling between the Ce 4f electrons and low-energy phonons associated with the Ce rattling motion. This interpretation is consistent with theoretical predictions of phonon-enhanced Kondo effects and dynamical Jahn-Teller distortions. Our results highlight the need for multi-orbital impurity models that include phonon coupling to fully describe the low-energy physics of Ce-BAS.</description>

      <title>Infinite temperature transport in the strong coupling regime of a nonintegrable quantum spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spin transport of the XXZ model with next-nearest neighbor $\Delta_2$ terms. We compute numerically dependence of spin conductivity $\sigma(\omega)$ on the anisotropy $\Delta$ and the ratio $r= \Delta_2/\Delta$, in the large $\Delta$ regime. We find that, when $0&lt;r&lt;1$, the low-frequency conductivity assumes an anomalous form $\sigma(\omega)\approx a \omega^2 + b \Delta^{-2} $. In particular, when $\Delta\to\infty$ the model becomes dynamically constrained and most states are localized. We show, microscopically, existence of magnon bound states in the strong coupling regime, which behave as self-generated disorders for single magnons. Based on this quasiparticle picture, we obtain analytical scalings, which match well with the numerical results.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Electronic Structure Engineering in 1$T$-TaS$_2$: Role of Doping and Amplitude Mode Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In strongly correlated transition metal dichalcogenides, an intricate interplay of polaronic distortions, stacking arrangement, and electronic correlations determines the nature of the insulating state. Here, we study the response of the electronic structure to optical excitations to reveal the effect of chemical electron doping on this complex interplay. Transient changes in pristine and electron-doped 1$T$ -TaS$_2$ are measured by femtosecond time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and compared to theoretical modeling based on non-equilibrium dynamical mean-field theory and density functional theory. The fine changes in the oscillatory signal of the charge density wave amplitude mode indicate phase-dependent modifications in the Coulomb interaction and the hopping. Furthermore, we find an enhanced fraction of monolayers in the doped system. Our work demonstrates how the combination of time-resolved spectroscopy and advanced theoretical modeling provides insights into the physics of correlated transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Exploring two dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant phases with time reversal symmetry and their transitions with topological operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use various topological operations to systematically study phase transitions between theories with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and time reversal symmetry in two spacetime dimensions. The phases (and accompanying CFTs) we consider come in two types - bosonic phases that are defined on unorientable manifolds and fermionic phases that are sensitive to a $\text{Pin}^-$ structure. In both cases, our analysis leads to eight phase diagrams, with the two sets of eight connected by fermionization/bosonization. Starting from a seed CFT, we obtain the CFT that governs each transition. Many of these exhibit symmetry enriched criticality. In addition to showing many symmetry enriched CFTs in their natural habitats, our work discusses the fermionic analogs of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ bosonic operations, which we have not seen discussed in the literature.</description>

Abstract: The tricritical Ising model serves as an example of emergent spacetime supersymmetry, which can arise in condensed matter systems. In this work, we present a variational quantum algorithm to create this tricritical state on a digitized quantum computer. We successfully prepare the state on an IBM quantum device and verify the critical correlations of supercurrents associated with the state. Additionally, we examine how other signatures of supersymmetry, namely universal gap ratios and the central charge, can be probed on quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While significant attention has been devoted to studying entanglement in photonic systems, solid-state spin lattices remain relatively underexplored. Motivated by this gap, we investigate the entanglement structure of one-dimensional ferrimagnetic chains composed of alternating spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 particles. We characterize the ground-state correlations using exact diagonalization and the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method. Although the bipartite entanglement is restricted to nearest neighbors, we reveal the presence of long-range genuine multipartite entanglement between spatially separated spin pairs. These findings advance our understanding of quantum correlations in ferrimagnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Fermi Surface, Van Hove Singularity and Enhancement of Superconductivity in Infinite-Layer Nickelates</title>

Abstract: Recent experiments reveal a three-dimensional (3D) Fermi surface with a clear $k_z$ dispersion in infinite-layer nickelates, distinguishing them from their cuprate superconductor counterparts. However, the impact of this difference on the superconducting properties of nickelates remains unclear. Here, we employ a combined random-phase-approximation and dynamical-mean-field-theory (RPA+DMFT) approach to solve the linearized gap equation for superconductivity. We find that, compared to the cuprate-like two-dimensional (2D) single-orbital Fermi surface, the van Hove singularities on the 3D Fermi surface of infinite-layer nickelates strengthen spin fluctuations by driving the system closer to antiferromagnetic instabilities, thereby significantly enhancing superconductivity. Our findings underscore the critical role of the van Hove singularities in shaping the superconducting properties of infinite-layer nickelates and, more broadly, highlight the importance of subtle Fermi surface features in modeling material-specific unconventional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy-dependent decay of room temperature metastable skyrmions and a nascent double-$q$ spin texture in Co$_{8}$Zn$_{9}$Mn$_{3}$</title>

Abstract: Chiral cubic Co-Zn-Mn magnets exhibit diverse topological spin textures, including room-temperature skyrmion phases and robust far-from-equilibrium metastable states. Despite recent advances in understanding metastable skyrmions, the interplay between compositional disorder and varying magnetic anisotropy on the stability and decay of metastable textures, particularly near room temperature, remains incompletely understood. In this work, the equilibrium and metastable skyrmion formation in Co$_{8}$Zn$_{9}$Mn$_{3}$ is examined, revealing transformations between distinct metastable spin textures induced by temperature and magnetic field. At room temperature, the decay dynamics of metastable skyrmions exhibits a strong dependence on magnetic anisotropy, showcasing a route towards tailoring relaxation behavior. Furthermore, a nascent double-$q$ spin texture, characterized by two coexisting magnetic modulation vectors $q$, is identified as a minority phase alongside the conventional triple-$q$ hexagonal skyrmion lattice. This double-$q$ texture can be quenched as a metastable state, suggesting both its topological character, and its role as a potential intermediary of metastable skyrmion decay. These findings provide new insights into the tunability of equilibrium and metastable topological spin textures via chemical composition and magnetic anisotropy, offering strategies for designing materials with customizable and dynamic skyrmion properties for advanced technological applications.</description>

      <title>Classical simulation of parity-preserving quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a classical simulation method for fermionic quantum systems which, without loss of generality, can be represented by parity-preserving circuits made of two-qubit gates in a brick-wall structure. We map such circuits to a fermionic tensor network and introduce a novel decomposition of non-Matchgate gates into a Gaussian fermionic tensor and a residual quartic term, inspired by interacting fermionic systems. The quartic term is independent of the specific gate, which allows us to precompute intermediate results independently of the exact circuit structure and leads to significant speedups when compared to other methods. Our decomposition suggests a natural perturbative expansion which can be turned into an algorithm to compute measurement outcomes and observables to finite accuracy when truncating at some order of the expansion. For particle number conserving gates, our decomposition features a unique truncation cutoff reducing the computational effort for high precision calculations. Our algorithm significantly lowers resource requirements for simulating parity-preserving circuits while retaining high accuracy, making it suitable for simulations of interacting systems in quantum chemistry and material science. Lastly, we discuss how our algorithm compares to other classical simulation methods for fermionic quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Time-reversal symmetry breaking in microscopic single-crystal Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-reversal symmetry breaking superconductivity is a quintessential unconventional quantum state. In Josephson junctions, time-reversal symmetry breaking manifests itself in the supercurrent interference pattern as the invariance of the critical current under the reversal of both transport and magnetic field directions, i.e., $I_\text{c+}(H) = I_\text{c-}(-H)$. So far, such systems have been realized in devices where superconductivity is injected into a deliberately constructed weak link medium, usually carefully tuned by external magnetic fields and electrostatic gating. In this work, we report time-reversal symmetry breaking in spontaneously emerging Josephson junctions without intentionally constructed weak links. This is realized in ultra-pure single-crystal microstructures of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, an unconventional superconductor with a multi-component order parameter. Here, the Josephson effect emerges intrinsically at the superconducting domain wall, where the degenerate states partially overlap. In addition to violating $I_\text{c+}(H) = I_\text{c-}(-H)$, we find a rich variety of exotic transport phenomena, including a supercurrent diode effect present in the entire interference pattern, two-channel critical current oscillations with a period that deviates from $\Phi_0$, fractional Shapiro steps, and current-switchable bistable states with highly asymmetric critical currents. Our findings provide direct evidence of TRSB in unstrained Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and reveal the potential of domain wall Josephson junctions, which can emerge in any superconductor where the pairing symmetry is described by a multi-component order parameter.</description>

      <title>Spin-Depairing-Induced Exceptional Fermionic Superfluidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) attractive Hubbard model with spin depairing, which is a spin-resolved asymmetric hopping that nonreciprocally operates spins in the opposite direction. We find that spin depairing stabilizes a superfluid state unique to the NH system. This phase is characterized not only by a finite order parameter, but also by the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the momentum space - a feature that starkly contrasts with previously discussed NH fermionic superfluidity, where EPs are absent within the superfluid state and emerge only at the onset of the superfluid breakdown. We uncover the rich mechanism underlying this ``exceptional fermionic superfluidity'' by analyzing the interplay between EPs and the effective density of states of the complex energy dispersion. Furthermore, we reveal that the exceptional superfluid state breaks down induced by strong spin depairing on the cubic lattice, while it remains robust on the square lattice.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Multiplet Excitations probed by the $M_{5,4}$ Branching Ratio in $3d \rightarrow 4f$ X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that ultrafast electronic $4f$ multiplet transitions in terbium metal are manifested by changes in the relative spectral weight of the $M_5$ and $M_4$ X-ray absorption resonances. Our experimental results are supported by a simulation of excited multiplet spectra with atomistic calculations; they prove that the so-called third rule of Thole and van der Laan, which relates the branching ratio of the spin-orbit split resonances to the total angular momentum $J$ of the excited ion, is also valid in non-equilibrium. The presented detection scheme allows to detect $J$-changing excitation, \textit{i.e}, alterations of spin and orbital states, even in samples without net magnetization. This makes branching-ratio spectroscopy a powerful tool for the quantitative investigation of ultrafast changes in angular momentum $J$.</description>

Abstract: We elucidate the dynamics induced by a Wilson Line of charge $q$ and electron charge $e$ in $QED_4$ coupled to a real scalar via Yukawa interactions. We observe that there is a range of the fixed product $e^2 q$ with $e\rightarrow 0$ and $q\rightarrow \infty$ for which four-fermion operators play a dominant role for the dynamics of the theory. We uncover the fixed-point dynamics of the theory and analyze their critical behavior.</description>

      <title>Non-stabilizerness generation in a multi-particle quantum walk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the generation of non-stabilizerness, or magic, in a multi-particle quantum walk by analyzing the time evolution of the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy $M_2$. Our study considers both single- and two-particle quantum walks in the framework of the XXZ Heisenberg model with varying interaction strengths. We demonstrate that the spread of magic follows the light-cone structure dictated by the system's dynamics, with distinct behaviors emerging in the easy-plane ($\Delta &lt; 1$) and easy-axis ($\Delta &gt; 1$) regimes. For $\Delta &lt; 1$, magic generation is primarily governed by single-particle dynamics, while for $\Delta &gt; 1$, doublon propagation dominates, resulting in a significantly slower growth of $M_2$. Furthermore, the magic exhibits logarithmic growth in time for both one and two-particle dynamics. Additionally, by examining the Pauli spectrum, we show that the statistical distribution of level spacings exhibits Poissonian behavior, independent of interaction strength or particle number. Our results shed light on the role of interactions on magic generation in a many-body system.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Relaxation Dynamics in Co_8Zn_7Mn_5 and Co_8Zn_8Mn_4: Evidence of Inertial Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetization relaxation dynamics serve as an essential tool for uncovering the intrinsic mechanisms governing the magnetic response and energy dissipation in magnetic systems. In this work, we examine the relaxation dynamics for Beta Mn type Co_8Zn_7Mn_5 and Co_8Zn_8Mn_4 across a frequency range of 1 kHz to 10 kHz, spanning different magnetic phases. While most magnetic systems tend to follow the Debye-like relaxation with non-zero distribution or the Cole-Cole formalism, our analysis reveal that these conventional models fail to capture frequency dependence of ac susceptibility across different magnetic phases in Co_8Zn_7Mn_5 and Co_8Zn_8Mn_4. Instead, an inertial component is needed to successfully describe the dynamics, suggesting the presence of unconventional relaxation behavior. The characteristic relaxation time is found to be of the order of 10^-5 s for both the compositions. The field dependent variation of relaxation time exhibits a non-monotonic nature, with the double peak like structure at the skyrmion phase transitions, implying slower relaxation dynamics at the phase boundaries. Furthermore, the presence of non-zero difference between isothermal and adiabatic susceptibility in the pure phases implies slower relaxation dynamics, which is consistent with the presence of finite dissipation in pure phases. The inertial term has been previously invoked to describe the dynamics in spin ice systems due to the propagation of magnetic monopoles. However, its necessity in this system, points to a wider significance in magnetization dynamics that goes beyond the conventional spin ices and skyrmions.</description>

      <title>Topological Mixed Valence Model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02670v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Song and Bernevig (SB) have recently proposed a topological heavy fermion description of the physics of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), involving the hybridization of flat band electrons with a relativistic conduction sea. We explore the consequences of this model, seeking a synthesis of understanding drawn from heavy fermion physics and MATBG experiments. We identify a key discrepancy between measured and calculated onsite Coulomb interactions, implicating renormalization effects that are not contained in the current model. With these considerations in mind, we consider an SB model with a single, renormalized onsite interaction between the f-electrons, containing a phenomenological heavy fermion binding potential on the moir\'e AA-sites. This feature allows the simplified model to capture the periodic reset of the chemical potential with filling and the observed stability of local moment behavior. We argue that a two stage Kondo effect will develop in MATBG as a consequence of the relativistic conduction band: Kondo I occurs at high temperatures, establishing a coherent hybridization at the $\Gamma$ points and a non-Fermi liquid of incoherent fermions at the moir\'e K-points; at much low temperatures Kondo II leads to a Fermi liquid in the flat band. Utilizing an auxiliary-rotor approach, we formulate a mean-field treatment of MATBG that captures this physics, describing the evolution of the normal state across a full range of filling factors. By contrasting the relative time-scales of phonons and valence fluctuations in bulk heavy fermion materials with that of MATBG we propose a valley-polaron origin to the Coulomb renormalization and the heavy fermion binding potential identified from experiment. We also discuss the possibility that the two-fluid, non-Fermi liquid physics of the relativistic Kondo lattice is responsible for the strange metal physics observed in MATBG.</description>

      <title>Universal Planckian relaxation in the strange metal state of the cuprates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12133v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major puzzle in understanding high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity is the microscopic origin of the linear-in-temperature ($T$-linear) resistivity in the strange metal state, which persists up to very high temperatures. Implicit to existing theoretical discussions of this universal `{Planckian}' relaxation rate is the assumption that it must also be independent of doping, $p$. Applied to the cuprates, however, this apparently contradicts the observed strong doping-dependence ($\propto 1/p$) of the slope of the $T$-linear resistivity over a wide doping range. Here, we show through a combination of measurements, including optical conductivity and entropy, that the plasma frequency squared $\omega_p^2$ scales as $p$ over a similar doping range. Together, these dependences provide compelling evidence that the relaxation rate $1/\tau$ is indeed doping-independent (i.e. universal) throughout the entire strange metal state. Furthermore, we argue that the entire doping dependence of $\omega_p^2$ can be understood to arise from an effective mass enhancement of a specific form proposed by Anderson [\emph{Science} \textbf{235}, 1196 (1987)] in the context of doped Mott insulators. Such a mass enhancement originates from strong short-range repulsive interactions, while the Planckian relaxation rate itself appears to be an emergent phenomenon of independent physical origin.</description>

      <title>Abnormal planar Hall effect and disentanglement of incoherent and coherent transport in a Kondo lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of localized-itinerant transition in Kondo lattice systems remains a mystery despite intensive investigations in past decades. While it is often identified from the coherent peak in magnetic resistivity, recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ultrafast optical spectroscopy revealed a precursor incoherent region with band bending and hybridization fluctuations. This raises the question of how the coherent heavy-electron state is developed from an incoherent background of fluctuating localized moments and then established at sufficiently low temperatures. Here, on the example of the quasi-one-dimensional Kondo lattice compound CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$, we show that planar Hall effect and planar anisotropic magnetoresistance measurements provide an effective way to disentangle the incoherent Kondo scattering contribution and the coherent heavy-electron contribution, and a multi-stage process is directly visualized with lowering temperature by their distinct angle-dependent patterns in magneto-transport. Our idea may be extended to other measurements and thereby opens up a pathway for systematically investigating the fundamental physics of Kondo lattice coherence.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of UTe$_2$ under pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A heavy-fermion paramagnet UTe$_2$ has been a strong candidate for a spin-triplet superconductor. Experiments on UTe$_2$ under pressure have been vigorously conducted, and rich phase diagrams have been suggested. Multiple superconducting phases exist in the pressure region of $0 \leq P &lt; 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$, and an antiferromagnetic ordered state is observed in the high pressure region $P &gt; 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$. However, under pressure, the underlying electronic structure in the normal state has not been clarified, although knowledge of electronic structures is essential for studying magnetic and superconducting states. As an indispensable step toward understanding the phase diagram of UTe$_2$, we study the electronic structure under hydrostatic and uniaxial stresses based on the density functional theory with and without employing structural optimization. It is shown that the low-energy band structure and Fermi surfaces are not sensitive to pressure for parameters where itinerant $f$-electrons are not essential. However, we find a significant pressure dependence for a certain Coulomb interaction $U$ of the GGA+$U$ calculation, where the large weight of $f$-electrons appears at the Fermi level. An increase in the density of states at the Fermi level is observed under pressure, which is attributed to compressive stress along the [010] crystallographic axis.</description>

      <title>Analytical expression for $\pi$-ton vertex contributions to the optical conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vertex corrections from the transversal particle-hole channel, so-called $\pi$-tons, are generic in models for strongly correlated electron systems and can lead to a displaced Drude peak (DDP). Here, we derive the analytical expression for these $\pi$-tons, and how they affect the optical conductivity as a function of correlation length $\xi$, fermion lifetime $\tau$, temperature $T$, and coupling strength to spin or charge fluctuations $g$. In particular, for $T\rightarrow T_c$, the critical temperature for antiferromagnetic or charge ordering, the dc vertex correction is algebraic $\sigma_{VERT}^{dc}\propto \xi \sim (T-T_c)^{-\nu}$ in one dimension and logarithmic $\sigma_{VERT}^{dc}\propto \ln\xi \sim \nu \ln (T-T_c)$ in two dimensions. Here, $\nu$ is the critical exponent for the correlation length. If we have the exponential scaling $\xi \sim e^{1/T}$ of an ideal two-dimensional system, the DDP becomes more pronounced with increasing $T$ but fades away at low temperatures where only a broadening of the Drude peak remains, as it is observed experimentally, with the dc resistivity exhibiting a linear $T$ dependence at low temperatures. Further, we find the maximum of the DPP to be given by the inverse lifetime: $\omega_{DDP} \sim 1/\tau$. These characteristic dependencies can guide experiments to evidence $\pi$-tons in actual materials.</description>

      <title>Entanglement renormalization of fractonic anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian models</title>

Abstract: Gapped fracton phases constitute a new class of quantum states of matter which connects to topological orders but does not fit easily into existing paradigms. They host unconventional features such as sub-extensive and robust ground state degeneracies as well as sensitivity to lattice geometry. We investigate the anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian model [1] which can describe a family of fracton phases defined on arbitrary graphs. Focusing on representative geometries where the 3D lattices are extensions of 2D square, triangular, honeycomb and Kagome lattices into the third dimension, we study their ground state degeneracies and mobility of excitations, and examine their entanglement renormalization group (ERG) flows. All models show bifurcating behaviors under ERG but have distinct ERG flows sensitive to both $N$ and lattice geometry. In particular, we show that the anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian models defined on the extensions of triangular and honeycomb lattices are equivalent when $N$ is coprime to $3$. We also point out that, in contrast to previous expectations, the model defined on the extension of Kagome lattice is robust against local perturbations if and only if $N$ is coprime to $6$.</description>

      <title>Algorithm for computing perturbation series of dynamical mean field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how to use diagrammatic techniques to compute the weak-coupling perturbation series of the self-consistent solution to a Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) problem. This approach constitutes an alternative to using diagrammatic techniques directly as an impurity solver. It allows one to bypass the need of multiple perturbative series resummations within the DMFT self-consistency loop. It can be applied at or out of equilibrium, with any diagrammatic formalism, such as real times, imaginary times, or Matsubara frequencies formalisms. As a proof of principle, we illustrate our method with the half-filled Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice in the DMFT approximation, using Quantum Quasi-Monte Carlo (QQMC) to obtain the impurity perturbation series on the real time axis.</description>

      <title>Strange metals and planckian transport in a gapless phase from spatially random interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: `Strange' metals that do not follow the predictions of Fermi liquid theory are prevalent in materials that feature superconductivity arising from electron interactions. In recent years, it has been hypothesized that spatial randomness in electron interactions must play a crucial role in strange metals for their hallmark linear-in-temperature ($T$) resistivity to survive down to low temperatures where phonon and Umklapp processes are ineffective, as is observed in experiments. However, a clear picture of how this happens has not yet been provided in a realistic model free from artificial constructions such as large-$N$ limits and replica tricks. We study a realistic model of two-dimensional metals with spatially random antiferromagnetic interactions in a non-perturbative regime, using numerically exact high-performance large-scale hybrid Monte Carlo and exact averages over the quenched spatial randomness. Our simulations reproduce strange metals' key experimental signature of linear-in-$T$ resistivity with a universal `planckian' transport scattering rate $\Gamma_\mathrm{tr} \sim k_B T/\hbar$ that is independent of coupling constants. We further find that strange metallicity in these systems is not associated with a quantum critical point, and instead arises from a phase of matter with gapless antiferromagnetic fluctuations that lacks long-range correlations and spans an extended region of parameter space: a feature that is also observed in several experiments. These gapless antiferromagnetic fluctuations take the form of spatially localized overdamped modes, whose presence could possibly be detected using recently developed nanoscale magnetometry methods. Our work paves the way for an eventual microscopic understanding of the role of spatial disorder in determining important properties of correlated electron materials.</description>

      <title>Refining the Two-Band Model for Highly Compensated Semimetals Using Thermoelectric Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In studying compensated semimetals, the two-band model has proven extremely useful in capturing electrical conductivity under magnetic field, as a function of density and mobility of electron-like and hole-like carriers. However, it rarely offers practical insight into magneto-thermoelectric properties. Here, we report the field dependence of thermoelectric (TE) coefficients in a highly compensated semimetal NbSb$_2$, where we find the Seebeck and Nernst coefficients increase quadratically and linearly with applied magnetic field, respectively. Such field dependence was predicted in previous work that studied a system of two parabolic bands, within semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory when the following two conditions are simultaneously met:$\omega_c\tau \gg 1$ and $\tan\theta_H \ll 1$. Under these conditions, we find the field dependence of the TE coefficients directly provides a relation between the electron-like ($n_e$) and hole-like ($n_h$) carrier densities, which in turn can be used to refine two-band model fitting. With this, we find the compensation factor ($\frac{|\Delta n|}{n_e}$) of NbSb$_2$ is two orders of magnitude smaller than what was found in unrestricted fitting, resulting in a larger saturation field scale for magnetoresistance. Within the same framework of the semiclassical theory, we also deduce that the thermoelectric Hall angle $\tan\theta_{\gamma} = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}$ can be expressed as $\big(\frac{|\Delta n|}{n_e} \times \omega_c\tau\big)^{-1}$, which serves as a parameter to predict the degree of compensation. Our findings offer crucial insights into identifying empirical conditions for field-induced enhancement of TE performance and into engineering efficient thermoelectric devices based on semimetallic materials.</description>

      <title>Soft symmetries of topological orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03314v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (2+1)D topological orders possess emergent symmetries given by a group $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$, which consists of the braided tensor autoequivalences of the modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ that describes the anyons. In this paper we discuss cases where $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$ has elements that neither permute anyons nor are associated to any symmetry fractionalization but are still non-trivial, which we refer to as soft symmetries. We point out that one can construct topological defects corresponding to such exotic symmetry actions by decorating with a certain class of gauged SPT states that cannot be distinguished by their torus partition function. This gives a physical interpretation to work by Davydov on soft braided tensor autoequivalences. This has a number of important implications for the classification of gapped boundaries, non-invertible spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the general classification of symmetry-enriched topological phases of matter. We also demonstrate analogous phenomena in higher dimensions, such as (3+1)D gauge theory with gauge group given by the quaternion group $Q_8$.</description>

      <title>Variationally optimizing infinite projected entangled-pair states at large bond dimensions: A split corner transfer matrix renormalization group approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) have become a powerful tool for studying quantum many-body systems in the condensed matter and quantum materials context, particularly with advances in variational energy optimization methods. A key challenge within this framework is the computational cost associated with the contraction of the two-dimensional lattice, crucial for calculating state vector norms and expectation values. The conventional approach, using the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG), involves combining two tensor network layers, resulting in significant time and memory demands. In this work, we introduce an alternative "split-CTMRG" algorithm, which maintains separate PEPS layers and leverages new environment tensors, reducing computational complexity while preserving accuracy. Benchmarks on quantum lattice models demonstrate substantial speedups for variational energy optimization, rendering this method valuable for large-scale PEPS simulations.</description>

      <title>Chiral anomaly in the Weyl semimetal TaRhTe$_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TaRhTe$_4$ is a type-IIWeyl semimetal, exhibiting fourWeyl points in proximity to the Fermi level. In this article, we report our results of a systematic study of longitudinal magnetoresistance in TaRhTe$_4$. Our findings indicate that magnetoresistance becomes negative only when the magnetic field is applied parallel to the electric field. By rotating E (as well as B), we show that its origin is consistent with the prediction of the chiral anomaly, while the current jetting effect and weak localization could be excluded. The negative magnetoresistance persists up to room temperature, suggesting that TaRhTe4 exhibits distinctive properties within the family of Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Enforced Gaplessness from States with Exponentially Decaying Correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that an exponentially localized Hamiltonian must be gapless if its ground state has algebraic correlations. We show that even certain exponentially decaying correlations can imply gaplessness. This is exemplified by the deformed toric code $\propto \exp(\beta \sum_{\ell} Z_{\ell}) |\mathsf{TC}\rangle$, where $|\mathsf{TC}\rangle$ is a fixed-point toric code wavefunction. Although it has a confined regime for $\beta &gt; \beta_c$, recent work has drawn attention to its perimeter law loop correlations. Here, we show that these unusual loop correlations -- namely, perimeter law coexisting with a 1-form symmetry whose disorder operator has long-range order -- imply that any local parent Hamiltonian must either be gapless or have a degeneracy scaling with system size. Moreover, we construct a variational low-energy state for arbitrary local frustration-free Hamiltonians, upper bounding the finite-size gap by $O(1/L^3)$ on periodic boundary conditions. Strikingly, these variational states look like loop waves -- non-quasiparticle analogs of spin waves -- generated from the ground state by non-local loop operators. Our findings have implications for identifying the subset of Hilbert space to which gapped ground states belong, and the techniques have wide applicability. For instance, a corollary of our first result is that Glauber dynamics for the ordered phase of the two-dimensional classical Ising model on the torus must have a gapless Markov transition matrix, with our second result bounding its gap.</description>

      <title>Diverse Magnetic Phase Diagram and Anomalous Hall Effect in Antiferromagetic LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interactions between conduction electrons and magnetism can significantly enhance the Hall signal, a phenomenon known as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE). While the AHE is generally not expected in antiferromagnets, a large AHE is observed in certain antiferromagnets with noncollinear spin textures and nonvanishing Berry curvature. In this work, we present a rich temperature and magnetic phase diagram with eight distinct magnetic phases for the antiferromagnetic kagome compound LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$. The Hall effect analysis in LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$ reveals both intriguing physical phenomena and methodological challenges. In the coplanar canted antiferromagnetic phase, we observe an AHE, which likely originates from the intrinsic effects. At low temperatures, upon entering the ferromagnetic phase, the AHE sharply increases and exceeds the conventional limits expected from intrinsic mechanisms. We also demonstrate the limitations of standard experimental methods in extracting the topological contribution to the Hall effect data. We show the importance of considering magnetoresistance anisotropy when estimating the anomalous and topological Hall effects. These shortcomings in current approaches in partitioning the Hall response necessitate new tools to interpret transport results in complex magnetic materials such as LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$.</description>

Abstract: The recursion method provides a powerful framework for studying quantum many-body dynamics in the Lanczos basis recursively constructed within the Krylov space of operators. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the recursion method, when supplemented by the universal operator growth hypothesis, can effectively compute autocorrelation functions and transport coefficients at infinite temperature. We extend the scope of the recursion method to far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics. We apply the method to spin systems in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. In one dimension we find an evidence that the convergence of the method is limited in time by the dynamical quantum phase transition.</description>

Abstract: The phase diagrams of arbitrary number $N_{\text{w}}$ of diagonally and perpendicularly coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger wires have been identified. The diagonally coupled wires have rich topological phase diagrams exhibiting insulating phases with winding numbers $0\leq w \leq N_{\text{w}}$ and topological critical lines restricted by the reflection mirror symmetry. Even number of perpendicularly coupled wires exhibit either gapless or trivial topological phases. Odd number of perpendicularly coupled wires additionally exhibit nontrivial topological phases with winding number $w=1$. Due to the mirror reflection symmetry, their gapless regions can be topologically nontrivial. Odd number of perpendicularly coupled wires reveal coherent confined correlations in the odd indexed wires away from the gapless regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar-fermion models, such as the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model, admit natural $1d$ defects given by the exponential of a scalar field integrated along a straight line. In $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions the defect coupling is weakly relevant and the setup defines a non-trivial interacting defect CFT. In this work we study correlation functions on these defect CFTs to order $\varepsilon$. We focus on $1d$ correlators constrained to the line, which include canonical operators like the displacement and the one-dimensional analog of the spin field. These results give access to perturbative CFT data that can be used as input in the numerical bootstrap. We also consider local operators outside the line, in particular two-point functions of scalars whose dynamics are non-trivial due to the presence of the defect.</description>

      <title>Level spacing statistics of two unitary equivalent models with distinct local symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The full spectrum and integrability of unitary equivalent models are the same. A standard diagnostic tool of integrability is level spacing statistics which requires separating the full spectrum into sectors according to the symmetry. When two unitary equivalent models have different symmetries, it is interesting to know how their level spacing statistics show consistent conclusions. In this work, we examine the level spacing statistics of two unitary equivalent models with distinct local symmetries. The first model is spin-1 XXZ chain $H$, the second model is obtained by Kennedy-Tasaki transformation $U_{KT}HU_{KT}$. We find that the level spacings of model $H$ follow the statistics of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE). However, model $U_{KT}HU_{KT}$ only displays GOE statistics in some sectors after a "hidden non-local symmetry" is resolved, and the other sectors labeled by quantum numbers corresponding to the local symmetries exhibit non-GOE statistics. Additionally, a mapping relation between the levels in the sector $\{Z,X,I\}$ of model $H$ and the sector $\{Z,X,I'\}$ of model $U_{KT}HU_{KT}$ is found, where $Z,X,I$ correspond to the quantum numbers of $\pi$ rotation around $z,x$ axes and bond-centered inversion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16944v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a synthetic Mach-Zehnder interferometer for digitized quantum computing devices to probe fractional exchange statistics of anyonic excitations that appear in quantum spin liquids. Employing an IonQ quantum computer, we apply this scheme to the toric ladder, a quasi-one-dimensional reduction of the toric code. We observe interference patterns resulting from the movement of `electric' excitations in the presence and absence of `magnetic' ones. We model the noise in IonQ via depolarizing Lindbladian dynamics, and find quantitative agreement with the measurements obtained from the quantum device. The synthetic Mach-Zehnder interferometer can thus also serve as an effective means to probe the coherence length and time scales of multi-qubit noisy quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: Electron-correlation-driven phonon soft modes have been recently reported in the antiferromagnetic kagome FeGe compound and associated with the observed charge density wave (CDW). In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of the CDW origin in the context of the ab initio lattice dynamics study. Performing the group theory analysis of the mentioned soft mode, we found that the stable structure has the Immm symmetry and can be achieved by shifts of Ge atoms. Additionally, we show that the final structure realizes a distorted honeycomb Ge lattice as well as a non-flat kagome-like Fe net. For completeness, we present the electronic properties calculations. From the theoretical STM topography simulation, we indicate that the observed CDW occurs in the deformed honeycomb Ge sublattice.</description>

      <title>Three-point functions from a Schwinger-Keldysh effective action, resummed in derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for the conjectured QCD critical point in heavy-ion collisions requires to account for far-from equilibrium effects as well as fluctuations, and in particular non-Gaussian fluctuations, in the modeling of the dynamics of the hot and dense matter created in such collisions. In order to study far-from equilibrium effects as well as fluctuations, in this work we construct a Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory (EFT) for the diffusion of the density to all orders in derivatives. The dissipation in the free part of our EFT follows the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation-time approximation (RTA). The interaction part of the EFT is constructed based on the self-interaction of the density field. We analytically find the quadratic and cubic parts of the KMS-invariant EFT in closed form, resummed in derivatives. We then explicitly compute the symmetrized three-point function at tree level, and investigate its analytical structure in detail. We also analytically calculate the branch-point singularity that appears in the structure of the two-point response function due to loop effects. Our results are important for future studies of the real-time dynamics of the correlation functions and the possible relation to thermalization when the system is far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Universal quantum computation using Ising anyons from a non-semisimple Topological Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for topological quantum computation using newly discovered non-semisimple analogs of topological quantum field theories in 2+1 dimensions. These enhanced theories offer more powerful models for quantum computation. The conventional theory of Ising anyons, which is believed to describe excitations in the $\nu = 5/2$ fractional quantum Hall state, is not universal for quantum computation via braiding of quasiparticles. However, we show that the non-semisimple theory introduces new anyon types that extend the Ising framework. By adding just one new anyon type, universal quantum computation can be achieved through braiding alone. This result opens new avenues for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computing in topologically ordered systems.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of particle-hole symmetric systems: a quantum Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of hydrodynamic behavior in electronic flow within clean, particle-hole-symmetric systems at half-filling is a non-trivial problem. Navier-Stokes (NS) equations describe the momentum flow, while experimental measurements typically capture the current flow profiles. However, in particle-hole-symmetric systems, electric current and momentum flow are entirely decoupled because electrons and holes move in opposite directions with equal distribution functions. This makes it challenging to link NS equations to observed flow patterns. In this work, we demonstrate that the hydrodynamic behavior of the charge current at half filling can emerge despite the absence of momentum flow. By combining Boltzmann transport theory with numerically exact Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of clean graphene samples, we show that NS-type equations can be derived directly for the charge current, eliminating the need for any additional mechanism coupling the velocity field and charge current in explaining the experimentally observed hydrodynamic flow profiles in graphene at half-filling. We show that a new transport quantity - the current diffusion coefficient - replaces viscosity and expect this description to be valid for any particle-hole symmetric system. Our results provide new insights into the interpretation of experimental data and demonstrate how Quantum Monte Carlo calculations can serve as an alternative to experiments in transport measurements to verify the kinetic theory results.</description>

      <title>Fragile topology on solid grounds: a mathematical perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a mathematical perspective on fragile topology phenomena in condensed matter physics. In dimension $d \leq 3$, vanishing Chern classes of bundles of Bloch eigenfunctions characterize operators with exponentially localized Wannier functions (these functions form convenient bases of spectrally determined subspaces of $L^2$). However, for systems with additional symmetries, such as the $C_{2}T$ (space-time reversal) or the $PT$ (parity-time) symmetry, a set of exponentially localized Wannier functions compatible with such symmetry may not exist. We show that for rank 2 Bloch bundles with such symmetry, non-trivial Euler classes are obstructions to constructing exponentially localized compatible Wannier functions. We also show that this obstruction can be lifted by adding additional Bloch bundles with the symmetry, even though the Stiefel--Whitney class of the total bundle is non-trivial. This allows a construction of exponentially localized Wannier functions compatible with the symmetry and that is referred to as topological fragility.</description>

      <title>Chiral Instabilities in Driven-Dissipative Quantum Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of periodically driven Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLLs) coupled to a thermal bath using a Floquet-Lindblad approach. When the coupling to the bath satisfies detailed balance, we obtain a condition for parametric instabilities to be suppressed, symmetrically for both chiralities. Remarkably, by designing a purely chiral coupling to the bath, instead of instability suppression, we uncover a driven-dissipative phase transition between the former symmetric parametric instability and a new chiral parametric instability. In the latter, a single chirality of bosonic quasiparticles gets exponentially amplified, leading to a dynamical chiral imbalance within the TLL, reminiscent of the non-Hermitian skin effect.</description>
