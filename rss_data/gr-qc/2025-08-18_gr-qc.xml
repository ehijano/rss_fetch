      <title>Self-gravitating nonlinear Dirac fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the self-gravitating Dirac field with a scalar fermion self-interaction term. For strong enough attractive fermion self-interaction, the maximum Arnowitt-Deser-Misner mass of soliton solutions consisting of two fermions can exceed the limit of noninteracting Dirac stars classically, and the "particle-like" solutions of the system can exhibit multiplicity, multiple valid solutions for a single set of parameters, that is inherent in the nonlinear Dirac field. We also find the mass-scale separation in our system similar to that discussed in the Einstein-Dirac-Higgs system. Interestingly, the system admits parity-violated solutions. The broken parity symmetry can be restored by increasing the central redshift of the solution.</description>

      <title>Acceleration Radiation from Derivative-Coupled Atoms Falling in Modified Gravity Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of quantum detector models with fields in curved spacetimes provides fundamental insights into phenomena such as Hawking and Unruh radiation. While standard models typically assume a minimal coupling between the detector and the field, physically motivated derivative couplings, which are sensitive to field gradients, have been less explored, particularly in the context of modified gravity theories. In this paper, we develop a general framework to analyze the acceleration radiation from a two-level atomic detector with a derivative coupling undergoing a radial geodesic infall into a generic static, spherically symmetric black hole. We derive a general integral expression for the excitation probability and apply it to two distinct spacetimes. For an extended uncertainty principle (EUP) black hole, we demonstrate that the detector radiates with a perfect thermal spectrum at the precise Hawking temperature, reinforcing the universality of this phenomenon. For a black hole solution in a Ricci-coupled Bumblebee gravity model, the radiation is also thermal. Still, its temperature is modified in direct correspondence with the theory's Lorentz-violating parameters, consistent with the modified Hawking temperature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that derivative coupling results in a significantly enhanced entropy flux compared to minimal coupling models. Our results establish acceleration radiation as a sensitive probe of near-horizon physics and demonstrate that this phenomenon can provide distinct observational signatures to test General Relativity (GR) and alternative theories of gravity in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>A New Paradigm for Testing Gravity: Theory-Independent Constraints Using Data From All Astrophysical and Cosmological Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Testing General Relativity (GR) is a key science goal of much of modern physics, and usually results in constraints that are either theory or context specific. We present an holistic framework that we dub `Parametrized Post-Newtonian Cosmology' (PPNC), which can be used for obtaining theory-agnostic constraints on deviations from GR using a single unified set of parameters that apply on all astrophysical and cosmological scales. Our approach is based on the formalism and philosophy of the highly successful Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) framework, but allows us to combine observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) with Solar System observations of the Cassini probe and ephemeris of Mars. The full combination of these data sets constrains average deviations from GR over the history of the Universe to be less than $\sim 10\%$, with PPNC parameter values $\bar{\alpha}=0.97^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$ and $\bar{\gamma}=0.97^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ at the $68\%$ confidence level (GR corresponds to $\bar{\alpha}=\bar{\gamma}=1$). We find that these gravitational parameters have a strong mutual degeneracy, and are constrained to be within $1\%$ of each other for all of cosmic history. Our results demonstrate the ability of the PPNC framework to combine astrophysical, Solar System and cosmological tests of gravity into a single set of unified constraints. We expect our approach to be particularly useful for upcoming missions in both cosmology and astrophysics, which ultimately seek to constrain the same underlying gravitational interaction.</description>

      <title>Perturbations of Solitonic Boson Stars: Nonlinear Radial Stability and Binding Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear radial stability of boson stars with a solitonic potential across the entire parameter space, focusing especially on families of solutions that support ultracompact models on the perturbatively stable branch. Using a dimensional reduction of the CCZ4 formulation of numerical relativity, we dynamically evolve these models with both internal and external perturbations. We find in particular that there are perturbatively stable models with positive binding energy that do not effectively disperse even under explicit perturbations, challenging the conventional wisdom that negative binding energy is a necessary condition for the dynamical stability of boson stars and other compact objects.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Perspective of Gravitational Lensing in Perturbed Cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the spacetime approach to gravitational lensing by spherically symmetric perturbations of flat, cosmological constant-dominated Friedman-Robertson-Walker metrics. The geodesics of the spacetime are expressed as integral expressions which are used to examine the formation of multiple images and the observed shapes of non-point sources. We develop the lens mapping from the spacetime perspective, and use the Jacobian of the mapping to explain the observed image shapes. Approaching the geodesic equations as ordinary differential equations, we demonstrate the development of wave front singularities and time delays between light ray signals. This work demonstrates that the widely used thin lens approximation can be replaced with more robust techniques aligned with general relativity.</description>

      <title>Hayward Boson Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examined the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system coupled to a nonlinear electrodynamics framework that asymptotically supports a Hayward spacetime. We explored the solution space of a static spherically symmetric, complex scalar field minimally coupled to the gravitational field known as Hayward Boson stars originally studied by Yue and Wang. We construct families of Hayward boson stars in the ground state, for different values of the charge parameter $Q$, and different values of the central scalar field. One of the main results of our analysis is the fact that the existence of boson stars is guaranteed once the condition $\frac{\sqrt{\beta}}{Q}&gt; 1.49661$, where $\beta$ is a parameter of the electrodynamic theory, is fulfilled. When this condition is not satisfied the electrovacum spacetime contains at least one horizon and the spacetime can not support a scalar field configuration.</description>

      <title>Energy extraction from the accelerating Kerr black hole via magnetic reconnection in the plunging region and circular orbit region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the magnetic reconnection mechanism, this study investigates how to extract energy effectively from an accelerating Kerr black hole in the plunging region and circular orbit region. After introducing the properties of accelerating black holes, including the event horizon, ergosphere, circular orbits, and innermost stable circular orbit, we investigate the magnetic reconnection process in the plunging region. Specifically, we analyze variations of the azimuthal angle with respect to the acceleration, examine changes in energy per enthalpy of decelerated plasma, and plot energy extraction efficiency along with permissible energy extraction regions. Results show that in the plunging region, at larger radii of reconnection locations, the accelerating black hole exhibits higher energy extraction efficiency than a Kerr black hole. Away from extremality, the acceleration parameter impedes energy extraction, while near extremality, it enhances extraction. We also study energy extraction in circular orbit region by plotting energy extraction efficiency within permissible regions. We find that the permissible energy extraction area is reduced and the efficiency exceeds that of Kerr black holes due to the existence of acceleration parameter. Larger acceleration parameters yield more effective energy extraction regardless of extremality, which is different from that in the plunging region. Additionally, energy extraction efficiency in the plunging region surpasses that in the circular orbit region, aligning with prior conclusions.</description>

      <title>Wavelets for power spectral density estimation of gravitational wave data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power spectral density (PSD) estimation is a critical step in gravitational wave (GW) detectors data analysis. The Welch method is a typical non-parametric spectral estimation approach that estimates the PSD of stationary noise by averaging periodograms of several time segments, or by taking the median of periodograms to adapt to non-stationary noise. In this work, we propose a wavelet-based approach for fast PSD estimation of both stationary and non-stationary noise. For stationary noise, we apply wavelet smoothing to the periodogram, avoiding the segmentation step in the Welch method, and enabling PSD estimates with high frequency resolution and low variance. The wavelet smoothing PSD outperforms Welch PSD in matched filtering and parameter estimation. For non-stationary noise, we estimate the PSD by taking the median of wavelet packet coefficients in each frequency bin, which offers greater robustness than the traditional median periodogram method. This work introduces a new PSD estimation approach for GW data analysis and expands the application of wavelet methods in this field.</description>

      <title>Destructuring Physics: A functional derivation of spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I propose that Physics should be formulated using minimal mathematical structure, beginning with its foundational arena: spacetime. This paper opens with a concise overview of several research directions explored in previous work. Among these are the proposal to represent spacetime at the quantum scale using (measure) closed ordered spaces; the unification of causality and topology through quasi-uniformities; the concept of the product trick to unify causality and metricity; the introduction of upper semi-continuous (stable) Lorentzian distances; the representation of spacetime via steep time functions; and the formulation of the Lorentzian distance formula.
  Subsequently, the properties of the stable distance over stable spacetimes are used as a reference to propose a simplified, abstract notion of spacetime. The discussion shows that spacetime can be introduced in a general and minimalistic way as nothing more than a family of functions defined over an arbitrary set. This abstraction removes unnecessary mathematical complexity, reducing spacetime to its essential elements while preserving its most fundamental physical properties.</description>

      <title>The representation of spacetime through time functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of the stable distance over stable spacetimes are used as a reference to propose a simplified, abstract notion of spacetime. The discussion shows that spacetime, with its topology, causal order and (upper semi-continuous) Lorentzian distance, can be introduced in a general and minimalistic way. Specifically, it is shown that spacetime can be represented as nothing more than a family of functions defined over an arbitrary set, the functions being a posteriori interpreted as rushing time functions. The proof makes use of the product trick which reduces causality and metricity to causality in a space with one additional dimension, so leading to a kind of unification for the notions of time function and proper time. Ultimately, our results show that time fully characterizes spacetime.</description>

      <title>Polarization Images of Solitonic Boson Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the polarization characteristics of solitonic boson stars surrounded by a thin accretion disk. By comparing their polarization images with corresponding optical images, we find a positive correlation between the polarization intensity distribution in the polarization images and the brightness in the optical images. Consequently, the strongest polarization occurs at the location corresponding to the direct image. The influence of the coupling strength of the sixtic potential on the polarization intensity distribution is not monotonic, under strong coupling, the polarization will concentrated on the left side of the image as the coupling strength increases, whereas under weak coupling, it is more evenly distributed across the entire direct image as the coupling strength increases. Moreover, we find that as the initial scalar field increases, both the lensing image and photon ring become more prominent. However, the polarization intensity at these regions remains weak. Due to the absence of the event horizon in solitonic boson stars, the polarization vector can penetrate the stellar interior, unlike in black holes, where no polarization signals exist within the event horizon. Our numerical simulations clearly reveal this phenomenon, suggesting that polarization features may serve as an effective tool for distinguishing solitonic boson stars from black holes.</description>

      <title>Images and photo regions of continous photon sphere spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study images of spacetimes containing continuous photon spheres (CPS). For a self-gravitating, isotropic, spherically symmetric spacetime with CPS, we find that a thin accretion disk produces images that closely resemble those of a Schwarzschild black hole, despite significant differences in photon dynamics. More generally, for any static, pherically symmetric spacetime with a luminous CPS core, the image profile is universal: members of this class produce identical image shapes, differing only by an overall normalization factor. This universality is, however, sensitive to the nature of the accretion flow and breaks down for spherically symmetric infalling accretion, where Doppler shifts and non-static emission introduce image features that depend on the flow dynamics and the metric. Finally, we investigate photon regions in a rotating CPS spacetime and find that unlike in Kerr spacetime, the photon region appears as one or two angular sectors in a constant-$\phi$ cross section. These distinctive photon region properties could produce observable signatures that distinguish rotating CPS spacetimes from the Kerr one.</description>

Abstract: We show that the null geodesic radial action for unbound orbits in the Kerr spacetime, and consequently the scattering angle, can be resummed in terms of hypergeometric functions, extending previous results [M.~M.~Ivanov, et al. arXiv:2504.07862]. We provide explicit expressions as series expansions in powers of the Kerr rotational parameter up the fourth order included. We finally use the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi formalism to prove the relation between the renormalized angular momentum and the radial action highlighted in previous works.</description>

      <title>Strong Field Scattering of Two Black Holes: Exploring Gauge Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in post-Minkowskian (PM) gravity provide new avenues for the high precision modelling of compact binaries. In conjunction with the Effective One Body (EOB) formalism, highly accurate PM informed models of binary black holes on scattering trajectories have emerged. Several complementary approaches currently exist, in particular the SEOB-PM model, the $w_{\rm eob}$ framework and the recent LEOB approach. These models incorporate PM results in fundamentally different ways, employing distinct resummation schemes and gauge choices. Notably, both SEOB-PM and LEOB have been used to compute gravitational waves of bound systems, showing excellent agreement with numerical relativity (NR). The essential component to all of the models is the EOB mass-shell condition describing the dynamics of the two-body spacetime. In this work we will investigate how this mass-shell condition is constructed, paying particular attention to the impact of gauge choices and how they interact with different resummation schemes, showing that there is a strong dependence on both coordinate choice and EOB gauge. For the region of parameter space considered, we find that the best performing gauges coincide with the choices made in SEOB-PM and $w_{eob}$, with other choices exhibiting worse performance. The case of spinning black holes is also considered, where the current techniques for spinning EOB-PM are reviewed and compared. We also introduce a new gauge based upon the centrifugal radius, which improves upon previous models, particularly for large and negative spins. This offers a promising avenue for further resummation of spin information within the EOB-PM framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of General Relativity has successfully passed a large number of observational tests. The theory has been extensively tested in the weak-field regime with experiments in the Solar System and observations of binary pulsars. The past 10 years have seen significant advancements in the study of the strong-field regime, which can now be tested with gravitational waves, X-ray data, and black hole imaging. Here I summarize the state-of-the-art of the tests of General Relativity with black hole X-ray data and I briefly discuss the long-term vision of the possibility of an interstellar mission to the closest black hole for more precise and accurate tests.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and Joule-Thomson Expansion for Schwarzschild-AdS Black Holes with Cloud of Strings and Quintessential-like Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the thermodynamic properties of a Schwarzschild black hole (BH) embedded in an anti-de Sitter (AdS) background, which is further coupled with a cloud of strings and surrounded by a quintessence-like fluid. Beginning with the formulation of BH mass in terms of the event horizon radius, we incorporate the concept of pressure as related to the AdS curvature radius within the framework of extended phase space thermodynamics. Using this setup, we derive key thermodynamic quantities, including the Gibbs free energy and internal energy, to characterize the energetic behavior of the black hole system. To assess the stability of the black hole, we compute the specific heat capacity and analyze how it is influenced by external parameters, such as the string cloud and the quintessence-like fluid. These geometric and matter fields are shown to significantly modify the thermal response of the BH. Furthermore, we examine the inversion temperature associated with the black hole and highlight its distinction from the standard Hawking temperature, providing deeper insight into the phase structure. Additionally, we investigate the Joule-Thomson expansion process and demonstrate how the aforementioned parameters affect this thermodynamic phenomenon, showing important aspects of BH cooling and heating behavior in an extended thermodynamic context.</description>

      <title>A Primer on Spacetime Singularities I: Mathematical Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a comprehensive and rigorous overview of spacetime singularities within the framework of classical General Relativity. Singularities are defined through the failure of geodesic completeness, reflecting the limits of predictability in spacetime evolution. The paper reviews the mathematical structures involved, including differentiability classes of the metric, and explores key constructions such as Geroch's and Schmidt's formulations of singular boundaries. A detailed classification of singularities - quasi-regular, non-scalar, and scalar - is proposed, based on the behavior of curvature tensors along incomplete curves. The limitations of previous approaches, including the cosmic censorship conjecture and extensions beyond General Relativity, are critically examined. The work also surveys the major singularity theorems of Penrose and Hawking, emphasizing their implications for gravitational collapse and cosmology. By focusing exclusively on the classical regime, the article lays a solid foundation for the systematic study of singular structures in relativistic spacetimes.</description>

      <title>GW200105: A detailed study of eccentricity in the neutron star-black hole binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GW200105_162426 is the first neutron star-black hole merger to be confidently confirmed through either gravitational-wave or electromagnetic observations. Although initially analyzed after detection, the event has recently gained renewed attention following a study, Morras et al. (2025), that employed a post-Newtonian inspiral-only waveform model and reported strong evidence for orbital eccentricity. In this work, we perform a detailed analysis of GW200105 using state-of-the-art effective-one-body waveform models. Importantly, we present the first study of this event utilizing a physically complete model that incorporates both orbital eccentricity and spin precession across the full inspiral, merger, and ringdown stages, along with higher-order gravitational wave modes. Our results support the presence of eccentricity in the signal, with zero eccentricity excluded from $99\%$ credible interval, but yield a mass ratio closer to the original LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA analysis, differing from the findings of Morras et al. (2025). Additionally, similar to previous eccentric-only analysis Planas et al. (2025), we observe a multimodal structure in the eccentricity posterior distribution. We conduct targeted investigations to understand the origin of this multimodality and complement our analysis with numerical relativity simulations to examine how the inclusion of eccentricity impacts the merger dynamics.</description>

      <title>Scalarized neutron stars with a highly relativistic core in scalar-tensor gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact stars in scalar-tensor gravity have been extensively investigated, but relatively few studies have focused on highly relativistic neutron stars (NSs) with an extremely dense core region where the trace of the energy-momentum tensor reverses its sign. In this regime, we identify the origin of the phenomenon where {\it multiple} scalarized solutions exist for a {\it fixed} central density, arising from the oscillatory profile of the scalar field inside the star. This origin further indicates that the multi-branch structure emerges for both negative and positive $\beta$, the quadratic-term coefficient in the effective coupling function between the scalar field and conventional matter in the Einstein frame. By comparing the Damour--Esposito-Far\`ese and Mendes-Ortiz models of the scalar-tensor gravity, we demonstrate that their distinct scalarization behaviors stem from whether the effective coupling function is bounded. We also compute for scalarized NSs with a highly relativistic dense core in scalar-tensor theories the moment of inertia and tidal deformability that are relevant to pulsar-timing and gravitational-wave experiments.</description>

      <title>Black holes of multiple horizons without mass inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass inflation is a phenomenon happened in the vicinity of inner horizon in two-horizon spacetime. It is shown that the mass of initially small perturbations will grow exponentially as they approach the inner horizon. This implies that black hole inner horizon is unstable to the perturbations. In view of the fact that the mass inflation is determined by the surface gravity of inner horizon, Carballo-Rubio et al. showed that if one makes the surface gravity of inner horizon vanish, then the exponential growth character of mass inflation is not present. Basing on this conclusion, we look for the black hole solutions of multiple horizons with nonlinear Maxwell field. Then we make the inner horizons to coincide with each other such that the surface gravities of every inner horizon vanish. By this way, black holes of multiple horizons without mass inflation are constructed.</description>

      <title>Electric Penrose process in Ay\'on-Beato-Garc\'ia (-dS) black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the electric Penrose process in ABG(-dS) regular black holes, examining the influence of the black hole charge and the cosmological constant on the negative-energy region and energy extraction efficiency. Compared with RN(-dS) black holes, ABG(-dS) black holes have a larger negative-energy region, which allows this process to occur farther from the horizons, and higher energy extraction efficiency. This is especially true when the splitting point is close to the event horizon, and the difference widens as the black hole charge increases. Even when the black hole charge and cosmological constant take very small values relevant to astrophysics, significant differences still exist, with the maximum efficiency ratio being approximately 23/8. This indicates that in real astrophysical scenarios, ABG(-dS) black holes can accelerate charged particles more efficiently and exhibit superior energy extraction capabilities compared with RN(-dS) black holes.</description>

      <title>Quantum spacetime from constraints: wave equations and fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous works, we showed that both time and space can emerge from entanglement within a globally constrained quantum Universe, with no background coordinates. By extending the Page and Wootters quantum time formalism to include both quantum clocks and rods, and imposing global constraints on total energy and momentum, we constructed a fully relational model of quantum spacetime. Here we take a further step: working in 1+1 dimensions, we show that the standard wave equations governing quantum particles (the Schr\"odinger, Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations) emerge naturally from this framework. The solutions of the equations are derived directly from the constraints, without assuming any external spacetime structure. The second quantization formalism is also implemented and discussed. Our results provide further support for the idea that quantum dynamics in spacetime may emerge from entanglement and constraints.</description>

      <title>Black holes in the external Bertotti-Robinson-Bonnor-Melvin electromagnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exact and analytical solution, in four-dimensional general relativity coupled with Maxwell electromagnetism, is built by means of a Lie point symmetry of the Ernst equations, the Harrison transformation. The new spacetime describes a Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded into a general external back-reacting electromagnetic field, which is the superposition of the Levi-Civita-Bertotti-Robinson and the Bonnor-Melvin ones. Conserved charges and the first law of thermodynamics are analysed. Swirling generalisations are also considered. Limits to the known metrics such as Schwarzschild-Bertotti-Robinson, Schwarzschild-Bonnor-Melvin and Bertotti-Robinson-Bonnor-Melvin are discussed.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Black holes in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the work [Phys.Rev.D 105 (2022) 2, 024042], D'Ambrosio et al. investigated spherically symmetric black hole solutions in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity, where several solutions satisfy the condition: $g_{tt}g_{rr} = \mathrm{const}$. This condition is characteristic of many black holes, including the Schwarzschild spacetime. In this Comment, we argue that no nontrivial vacuum black hole solutions satisfy this condition in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity. We demonstrate our claim by reexamining the field equations under the "Set 2" connection called by D'Ambrosio et al., which is necessary for obtaining solutions distinct from those of general relativity (GR). For the case where the free parameters $c$ and $k$ are zero, i.e., Option 2 in their work, we show that any attempt to find a solution beyond GR forces the non-metricity scalar to vanish ($\mathbb{Q}=0$), which trivializes the field equations and does not describe a valid black hole solution. Our findings indicate that the condition, $g_{tt}g_{rr} = \mathrm{const.}$, is overly restrictive for finding new, static and spherically symmetric vacuum black holes in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity. This conclusion does not depend on the specific form of $f(\mathbb{Q})$. We also briefly discuss Option 1 that was not addressed in D'Ambrosio et al.'s work, and give new constraints for the selection of parameters $c$ and $k$.</description>

      <title>Correspondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors in five-dimensional black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the correspondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors for the five-dimensional Schwarzschild--Tangherlini black hole. The quasinormal modes of gravitational perturbations are computed numerically using the continued fraction method. Particularly, we analyze the scalar, vector, and tensor types of perturbations, noting that the tensor type only exists in spacetimes with more than four dimensions. The grey-body factors are then calculated analytically via the correspondence, using data from the fundamental quasinormal mode and the first overtone. We then compute the grey-body factors independently using a numerical method and find that the results from the two methods coincide. This demonstrates that the correspondence holds with high accuracy for all three types of gravitational perturbations. Furthermore, our results extend the validity of the correspondence to the tensor type, which can only be tested in spacetimes with more than four dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is part of a bottom-up approach to gravitational thermodynamics that is guided by the axiomatic frameworks of equilibrium thermodynamics. We identify a novel form of the microcanonical distribution for systems in background gravitational fields that respects the kinetic theory and the thermodynamic symmetries. Thermodynamic consistency dictates the treatment of the gravitational field as a thermodynamic variable. We introduce the thermodynamic conjugate to the gravitational field, the gravitational pull, an additive variable that is a structural element of our microcanonical distribution. We demonstrate the validity of our results to inhomogenous background fields, a class of self-gravitating systems, relativistic gases in Rindler spacetime, and quantum gases.</description>

      <title>Primary hairs may create echoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In most scenarios studied so far, the appearance of echoes in the ringdown signal requires modifications external to the black hole itself, such as the presence of matter in the near-horizon region, quantum field clouds, or exotic compact objects like wormholes that effectively introduce additional peaks in the effective potential. In this work we show that echoes can naturally arise in a different setting: black holes endowed with primary Proca-Gauss-Bonnet hair. We demonstrate that the primary hair modifies the effective potential in such a way that a second peak is formed, giving rise to late-time echoes without invoking any external environment or exotic horizon-scale physics. Using both the higher-order WKB method with Pad\'e resummation and time-domain integration, we compute the quasinormal spectrum for scalar and Dirac test fields and show the appearance of these echoes. Our results highlight a novel mechanism by which primary hairs alone can leave observable imprints on the ringdown signal of black holes in modified gravity.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on holography in $(2 + 1)$-dimensional cosmology with a generalized equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study we explore the cosmic holographic principle, as proposed by Fischler and Susskind~\cite{Fischler}, within the framework of $(2 + 1)$-dimensional cosmological models. A generalized equation of state is employed, given by $p = (\zeta - 1)(\rho + \rho_0)$, where $\zeta$ and $\rho_0$ are treated as two free parameters. The analysis confirms the validity of the holographic principle in all flat and open universes. However, for a $(2 + 1)$-dimensional closed universe, we apply the method proposed by Kaloper and Linde~\cite{Kaloper}, and observe that the holographic principle is generally not satisfied. Furthermore, we examine the stability of the proposed model using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, and estimate the best-fit values for the model parameters based on observational Hubble data sets.</description>

      <title>Harvesting Contextuality from the Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum contextuality is the notion that certain measurement scenarios do not admit a global description of their statistics and has been implicated as the source of quantum advantage in a number of quantum information protocols. It has been shown that contextuality generalizes the concepts of non-local entanglement and magic, and is an equivalent notion of non-classicality to Wigner negativity. In this paper, the protocol of contextuality harvesting is introduced and it is shown that Unruh-DeWitt models are capable of harvesting quantum contextuality from the vacuum of a massless scalar quantum field. In particular, it is shown that gapless systems can be made to harvest contextuality given a suitable choice of measurements. The harvested contextuality is also seen to behave similarly to harvested magic and can be larger in magnitude for specific parameter regimes. An Unruh-DeWitt qubit-qutrit system is also investigated, where it is shown that certain tradeoffs exist between the harvested contextuality of the qutrit and the harvested entanglement between the systems, and that there are harvesting regimes where the two resources can both be present. Some of the tools of contextuality, namely the contextual fraction, are also imported and used as general harvesting measures for any form of contextuality, including non-local entanglement and magic. Additionally, new criteria for genuine harvesting are put forward that also apply to individual systems, revealing new permissible harvesting parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Limitations in constraining neutron star radii and nuclear properties from inspiral gravitational wave detections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the constraints on the neutron star equation of state (EoS) and nuclear properties achievable with third-generation gravitational wave detectors using the Fisher information matrix approach. Assuming an optimistic binary neutron star (BNS) merger rate, we generate synthetic inspiral gravitational wave (GW) signals corresponding to one year of observation. From these simulated data, we compute the covariance matrix and posterior distributions for nuclear properties and EoS. Our results show that the EoS can be tightly constrained, particularly in the density range between one and four times nuclear saturation density. However, due to the scarcity of of low-mass neutron stars in the GW sample, the EoS at sub-saturation densities remains poorly constrained. Thus, in turn, leads to weaker constraints on neutron star radii, as the radii are sensitive to the low-density EoS. Additionally, We note that the nuclear properties are degenerate in their influence on the EoS, making them difficult to be constrained through GW observations alone. These highlights inherent limitations of inspiral GW signals in probing dense matter properties. Therefore, precise radius measurements, post-merger GW observations, and supplementary constraints from terrestrial nuclear experiments remain essential for a comprehensive understanding of dense matter.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Gravity through Realistic 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: General Algorithm and a Pilot Study with HARPS Radial Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When 3D relative displacement $\mathbf{r}$ and velocity $\mathbf{v}$ between the pair in a gravitationally-bound system are precisely measured, the six measured quantities at one phase can allow elliptical orbit solutions at a given gravitational parameter $G$. Due to degeneracies between orbital-geometric parameters and $G$, individual Bayesian inferences and their statistical consolidation are needed to infer $G$ as recently suggested by a Bayesian 3D modeling algorithm. Here I present a fully general Bayesian algorithm suitable for wide binaries with two (almost) exact sky-projected relative positions (as in the Gaia data release 3) and the other four sufficiently precise quantities. Wide binaries meeting the requirements of the general algorithm to allow for its full potential are rare at present, largely because the measurement uncertainty of the line-of-sight (radial) separation is usually larger than the true separation. As a pilot study, the algorithm is applied to 32 Gaia binaries for which precise HARPS radial velocities are available. The value of $\Gamma \equiv \log_{10}\sqrt{G/G_{\rm N}}$ (where $G_{\rm N}$ is Newton's constant) is $-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.012}$ supporting Newton for a combination of 24 binaries with Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm N}&gt;10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$, while it is $\Gamma=0.063_{-0.047}^{+0.058}$ or $0.134_{-0.040}^{+0.050}$ for $7\text{ or }8$ binaries with $g_{\rm N}&lt;10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$ (depending on one system) showing tension with Newton. The Newtonian ``outlier'' is at the boundary set by the Newtonian escape velocity, but can be consistent with modified gravity. The pilot study demonstrates the potential of the algorithm in measuring gravity at low acceleration with future samples of wide binaries.</description>

      <title>On constraining initial orbital eccentricity of purely inspiral events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA consortium has sporadically detected purely inspiral gravitational-wave events like GW170817 and GW190425. These events offer an opportunity to constrain the presence of possible initial (residual) orbital eccentricities while using purely inspiral template families. We detail the implementation of a LSC Algorithm Library Suite approximant, TaylorF2Ecck, which models analytically inspiral gravitational waves from non-spinning compact binaries in Post-Newtonian accurate eccentric orbits while restricting the initial-eccentricity contributions to its leading order. Specifically, our frequency domain approximant consistently incorporates the orbital, advance of periastron, and gravitational-wave emission effects fully up to the 3PN order. We pursue detailed parameter estimation studies of GW170817 and GW190425 using TaylorF2Ecck, after performing comprehensive sanity checks to validate the model's performance and investigate the influence of periastron advance in the relevant parameter space. The results indicate that initial-eccentricity at 20 Hz is essentially zero (less than 0.011 for GW170817 and less than 0.028 for GW190425) at a 90 percent confidence level. We compare posteriors for these two events that arise from a few purely inspiral eccentric approximants and point out certain subtle effects arising due to the inclusion of periastron advance. Additionally, these detailed studies reveal the importance of incorporating initial eccentricity contributions at least up to 3.5PN-order and discuss its implications. We substantiate this inference by employing versions of quasi-circular TaylorF2 approximant that incorporate Fourier phase contributions beyond the conventional 3.5PN order.</description>

      <title>Interact or Twist: Cosmological Correlators from Field Redefinitions Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cosmology, correlation functions on a late-time boundary can arise from both field redefinitions and bulk interactions, which are usually believed to generate distinct results. In this letter, we propose a counterexample showcasing that correlators from local field redefinitions can be identical to the ones from bulk interactions. In particular, we consider a two-field model in de Sitter space, where the field space gets twisted by field redefinitions to yield a nontrivial reheating surface. We then exploit conformal symmetry to compute the three-point function, and show that the result takes the form of contact correlators with a total-energy singularity. Our finding suggests that in the effective field theory, a class of lower-dimensional operators, which were overlooked previously, may lead to nontrivial signals in cosmological correlators. As an illustration, we apply our result to cosmic inflation and derive a possibly leading signature of the Higgs in the primordial bispectrum.</description>

      <title>Mastering Cosmological Amplitudes Using Generalized Ramanujan's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic method for computing cosmological amplitudes, including in-in correlators and wavefunction coefficients, in FRW spacetime. Specializing to cases with conformally-coupled external scalars and massive scalar exchanges, we introduce a decomposition into massive family trees, which capture the nested time structure common to these observables. We then evaluate these building blocks using the Method of Brackets (MoB), a multivariate extension of Ramanujan's master theorem that operates directly on the integrand, translating integrals into discrete summations via a compact set of algebraic rules. This yields infinite series representations valid across the full space of external momenta and internal energies. We also develop Feynman-like diagrammatic rules that map interaction graphs to summand structures, enabling efficient and scalable computation. The resulting expressions make time evolution manifest, smoothly interpolate to the conformal limit, and are well suited for both numerical evaluation and analytic analysis of massive field effects in cosmology.</description>

      <title>New black hole mergers in the LIGO-Virgo O3 data from a gravitational wave search including higher-order harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nearly all of the previous gravitational wave (GW) searches in the LIGO-Virgo data included GW waveforms with only the dominant quadrupole harmonic, i.e., omitting higher-order harmonics which are predicted by general relativity. We improved the IAS pipeline by efficiently introducing higher harmonics in the GW templates using the techniques in Wadekar et al. [1, 2]. Using the IAS-HM pipeline on the public LIGO-Virgo data from the O3 run, we find 11 new candidate BBH mergers with $0.52\leq p_\mathrm{astro}\leq 0.88$ (we use the detection threshold as the astrophysical probability, $p_\mathrm{astro}$, being over 0.5, following the approach of other pipelines). We broadly recover the high-significance events from earlier catalogs, except a few which were vetoed. We also find that including higher harmonics in our search raises the significance of a few previously reported marginal events (e.g., GW190711_030756).
  A few notable properties of our new candidate events are as follows. At $&gt;95$% credibility, 4 candidates have primary masses in the intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) range (i.e., above $\sim$100 $M_\odot$). 5 candidates have median mass ratio $q \leq 0.5$. 5 candidates have median redshift $z \geq 0.8$. 3 candidates have non-zero $\chi_{\rm eff}$ at $&gt;95\%$ credibility. While our new candidate events have modest false alarm rates ($\gtrsim 1.5 $/yr), a population inference study including these can better inform the parameter space of BHs corresponding to the pair instability mass gap, high redshifts and asymmetric mass ratios.</description>

      <title>Projective path to points at infinity in spherically symmetric spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02128v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proves that, in a four-dimensional spherically symmetric spacetime manifold, one can consider coordinate transformations expressed by fractional linear maps which give rise to isometries and are the simplest example of coordinate transformation used to bring infinity down to a finite distance. The projective boundary of spherically symmetric spacetimes here studied is the disjoint union of three points: future timelike infinity, past timelike infinity, spacelike infinity, and the three-dimensional products of half-lines with a 2-sphere. Geodesics are then studied in the projectively transformed (t',r',theta',phi') coordinates for Schwarzschild spacetime, with special interest in their way of approaching our points at infinity. Next, Nariai, de Sitter and Godel spacetimes are studied with our projective method. Since the kinds of infinity here defined depend only on the symmetry of interest in a spacetime manifold, they have a broad range of applications, which motivate the innovative analysis of Schwarzschild, Nariai, de Sitter and Godel spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03147v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotating black holes can produce superradiant clouds of ultralight bosons. When the black hole is part of a binary system, its cloud can undergo resonances and ionization. These processes leave a distinct signature on the gravitational waveform that depends on the cloud's properties. To determine the state of the cloud by the time the system enters the band of future millihertz detectors, we study the chronological sequence of resonances encountered during the inspiral. For the first time, we consistently take into account the nonlinearities induced by the orbital backreaction and we allow the orbit to have generic eccentricity and inclination. We find that the resonance phenomenology exhibits striking new features. Resonances can "start" or "break" above critical thresholds of the parameters, which we compute analytically, and induce dramatic changes in eccentricity and inclination. Applying these results to realistic systems, we find two possible outcomes. If the binary and the cloud are sufficiently close to counter-rotating, the cloud survives in its original state until the system enters in band; otherwise, the cloud is destroyed during a resonance at large separations, but leaves an imprint on the eccentricity and inclination. In both scenarios, we characterize the observational signatures, with particular focus on future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>No-hair and almost-no-hair results for static axisymmetric black holes and ultracompact objects in astrophysical environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: No-hair theorems are uniqueness results constraining the form of the metric of black holes in general relativity. These theorems are typically formulated under idealized assumptions, involving a mixture of local (regularity of the horizon) and global aspects (everywhere vacuum spacetime and asymptotic flatness). This limits their applicability to astrophysical scenarios of interest such as binary black holes and accreting systems, as well as their extension to horizonless objects. A previous result due to G\"urlebeck constrains the asymptotic multipolar structure of static spacetimes containing black holes surrounded by matter although not revealing the possible structure of the metric itself. In this work, we disentangle some of these assumptions in the static and axisymmetric case. Specifically: i) we show that only a one-parameter family of black-hole geometries is compatible with a given external gravitational field, ii) we also analyze the case in which the central object is close to forming an event horizon but is still horizonless and show that the deviations from the natural black-hole shape have to die off as one approaches the black hole limit under the physical principle that curvatures are bounded.</description>

      <title>Space-borne Interferometers to Detect Thousands of Memory Signals Emitted by Stellar-mass Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational memory effect manifests gravitational nonlinearity, degenerate vacua, and asymptotic symmetries; its detection is considered challenging. We propose using the space-borne interferometer to detect memory signals from stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs), typically targeted by ground-based detectors. We use DECIGO detector as an example. Over 5 years, DECIGO is estimated to detect $\sim$2,036 memory signals (SNRs $&gt;$3) from stellar-mass BBHs. Simulations used frequency-domain memory waveforms for direct SNR estimation. Predictions utilized a GWTC-3 constrained BBH population model (Power Law + Peak mass, DEFAULT spin, Madau-Dickinson merger rate). The analysis used conservative lower merger rate limits and considered orbital eccentricity. The high detection rate stems from strong memory signals within DECIGO's bandwidth and the abundance of stellar-mass BBHs. This substantial, conservative detection count enables statistical use of the memory effect for fundamental physics and astrophysics. DECIGO exemplifies that space interferometers may better detect memory signals from smaller mass binaries than their typical targets. Detectors in lower frequency bands are expected to find strong memory signals from $\sim 10^4 M_\odot$ binaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply Iyer-Wald's covariant phase space formalism to asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes and establish the thermodynamic first law, expressed in terms of the Abbott-Deser mass. Similar to Iyer-Wald's first law for asymptotically flat black holes, our first law applies to general asymptotically de Sitter perturbations around a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-de Sitter black hole, without imposing any symmetry for the perturbations. We explicitly derive the first law up to the second order in perturbation. Additionally, we apply this first law to a thought experiment involving the overcharging of a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-de Sitter black hole by injecting energy and charge sources. We find that asymptotically de Sitter black holes cannot be overcharged, provided that the null energy condition holds, thereby reinforcing the weak cosmic censorship conjecture.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Cardoso and Natario constructed an exact solution of Einstein-scalar field equations that describes a scalar counterpart of the Schwarzschild-Melvin Universe. In fact, this solution belongs to a more general class of solutions described by Herdeiro in [7]. In this work we show how to further generalize these solutions in presence of acceleration, rotation and various charges. More specifically, we describe general accelerating charged rotating black holes with NUT charge in scalar multipolar universes and present some of their properties.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the Bogoliubov vs Boltzmann approaches in gravitational production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral behavior of scalar fluctuations generated by gravity during inflation and the subsequent reheating phase. We consider a non-perturbative Bogoliubov treatment within the context of pure gravitational reheating. We compute both long and short-wavelength spectra, first for a massless scalar field, revealing that the spectral index in part of the infrared (IR) regime varies between $-6$ and $-3$, depending on the post-inflationary equation of state (EoS), $0\leq w_\phi\leq1$. Furthermore, we study the mass-breaking effect of the IR spectrum by including finite mass, $m_{\chi}$, of the daughter scalar field. We show that for $m_{\chi}/H_{\rm e} \gtrsim 3/2$, where $H_{\rm e}$ is the Hubble parameter during inflation, the IR spectrum of scalar fluctuations experiences exponential mass suppression, while for smaller masses, $m_{\chi}/H_{\rm e}&lt;3/2$, the spectrum remains flat in the IR regime regardless of the post-inflationary EoS. For any general EoS, we also compute a specific IR scale, $k_m$, of fluctuations below which the IR spectrum will suffer from this finite mass effect. In the UV regime, oscillations of the inflaton background lead to interference terms that explain the high-frequency oscillations in the spectrum. Interestingly, we find that for any EoS, $1/9 \lesssim w_\phi \lesssim 1$, the spectral behavior turns out to be independent of the EoS, with a spectral index $ -6$. We have compared this Bogoliubov treatment for the UV regime to perturbative computations with solutions to the Boltzmann equation and found an agreement between the two approaches for any EoS, $0 \lesssim w_\phi \lesssim 1$. We also explore the relationship between the gravitational reheating temperature and the reheating EoS employing the non-perturbative analytic approach, finding that reheating can occur for $w_\phi \gtrsim 0.6$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ a ray-tracing algorithm to simulate the shadows of three equal-mass black holes in static equilibrium across a wide parameter space. We find that the shadows consist of a larger primary shadow and several distorted, eyebrow-like secondary shadows. The boundaries of these profiles exhibit self-similar fractal structures, which can be attributed to the photon chaotic scattering. In certain parameter spaces, we also observe the ring-like shadows, with the ring diameter associated with the spacing of black holes. Furthermore, when the black holes approach each other sufficiently, their shadows can merge into a standard disk, suggesting a shadow degeneracy between closely arranged triple black holes and a single massive, spherically symmetric black hole. The shadow features of the triple black holes revealed in this study have potential implications for analyzing the shadow formation mechanisms, as well as the gravitational lensing during the merger and inspiral of black holes.</description>

In the limit where an infinite series of corrections is included, we obtain theories that admit fully regular black hole solutions.

      <title>Equipartition of Energy in Gravitating Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09500v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore on the one hand, whether the well-known theorem of equipartition of energy also applies to physical systems in which gravity plays a non-negligible role, as is the case of cosmological horizons and, on the other hand, if the holographic principle holds for these systems. Furthermore, we find a direct connection between the partition function of the gravitating system and the metric of the gravitational field.</description>

      <title>Toroidal black holes in four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From a purely geometric (kinematic) perspective, black holes in four dimensional spacetimes can have event horizons with arbitrary topologies. It is only when energy conditions are imposed that the horizon's topology is constrained to be that of a sphere. Despite this, exploring exotic horizon topologies remains theoretically intriguing since it allows to unveil structural aspects of General Relativity and gain intuition on energy condition violations. In the axisymmetric case, besides the well-known spherical topology, only a toroidal topology is consistent with the symmetry. Complete solutions, describing the entire exterior region of such toroidal black holes without singularities, have not been reported yet. To the best of our knowledge, the construction we present here is the first explicit example of a toroidal black hole solution in four spacetime dimensions that is free of singularities in the external region.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass ratio inspirals in rotating dark matter spikes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) signals from extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are a key observational target for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The waveforms may be affected by the astrophysical environment surrounding the central black hole (BH), and in particular by the surrounding dark matter (DM) distribution. In this work, we consider the effect of a rotating DM "spike" around a central Kerr BH, and assess its detectability with LISA. Using a fully relativistic model for the rotating spike, we investigate its effect on the inspiral and hence on the emitted GW signals. We compute dephasings and mismatches to quantify how the spin of the primary BH affects the binary dynamics and the gravitational waveform. We show that the modifications due to the spin of the primary BH improve the detection prospects of DM spikes with LISA, and must be taken into account for future parameter estimation studies. We also estimate within post-Newtonian theory how the environment affects the background metric, and show that this effect is mostly negligible for the systems we consider.</description>

      <title>Can quantum gravity be both consistent and complete?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General relativity, despite its profound successes, fails as a complete theory due to presence of singularities. While it is widely believed that quantum gravity has the potential to be a complete theory, in which spacetime consistently emerges from quantum degrees of freedom through computational algorithms, we demonstrate that this goal is fundamentally unattainable. Godel's theorems establish that no theory based on computational algorithms can be both complete and consistent, while Tarski's undefinability theorem demonstrates that even within quantum gravity, or any computational framework, a fully consistent internal determination of true propositions is impossible. Chaitin's incompleteness theorem further reinforces this conclusion, revealing intrinsic limits to any computational theory. We discuss some possible consequences for descriptions of physical systems, and note that a non-algorithmic approach should be essential for any theory of everything.</description>

      <title>A pedagogical approach to the black hole information problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The semiclassical depiction of gravity has provided many important results, such as particle creation effects in expanding universes and in spacetimes containing black holes. However, many questions remain open, most notably concerning the final product of the black hole evaporation process and the conservation of information. From a pedagogical perspective, we review the concepts that lead to this state of affairs, also known as the black hole information problem, and discuss the assumptions and hypotheses necessary for its formulation. Stating the necessary conjectures and results that lead to the geometrical properties of black holes, we present the notion of black hole evaporation and the result that entanglement between causally complementary regions is an intrinsic feature of quantum field theory under the Hadamard condition. We then show that, under certain assumptions, formation and complete evaporation of a black hole can lead to information loss. Comparing such a result to the main alternatives to this non-unitary dynamical evolution, we formulate the black hole information problem and show that information loss is a genuine prediction if no deviations from the semiclassical picture occur at the Planck scale.</description>

      <title>Structure Scalars for Charged Dissipative Spherical Collapse in $f(R, T)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23605v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the structure scalars constructed from the orthogonal splitting of the Riemann tensor for the spacetime metric describing the interior of a charged matter configuration undergoing dissipative collapse in the framework of $f(R,T)$ gravity (where $R$ and $T$ are the Ricci scalar and the trace of energy-momentum tensor, respectively), and also the way these quantities influence the various physical parameters of the collapsing matter. In absence of dissipation, the energy density inhomogeneity is found to be influenced by the structure scalar $X_{TF}$ and the mass-function of the collapsing matter. Further, the presence of charge affects the structure scalars and the total mass-energy content. The dependence of the various physical parameters like heat dissipation, energy density inhomogeneity, evolution of the expansion scalar, the shear scalar, effective homogeneous energy density, and pressure anisotropy on the structure scalars, have been clearly indicated along with a discussion on the complexity factor of the collapsing configuration. The $f(R,T)$ junction conditions have been presented, showing the matching conditions for the matter Lagrangian and their derivatives at the boundary. The energy conditions are also presented and the possibility of violation of the Strong Energy Condition has been discussed.</description>

      <title>Clarifying the relation between covariantly conserved currents and Noether's second theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proper conservation laws, that is, the existence of local functions of the fields whose divergence vanishes on-shell, are associated with global symmetries and are a consequence of Noether's first theorem. Covariant conservation laws, i.e., the same type of laws but featuring a covariant divergence, are associated with local symmetries and are a consequence (under certain conditions) of Noether's second theorem. In this paper, we clarify under which conditions Noether's second theorem, which is mostly known for providing relations between the equations of motion of a theory that possesses some local symmetries, can be used to generate covariantly conservation laws. We do it using mostly the tools of Calculus, in the fashion of Noether's original article, avoiding the somewhat complicated mathematical tools that plague much of the literature on this topic, thus making the article readable for the general physicist.</description>

Abstract: We establish a hidden symmetry between the specific volumes of the coexistent phases and hence develop an analytical approach to study criticality of AdS black holes. In particular, using the method, we solve the coexistence line exactly for a variety of black holes, including the charged AdS black hole in diverse dimensions, the rotating AdS black hole, the Gauss-Bonnet black hole and the quantum BTZ black hole as well as the Van der Waals fluid.</description>

      <title>A new class of rotating charged black holes with non-aligned electromagnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a large family of twisting and expanding solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations of algebraic type D, for which the two double principal null directions (PNDs) of the Weyl tensor are not aligned with the null eigendirections of the Faraday tensor. In addition to systematically deriving this new class, we present its various metric forms and convenient parameterizations. We show that in Boyer-Lindquist-type coordinates these solutions depend on 7 parameters, namely the Kerr and NUT (Newman-Unti-Tamburino) twist parameters $a$ and $l$, mass parameter $m$, acceleration $\alpha$, strength of the Maxwell field $|c|$, and angular parameters $\beta, \gamma$ that represent two duality rotations of the Faraday tensor, which include the rotation between the electric and magnetic charges generating the aligned part of the Maxwell field. This coordinate parameterization, analogous to the Griffiths-Podolsk\'y form of the Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski solutions, allows us to perform various limits, explicitly identify the subcases, and determine the physical interpretation of the new class. Interestingly, by considering the limit with no acceleration ($\alpha\to 0$), one obtains either the famous Kerr-Newman-NUT black holes (if the parameter $|c|$ remains constant) or the novel Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson black holes, announced recently in our work arXiv:2507.05199 (if $|c|\rightarrow \infty$ while $\alpha |c|=\mathrm{const.}$). We may thus conclude that this new class of spacetimes represents twisting charged accelerating black holes, immersed in an external magnetic (or electric) field. In the non-twisting subcase, we obtain the previously known solution of Van den Bergh-Carminati.</description>

      <title>Partial tidal disruptions of spinning eccentric white dwarfs by spinning intermediate mass black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs, $\sim 10^2-10^5M_{\odot}$) are often dubbed as the missing link between stellar mass ($\lesssim 10^2M_{\odot}$) and super-massive ($\gtrsim 10^{5-6} M_{\odot}$) BHs. Observational signatures of these can result from tidal disruptions of white dwarfs (WDs), which would otherwise be captured as a whole by super-massive BHs. Recent observations indicate that IMBHs might be rapidly spinning, while it is also known that isolated white dwarfs might have large spins, with spin periods of the order of minutes. Here, we aim to understand the effects of ``coupling'' between BH and stellar spin, focussing on the tidal disruption of spinning WDs in the background of spinning IMBHs. Using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, we perform a suite of numerical simulations of partial tidal disruptions, where spinning WDs are in eccentric orbits about spinning IMBHs. We take a hybrid approach, where we integrate the Kerr geodesic equations while being in a regime where we can treat the internal stellar fluid dynamics in the Newtonian limit. The coupling of BH and stellar spin results in distinctive behaviour of mass distribution of debris, compared to non-rotating cases. Further, while late time fallback rates of debris into the BH is unaffected by only BH spin, these have noticeable deviations in the presence of stellar spin, in particular, this causes a broadening of the fallback curves at late times. On the other hand, gravitational wave signatures are unaffected by stellar spin in the parameter regime that we consider.</description>

      <title>Estimating the gravitational wave background anisotropy: a Bayesian approach boosted by cross-correlation angular power spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new method designed for Bayesian inference of the angular power spectrum of the Gravitational Wave Background (GWB) anisotropy. This scheme works with time-series data and can optionally incorporate the cross-correlations between the GWB anisotropy and other cosmological tracers, enhancing the significance of Bayesian inference. We employ the realistic LISA response and noise model to demonstrate the validity of this approach. The findings indicate that, without considering any cross-correlations, the 4-year LISA data is insufficient to achieve a significant detection of multipoles. However, if the anisotropies in the GWB are strongly correlated with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the 4-year data can provide unbiased estimates of the quadrupole moment ($\ell = 2$). This reconstruction process is generic and not restricted to any specific detector, offering a new framework for extracting anisotropies in the GWB data from various current and future gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Exploring lensing signatures through spectrotemporal correlations: implications for black hole parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme gravitational lensing and relativistic frequency shifts, combined together, imply that radiation emitted from a black hole's vicinity can echo at different frequencies and times, leading to spectrotemporal correlations in observed signals. If such correlations are uncovered by future observations, they could provide a probe of the spacetime geometry in the strong-field region near black holes. Here, motivated by these prospects, we numerically compute the two-point correlation function of specific flux fluctuations in a simple model of line emission by a hotspot in an equatorial circular orbit. We make use of the Adaptive Analytical Ray Tracing (AART) code to generate the light curves we then correlate. Our results for the correlation maps show a clear decomposition into direct emission-dominated, and lensing-dominated contributions. The computation transcends past analytical approximations, studying the main contribution to the correlation function, which is not deep in the universal regime. We compute correlation maps for many combinations of black hole mass, spin, inclination, hotspot width, and orbital radius, and study their dependence on these parameters. The correlation maps are then used to train convolutional neural networks which can be used to estimate source parameters, achieving promisingly low evaluation errors within the model. Our results could be relevant for future X-ray spectroscopic missions, offering insights into black hole parameter inference.</description>

      <title>Massive Double White Dwarf Binary Mergers from the Moon: Extending the Reach of Multi-messenger Astrophysics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential of lunar-based gravitational-wave detectors to broaden the multi-messenger astrophysics landscape by detecting mergers of massive ($M_1,M_2 &gt;1 M_\odot$) double white dwarf (WD) binaries. These systems are potential progenitors of Type Ia supernovae and could serve as independent probes of cosmic expansion. We examine two proposed lunar gravitational-wave detector concepts operating in the sub-hertz band (0.1-1 Hz): the Gravitational-Wave Lunar Observatory for Cosmology (a proxy for suspended test mass detectors) and the Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (a proxy for seismic array detectors). We estimate that these detectors could reach distances of up to $\sim$1 Gpc for the most massive mergers. We show that lunar detectors could observe up to dozens of massive WD mergers annually, including those originating from globular clusters. Lunar detectors would constrain the masses of these WDs with an unprecedented accuracy of one part in a million. Furthermore, these detectors would provide early warnings of weeks before merger, including sky-localization of square arcminute resolution, enabling a new era of coordinated multi-messenger follow-up of electromagnetic transients-whether they evolve into Type Ia supernovae or accretion-induced collapse events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a new roadmap for constructing microstates of non-extremal black holes in supergravity. First, we review the non-linear sigma model of five-dimensional supergravity governing stationary solutions with a U(1) isometry and present the first generalized Ernst formulation of this model. We then revisit solution-generating techniques associated to the coset model symmetry, Ernst formalism and inverse scattering method. While some of these techniques have been extensively used to generate non-extremal black holes and black rings in supergravity, we demonstrate how they can be adapted to construct systematically non-BPS smooth horizonless geometries that have the same mass and charges as non-extremal black holes. To illustrate these methods, we construct novel static solutions of this type, including a non-BPS generalization of the $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS Gibbons-Hawking center, which has served as the fundamental building block of multicenter microstates of BPS black holes.</description>

      <title>Topological properties of curved spacetime Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, a prime example of a one-dimensional topologically nontrivial insulator, has been extensively studied in flat space-time. In recent times, many studies have been conducted to understand the properties of the low-dimensional quantum matter in curved spacetime, which can mimic the gravitational event horizon and black hole physics. However, the impact of curved spacetime on the topological properties of such systems remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the curved spacetime (CST) version of the SSH model by introducing a position-dependent hopping parameter. We show, using different topological markers, that the CST-SSH model can undergo a topological phase transition. We find that the topologically non-trivial phase can host zero-energy edge modes, but those edge modes are asymmetric, unlike the usual SSH model. Moreover, we find that at the topological transition point, a critical slowdown takes place for zero-energy wave packets near the boundary, indicating the presence of a horizon, and interestingly, if one moves even a slight distance away from the transition point, wave packets start bouncing back and reverse direction before reaching the horizon. An extended version of the CST-SSH model, which supports distinct topological phases characterized by higher winding numbers, has also been studied. We show that a similar critical slowdown of wave packets near the boundary occurs at all topological transition points between any two distinct phases. A semiclassical description of the wave packet trajectories also supports these results.</description>

      <title>Cosmic strings in the complex symmetron model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study cosmic strings in the complex symmetron model, a scalar-tensor theory with a spontaneously broken local $U(1)$ symmetry in low matter density regions. Using numerical simulations, we show that these strings preferentially attach to matter halos, leading to the stabilization of string loops. While the requirement for screening of fifth-force interactions in the solar system limits observable signatures in theories with universal coupling to matter, analogous topological defects in the dark sector may still influence cosmic structure formation, offering a novel avenue to constrain dark-sector interactions.</description>

      <title>Open-closed 3d gravity as a random ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate an ensemble of boundary CFTs within the framework of a tensor model recently constructed to model 3d quantum gravity. The incorporation of CFT borders introduces new elements to the gravity theory. In particular, it leads to an open-closed extension of Virasoro TQFT, which in the classical limit gives rise to 3d gravity with tensionful end-of-the-world branes. It also provides predictions for off-shell manifolds with bordered asymptotic boundaries, such as the annulus wormhole. As an application, we construct a purely open variant of the tensor model to study a purely open bootstrap problem in the context of CFT triangulation. We also briefly discuss the extension to non-orientable CFTs.</description>

      <title>Direct High-Resolution Imaging of Earth-Like Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have surveyed all conventional methods proposed or conceivable for obtaining resolved images of an Earth-like exoplanet. Generating a 10 x 10 pixel map of a 1 R_E world at 10 pc demands ~0.85 uas angular resolution and photon-collection sufficient for SNR &gt;= 5 per "micro-pixel." We derived diffraction-limit and photon-budget requirements for: (1) large single-aperture space telescopes with internal coronagraphs; (2) external-starshades; (3) space-based interferometry (nulling and non-nulling); (4) ground-based ELTs with extreme AO; (5) pupil-densified "hypertelescopes"; (6) indirect reconstructions (rotational light-curve inversion, eclipse mapping, intensity interferometry); and (7) diffraction-occultation by Solar System bodies. Even though these approaches serve their primary goals-exoplanet discovery and initial coarse characterization--each remains orders of magnitude away from delivering a spatially resolved image. In every case, technology readiness falls short, and fundamental barriers leave them 2-5 orders of magnitude below the angular resolution and photon-budget thresholds needed to map an Earth analog even on decadal timescales. Ultimately, an in-situ platform delivered to &lt;= 0.1 AU of the target could, in principle, overcome both diffraction and photon-starvation limits--but such a mission far exceeds current propulsion, autonomy, and communications capabilities. By contrast, the Solar Gravitational Lens--providing on-axis gain of ~1e10 and inherent uas-scale focusing once an imaging spacecraft reaches beyond &gt;=550 AU--appears uniquely capable of simultaneously meeting both the resolution and photon-budget requirements. The SGL thus enables true, resolved surface images and spatially resolved spectroscopy of Earth-like exoplanets in our stellar neighborhood, provided several mission-specific risks (coronal calibration, focal-plane scanning, deconvolution) are retired.</description>

      <title>Stochastic inflation as an open quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reinterpret Starobinsky's stochastic inflation as an open quantum system, where short-wavelength modes act as the environment for long-wavelength modes. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we systematically trace out the environment and derive an effective theory for the reduced density matrix, including deviations from exact de Sitter. The resulting master equation is a Lindblad equation, which reduces to a Fokker-Planck equation for the diagonal elements up to higher orders in the slow-roll expansion, while also yielding a more complete equation in phase space. Finally, we extend the formalism to global de Sitter, for which the associated Fokker-Planck equation lacks equilibrium solutions until the late-time regime $aH \gg 1$.</description>

      <title>Self-Tracking Solutions for Asymptotic Scalar Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of pure scalar fields rolling on an exponential potential in the absence of any additional background fluid and demonstrate the existence of self-tracking solutions in which the self-perturbations of the scalar field act as an effective radiation background. The validity of these solutions is demonstrated through both analytic techniques and numerical simulations using CosmoLattice. We discuss applications to string cosmologies with significant trans-Planckian field excursions between inflation and BBN, including the required initial level of scalar perturbations to avoid overshoot.</description>

      <title>Tightening constraints on primordial oscillations with latest ACT and SPT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The oscillation feature in primordial power spectrum (PPS), a fingerprint of not only a wide class of models of inflation but new physics, is of significant theoretical interest, and can be imprinted on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In this work, we present constraints on periodic oscillations in the PPS using the latest ACT DR6 and SPT-3G D1 CMB data with the precise measurements at high multipoles beyond the Planck angular resolution and sensitivity. It is found that the combination of SPT and ACT with Planck CMB dataset significantly tightens the upper bound to $A_\mathrm{log,lin}\lesssim 0.029$ at $95\%$ C.L., showing no hint for primordial oscillations, where $A_\mathrm{log,lin}$ are the amplitudes of logarithmic and linear oscillation in the PPS, respectively. Our work presents state-of-the-art CMB constraints on primordial oscillations, highlighting the power of the ground-based CMB experiments in constraining physics beyond the simplest slow-roll models.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Evolving Dark Energy from LRG1 and Low-$z$ SNe Ia Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present observational evidences indicating that dark energy may be evolving with time, thereby challenging the core assumptions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our investigation extends beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by exploring a range of dynamical dark energy models. The analysis reveals that the matter density parameter, $\Omega_m$, changes with redshift, and this change is significantly influenced by the LRG1 datapoint from the DESI DR2 survey. We find that including LRG1 strongly affects the predictions of these models, especially for $\Omega_m$ and $\omega_0$, with the latter shifting from $-1$ to slightly higher values. This suggests that the evidence of evolving dark energy in the DESI DR2 data is driven by the LRG1 datapoint. When we exclude low-redshift supernovae data, particularly from the DES-SN5YR compilation, the model predictions are restored to the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. This effect is particularly evident in the GEDE model, where removing low-redshift supernovae data leads to $\Delta = 0$, effectively recovering $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Our analysis confirms that the evidence for dynamical dark energy is substantial, particularly at low redshift ($z \lesssim 0.3$). The reconstruction of $\omega(z)$ and $f_{DE}(z)$, using a combination of DESI DR2 BAO measurements, CMB distance priors, and supernovae datasets, further supports the evolving nature dark energy. These results favor a dynamical dark-energy scenario characterized by $\omega_0&gt;-1$, $\omega_a&lt;0$, and $\omega_0+\omega_a&lt;-1$ (Quintom-B). Bayesian analysis of model evidence reveals that the inclusion of low-redshift supernovae data significantly strengthens the support for evolving dark energy models such as JBP and Mirage, while models revert to inconclusive or weak support when low-redshift data are excluded.</description>
