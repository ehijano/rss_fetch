      <title>Global Deep Neural Network Modeling of Compton Form Factors Constrained from Local $\chi^2$ Maps Fits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, intense experimental efforts have focused on measuring observables that contribute to a three-dimensional description of the nucleon. Generalized Parton Distributions provide complementary insights into the internal structure and dynamics of hadrons, including information about the orbital angular momentum carried by quarks. The most direct process to access these distributions is Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering, in which the cross section can be expressed in terms of Compton Form Factors. These quantities are defined as convolutions of the Generalized Parton Distributions with coefficient functions derived in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics. We extract the Compton Form Factors from Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering data collected at Jefferson Lab, including the most recent measurements in Hall A, using a novel local fitting technique based on $\chi^2$ mapping to constrain the real parts of the Compton Form Factors $\mathcal{H}, \mathcal{E}$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{H}}$. They are determined independently in each kinematic bin for the unpolarized beam-target configuration under the twist-2 approximation, following the formalism developed by Belitsky, M\"uller, and Kirchner. The extracted Compton Form Factors are then used to train and regularize a deep neural network, enabling a global determination of their behavior with minimal model dependence. This procedure is validated and systematically studied using pseudodata generated with kinematics matching those of the experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Probing Quark Electromagnetic Properties via Entangled Quark Pairs in Fragmentation Hadrons at Lepton Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic dipole interactions of light quarks induce distinct spin correlations in quark pairs produced at lepton colliders, favoring entangled spin-triplet state aligned along the $\hat{z}$ axis or spin-singlet state. These correlations lead to unique $\cos(\phi_1-\phi_2)$ azimuthal asymmetries in inclusive $\pi^+\pi^-$-dihadron pair production and in back-to-back hadron pairs ($\pi\pi,K\pi,KK$), which are absent in the SM. By analyzing Belle and BaBar data and using ratios of azimuthal asymmetries, we demonstrate that these measurements provide robust and significant constraints on light-quark dipole couplings, insensitive to nonperturbative fragmentation functions and free from contamination by other new physics effects. This approach offers a clean and novel probe of light-quark dipole interactions in collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Elliptical Polarization in Partial Wave Analysis of Two Spinless Meson Photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical ambiguities in partial-wave analysis present a significant challenge to the extraction of resonance properties in hadronic reactions. Recent work has shown that while linear photon polarization can resolve continuous ambiguities in the photoproduction of two pseudoscalar mesons, a final complex conjugate ambiguity remains. In this work, we extend the partial-wave formalism to include circular and elliptical photon polarization. We demonstrate that the additional constraints provided by circularly polarized observables, which are sensitive to the imaginary parts of bilinear amplitude products, are sufficient to remove remaining mathematical ambiguities, yielding an improved partial-wave solution. Furthermore, we show that the resulting overconstrained system allows for a novel application: using the reaction dynamics themselves as a polarimeter. Using recent high-statistics data on rho(770) photoproduction from the GlueX experiment, we illustrate the viability of this technique in determining the degrees of beam polarization from the data. These results will benefit the next generation of photoproduction experiments at facilities such as Jefferson Lab and the future Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Soret and Dufour effects in hot and dense QCD matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gradients act as invisible engines of transport, converting microscopic imbalances into macroscopic flows, and thus providing deep insights into the dynamics of physical systems. Thermal gradients do not merely drive the flow of heat, but they also set the microscopic constituents of the system into motion. In such scenarios, the constituents of the system not only transport energy but also diffuse collectively under the influence of these gradients. For the very first time, we present a first-principles investigation of the Soret and Dufour effects in hot and dense quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter. We use the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation under the relaxation time approximation. By incorporating chemical potential and temperature gradients into the kinetic theory framework, we derive explicit expressions for the Dufour coefficient, which quantifies the heat flow due to concentration gradients, and the Soret coefficient, which describes the particle diffusion induced by thermal gradients. These coupled-transport phenomena are traditionally studied in multi-component classical systems at low energy scales. In this study, we follow quasiparticle models for the deconfined phase and the hadron resonance gas model for the confined hadronic phase in the context of heavy-ion collisions. This study provides novel insights into the thermo-diffusion and diffusion-thermo phenomena and opens avenues for incorporating such effects in hydrodynamic modeling and transport simulations of QCD matter.</description>

      <title>Measurement of $\Lambda$ Polarization in the $\pi^{-}p \to K^{0} \Lambda$ Reaction at $p_{\pi^{-}}=1.33$ GeV/$c$ toward a New $\Lambda p$ Scattering Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents high-precision experimental data of the polarization of the $\Lambda$ hyperon in the $\pi^{-}p \to K^{0} \Lambda$ reaction, measured in the angular range $0.6&lt;\cos \theta ^{CM}_{K0}&lt;1.0$ with a fine bin width of $d\cos \theta ^{CM}_{K0}=0.05$. The data were obtained from the J-PARC E40 experiment at the K1.8 beamline in the J-PARC Hadron Experimental Facility. The observed average polarization of $\Lambda$ in the range $0.60&lt;\cos \theta ^{CM}_{K0}&lt;0.85$ was $0.932 \pm 0.058 \,(\text{stat}) \pm 0.028 \,(\text{syst})$, demonstrating the successful extraction of precise polarization observables. This result provides essential experimental input for partial wave analysis (PWA) of dynamical coupled-channel (DCC) models, which aim to uncover the underlying mechanisms of $N^{*}$ resonances that emerge in intermediate states of $\pi N$ and $\gamma N$ interactions. Besides, it indicates the feasibility of a strongly polarized $\Lambda$ beam suitable for future $\Lambda p$ scattering experiments (e.g., J-PARC E86).</description>

      <title>Gain characterization of LGAD sensors with beta particles and 28-MeV protons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low Gain Avalanche Diodes, also known as LGADs, are widely considered for fast-timing applications in high energy physics, nuclear physics, space science, medical imaging, and precision measurements of rare processes. Such devices are silicon-based and feature an intrinsic gain due to a $p{^+}$-doped layer that allows the production of a controlled avalanche of carriers, with multiplication on the order of 10-100. This technology can provide time resolution on the order of 20-30 ps, and variants of this technology can provide precision tracking too. The characterization of LGAD performance has so far primarily been focused on the interaction of minimum ionizing particles for high energy and nuclear physics applications. This article expands the study of LGAD performance to highly-ionizing particles, such as 28-MeV protons, which are relevant for several future scientific applications, e.g. in biology and medical physics, among others. These studies were performed with a beam of 28-MeV protons from a tandem Van de Graaff accelerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory and beta particles from a $^{90}{\rm Sr}$ source; these were used to characterize the response and the gain of an LGAD as a function of bias voltage and collected charge. The experimental results are also compared to TCAD simulations.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $\eta'(958)$ nuclear states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observing $\eta'$-nuclear quasibound states requires that the $\eta'$-nuclear potential is both sufficiently attractive and weakly absorptive, as confirmed by the CBELSA/TAPS collaboration analysis of inclusive $\eta'$ production experiments on nuclear targets, including liquid hydrogen (LH$_2$). Here we present an alternative derivation of the $\eta'$-nuclear potential, constrained by near-threshold $pp\to pp\eta'$ and $\gamma p\to\eta' p$ production experiments on a free proton. The resulting $\eta'$-nuclear potential is weakly attractive and strongly absorptive, to the extent that observation of clear signals of $\eta'$-nuclear quasibound states is unlikely. Possible exceptions resulting from the dynamics of the nearby $I=\frac{1}{2}$ $J=({\frac{1}{2}})^-$ nucleon resonance $N^{\ast}$(1895) are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Accessing nucleon transversity with one-point energy correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel probe of the nucleon's transversity distribution, $h_1^q$, using the one-point energy correlator (OPEC), an infrared-and-collinear safe jet substructure observable. We demonstrate that in transversely polarized $p^{\uparrow}p$ collisions, the OPEC exhibits a single-spin asymmetry (SSA) with a clean $\sin(\phi_s - \phi_n)$ angular dependence. This method probes SSA over a much wider kinematic range in the angular scale $\theta_n$ compared to traditional measurements of hadron transverse momentum~$j_\perp$, establishing a complementary and systematically distinct channel to study the nucleon's three-dimensional structure at RHIC and the future Electron-Ion Collider.</description>
