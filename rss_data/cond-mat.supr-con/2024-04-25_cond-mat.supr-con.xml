      <title>Amplitude, phase, and topological fluctuations shaping the complex phase diagram of two-dimensional superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the amplitude and phase fluctuations of the Ginzburg-Landau order parameter for superconductors in two spatial dimensions. Starting from the mean-field critical temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}0}$, we calculate the beyond-mean-field critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$ by including thermal fluctuations of the order parameter within the Gaussian level. Moreover, from our beyond-mean field results, we derive the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless critical temperature $T_{\rm BKT}$, which takes into account topological vortex-antivortex excitations in the phase fluctuations as well as the amplitude fluctuations, to obtain the shifts of transition temperatures. We elucidate how the Gaussian thermal fluctuations and phase fluctuations associated with vortex excitations affect thermodynamic properties by determining the $H$-$T$ phase diagram for a type-II superconductor and computing the critical behaviors of the heat capacity, which are experimentally accessible, allowing the characterization of the cascade of different kinds of fluctuations in 2D superconductors.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of planar halfmetallic ferromagnetic Josephson junctions with long range coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting junctions with a ferromagnet as the weak link, where triplet correlations can transport supercurrents over a substantial distance, have been of long-standing interest. In this work, we study the triplet transport in planar La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) nanowire Josephson junctions with NbTi superconducting contacts. By meticulous ion etching with an artificial Pt hard mask, the NbTi/LSMO bilayer is structured to form an LSMO bridge without damaging its top layer. We observe superconducting (critical) currents of the order of 10$^{9}$ A/m$^2$ in a junction with a length of 1.3 $\mu$m, and distinguishing superconducting quantum interference (SQI) patterns when sweeping a magnetic field perpendicular ($B_\perp$) to the plane of the wire or parallel ($B_\parallel$) to the plane and along the wire. The observed Gaussian-shaped SQI pattern is attributed to the diffusive transport of triplet pairs in the LSMO. Our work demonstrates that combinations of oxide magnets with conventional ($s$-wave) alloy superconductors can be a promising new route to realizing superconducting spintronics.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Debye Energy in Superconductors via two Electron Photoemission Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate theoretically that double angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (2eARPES) can directly probe the existence of Cooper pairs away from the Fermi surface, and can thus provide insight into the characteristic energy scale around the Fermi surface, the Debye energy, in which electrons are bound into Cooper pairs. To this end, we compute the photoelectron counting rate $P^{(2)}$ in two different types of unconventional superconductors, a $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductor, and a topological superconductor with a broken time-reversal symmetry. We show that $P^{(2)}$ provides insight into the relative strength of intra- and inter-band pairing in multi-band systems, as well as into the spin polarization of the bands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In superconductors that lack inversion symmetry, a supercurrent flow can lead to nondissipative magnetoelectric effects. We offer a straightforward formalism to obtain a supercurrent-induced magnetization in superconductors with broken inversion symmetry, which may have orbital, layer, sublattice, or valley degrees of freedom\textemdash multiband noncentrosymmetric superconductors. The nondissipative magnetoelectric effect may find applications in fabricating quantum computation platforms or efficient superconducting spintronic devices. We explore how the current-induced magnetization can be employed to create and manipulate Majorana zero modes in a simple hybrid structure.</description>

      <title>Molecular beam epitaxy of superconducting FeSe$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$ thin films interfaced with magnetic topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Engineering heterostructures with various types of quantum materials can provide an intriguing playground for studying exotic physics induced by the proximity effect. Here, we report the successful synthesis of iron-based superconductor FeSe$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$ (FST) thin films across the entire composition range of $0 \leq x \leq 1$ and its heterostructure with a magnetic topological insulator by using molecular beam epitaxy. Superconductivity is observed in the FST films with an optimal superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ $\sim$ 12 K at around x = 0.1. We found that superconductivity survives in the very Te-rich films ($x \leq 0.05$), showing stark contrast to bulk crystals with suppression of superconductivity due to an appearance of bicollinear antiferromagnetism accompanied by a monoclinic structural transition. By examining thickness $t$ dependence of magnetic susceptibility and electrical transport properties, we observed a trend where anomalies associated with the first order structural transition broaden in films with below $t \sim$ 100 nm. We infer this observation suggests a suppression of the structural instability near substrates. Furthermore, we fabricated an all chalcogenide-based heterointerface between FST and a magnetic topological insulator (Cr,Bi,Sb)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ for the first time, observing both superconductivity and a large anomalous Hall conductivity. The anomalous Hall conductivity increases with decreasing temperature, approaching the quantized value of $e^2/h$ down to the measurable minimum temperature at $T_c$. The result suggests coexistence of magnetic and superconducting gaps at low temperatures opening at the top and bottom surfaces, respectively. Our novel magnetic topological insulator/superconductor heterostructure could be an ideal platform to explore chiral Majorana edge mode.</description>

      <title>Low frequency electrodynamics in the mixed state of superconducting NbN and a-MoGe films using two-coil mutual inductance technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the low-frequency electrodynamics in the vortex state of two type-II superconducting films, namely, a moderate-to-strongly pinned Niobium Nitride (NbN) and a very weakly pinned amorphous Molybdenum Germanium (a-MoGe). We employ a two-coil mutual inductance technique to extract the complex penetration depth, $\tilde{\lambda}$. The sample response is studied through the temperature variation of $\tilde{\lambda}$ in the mixed state, where we employ a model developed by Coffey and Clem (CC model) to extract the different vortex lattice (VL) parameters such as the restoring pinning force constant (Labusch parameter), VL drag coefficient and pinning potential barrier. We observe that a consistent description of the inductive and dissipative part of the response is only possible when we take the viscous drag on the vortices to be several orders of magnitudes larger than viscous drag estimated from the Bardeen-Stephen model.</description>

      <title>Evidence of filamentary superconductivity in pressurized La3Ni2O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the signatures of superconductivity near 80 K have been discovered in the single crystal of La3Ni2O7 under pressure, which makes it a new candidate of the high-temperature superconductors dominated by 3d transition elements after the cuprate and iron-pnictide superconductors, and thus has attracted significant attention. However, the superconductivity, characterized by the zero resistance and the Meissner effect, is anomalously irreproducible in the compressed La3Ni2O7. In this study, we report the experimental results obtained through highly sensitive modulated ac susceptibility measurements, which reveal that the maximum superconducting volume fraction in the La3Ni2O7 sample is only approximately 1% (employing superconducting element vanadium as a reference). In tandem with our observation of the zero-resistance state only in some of the samples, we suggest that the superconductivity in this nickelate is filamentary-like. In combination of our scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) investigations, we propose that the filamentary superconductivity most likely emerges at the interface between the La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10 phases. Further, the connection of the oxygen vacancy in La3Ni2O7 with the presence of superconductivity and superconducting transition temperature (Tc) has been established, through which the upper and lower bounds of the oxygen content for the presence of superconductivity were determined to be 6.89 and 7.35, respectively. Our results not only provide new insights into understanding the puzzling issues in this material, but also highlight a new route for exploring new high-Tc nickelate superconductors with a higher superconducting volume fraction, as well as pose a new challenge in comprehending the complex nature of this filamentary superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Theory of Majorana zero modes in unconventional superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00643v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Majorana fermions are spin-1/2 neutral particles that are their own antiparticles and were initially predicted by Ettore Majorana in particle physics but their observation still remains elusive. The concept of Majorana fermions has been borrowed into condensed matter physics, where, unlike particle physics, Majorana fermions emerge as zero-energy quasiparticles that can be engineered by combining electrons and holes and have therefore been coined Majorana zero modes. In this review, we provide a pedagogical explanation of the basic properties of Majorana zero modes in unconventional superconductors and their consequences in experimental observables, putting a special emphasis on the initial theoretical discoveries. In particular, we first show that Majorana zero modes are self-conjugated and emerge as a special type of zero energy surface Andreev bound states at the boundary of unconventional superconductors. We then explore Majorana zero modes in one-dimensional spin-polarized $p$-wave superconductors, where we address the formation of topological superconductivity and the physical realization in superconductor-semiconductor hybrids. In this part we highlight that Majorana quasiparticles appear as zero-energy edge states, exhibiting charge neutrality, spin-polarized, and spatial nonlocality as unique properties that can be already seen from their energies and wavefunctions. Next, we discuss analytically obtained Green's functions of $p$-wave superconductors and demonstrate that the emergence of Majorana zero modes is always accompanied by the formation of odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing as a unique result of the self-conjugate nature of Majorana zero modes. We finally address the signatures of Majorana zero modes in tunneling spectroscopy, including the anomalous proximity effect, and the phase-biased Josephson effect.</description>

      <title>Many-body effects on superconductivity mediated by double-magnon processes in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets exhibit a large electron spin splitting which can be understood as a result of strong coupling between itinerant electrons and localized spins. We consider superconductivity due to electron-magnon scattering, using strong-coupling Eliashberg theory to capture many-body effects that are not covered by a weak-coupling approach. The characteristic band structure of altermagnets puts significant constraints on the spin structure of electron scattering on the Fermi surface. We emphasize the role of spin-preserving, double-magnon scattering processes compared to conventional spin-flip processes involving a single magnon. Then, we derive the Eliashberg equations for a situation where double-magnon scattering mediates spin-polarized Cooper pairs, while both double-magnon and single-magnon scatterings contribute to many-body effects. These many-body effects impact superconducting properties in a way that differs significantly from systems where conventional spin-flip processes mediate superconductivity. To highlight the role of $d$-wave magnetism on superconductivity in altermagnets, we compare our results to those found in ferromagnetic half-metals and conventional antiferromagnetic metals.</description>

      <title>Pressure-driven right-triangle shape superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we report a comprehensive study of the crystal structure, resistivity, and alternating-current magnetic susceptibility in single crystals of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, with a hydrostatic pressure up to 104 GPa. X-ray diffraction measurements reveal a bilayer orthorhombic structure (space group $Amam$) at ambient pressure and a transformation into a tetragonal phase (space group $I4/mmm$) at ad critical pressure of $\sim$14 GPa. The transport measurements reveal a right-triangle shape superconducting region with a maximum $T_c$ of 83 K at 18.0 GPa. The superconductivity is gradually suppressed when applying a higher pressure, but it can persist up to 90 GPa. Importantly, we measured the Meissner effect of superconductivity using an alternating-current magnetic susceptibility technique under pressure and estimated the maximum superconducting volume fraction of being 48$\%$ at 19.4 GPa. Thus, we demonstrate the bulk nature of superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure. The intimate connection among the superconductivity, the oxygen content, and the tetragonal structure are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We extend the scattering theory of the Josephson effect to include a coupling of the Josephson junction to a gapless electron reservoir in the normal state. By opening up the system with a quasiparticle escape rate $1/\tau$, the supercurrent carried at zero temperature by an Andreev level at energy $\varepsilon_{\rm A}$ is reduced by a factor $(2/\pi)\arctan(2\varepsilon_{\rm A}\tau/\hbar)$ . We make contact with recent work on "non-Hermitian Josephson junctions", by comparing this result to different proposed generalizations of the Josephson effect to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Crossed Andreev Reflection in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) is a scattering phenomenon occurring in a superconductor (SC) connected to two metallic leads, where an incident electron on one side of the SC emerges on the opposite side as a hole. Despite its significance, CAR detection is often impeded by the prevalent electron tunneling (ET), wherein the incident electron exits on the opposing side as an electron. One approach to augment CAR over ET involves employing two antiparallel ferromagnets across the SC. However, this method is constrained by the low polarization in ferromagnets and necessitates the application of a magnetic field. Altermagnets (AMs) present a promising avenue for detecting and enhancing CAR due to their distinct Fermi surfaces for the two spins. Here, we propose a configuration utilizing two AMs rotated by $90^{\circ}$ with respect to each other on either side of an SC to enhance CAR. We calculate local and nonlocal conductivities across the AM-SC-AM junction using the Landauer-B\"uttiker scattering approach. Our findings reveal that in the strong phase of AMs, CAR overwhelmingly dominates nonlocal transport. In the weak phase, CAR can exhibit significant enhancement for larger values of the altermagnetic parameter compared to the scenario where AMs are in the normal metallic phase. As a function of the length of the SC, the conductivities exhibit oscillations reminiscent of Fabry-P\'erot interference.</description>

      <title>Time reversal invariant topological 1D and 2D superconductors: doubling the Sau-Luchtin-Tewari-Sarma and Oreg-Refael-von Oppen proposals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01696v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we present a doubled version of the Sau-Luchtin-Tewari-Sarma and Oreg-Refael-von Open proposals thereby obtaining time reversal invariant p-wave superconductivity in both 1D and 2D. This construction is much like the Kane-Mele spin Hall model which is a time reversal invariant doubling of the Haldane model. We show that the low energy effective action for these doubled versions of the Sau-Luchtin-Tewari-Sarma and Oreg-Refael-von Open models corresponds to a single band p-wave time reversal invariant superconductors with pseudo spin degree of freedom instead of spin degree of freedom. There are Majorana fermions at the ends of wires or in vortex cores of these superconductors. Furthermore these are shown to be stable to small perturbations. In the supplement we present physical realization of the system with cold atoms and show a related "no-go" theorem given in Haim et. al. (2019) has too restrictive assumptions to apply to this proposal.</description>
