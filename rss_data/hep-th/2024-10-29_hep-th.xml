      <title>Massless fermions in uniform flux background on $T^2\times R$: Vacuum quantum numbers from single-particle filled modes using lattice regulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum numbers of monopoles in $R^3$ in the presence of massless fermions have been analyzed using a uniform flux background in $S^2\times R$ coupled to fermions. An analogous study in $T^2\times R$ is performed by studying the discrete symmetries of the Dirac Hamiltonian in the presence of a static uniform field on $T^2$ with a total flux of $Q$ in the continuum. The degenerate ground states are classified based on their transformation properties under $\frac{\pi}{2}$ rotations of $T^2$ that leave the background field invariant. We find that the lattice analysis with overlap fermions exactly reproduces the transformation properties of the single particle zero modes in the continuum. Whereas the transformation properties of the single particle negative energy states can be studied in the continuum and the lattice, we are also able to study the transformation properties and the particle number (charge) of the many-body ground state on a finite lattice, and we show that the contributions from the fully filled single-particle states cannot be ignored.</description>

      <title>BRST Formalism of $f(R)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the manifestly covariant quantization of $f(R)$ gravity in the de Donder gauge condition (or harmonic gauge condition) for general coordinate invariance. We explicitly calculate various equal-time commutation relations (ETCRs), in particlular, the ETCR between the metric and its time derivative, and show that it has a nonvanishing and nontrivial expression, whose situation should be contrasted to the previous result in the higher-derivative or quadratic gravity where the ETCR was found to be identically vanishing. We also clarify global symmetries, the physical content of $f(R)$ gravity, and clearly show that this theory is manifestly unitary and has a massive scalar and massless graviton as physical modes.</description>

      <title>A Comment on Boundary Correlators: Soft Omissions and the Massless S-Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the extrapolate dictionary for massless scattering in flat spacetime and identify a soft contribution that is typically dropped from the saddle point approximation. We show how to consistently regulate the extrapolation to include both the soft and hard components and identify the boundary correlation functions as a combination of electric and magnetic branch Carrollian correlators. This implies in particular that there are contributions to these boundary correlators that are non-distributional on the celestial sphere. Finally, we close by exploring the utility of the magnetic branch for extracting celestial data from low point correlators: connecting our results to recent work on flat space extrapolate dictionaries and celestial shadow amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Majorana fermions solve the tetrahedron equations as well as higher simplex equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Yang-Baxter equations define quantum integrable models. The tetrahedron and higher simplex equations are multi-dimensional generalizations. Finding the solutions of these equations is a formidable task. In this work we develop a systematic method - constructing higher simplex operators [solutions of corresponding simplex equations] from lower simplex ones. We call it lifting. By starting from a solution of Yang-Baxter equations we can construct [lift] a solution of the tetrahedron equation and simplex equation in any dimension. We then generalize this by starting from a solution of any lower simplex equation and lifting it [construct solution] to another simplex equation in higher dimension. This process introduces several constraints among the different lower simplex operators that are lifted to form the higher simplex operators. We show that braided Yang-Baxter operators [solutions of Yang-Baxter equations independent of spectral parameters] constructed using Majorana fermions satisfy these constraints, thus solving the higher simplex equations. As a consequence these solutions help us understand the action of an higher simplex operator on Majorana fermions. Furthermore we show that operators constructed using Dirac (complex) fermions satisfy these constraints as well.</description>

      <title>Carrollian propagator and amplitude in Rindler spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the three-dimensional Carrollian field theory on the Rindler horizon which is dual to a bulk massless scalar field theory in the four-dimensional Rindler wedge. The Carrollian field theory could be mapped to a two-dimensional Euclidean field theory in the transverse plane by a Fourier transform. After defining the incoming and outgoing states at the future and past Rindler horizon, respectively, we construct the boundary-to-boundary and bulk-to-boundary propagators that are consistent with the bulk Green's function in the literature. We investigate the tree-level Carrollian amplitudes up to four points. The tree-level four-point Carrollian amplitude in $\Phi^4$ theory has the same structure as the one-loop triangle Feynman integral in the Lee-Pomeransky representation with complex powers in the propagators and spacetime dimension. Moreover, the four-point Carrollian amplitude with a zero energy state inserted at infinity in $\Phi^4$ theory is proportional to the three-point Carrollian amplitude in $\Phi^3$ theory.</description>

      <title>Geodesics in Carrollian Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20420v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the geodesics in different types of Carrollian RN (Reissner-Nordstr\"om) black holes, considering the motions of both neutral and charged particles. We use the geodesic equations in the weak Carrollian structure and analyze the corresponding trajectories projected onto the absolute space, and find that the geodesics are well-defined. In particular, we examine the electric-electric and magnetic-electric limit of the RN black hole, focusing on their geodesic structures. We find that the global structures of the usual RN black holes get squeezed under the ultra-relativistic limit. More precisely, the nonextreme magnetic-electric RN spacetime has two different asymptotic flat patches while the extreme black hole spacetime consists of only one patch. For the magnetic-electric RN spacetime, the Carrollian extremal surfaces (CESs) divide the spacetime into several geodesically complete regions, and the geodesics can only travel in one of these regions. For the charged particles, we extend the analysis by considering their interactions with the electromagnetic field in the Carrollian RN spacetimes and find that their trajectories are significantly different from the neutral geodesics.</description>

      <title>$\zeta$-function for a model with spectral dependent boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the meromorphic structure of the $\zeta$-function associated to the boundary eigenvalue problem of a modified Sturm-Liouville operator subject to spectral dependent boundary conditions at one end of a segment of length $l$. We find that it presents isolated simple poles which follow the general rule valid for second order differential operators subject to standard local boundary conditions. We employ our results to evaluate the determinant of the operator and the Casimir energy of the system it describes, and study its dependence on $l$ for both the massive and the massless cases.</description>

      <title>Discrete Spectrum of Interior Length and Timeshift in Two-sided Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectrum of the interior length and the horizon timeshift of a two-sided black hole in Jackiew-Teitelboim gravity. We construct projection operators onto the subspace of fixed length or fixed horizon timeshift states via the replica trick. We find that the density of state for the length and the timeshift is finite. This implies that the spectrum of these quantities is discrete microscopically. Utilizing the projection operator, we construct the microscopic length operator and the timeshift operator. Using these non-perturbative geometric operators, we study the time evolution of the thermofield double state. We find that at early time, the probability distribution of the interior length and the timeshift are sharply peaked at the classical values, while after the Heisenberg time, the distribution is completely uniform over all possible values of the length and the timeshift, indicating maximal uncertainty of the length and the timeshift. In particular, the probability of obtaining the negative timeshift states, which have contracting interior geometry and thus correspond to a white hole, is $O(1)$ after the Heisenberg time.</description>

      <title>Non-metricity approach to Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct 2d Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity in the framework of symmetric teleparallel gravity based on a non-metricity tensor. In symmetric teleparallel gravity, we often use the scalar quantity $Q$ composed of the bilinear terms of the non-metricity tensor but $Q$ is not a unique scalar quantity from the viewpoint of covariance. However, other scalar quantities composed of the non-metricity tensor generate ghosts in general. In two dimensions, because a propagating gravitational mode does not exist, if we consider general scalar quantities, there might appear any propagating modes although these modes are often ghosts. We consider a general combination of the terms given by the bi-linear of the non-metricity tensors. After finding the condition that the conformal form of the metric is compatible with the coincident gauge, where connections vanish, we determine the combination so that a solution with constant curvature exists. The obtained model corresponds to 2d JT gravity in the framework of the symmetric teleparallel gravity. The conformal mode propagates as a scalar in this theory and we also consider the condition that the scalar mode is not a ghost.</description>

      <title>A Note on $T\bar{T}$ Deformations and Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The irrelevant composite operator $T\bar{T}$, constructed from components of the stress-energy tensor, exhibits unique properties in two-dimensional quantum field theories and represents a distinctive form of integrable deformation. Significant progress has been made in understanding the bulk aspects of the theory, including its interpretation in terms of coordinate transformations and its connection to topological gravity models. However, the behavior of $T\bar{T}$-deformed theories in the presence of boundaries and defects remains largely unexplored. In this note, we review analytical results obtained through various techniques. Specifically, we study the $T\bar{T}$-deformed exact g-function within the framework of the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz and show that the results coincide with those obtained by solving the corresponding Burgers-type flow equation. Finally, we highlight some potentially significant open problems.</description>

      <title>Towards a uniqueness theorem for static black holes in Kaluza-Klein theory with small circle size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kaluza-Klein theory, by which we mean vacuum gravity in 5-dimensions, with asymptotics that are a product of a circle with Minkowski spacetime, has a variety of different static black hole solutions; localized black holes and the homogeneous and inhomogeneous black strings. There is currently no uniqueness theorem for the solutions, and for fixed circle size multiple solutions with the same mass co-exist. Intuitively for small circle sizes we might expect the theory truncates to become 4-dimensional, and correspondingly the only black holes are the homogeneous black strings. Thus we conjecture that for fixed mass and sufficiently small circle size, the only black holes are homogeneous ones. Here we give evidence that this is indeed the case. Firstly we introduce a toy scalar field model with a potential that allows tachyonic behaviour. Putting this theory on a product of Minkowski with a circle gives an analogous set of static homogeneous and inhomogeneous solutions to that of the black holes. We prove that solutions must be homogeneous for small circle sizes, the analog of our conjecture for this toy model. A weaker statement that is straightforward to derive is a bound on how inhomogeneous a solution can be - putting this scalar theory in a large but finite cavity, a norm of the wavefunction of the Kaluza-Klein modes can be shown to vanish in the small circle limit. Turning to the full gravitational theory, we employ a metric ansatz that imposes static axisymmetry, encompasses the homogeneous and inhomogeneous black strings (but not the localized solutions) and allows us to measure inhomogeneity of a solution. Employing a finite cavity and imposing boundary conditions that are compatible with homogeneity we show a similar result; the norm of certain Kaluza-Klein modes is bounded by the circle size, providing evidence that our conjecture is true.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we provide a short review (written in Chinese) on the Bethe/Gauge correspondence. We first explain the basic idea in an explicit example of the correspondence between XXX spin chains and 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ gauge theories. The connection between 4d and 2d will then be explored by comparing the instanton and vortex partition functions. We conclude this article by briefly mentioning the similarity in the integrability structure of 4d gauge theories and 2d ones from an algebraic aspect, and a potential relation between two different integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Consistency of EFT illuminated via relative entropy: A case study in scalar field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relative entropy is a non-negative quantity and offers a powerful means of achieving a unified understanding of fundamental properties in physics, including the second law of thermodynamics and positivity bounds on effective field theories (EFTs). We analyze the relative entropy in scalar field theories and show that the non-negativity of relative entropy is potentially violated in perturbative calculations based on operator and loop expansions. Conversely, this suggests that the consistency of the EFT description in the scalar field theory can be identified by the sign of the relative entropy. In fact, we revisit an EFT of single-field inflation and present a relation between its non-linear parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ and the consistency condition of the EFT description derived from the relative entropy method. We find that interesting regions of $f_{\rm NL}$ that are observationally allowed can be constrained from the relative entropy by imposing the consistency of the EFT description.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We work out the unfolded formulation of the fields in the non-linear realisation of $E_{11}$. Using the connections in this formalism, we propose, at the linearised level, an infinite number of first-order duality relations between the dual fields in $E_{11}$. In this way, we introduce extra fields that do not belong to $E_{11}$ and we investigate their origin. The equations of motion of the fields are obtained by taking derivatives and higher traces of the duality relations.</description>

      <title>Super long-range kinks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the presence of scalar field models supporting kink solutions with logarithmic tails, which we call super long-range structures. We first consider models with a single real scalar field and associate the long-range profile to the orders of vanishing derivatives of the potential at its minima. We then present a model whose derivatives are null in all orders and obtain analytical solutions with logarithmic falloff. We also show that these solutions are stable under small fluctuations. Remarkably, by investigating the forces between super long-range structures, we show that the kink-antikink force is stronger than the kink-kink one. Next, we study two-field models in which the additional field is used to modify the kinetic term of the other. By using a first-order formalism based on the minimization of the energy, we explore the situation in which one of the fields can be obtained independently from the other. Within this framework, we unveil how to smoothly go from long- or short- to super long-range structures.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamics and interactions of the solitonic domain walls that occur in realistic axion electrodynamics models including the Chern-Simons interaction, $a\epsilon_{\mu\nu\lambda\sigma}F^{\mu\nu} F^{\lambda\sigma}$, between an axion $a(x)$ of mass $m_a$, and a massless U(1) gauge field, e.g. EM, interacting with strength $\alpha=e^2/4\pi$ with charged matter, e.g. electron-positron pairs. In particular, in the presence of a U(1) gauge-and-matter relativistic thermal plasma we study the friction experienced by the walls due to the Chern-Simons term. Utilizing the linear response method we include the collective effects of the plasma, as opposed to purely particle scattering across the wall (as is done in previous treatments) which is valid only in the thin wall regime that is rarely applicable in realistic cases. We show that the friction depends on the Lorentz-$\gamma$-factor-dependent inverse thickness of the wall in the plasma frame, $\ell^{-1} \sim \gamma m_a$, compared to the three different plasma scales, the temperature $T$, the Debye mass $m_D\sim\sqrt{\alpha} T$, and the damping rate $\Gamma \sim \alpha^2 T$, and elucidate the underlying physical intuition for this behavior. (For friction in the thin-wall-limit we correct previous expressions in the literature.) We further consider the effects of long-range coherent magnetic fields that are possibly present in the early universe and compare their effect with that of thermal magnetic fields. Finally, we briefly discuss the possible early universe consequences of our results for domain wall motion and network decay, stochastic gravitational wave production from domain wall networks, and possible primordial black hole production from domain wall collapse, though a more complete discussion of these topics is reserved for a companion paper.</description>

      <title>$\pi$-$\pi$ scattering lengths: electric corrections in the linear sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the frame of the linear sigma model and working in the weak field approximation, we discuss the role played by an external electric field on the behavior of $\pi$-$\pi$ scattering lengths. For this purpose, we have considered all relevant one-loop diagrams in the $s$, $t$, and $u$ channels where we have Schwinger propagators for charged pions. An important novelty of our analysis, compared with previous existing discussions in the literature, is the explicit calculation of box diagrams which were previously not considered in discussions regarding magnetic corrections to $\pi$-$\pi$ scattering lengths. Our analysis shows that electric field corrections have an opposite effect with respect to the previously calculated magnetic corrections.</description>

      <title>Lattice models from CFT on surfaces with holes II: Cloaking boundary conditions and loop models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we continue to investigate the lattice models obtained from 2d CFTs via the construction introduced in [arXiv:2112.01563]. On the side of the 2d CFT we consider the cloaking boundary condition relative to a fixed fusion category F of topological line defects. The resulting lattice model realises the topological symmetry F exactly. We compute the state spaces and Boltzmann weights of these lattice model in the example of unitary Virasoro minimal models. We work directly with amplitudes, rather than with normalised correlators, and we provide a careful treatment of the Weyl anomaly factor in terms of the Liouville action.
  We numerically evaluate the Ising CFT on the torus with one hole and cloaking boundary condition in two channels, and illustrate in this example that the anomaly factors are essential to obtain matching results for the amplitudes. We show that lattice models obtained from Virasoro minimal models at lowest non-trivial cutoff can be exactly mapped to loop models. This provides a first non-trivial check that our lattice models can contain the 2d CFT they were constructed from in their phase diagram, and we propose a condition on the cloaking boundary condition for F under which we expect this to happen in general.</description>

Abstract: These lecture notes are devoted to the recent progress in the geometric aspects of quantum integrable systems based on quantum groups solved using the Bethe ansatz technique. One part is devoted to their enumerative geometry realization through the quantum K-theory of Nakajima quiver varieties. The other part describes a recently studied $q$-deformation of the correspondence between oper connections and Gaudin models. The notes are based on a minicourse at C.I.M.E. Summer School ``Enumerative geometry, quantisation and moduli spaces," September 04-08, 2023.</description>

      <title>The maximum radiated energy and final spin of high speed collision of two black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We performed a series of 739 full numerical simulations of high energy collision of black holes to search for the maximum gravitational energy emitted $E_{rad}$, during their merger. We consider equal mass binaries with spins pointing along their orbital angular momentum $\vec{L}$ and perform a search over impact parameters $b$ and initial linear momenta $p/m=\gamma v$ to find the maximum $E_{rad}$ for a given spin $\vec{S}$. The total radiated energy proves to have a weak dependence on the intrinsic spin $s$ of the holes, for the sequence $s=+0.8, 0.0, -0.8$ studied here. We thus estimate the maximum $E_{rad}^{max}/M_{ADM}\approx25\%\pm2\%$ for these direct merger encounters. We also explore the radiated angular momentum and the maximum spin of the merger remnant (within these configurations), finding $\alpha_f^{max}=0.987$. We then use the zero frequency limit expansion to analytically model the radiated energy in the small impact parameter and large initial linear momentum regime.</description>

      <title>Composite running vacuum in the Universe: implications on the cosmological tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possibility that the vacuum energy density (VED) could be time dependent in the expanding Universe is intuitively more reasonable than just a rigid cosmological constant for the entire cosmic history. The framework of the running vacuum model (RVM) is a salient example derived from QFT in curved spacetime, wherein the VED appears as a power series of the Hubble rate, $H(t)$, and its derivatives. The RVM contributes to alleviate the cosmological tensions and at a more fundamental level it also helps to smooth out certain hardcore aspects of the cosmological constant problem. Composite dark energy (DE) extensions of the RVM are possible, in which the DE is a mixed fluid made out of running vacuum and an entity X called ``phantom matter'' which, I should stress, is radically different from phantom DE, since the former produces positive pressure like ordinary matter (therein its name). The prototype is the old $\Lambda$XCDM model from 2006. Recently a simplified version of the latter, called the $w$XCDM, has proven capable to yield a truly outstanding fit to the cosmological data with dramatic implications for mitigating the cosmological tensions. The analysis is sensitive to the kind of BAO data used, transversal (2D) or anisotropic (3D). For both BAO types the overall fit quality is substantially better than for the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, and the growth tension becomes alleviated. Nevertheless, only for 2D BAO the $H_0$-tension can be completely cut down. Most notably, this scenario favours (at $3.3\sigma$ c.l.) quintessence-like behavior around our time, as recently reported by the DESI Collaboration. In what follows I will summarize in very simple phenomenological terms the essentials of the RVM idea and its composite extensions, as well as the remarkable practical implications ensuing from such scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review explores the current understanding of collective excitations and the dynamics of heavy quark propagation in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We focus on three core aspects: the theoretical modelling of the QGP, including momentum anisotropy, medium-induced collisions, finite chemical potential, and non-ideal interactions; the collective behaviours within the plasma; and the interaction dynamics of heavy quarks as they traverse the medium. Along with the polarization energy loss mechanisms, we also review the possibility of energy gain due to thermal field fluctuations. Lastly, we discuss how these theoretical insights can be tested through experiments and outline possible directions for future research.</description>

We also develop the open-closed brace relations, provide a concise description of OCHAs, and establish an A-infinity structure that extends the open-closed Hochschild differential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the effective action for a massive scalar field in (A)dS spacetime using the Euclidean heat kernel method. We highlight that in even-dimensional dS spacetimes, the effective action exhibits a non-trivial imaginary part, reminiscent of the Schwinger effect in quantum electrodynamics. We find consistency between the results obtained from the Euclidean heat kernel method with those from the Green's function approach in Lorentzian signature. Additionally, we compare our results with the perturbative calculations and find that the perturbation theory almost fails to capture the correct non-perturbative imaginary part of the effective action. This discrepancy presents a challenge to computing the gravitational pair production using the perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Kinetic dynamics of neutral spin particles in a spacetime with torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A kinetic model for the dynamics of collisionless spin neutral particles in a spacetime with torsion is proposed. The fundamental matter field is the kinetic density $f(x,u,s)$ of particles with four-velocity $u$ and four-spin $s$. The stress-energy tensor and the spin current of the particles distribution are defined as suitable integral moments of $f$ in the $(u,s)$ variables. By requiring compatibility with the contracted Bianchi identity in Einstein-Cartan theory, we derive a transport equation on the kinetic density $f$ that generalizes the well-known Vlasov equation for spinless particles. The total number of particles in the new model is not conserved. To restore this important property we assume the existence in spacetime of a second species of particles with the same mass and spin magnitude. The Vlasov equation on the kinetic density $\overline{f}$ of the new particles is derived by requiring that the sum of total numbers of particles of the two species should be conserved.</description>

      <title>Equivalence in virtual transitions between uniformly accelerated and static atoms: from a bird's eye</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the prospect of equivalence principle at the quantum regime by investigating the transition probabilities of a two-level atomic detector in different scenarios. In particular, two specific set-ups are considered. ($i$) {\it Without a boundary}: In one scenario the atom is in uniform acceleration and interacting with Minkowski field modes. While in the other the atom is static and in interaction with Rindler field modes. ($ii$) {\it With a reflecting boundary}: In one scenario the atom is uniformly accelerated and the mirror is static, and in the other scenario the atom is static and the mirror is in uniform acceleration. In these cases the atom is interacting with the field modes, defined in mirror's frame. For both the set-ups, the focus is on the excitation and de-excitation probabilities in $(1+1)$ and $(3+1)$ spacetime dimensions. Our observations affirm that in $(1+1)$ dimensions, for both set-ups the transition probabilities from different scenarios become the same when the atomic and the field frequencies are equal. In contrast, in $(3+1)$ dimensions this equivalence is not observed in general, inspiring us to look for a deeper physical interpretation. Our findings suggest that when the equivalence between different scenarios is concerned, the excitation to de-excitation ratio provides a more consistent measure even in $(3+1)$ dimensions. We discuss the physical interpretation and implications of our findings.</description>

      <title>Quantum magic dynamics in random circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magic refers to the degree of "quantumness" in a system that cannot be fully described by stabilizer states and Clifford operations alone. In quantum computing, stabilizer states and Clifford operations can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer, even though they may appear complicated from the perspective of entanglement. In this sense, magic is a crucial resource for unlocking the unique computational power of quantum computers to address problems that are classically intractable. Magic can be quantified by measures such as Wigner negativity and mana that satisfy fundamental properties such as monotonicity under Clifford operations. In this paper, we generalize the statistical mechanical mapping methods of random circuits to the calculation of Renyi Wigner negativity and mana. Based on this, we find: (1) a precise formula describing the competition between magic and entanglement in many-body states prepared under Haar random circuits; (2) a formula describing the the spreading and scrambling of magic in states evolved under random Clifford circuits; (3) a quantitative description of magic "squeezing" and "teleportation" under measurements. Finally, we comment on the relation between coherent information and magic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.04990v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct higher-spin gauge models including fermions by applying the BRST-antifield formalism. We introduce massless totally-symmetric rank-$n$ tensor-spinors, which is Dirac spinors in $D$-dimensional spacetime, as well as massless bosonic totally-symmetric tensors. By applying the BRST deformation scheme, the free higher-spin gauge theory is deformed such that the deformed action $S$ would satisfy the master equation $(S,S)=0$. We obtain vertices of two fermions and one boson, and those of a fermion and a boson in turn. They contain terms of all orders in the deformation parameter and satisfy the master equation exactly. Employing the BRST deformation scheme built on AdS spaces, we derive higher-spin gauge models including fermions on AdS spaces as well. We also consider the case that infinite series contained in our models is convergent.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fusion of B-type interfaces between N=(2,2) supersymmetric Landau-Ginzburg models. Such interfaces can be described by matrix factorizations of the difference of the superpotentials, and their fusion is modelled by the tensor product of the factorizations. The effect of fusing a fixed interface gives rise to a functor on the category of matrix factorizations. For at least some interfaces, this can be lifted to a functor on the category of modules over polynomial rings. These fusion functors provide an alternative way of modelling interfaces between Landau-Ginzburg models that characterizes interfaces by their fusion properties. Interface fields correspond to morphisms between fusion functors that can be defined via a Hochschild-type cohomology. This leads to a strict monoidal supercategory of fusion functors, where horizontal composition is given by composition of functors. The category of fusion functors can be related to the category of matrix factorizations by a functor that maps a fusion functor to the corresponding interface factorization. It is not faithful, but we prove that it is full for polynomial rings in one variable. The description of interfaces in terms of fusion functors has the advantage that fusion of interfaces becomes simple. It provides a computational tool to evaluate tensor products of matrix factorizations, and could be applied for example in Kazama-Suzuki models to analyse fusion categories of rational defects, or in the context of Khovanov-Rozansky link homology.</description>

      <title>On the Species Scale, Modular Invariance and the Gravitational EFT expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of the species scale as the quantum gravity cut-off has been recently emphasised in the context of the Swampland program. Along these lines, we continue the quest for a precise understanding of its role within effective field theories of gravity as well as a global definition of the latter in case there is enough supersymmetry preserved. To do so, we exploit duality symmetries, the familiar asymptotic dependence imposed by the presence of infinite towers of light states and the known behaviour of higher-curvature corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action in various String Theory setups. In those cases, we obtain a self-consistent result for the identification of the species scale as the quantum gravity cut-off, but also present some puzzles related to the suppression of certain higher-dimensional operators as well as minor ambiguities that may arise in the deep interior of moduli space.</description>

      <title>Towards Systematic Evaluation of de Sitter Correlators via Generalized Integration-By-Parts Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00129v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize Integration-By-Parts (IBP) and differential equations methods to de Sitter correlators related to inflation. While massive correlators in de Sitter spacetime are usually regarded as highly intricate, we find they have remarkably hidden concise structures from the perspective of IBP. We find the factorization of the IBP relations of each vertex integral family corresponding to $\mathrm{d} \tau_i$ integration. Furthermore, with a smart construction of master integrals, the universal formulas for iterative reduction and $\mathrm{d} \log$-form differential equations of arbitrary vertex integral family are presented and proved. These formulas dominate all tree-level de Sitter correlators and play a kernel role at the loop-level as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flux- and charge-quantization laws for higher gauge fields of Maxwell type -- e.g. the common electromagnetic field (the "A-field") but also the B-, RR-, and C-fields considered in string/M-theory -- specify non-perturbative completions of these fields by encoding their solitonic behaviour and hence by specifying the discrete charges carried by the individual branes (higher-dimensional monopoles or solitons) that source the field fluxes.
  This article surveys the general (rational-)homotopy theoretic understanding of flux- and charge-quantization via the Chern-Dold character map generalized to the non-linear (self-sourcing) Bianchi identities that appear in higher-dimensional supergravity theories, notably for B&amp;RR-fields in D=10, for the C-field in D=11 supergravity, and for the B-field on fivebrane worldvolumes.</description>

      <title>Propagation speeds of relativistic conformal fluids from a generalized relaxation time approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the propagation speeds for a conformal real relativistic fluid. We begin from a kinetic equation in the relaxation time approximation, where the relaxation time is an arbitrary function of the particle energy in the Landau frame. We propose a parameterization of the one particle distribution function designed to contain a second order Chapman-Enskog solution as a particular case. We derive the hydrodynamic equations applying the moments method to this parameterized one particle distribution function, and solve for the propagation speeds of linearized scalar, vector and tensor perturbations. For relaxation times of the form $\tau=\tau_0(-\beta_{\mu}p^{\mu})^{-a}$, with $-\infty&lt; a&lt;2$, where $\beta_{\mu}=u_{\mu}/T$ is the temperature vector in the Landau frame, we show that the Anderson-Witting prescription $a=1$ yields the fastest speeds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A solitonic ground state called a chiral soliton lattice (CSL) is realized in a supersymmetric theory with background magnetic field and finite chemical potential. To this end, we construct, in the superfield formalism, a supersymmetric chiral sine-Gordon model as a neutral pion sector of a supersymmetric two-flavor chiral Lagrangian with a Wess-Zumino-Witten term. The CSL ground state appears in the presence of either a strong magnetic field and/or large chemical potential, or a background fermionic condensate in the form of a fermion bilinear consisting of the gaugino and a superpartner of a baryon gauge field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physical phenomena seen by an observer are defined for a local inertial system that is subjective to the observer. Such a coordinate system is called a ``moving frame'' because it changes from time to time. However, unlike the Thomas precession, the Unruh-DeWitt detector has been discussed for a fixed frame. We discuss the Unruh-DeWitt detector by defining the vacuum for the moving frame, showing that the problem of the Stokes phenomenon can be solved by using the vierbeins and the exact WKB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct unitary irreducible representation of the de Sitter group, that forms the basis for the study of $dS_{d+1}$ QFT. Using the intertwining kernel analysis, we discuss bosonic symmetric tensor, and fermionic higher-spinors. Particular care is given to the structure and construction of exceptional series and fermionic operators. We discuss the discrete series, and explain how and why the exceptional series give rise to seemingly non-invariant correlators in de Sitter. Using tools from Clifford analysis, we show that for $d&gt;3$, there are no exceptional fermionic representations, and so no unitary (higher)-gravitino fields. We also consider the structure of representations for $d=3$ and $d=2$, as relevant for the study of $dS_4$, the only space allowing for unitary gravitino and its generalisation, and of $dS_3$.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Bell Tests with Decoherence Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inflationary universe creates particle pairs, which are entangled in their momenta due to momentum conservation. Operators involving the momenta of the fluctuations can be rewritten into pseudo-spin operators, such as the Gour-Khanna-Mann-Revzen (GKMR) pseudo-spin. Making use of these pseudo-spin operators, cosmological Bell inequalities can be formulated. The violation of these Bell inequalities indicates the quantum nature of primordial fluctuations.
  In this work, we focus on primordial curvature perturbations. Since curvature perturbations arise from gravity, their action includes the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term. We clarify the role of the boundary term in selecting suitable initial conditions for linear perturbations.
  After that, we proceed to the interactions of cosmological perturbations, including the bulk and boundary interaction terms, which introduce decoherence effects. These decoherence effects change the expectation value of the Bell operator, and gradually restore the Bell inequality. We describe this process by a ``Bell test curve'', which offers a window around 5 e-folds for testing the quantum origin of cosmological perturbations. We also explore the possibility of extracting the information of the decoherence rate and the structure of primordial interactions from the Bell test curve.</description>

Abstract: We highlight the need for global completion of the field content in the M5-brane sigma-model analogous to Dirac's charge/flux quantization, and we point out that the superspace Bianchi identities on the worldvolume and on its ambient supergravity background constrain the M5's flux-quantization law to be in a non-abelian cohomology theory rationally equivalent to a twisted form of co-Homotopy. In order to clearly bring out this subtle point we give a streamlined re-derivation of the worldvolume 3-flux via M5 "super-embeddings". Finally, assuming the flux-quantization law to actually be in co-Homotopy ("Hypothesis H") we show how this implies Skyrmion-like solitons on general M5-worldvolumes and (abelian) anyonic solitons on the boundaries of "open M5-branes" in heterotic M-theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the violation of Lorentz symmetry through the Casimir effect. The Casimir effect is one of the most intriguing aspects of modern physics, representing a macroscopic quantum-origin force between two neutral conducting surfaces, and it stands as a triumph of Quantum Field Theory. Here, we examine the Casimir effects associated with a massive fermionic quantum field confined in the region between two large and parallel plates within the Horava-Lifshitz framework of Lorentz symmetry violation. To calculate the Casimir energy and consequently the Casimir pressure, we impose a MIT bag boundary condition on two plates, compatible with the higher-order derivative term in the modified Dirac equation. Our results indicate a strong influence of Lorentz violation on the Casimir effect. We observe that the Casimir energy is affected, both in intensity and sign, potentially exhibiting repulsive or attractive force between the plates, depending on the critical exponent associated with the Horava-Lifshitz formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the complete set of planar two-loop five-point Feynman integrals with two off-shell external legs. These integrals are relevant, for instance, for the calculation of the second-order QCD corrections to the production of two heavy vector bosons in association with a jet or a photon at a hadron collider. We construct pure bases for these integrals and reconstruct their analytic differential equations in canonical form through numerical sampling over finite fields. The newly identified symbol alphabet, one of the most complex to date, provides valuable data for bootstrap methods. We then apply our results to initiate the study of double Lagrangian insertions in a four-cusp Wilson loop in planar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, computing it through two loops. We observe that it is finite, conformally invariant in four dimensions, and of uniform transcendentality. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence for its positivity within the amplituhedron region through two loops.</description>

      <title>Deformations of Extremal Black Holes and the UV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has recently been noted that deformations of extremal AdS black holes in four and higher dimensions are generically non-smooth or singular on the horizon. Further, it was found that certain deformations of asymptotically flat extremal black holes are marginal, causing the nature of the horizon to be strongly sensitive to UV corrections -- in particular, Wilson coefficients associated with consistent UV completions generically lead to worse behaviour on the horizon. In this work, we extend the discussion of deformed horizons in the presence of UV corrections to extremal charged black holes in AdS, where we find a tower of marginal perturbations for different black hole masses. We argue that the apparent UV sensitivity of marginal modes is, in fact, a feature of the UV theory which is correctly reproduced by the EFT, and illustrate this with explicit UV completions confirming the validity of the EFT. We demonstrate that the same holds for a scalar-Maxwell EFT with known UV completion. In the gravitational case, the sign of EFT corrections to marginal perturbations is generally connected with the signs implied by positivity bounds, with UV completions generically leading to worse behaviour on the horizon. We conjecture that this result is more generic, and use this to derive more general positivity bounds motivated by the weak gravity conjecture, which we illustrate with further evidence.</description>

      <title>Fragmented perspective of self-organized criticality and disorder in log gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a statistical model to discuss nonequilibrium fragmentation phenomena taking place in the stochastic dynamics of the log sector in log gravity. From the canonical Gibbs model, a combinatorial analysis reveals an important aspect of the $n$-particle evolution previously shown to generate a collection of random partitions according to the Ewens distribution realized in a disconnected double Hurwitz number in genus zero. By treating each possible partition as a member of an ensemble of fragmentations, and ensemble averaging over all partitions with the Hurwitz number as a special case of the Gibbs distribution, a resulting distribution of cluster sizes appears to fall as a power of the size of the cluster. Dynamical systems that exhibit a distribution of sizes giving rise to a scale-invariant power-law behavior at a critical point possess an important property called self-organized criticality. As a corollary, the log sector of log gravity is a self-organized critical system at the critical point $\mu l =1$. A similarity between self-organized critical systems, spin glass models and the dynamics of the log sector which exhibits aging behavior reminiscent of glassy systems is pointed out by means of the P\`{o}lya distribution, also known to classify various models of (randomly fragmented) disordered systems, and by presenting the cluster distribution in the log sector of log gravity as a distinguished member of this probability distribution. We bring arguments from a probabilistic perspective to discuss the disorder in log gravity, largely anticipated through the conjectured AdS$_3$/LCFT$_2$ correspondence.</description>

Abstract: The late time behaviour of OTOCs involving generic non-conserved local operators show exponential decay in chaotic many body systems. However, it has been recently observed that for certain holographic theories, the OTOC involving the $U(1)$ conserved current for a gauge field instead varies diffusively at late times. The present work generalizes this observation to conserved currents corresponding to higher-form symmetries that belong to a wider class of symmetries known as generalized symmetries. We started by computing the late time behaviour of OTOCs involving $U(1)$ current operators in five dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black hole geometry for the 2-form antisymmetric $B$-fields. The bulk solution for the $B$-field exhibits logarithmic divergences near the asymptotic AdS boundary which can be regularized by introducing a double trace deformation in the boundary CFT. Finally, we consider the more general case with antisymmetric $p$-form fields in arbitrary dimensions. In the scattering approach, the boundary OTOC can be written as an inner product between asymptotic 'in' and 'out' states which in our case is equivalent to computing the inner product between two bulk fields with and without a shockwave background. We observe that the late time OTOCs have power law tails which seems to be a universal feature of the higher-form fields with $U(1)$ charge conservation.</description>

      <title>BPS Spectra of complex knots</title>

Abstract: Marino's conjecture remains underexplored within the framework of $SO(N )$ string dualities. In this article, we investigated the reformulated invariants of a one-parameter family of knots $\left[ K\right]_p$ derived from tangle surgery on Manolescu's quasi-alternating knot diagrams. Within topological string dualities, we have verified Marino's integrality conjecture for these families of knots up to the Young diagram representation ${\bf R}$, with ${|\bf R|}\leq 2$. Furthermore, through our analysis, we have conjectured the closed structure of extremal refined BPS integers for the torus knots $ \left[{\bf 3_1}\right]_{2p+1}$ and $ \left[{\bf 8_{20}}\right]_{2p+1}$, $p \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$. As the parameter $p$ of the knot diagram increases, the total crossing number of a knot exceeds $16$, which we describe as a complex knot. Interestingly, we discovered a maximum number of gaps in the BPS spectra associated with complex knot families. Moreover, our observations indicated that as $p$ increases, the size of these gaps also expands.</description>

      <title>The primordial non-Gaussianities for non-singular Horndeski cosmologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have acquired and analyzed the bispectrum of primordial scalar perturbations and the corresponding non-Gaussianities in the particular model of the contracting Universe with strong gravity in the past within the framework of the Horndeski theory. The found shape function of the bispectrum did not correspond to the widely used local, equilateral, orthogonal or enfolded shapes. We also evaluate non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{\text{NL}}$ for different wave numbers $\vec{k}_1$, $\vec{k}_2$, $\vec{k}_3$ configurations. The convenient ones in our case are: (i) $k_1=k_2$, $k_3\to 0$ (local configuration of wave numbers); (ii) $k_1=k_2=k_3$ (equilateral configuration); (iii) the enfolded one, where $k_1=k_2+k_3$, which is a linear combination of the equilateral and orthogonal configurations. For each separate configuration (local, equilateral, and enfolded) it is possible to satisfy the current observational bounds for non-linear parameter even under the restrictions of the applicability of regime, where the background evolution and perturbations are legitimately described within classical field theory and weakly coupled quantum theory at all times. However, one can not select the parameters of the model so that all three non-linear parameters $f_{\text{NL}}^{\text{local}}$, $f_{\text{NL}}^{\text{equil}}$, and $f_{\text{NL}}^{\text{enfold}}$ would simultaneously satisfy the acceptable observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Strings as Hyper-Fractons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically examine all possible Gauss laws obeying spatial rotation symmetry, characterising the corresponding conserved charges. In the case of conserved higher moments, this gives rise to fractonic behaviour. We show that many Gauss laws, including those arising from $p$-form electrodynamics, in fact, produce an infinite tower of conserved moments, which we dub hyper-fractonic. In hyper-fractonic systems, a finite number of charged particles cannot be mobile due to an inability of fulfilling the infinite number of conservation laws with a finite number of degrees of freedom. Instead, mobile charged objects must have an infinite number of degrees of freedom. In particular, the strings and branes naturally coupling to $p$-form potentials provide an example of hyper-fractonic matter.</description>

      <title>Spin One Matter Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown how spin one vector matter fields can be coupled to a Yang-Mills theory. Such matter fields are defined as belonging to a representation $R$ of the Yang-Mills gauge algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. It is also demanded that these fields together with the original gauge fields be the gauge fields of an embedding total gauge algebra $\mathfrak{g}_{\rm tot}$. The existence of a physically consistent Yang-Mills action for the total algebra is finally required. These conditions are rather restrictive, as shown in some examples: non-trivial solutions may or may not exist depending on the choice of the original algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and of the representation $R$. The case of the initial algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ = $\mathfrak{u}(1)\oplus\mathfrak{su}(2)$ is treated in more detail.</description>

      <title>IR finite correlation functions in de Sitter space, a smooth massless limit, and an autonomous equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore two-point and four-point correlation functions of a massive scalar field on the flat de Sitter background in the long-wavelength approximation. By employing the Yang-Feldman-type equation, we compute the two-point correlation function up to the three-loop level and the four-point correlation function up to the two-loop one. In contrast to the standard theory of a massive scalar field based on the de Sitter-invariant vacuum, we develop the vacuum-independent reasoning that may not possess de Sitter invariance but results in a smooth massless limit of the correlation function's infrared part. Our elaboration affords to calculate correlation functions of a free massive scalar field and to proceed with quantum corrections, relying only on the known two-point correlation function's infrared part of a free massless one. Remarkably, the two-point correlation function of a free massive scalar field coincides with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process's one and has a clear physical interpretation. We compared our results with those obtained with the Schwinger-Keldysh diagrammatic technique, Starobinsky's stochastic approach, and the Hartree-Fock approximation. At last, we have constructed a renormalization group-inspired autonomous equation for the two-point correlation function. Integrating its approximate version, one obtains the non-analytic expression with respect to a self-interaction coupling constant $\lambda$. That solution reproduces the correct perturbative series up to the two-loop level. At the late-time limit, it almost coincides with the result of Starobinsky's stochastic approach in the whole interval of a new dimensionless parameter $0 \leq \tfrac{\pi^2 m^4}{3\lambda H^4} &lt; \infty$.</description>

      <title>$T^2$ deformations in the double-scaled SYK model: Stretched horizon thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been recently realized that the bulk dual of the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model has both positive and negative Ricci curvature and is described by a dilaton-gravity theory with a $\sin(\Phi)$ potential arXiv:2404.03535. We study T$^2$-deformations in the DSSYK model after performing the ensemble averaging to probe regions of positive and approximately constant curvature. The dual finite cutoff interpretation of the deformation allows us to place the DSSYK model in the stretched horizon of the bulk geometry, partially realizing a conjecture of Susskind arXix:2109.14104. We show that the energy spectrum and thermodynamic entropy are well-defined for a contour reaching these regions. Importantly, the system displays a phase transition from a thermodynamically stable to an unstable configuration by varying its microcanonical temperature; unless it is located on any of the stretched horizons, which is always unstable. The thermodynamic properties in this model display an enhanced growth as the system approaches the stretched horizon, and it scrambles information at a (hyper)-fast rate.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy of Free Fermions in Timelike Slices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.03134v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the entanglement entropy of free fermion quantum states in an arbitrary spacetime slice of a discrete set of points, and particularly investigate timelike (causal) slices. For 1D lattice free fermions with an energy bandwidth $E_0$, we calculate the time-direction entanglement entropy $S_A$ in a time-direction slice of a set of times $t_n=n\tau$ ($1\le n\le K$) spanning a time length $t$ on the same site. For zero temperature ground states, we find that $S_A$ shows volume law when $\tau\gg\tau_0=2\pi/E_0$; in contrast, $S_A\sim \frac{1}{3}\ln t$ when $\tau=\tau_0$, and $S_A\sim\frac{1}{6}\ln t$ when $\tau&lt;\tau_0$, resembling the Calabrese-Cardy formula for one flavor of nonchiral and chiral fermion, respectively. For finite temperature thermal states, the mutual information also saturates when $\tau&lt;\tau_0$. For non-eigenstates, volume law in $t$ and signatures of the Lieb-Robinson bound velocity can be observed in $S_A$. For generic spacetime slices with one point per site, the zero temperature entanglement entropy shows a clear transition from area law to volume law when the slice varies from spacelike to timelike.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behaviour of head-to-head high energy Compton scattering in the $\theta$-exact noncommutative (NC) quantum electrodynamics (QED) on the Moyal space (NCQED) in the amid its unresolved forward scattering singularity. We model the effect of the currently unknown resolution to this unavoidable collinear singularity by cut-offs which are functions of the control variable $s/\Lambda_{\rm NC}^2$, and find that such cut-off functions can suppress NC corrections to the inverse Compton scattering to negligible. Discussed cut-offs leave the unpolarised integral cross section of the forward region larger than the backward region all the time, making the former potentially easier to observe. Our estimations indicate that such an effect may be visible in the future collider experiments when the NC scale $\Lambda_{\rm NC}\gtrsim1$ TeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We question the existence of one-loop corrections to the large-scale power spectrum from small-scale modes in non-slow-roll dynamics which are not volume suppressed by the ratio of the short to long distance scales. One-loop contributions proportional to the long wavelength tree-level power spectrum, and not sharing this suppression, have appeared in studies involving interactions singled out by the non-slow-roll dynamics. In this context, we show the relevance of seemingly irrelevant interactions terms, such as the one provided by total derivative terms (boundary terms), and how they equally lead to non-volume suppressed contributions and exact cancellations.</description>

      <title>The Composite Particle Duality: A New Class of Topological Quantum Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00825v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The composite particle duality extends the notions of both flux attachment and statistical transmutation in spacetime dimensions beyond 2+1D. It constitutes an exact correspondence that can be understood either as a theoretical framework or as a dynamical physical mechanism. The immediate implication of the duality is that an interacting quantum system in arbitrary dimensions can experience a modification of its statistical properties if coupled to a certain gauge field. In other words, commutation relations of quantum fields can be effectively modified by a dynamical physical process. For instance, an originally bosonic quantum fluid in $d$ spatial dimensions can feature composite fermionic (or anyonic) excitations when coupled to a statistical gauge field. In 3+1D the mechanism of flux attachment induces a dynamical formation of dyons as higher-dimensional analogues of Laughlin quasiparticles. In 1+1D there is lack of flux attachment but a remnant in the form of a statistical gauge field can be explicitly constructed. We also introduce a family of interacting quantum many-body systems that undergo statistical transmutation as indicated by the duality. This opens the door to a new realm of topological phases across dimensions both in lattice and continuum systems.</description>

Abstract: In a dimensionless multi-scalar extension of the Standard Model, Gildener and Weinberg assumed that along a flat direction, there is only one classically massless scalar, known as the {\it scalon}, which acquires mass through radiative corrections \`a la Coleman-Weinberg, while all other scalars remain heavy. In this paper, by introducing a toy model with four scalar degrees of freedom we demonstrate the existence of {\it two} scalons along a specific flat direction that we construct. We present the effective potential for the model and provide the masses of the heavy scalars and two radiatively light pseudo-Goldstone bosons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In general relativity, all vacuum black holes are described by the Kerr solution. Beyond general relativity, there is a prevailing expectation that deviations from the Kerr solution increase with the horizon curvature. We challenge this expectation by showing that, in a scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory, black holes scalarize in a finite, adjustable window of black-hole masses, bounded from above and below. In this theory, there is an interplay between curvature scales and compactness, which we expect to protect neutron stars and other less compact objects from scalarization. In addition, this theory is the first to avoid the catastrophic instability of early-universe cosmology that affects previous scalarization models. In this theory, black-hole uniqueness can be broken at supermassive black-hole scales, while stellar-mass black holes remain well-described by the Kerr solution. To probe this scenario, observations targeting supermassive black holes are necessary.</description>

Abstract: We applied the method of finite-part integration [Galapon E.A Proc.R.Soc A 473, 20160567(2017)] to evaluate in closed-form the exact one-loop integral representations of the Heisenberg-Euler Lagrangian from QED for a constant electric field and electric-like self-dual background. We also devise a prescription based on the finite-part integration of the Cauchy principal value integral to sum and extrapolate the non-alternating divergent weak-field expansions of the Heisenberg-Euler Lagrangians to recover the non-perturbative Schwinger effect well into the strong field limit.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes-shadow correspondence for rotating regular black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07589v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eikonal quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes (BHs) and parameters of null geodesics, ultimately tied to the appearance of BHs to external observers, are known to be related, and the eikonal QNM-BH shadow radii correspondence has been extensively studied for spherically symmetric BHs. The extension to rotating BHs is non-trivial, and has been worked out only for equatorial ($m=\pm\ell$) QNMs, or for general modes but limited to the Kerr metric. We extend the QNM-shadow radius correspondence to more general rotating space-times, and argue that the requirements for it to hold amount to conditions on the separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for null geodesics and the Klein-Gordon equation. Metrics obtained by the Newman-Janis algorithm enjoy these conditions, provided certain mathematical requirements are imposed on the line element. We explicitly verify the correspondence for the rotating Bardeen and Hayward regular BHs, both of which satisfy the separability requirements. Our findings show that the QNM-shadow radius correspondence holds for a wide range of axisymmetric space-times beyond Kerr. This paves the way to potential strong-field multi-messenger tests of fundamental physics by hearing (via gravitational wave spectroscopy) and seeing (via VLBI imaging) BHs, although substantial improvements relative to the current observational sensitivity are required to make this possible.</description>

      <title>Warp Drives and Martel-Poisson charts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the construction of Alcubierre-Nat\'{a}rio class of warp drives to an infinite class of spacetimes with similar properties. This is achieved by utilising the Martel-Poisson charts which closely resembles the Weak Painlev\'{e}-Gullstrand form for various background metrics (Mink, AdS, dS). The highlight of this construction is the non-flat intrinsic metric which in three dimensional spacetimes introduce conical singularities at the origin and in higher dimensions generates non-zero Ricci scalar for the spatial hypersurfaces away from the origin. We analyse the expansion/contraction of space and the (NEC) violations associated with these warp drives and find interesting scalings due to the global imprints of the conical defects. Other properties like tilting of light cones, event horizons and several generalisations are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It shown that if a vector space carries commuting actions of two Clifford algebras, then the quadratic monomials using generators from either Clifford algebra determine a spinor representation of an orthogonal Lie algebra.
  Examples of this construction have applications to high energy physics, particularly to the standard model and unification. It is shown how to use Clifford data to construct spectral triples for the Pati-Salam model that admit an action of Spin(10).</description>

      <title>Growth of cosmic perturbations in the modified $f(R,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the generalized $f(R,T)$ modified theory of gravity, where the gravitational Lagrangian is a function of Ricci scalar $R$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$. We derive modified field equations to the linear order of perturbations in the context of $f(R,T)$ model. We then investigate the growth of perturbations in the context of $f(R,T)$ modified gravity. Primary numerical investigations based on matter power spectra diagrams indicate a structure growth suppression in $f(R,T)$ gravity, which exhibits consistency with local measurements. Also, we notice that matter-geometry interaction in $f(R,T)$ model would results in the specific feature named as "matter acoustic oscillations" appeared in matter power spectra diagrams. Moreover, we put constraints on the cosmological parameters of $f(R,T)$ model, utilizing current observations, chiefly cosmic microwave background (CMB), weak lensing, supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and redshift-space distortions data. Numerical results based on MCMC calculations imply that $f(R,T)$ is a qualified theory of modified gravity in reconciling Planck CMB data with local probes of large scale structures, by reporting lower values for the structure growth parameter $\sigma_8$ compared to the standard model of cosmology.</description>

      <title>Discontinuities of banana integrals in dispersion relation representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the discontinuities of banana integrals using the dispersion relation iteratively. We find a series of identities between the parameterized discontinuities of banana integrals (p-DOBIs). Similar to elliptic integrals, these identities enable the reduction of various p-DOBIs to be a linear combination of some fundamental ones. We present a practical application of p-DOBIs for deriving Picard-Fuchs operator. Then we establish the expression of generalized dispersion relation, which enables us to obtain the dispersion relation representation of arbitrary banana integrals. Moreover, we propose a hypothesis for generalized dispersion relation and p-DOBIs, which provides a simple way to calculate the discontinuities and transform dispersion relation representation to p-DOBIs.</description>

      <title>Phase-Space methods for neutrino oscillations: extension to multi-beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Phase-Space approach (PSA), which was originally introduced in [Lacroix et al., Phys. Rev. D 106, 123006 (2022)] to describe neutrino flavor oscillations for interacting neutrinos emitted from stellar objects is extended to describe arbitrary numbers of neutrino beams. The PSA is based on mapping the quantum fluctuations into a statistical treatment by sampling initial conditions followed by independent mean-field evolution. A new method is proposed to perform this sampling that allows treating an arbitrary number of neutrinos in each neutrino beam. We validate the technique successfully and confirm its predictive power on several examples where a reference exact calculation is possible. We show that it can describe many-body effects, such as entanglement and dissipation induced by the interaction between neutrinos. Due to the complexity of the problem, exact solutions can only be calculated for rather limited cases, with a limited number of beams and/or neutrinos in each beam. The PSA approach considerably reduces the numerical cost and provides an efficient technique to accurately simulate arbitrary numbers of beams. Examples of PSA results are given here, including up to 200 beams with time-independent or time-dependent Hamiltonian. We anticipate that this approach will be useful to bridge exact microscopic techniques with more traditional transport theories used in neutrino oscillations. It will also provide important reference calculations for future quantum computer applications where other techniques are not applicable to classical computers.</description>

      <title>Doping a fractional quantum anomalous Hall insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study novel itinerant phases that can be accessed by doping a fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) insulator, with a focus on the experimentally observed Jain states at lattice filling $\nu = p/(2p+1)$. Unlike in the lowest Landau level, where charge motion is confined into cyclotron orbits, the charged excitations in the FQAH occupy Bloch states with well-defined crystal momenta. At a non-zero doping density, this enables the formation of itinerant states of the doped anyons just beyond the FQAH plateau region. Specializing to the vicinity of $\nu = 2/3$, we describe a few possible such itinerant states. These include a topological superconductor with chiral neutral fermion edge modes as well as a more exotic Pair Density Wave (PDW) superconductor with non-trivial non-Abelian topological order. A Fermi liquid metal with a doping-induced period-3 charge density wave also occurs naturally in our analysis. This Fermi liquid (as well as the PDW) arises from pairing instabilities of a composite Fermi liquid metal that can emerge near filling $2/3$. Though inspired by the theory of anyon superconductivity, we explain how our construction is qualitatively different. At a general Jain filling $\nu = p/(2p+1)$, the same analytical framework leads to a wider variety of phases including higher-charge superconductors and generalized composite Fermi liquids. We predict unusual physical signatures associated with each phase and analyze the crossover between different temperature regimes. These results provide a proof-of-principle that exotic itinerant phases can be stabilized by correlations intrinsic to the FQAH setup.</description>

      <title>Finitely supertranslated Schwarzschild black hole and its perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A finitely supertranslated Schwarzschild black hole possesses nontrivial super-Lorentz charges compared with the standard one. This may impact the quasinormal modes of the black hole. Since the Einstein's equations are generally covariant, the quasinormal modes of a supertranslated black hole can be obtained by supertranslating the familiar results for a standard black hole. It turns out that the supertranslated quasinormal modes can be obtained by simply shifting the retarded time of the standard modes by an angle-dependent function parameterizing the supertranslation. Therefore, the supertranslated quasinormal modes oscillate at the same frequencies and decay at the same rates as the corresponding standard ones. The supertranslated metric is time translation invariant, but does not explicitly respect spherical symmetries, although it is implicitly rotationally symmetric. So the supertranslated perturbations can still be written as linear combinations of the eigenfunctions of the generalized angular momentum operators for the underlying rotational symmetry. With a suitably defined asymptotic parity transformation, any perturbation can be decomposed into the even and odd parity parts. Then, one may conclude that the isospectrality still holds. To detect such supertranslated quasinormal modes, one has to place multiple gravitational wave interferometers around the supertranslated black hole, and measure the differences in the time shifts between interferometers. Gravitational lensing may also be helpful in the same spirit.</description>

      <title>Degrees of Freedom of New General Relativity: Type 2, Type 3, Type 5, and Type 8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the degrees of freedom of new general relativity. This theory is a three-parameter theory and is classified into nine irreducible types according to the rotation symmetry of $SO(3)$ on each leaf of ADM-foliation. In this work, we focus on unveiling the degrees of freedom of the physically interesting types of NGR: Type 2, Type 3, Type 5, and Type 8, which contain the gravitational propagating degrees of freedom. First, we revisit the theory based on the gauge approach to gravity and reformulate the Lagrangian of the theory. Second, we review the irreducible decomposition of the theory while focusing on the Hamiltonian and the primary constraints in each type. Third, we perform the Dirac-Bergmann analysis to unveil the degrees of freedom of the theory in the case of Type 2, Type 3, Type 5, and Type 8. We find a novel new behavior of constraints in Type 8, which is classified as second-class but not to determine any Lagrange multipliers and to provide the gauge invariance of the theory under the satisfaction of a specific condition of the multipliers. The degrees of freedom of Type 2, Type 3, and Type 5 are unveiled as six, five, and seven, respectively. The degrees of freedom of Type 8 is either four under a specific condition to the Lagrange multipliers or six in the generic case. Finally, we conclude this work with several future perspectives.</description>

      <title>The $D$-dimensional charged AdS black holes solutions in polytropic dark energy from Barrow entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper mainly aims to solve the Anti deSitter Black Holes (AdS BH) under the Barrow entropy under polytropic gas fluid, especially the Chaplygin Gas. First, we develop this last polytropic model in detail to then obtain the possible solutions and thermodynamic conditions on the Energy-Momentum and the Barrow Entropy for spacetimes of spatial dimension $D&gt;3$. Then, we focus on thermidynamic solutions and the different impacts on the Barrow entropy of the black hole, the temperature profile, the mass and the various physical quantities involved. Afterwards, we focus on the specific cases of the solutions of dimensions $D=4$ and $5$ in order to concretely test the models, especially from the point of view of the thermodynamic topology. Finally, we generalize everything by elaborating and testing the stability of the models to arrive at the thermal geometry of the AdS BH.</description>
