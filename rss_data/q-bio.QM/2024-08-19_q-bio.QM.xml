      <title>Exploring Latent Space for Generating Peptide Analogs Using Protein Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating peptides with desired properties is crucial for drug discovery and biotechnology. Traditional sequence-based and structure-based methods often require extensive datasets, which limits their effectiveness. In this study, we proposed a novel method that utilized autoencoder shaped models to explore the protein embedding space, and generate novel peptide analogs by leveraging protein language models. The proposed method requires only a single sequence of interest, avoiding the need for large datasets. Our results show significant improvements over baseline models in similarity indicators of peptide structures, descriptors and bioactivities. The proposed method validated through Molecular Dynamics simulations on TIGIT inhibitors, demonstrates that our method produces peptide analogs with similar yet distinct properties, highlighting its potential to enhance peptide screening processes.</description>

      <title>Personalized graph feature-based multi-omics data integration for cancer subtype identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease with significant variability in molecular features and clinical outcomes, making diagnosis and treatment challenging. In recent years, high-throughput omic technologies have facilitated the discovery of mechanisms underlying various cancer subtypes by providing diverse omics data, such as gene expression, DNA methylation, and miRNA expression. However, the complexity and heterogeneity of multi-omics data present significant challenges for their integration in exploring cancer subtypes. Various methods have been proposed to address these challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel and straightforward approach for identifying cancer subtypes by integrating patient-specific subnetworks features from different omics data. We construct patient-specific induced subnetwork using a random walk with restart algorithm from patient similarity networks (PSNs) and compute nine structural properties that capture essential network topology. These features are integrated across the three omic datasets to form comprehensive patient profiles. K-means clustering is then applied for cancer subtype identification. We evaluate our approach on five cancer datasets, including breast invasive carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, and lung squamous cell carcinoma, for three different omic data types. The evaluation shows that our method produces promising and effective results, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to existing methods and underscoring its potential for advancing personalized cancer diagnosis and treatment.</description>

      <title>Predicting the genetic component of gene expression using gene regulatory networks</title>

Abstract: Gene expression prediction plays a vital role in transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), which seek to establish associations between tissue gene expression and complex traits. Traditional models rely on genetic variants in close genomic proximity to the gene of interest to predict the genetic component of gene expression. In this study, we propose a novel approach incorporating distal genetic variants acting through gene regulatory networks (GRNs) into gene expression prediction models, in line with the omnigenic model of complex trait inheritance. Using causal and coexpression GRNs reconstructed from genomic and transcriptomic data and modeling the data as a Bayesian network jointly over genetic variants and genes, inference of gene expression from observed genotypic data is achieved through a two-step process. Initially, the expression level of each gene in the network is predicted using its local genetic variants. The residuals, calculated as the differences between the observed and predicted expression levels, are then modeled using the genotype information of parent and/or grandparent nodes in the GRN. The final predicted expression level of the gene is obtained by summing the predictions from the local variants model and the residual model, effectively incorporating both local and distal genetic influences. Using various regularized regression techniques for parameter estimation, we found that GRN-based gene expression prediction outperformed the traditional local-variant approach on simulated data from the DREAM5 Systems Genetics Challenge and real data from the Geuvadis study and an eQTL mapping study in yeast. This study provides important insights into the challenge of gene expression prediction for TWAS. It reaffirms the importance of GRNs for understanding the genetic effects on gene expression and complex traits more generally.</description>

      <title>Assessing Generalization Capabilities of Malaria Diagnostic Models from Thin Blood Smears</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Malaria remains a significant global health challenge, necessitating rapid and accurate diagnostic methods. While computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools utilizing deep learning have shown promise, their generalization to diverse clinical settings remains poorly assessed. This study evaluates the generalization capabilities of a CAD model for malaria diagnosis from thin blood smear images across four sites. We explore strategies to enhance generalization, including fine-tuning and incremental learning. Our results demonstrate that incorporating site-specific data significantly improves model performance, paving the way for broader clinical application.</description>

      <title>A Real-Time Suite of Biological Cell Image Analysis Software for Computers, Smartphones, and Smart Glasses, Suitable for Resource-Constrained Computing</title>

Abstract: Methods for personalizing medical treatment are the focal point of contemporary clinical research. In cancer care, for instance, we can analyze the effects of therapies at the level of individual cells. Complete characterization of treatment efficacy and evaluation of why some individuals respond to specific regimens, whereas others do not, requires additional approaches to genetic sequencing at single time points. Methods for the continuous analysis of changes in phenotype, such as morphology and motion tracking of cellular proteins and organelles over time frames spanning the minute-hour scales, can provide important insight to patient treatment options. The integration of measurements of intracellular dynamics and the contribution of multiple genetic pathways in degenerative diseases is vital for the development of biomarkers for the early detection of pathogenesis and therapy efficacy. We have developed a software suite (DataSet Tracker) for real-time analysis designed to run on computers, smartphones, and smart glasses hardware and suitable for resource-constrained, on-the-fly computing in microscopes without internet connectivity; a demo is available for viewing at datasetanalysis.com. Our objective is to present the community with an integrated, easy to use by all, tool for resolving the complex dynamics of the cytoskeletal meshworks, intracytoplasmic membranous networks, and vesicle trafficking. It is our goal to have this integrated tool approved for use in the clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Mitosis, Cytoskeleton Regulation, and Drug Resistance in Receptor Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>

Abstract: During cell division, the receptor triple-negative MDA-MB-231 mitotic spindles are the largest in comparison to other BC cell lines. Many of the MDA-MB-231 spindles exhibit rapid lateral twisting during metaphase, which remains unaffected by knockdown of the oncogene Myc and treatment with inhibitors of the serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), alone or in any combination. The MDA-MB-231 cells are the most aggressive and rapidly form metastatic tumors in xenograft transplant models, and exhibited very high proliferation rates when plated as three-dimensional cultures in Matrigel. Quantitative image analysis of microtubules (MTs) in six BC cell lines - MDA-MB-231 (receptor negative), HCC-1143 (receptor negative), HCC-3153 (receptor negative), ZR75B (estrogen receptor-positive), LY2 (progesterone receptor-positive), HCC-1428 (estrogen receptor-positive, progesterone receptor-positive) - demonstrated that the rotational spindle rocking of MDA-MB-231 cells during metaphase appears coupled with a significant increase in MT polymerization rates during interphase, which likely shortens interphase and accelerates cell cycle progression and mitotic entry. Unlike the uniform treadmilling rates of about 21 um/min in kinetochore MTs during metaphase we measured across cell lines, MDA-MB-231 cells in interphase exhibit the fastest MT polymerization dynamics of about 19 um/min and this is coupled with abnormal mitotic spindle oscillations of almost 30 um/min. This aberrant behavior in MDA-MB-231 spindles may represent a therapeutically targetable disrupted mechanism of spindle positioning in receptor triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells leading to tumor aggressiveness. In this manuscript, we outline a strategy for the selection of the most optimal tubulin inhibitor based on the ability to affect MT dynamics.</description>

      <title>Personalized Predictions of Glioblastoma Infiltration: Mathematical Models, Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Multimodal Scans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16536</link>

Abstract: Predicting the infiltration of Glioblastoma (GBM) from medical MRI scans is crucial for understanding tumor growth dynamics and designing personalized radiotherapy treatment plans.Mathematical models of GBM growth can complement the data in the prediction of spatial distributions of tumor cells. However, this requires estimating patient-specific parameters of the model from clinical data, which is a challenging inverse problem due to limited temporal data and the limited time between imaging and diagnosis. This work proposes a method that uses Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to estimate patient-specific parameters of a reaction-diffusion PDE model of GBM growth from a single 3D structural MRI snapshot. PINNs embed both the data and the PDE into a loss function, thus integrating theory and data. Key innovations include the identification and estimation of characteristic non-dimensional parameters, a pre-training step that utilizes the non-dimensional parameters and a fine-tuning step to determine the patient specific parameters. Additionally, the diffuse domain method is employed to handle the complex brain geometry within the PINN framework. Our method is validated both on synthetic and patient datasets, and shows promise for real-time parametric inference in the clinical setting for personalized GBM treatment.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Active Subspaces to Capture Epistemic Model Uncertainty in Deep Generative Models for Molecular Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models have been accelerating the inverse design process in material and drug design. Unlike their counterpart property predictors in typical molecular design frameworks, generative molecular design models have seen fewer efforts on uncertainty quantification (UQ) due to computational challenges in Bayesian inference posed by their large number of parameters. In this work, we focus on the junction-tree variational autoencoder (JT-VAE), a popular model for generative molecular design, and address this issue by leveraging the low dimensional active subspace to capture the uncertainty in the model parameters. Specifically, we approximate the posterior distribution over the active subspace parameters to estimate the epistemic model uncertainty in an extremely high dimensional parameter space. The proposed UQ scheme does not require alteration of the model architecture, making it readily applicable to any pre-trained model. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the AS-based UQ and its potential impact on molecular optimization by exploring the model diversity under epistemic uncertainty.</description>
