      <title>A magnetized strongly turbulent corona as the source of neutrinos from NGC 1068</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cores of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are potential accelerators of 10-100 TeV cosmic rays, in turn producing high-energy neutrinos. This picture was confirmed by the compelling evidence of a TeV neutrino signal from the nearby active galaxy NGC 1068, leaving open the question of which is the site and mechanism of cosmic ray acceleration. One candidate is the magnetized turbulence surrounding the central supermassive black hole. Recent particle-in-cell simulations of magnetized turbulence indicate that stochastic cosmic ray acceleration is non-resonant, in contrast to the assumptions of previous studies. We show that this has important consequences on a self-consistent theory of neutrino production in the corona, leading to a more rapid cosmic ray acceleration than previously considered. The turbulent magnetic field fluctuations needed to explain the neutrino signal are consistent with a magnetically powered corona. We find that strong turbulence, with turbulent magnetic energy density higher than $1\%$ of the rest mass energy density, naturally explains the normalization of the IceCube neutrino flux, in addition to the neutrino spectral shape. Only a fraction of the protons in the corona, which can be directly inferred from the neutrino signal, are accelerated to high energies. Thus, in this framework, the neutrino signal from NGC 1068 provides a testbed for particle acceleration in magnetized turbulence.</description>

      <title>Estimated Heating Rates Due to Cyclotron Damping of Ion-scale Waves Observed by Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circularly polarized waves consistent with parallel-propagating ion cyclotron waves (ICWs) and fast magnetosonic waves (FMWs) are often observed by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) at ion kinetic scales. Such waves damp energy via the cyclotron resonance, with such damping expected to play a significant role in the enhanced, anisotropic heating of the solar wind observed in the inner heliosphere. We employ a linear plasma dispersion solver, PLUME, to evaluate frequencies of ICWs and FMWs in the plasma rest frame and Doppler-shift them to the spacecraft frame, calculating their damping rates at frequencies where persistently high values of circular polarization are observed. We find such ion-scale waves are observed during $20.37\%$ of PSP Encounters 1 and 2 observations and their plasma frame frequencies are consistent with them being transient ICWs. We estimate significant ICW dissipation onto protons, consistent with previous empirical estimates for the total turbulent damping rates, indicating that ICW dissipation could account for the observed enhancements in the proton temperature and its anisotropy with respect to the mean magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory Simulation for Analyzing Neutralization Process of Hydrogen Ion Injected onto Tungsten Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have performed time-dependent density functional theory simulations for the neutralization process of a hydrogen ion injected at 100eV onto the (110) surface of tungsten material. We have also proposed a method for evaluating the detection probability of electrons in a small region. This probability is interpreted as that of detecting hydrogen in each state: positive ion, neutral atom, and negative ion. As a result, the probabilities of detecting hydrogen after a collision as a positive ion, neutral atom, and negative ion were approximately 30 percent, 50 percent, and 20 percent, respectively.</description>

      <title>The Kinetic Ion-Temperature-Gradient-driven instability and its localisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a description of Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG) driven localised linear modes which retains both wave-particle and magnetic drift resonant effects while capturing the field-line dependence of the electrostatic potential. We exploit the smallness of the magnetic drift and the strong localisation of the mode to resolve the problem with a polynomial-gaussian expansion in the field-following co-ordinate. A simple semi-analytical formula for the spectrum of the mode is shown to capture long wavelength Landau damping, ion-scale Larmor radius stabilization, weakening of Larmor radius effects at short-wavelengths and magnetic-drift resonant stabilisation. These elements lead to linear spectra with multiple maxima as observed in gyrokinetic simulations in stellarators. Connections to the transition to extended eigenfunctions and those localized by less unfavourable curvature regions (hopping solutions) are also made. The model provides a clear qualitative framework with which to interpret numerically simulated ITG modes linear spectra with realistic geometries, despite its limitations for exact quantitative predictions.</description>

      <title>Using Convolutional Neural Networks to detect Edge Localized Modes in DIII-D from Doppler Backscattering measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In H-mode tokamak plasmas, the plasma is sometimes ejected beyond the edge transport barrier. These events are known as edge localized modes (ELMs). ELMs cause a loss of energy and damage the vessel walls. Understanding the physics of ELMs and by extension, how to detect and mitigate them, is an important challenge. In this paper, we focus on two diagnostic methods $\unicode{x2013}$ D-alpha spectroscopy and Doppler backscattering (DBS). The former detects ELMs by measuring Balmer alpha emission while the latter uses microwave radiation to probe the plasma. DBS has the advantage of having higher temporal resolution and robustness to damage. These advantages of DBS diagnostics may be beneficial for future operational tokamaks and thus data processing techniques for DBS should be developed in preparation. In sight of this, we explore the training of neural networks to detect ELMs from DBS data, using D-alpha data as the ground truth. With shots found in the DIII-D database, the model is trained to classify each time step based on the occurrence of an ELM event. The results are promising. When tested on shots similar to those used for training, the model is capable of consistently achieving a high f1-score of 0.93. This score is a performance metric for imbalanced datasets that ranges between 0 and 1. We evaluate the performance of our neural network on a variety of ELMs $\unicode{x2013}$ grasssy, suppressed, and wide pedestal $\unicode{x2013}$ finding broad applicability. Beyond ELMs, our work demonstrates the wider feasibility of applying neural networks to data from DBS diagnostics.</description>
