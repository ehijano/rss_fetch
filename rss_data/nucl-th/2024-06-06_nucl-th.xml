      <title>Impact of correlations on nuclear binding energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A strong effort will be dedicated in the coming years to extend the reach of ab initio nuclear-structure calculations to heavy doubly open-shell nuclei. In order to do so, the most efficient strategies to incorporate dominant many-body correlations at play in such nuclei must be identified. With this motivation in mind, the present work pedagogically analyses the inclusion of many-body correlations and their impact on binding energies of Calcium and Chromium isotopes. Employing an empirically-optimal Hamiltonian built from chiral effective field theory, binding energies along both isotopic chains are studied via a hierarchy of approximations based on polynomially-scaling expansion many-body methods. The corresponding results are compared to experimental data and to those obtained via valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group calculations at the normal-ordered two-body level that act as a reference in the present study. The spherical mean-field approximation is shown to display specific shortcomings in Ca isotopes that can be understood analytically and that are efficiently corrected via the consistent addition of low-order dynamical correlations on top of it. While the same setting cannot appropriately reproduce binding energies in doubly open-shell Cr isotopes, allowing the unperturbed mean-field state to break rotational symmetry permits to efficiently capture the static correlations responsible for the phenomenological differences observed between the two isotopic chains. Eventually, the present work demonstrates in a pedagogical way that polynomially-scaling expansion methods based on unperturbed states that possibly break (and restore) symmetries constitute an optimal route to extend ab initio calculations to heavy closed- and open-shell nuclei.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I examined a phenomenological Nijmegen and a first principles HAL QCD $\Xi N$ potentials to study $\alpha\Xi$ ineractions. A Woods-Saxon type form for $\alpha\Xi$ potential in the single-folding potential approach is derived by using the spin- and isospin averaged $\Xi N$ interactions. The possibility of resonance or bound state is searched and accordingly, the low energy scattering phase shift parameters of $\alpha\Xi$ are calculated. The numerical results show that even though two $ \Xi N $ potentials have significantly dissimilar isospin (I) and spin (S) components, $_{\Xi}^{5}H $ could be only a Coulomb-assisted resonance state that appears about $ 0.5 $ MeV below the threshold of $\alpha+\Xi^{-} $ for both model of potentials.</description>

      <title>PREX and CREX: Evidence for Strong Isovector Spin-Orbit Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent PREX-2 and CREX data on the model-independent extraction of the charge-weak form factor difference $\Delta F_{\rm CW}$ in $^{208}$Pb and $^{48}$Ca challenge modern nuclear energy density functionals (EDFs) as well as our present understanding on the neutron skin and nuclear symmetry energy. Within the Skyrme-like EDFs, we demonstrate that the isovector spin-orbit interaction can strongly change the $\Delta F_{\rm CW}$ in $^{48}$Ca while it has essentially no influence on the $\Delta F_{\rm CW}$ in $^{208}$Pb, mainly due to the eight spin-orbit unpaired $1f_{7/2}$ neutrons in $^{48}$Ca. To simultaneously describe PREX-2 and CREX data in $1\sigma$ error, we find the strength of isovector spin-orbit interaction should be larger than about four times of that in the conventional Skyrme-like EDFs, implying the neutrons and protons have significantly different spin-orbit interaction. To further reconcile the data on electric dipole polarizability in $^{208}$Pb and $^{48}$Ca, we obtain $L \approx 55$ MeV for the slope parameter of the symmetry energy, $\Delta r_{\rm np}(^{208}\rm{Pb}) \approx 0.19$ fm and $\Delta r_{\rm np}(^{48}\rm{Ca}) \approx 0.12$ fm for the neutron skin thickness. The implications of the strong isovector spin-orbit interaction are discussed.</description>

      <title>Discovering reduced order model equations of many-body quantum systems using genetic programming: a technical report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this technical report we present first results of applying Genetic Programming (GP) to obtain equations for constructing reduced order models of quantum systems, with a particular interest in nuclear Density Functional Theory. We employ the reduced basis method to obtain reduced coordinates as the amplitudes of the reduced basis, and use GP to avoid the need of constructing the reduced equations through, for example, a Galerkin projection. The reduced order models constructed through GP show excellent accuracy and speed performance, including extrapolations in the controlling parameters, and show promise as an effective method for emulating computationally demanding calculations in nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Does the Sun have a Dark Disk?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sun is not quite a perfect sphere, and its oblateness, thought to be induced through its rotation, has been measured using optical observations of its radius. Its gravitational quadrupole moment can then be deduced using solar models, or through helioseismology, and it can also be determined from measurements of its gravitational effects on Mercury's orbit. The various assessments do not agree, with the most complete and precise orbital assessments being in slight excess of other determinations. This may speak to the existence of a non-luminous disk or ring, where we also note evidence for a circumsolar dust ring within Mercury's orbit from the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) mission. Historically, too, a protoplanetary disk may have been key to reconciling the Sun's metallicity with its neutrino yield.
  The distribution of the non-luminous mass within Mercury's orbit can modify the relative size of the optical and orbital quadrupole moments in different ways. We develop how we can use these findings to limit a dark disk, ring, or halo in the immediate vicinity of the Sun, and we note how future orbital measurements of Mercury and near-Sun asteroids can refine these constraints.</description>

      <title>Light quark mass dependence of nucleon mass to two-loop order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nucleon self energy through the sixth chiral order in the covariant $SU(2)$ chiral perturbation theory ($\chi$PT) in the single baryon sector. The validity of the extended on-mass-shell (EOMS) renormalization scheme is explicitly verified to two-loop order, manifested by the miraculous cancellation of all nonlocal divergences and power-counting-breaking (PCB) terms that are nonanalytic in pion mass. Using the $\sigma_{\pi N}$ term determined from the latest lattice simulation to constrain some unknown higher-order low energy constants (LECs), we predict the nucleon mass in the chiral limit to be $856.6\pm 1.7$ MeV. It is found that the EOMS scheme exhibits quite satisfactory convergence behavior through ${\cal O}(q^6)$ around physical point. We also predict the pion mass dependence of the nucleon mass to the accuracy of ${\cal O}(q^6)$, which is in satisfactory agreement with the recent lattice results over a wide range of pion mass.</description>

      <title>The evolution of the transverse-momentum dependent gluon distribution at small $x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the colour dipole picture for photon-nucleus interactions at small $x$ together with the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) effective theory, we demonstrate that the next-to-leading (NLO) order corrections to the cross-section for the inclusive production of a pair of hard jets encode not only the JIMWLK evolution with decreasing $x$, but also the DGLAP evolution of the gluon distribution function and the CSS evolution of the gluon transverse momentum dependent (TMD) distribution. The emergent CSS equation takes the form of a rate equation describing the evolution of the dijet distribution in the transverse momentum imbalance $K_\perp$ when increasing the dijet relative momentum $P_\perp$. All three types of evolution become important when both $P_\perp$ and $K_\perp$ are much larger than the nuclear saturation momentum $Q_s(x)$ and we propose a framework which encompasses all of them. The solution to the JIMWLK equation provides the source term for the DGLAP evolution with increasing $K_\perp$, which in turn generates the initial condition for the CSS evolution with increasing $P_\perp$.</description>

      <title>Dilepton polarization as a signature of plasma anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the angular distribution of lepton pairs produced in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions as a probe of thermalization of the quark-gluon plasma. We focus on dileptons with invariant masses large enough that they are produced through quark-antiquark annihilation in the early stages of the collision. The angular distribution of the lepton in the rest frame of the pair then reflects the angular distribution of quark momenta. At early times, the transverse pressure of the quark-gluon plasma is larger than its longitudinal pressure as a result of the fast longitudinal expansion, which results in an oblate lepton distribution. By contrast, direct (Drell-Yan) production by quarks and antiquarks from incoming nuclei, whose momenta are essentially longitudinal, results in a prolate distribution. As the invariant mass increases, Drell-Yan gradually becomes the dominant source of dilepton production, and the lepton distribution evolves from oblate to prolate. The invariant mass at which the transition occurs is highly sensitive to the equilibration time of the quark-gluon plasma or, equivalently, the shear viscosity over entropy ratio $\eta/s$ in the early stages of the collision.</description>

Abstract: The developed Faddeev three-body equations are solved to search for bound-state solutions of a phi-meson $ \left(\phi\right) $ and two nucleons $ \left( \textrm{NN} \right) $ system. The newly published spin $ 3/2 $ $ \textrm{N-\ensuremath{\phi}} $ potential based on the $ \left(\textrm{2+1}\right) $-flavor lattice QCD simulations near physical point, and realistic $ \textrm{NN} $ Malfliet-Tjon (MT) potential, are employed. Our numerical calculations for $ (I)J^{\pi}=(0)2^{-}$ $ \phi\textrm{-d} $ system in maximum spin leads to ground state binding energy of about $ 7 $ MeV and a matter radius of about $ 8 $ fm. Our results indicates the possibility of the formation of new nuclear clusters.</description>

      <title>Charmonium production in hot magnetized hyperonic matter -- effects of baryonic Dirac sea and PV mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03677v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the medium modifications of the masses of pseudoscalar open charm ($D$ and $\bar D$) mesons and the charmonium state ($\psi(3770)$) in hot isospin asymmetric strange hadronic medium in the presence of an external magnetic field within a chiral effective model. The in-medium partial decay widths of $\psi(3770)$ to $D\bar D$ mesons are computed from the in-medium masses of the initial and final state mesons. These are computed using two light quark pair creation models - (I) the $^3P_0$ model and (II) a field theoretical (FT) model of composite hadrons with quark (and antiquark) constituents. The production cross-sections of $\psi(3770)$, arising from scattering of the $D$ and $\bar D$ mesons, are computed from the relativistic Breit-Wigner spectral function expressed in terms of the in-medium masses and the decay widths of the charmonium state. The effects of the magnetic field are considered due to the Dirac sea (DS) of the baryons, the mixing of the pseudoscalar and vector meson (PV mixing) and the Landau level contributions for the charged hadrons. The production cross-sections of $\psi(3770)$ arising due to scattering of $D^+D^-(D^0\bar{D}^0)$ mesons in the hot magnetized strange hadronic matter are observed to have distinct peak positions, when the magnetic field is large, due to the mass difference of the transverse and longitudinal components of $\psi(3770)$, arising from PV mixing. These can have observable consequences on the dilepton spectra and the production of the charm mesons in ultra-relativistic peripheral heavy ion collision experiments, where the produced magnetic field is huge.</description>

      <title>Isospin diffusion from $^{40,48}$Ca$+^{40,48}$Ca experimental data at Fermi energies: Direct comparisons with transport model calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents an investigation of isospin equilibration in cross-bombarding $^{40,48}$Ca$+^{40,48}$Ca reactions at 35 MeV/nucleon, by comparing experimental data with filtered transport model calculations. Isospin diffusion is studied using the evolution of the isospin transport ratio with centrality. The asymmetry parameter $\delta=(N-Z)/A$ of the quasiprojectile (QP) residue is used as isospin-sensitive observable, while a recent method for impact parameter reconstruction is used for centrality sorting. A benchmark of global observables is proposed to assess the relevance of the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD) model, coupled to GEMINI++, in the study of dissipative collisions. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering cluster formation to reproduce observables used for isospin transport and centrality studies. Within the AMD model, we prove the applicability of the impact parameter reconstruction method, enabling a direct comparison to the experimental data for the investigation of isospin diffusion. For both, we evidence a tendency to isospin equilibration with an impact parameter decreasing from 9 to 3 fm, while the full equilibration is not reached. A weak sensitivity to the stiffness of the equation of state employed in the model is also observed, with a better reproduction of the experimental trend for the neutron-rich reactions.</description>

      <title>Collision energy dependence of source sizes for primary and secondary pions at NICA energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of the two-pion correlation function parameters with collision energy in the context of relativistic heavy-ion collisions within the NICA energy range. To this end, we perform UrQMD simulations in the cascade mode to produce samples of pions from $5\times 10^6$ Bi+Bi collisions for each of the studied energies. The effects of the quantum-statistical correlations are introduced using the correlation afterburner code CRAB. We fit the correlation function using Gaussian, exponential and symmetric L\'evy shapes and show that for all collision energies the latter provides the best fit. We separate the sample into pions coming from primary processes and pions originating from the decay of long-lived resonances, and show that the source size for the latter is significantly larger than for the former. The source size for the secondaries, is similar but in general larger than the size for the whole pion sample. To further characterize the pion source, we also simulate the effects of a non-ideal detector introducing a momentum smearing parameter, representing the minimum pair momentum and thus a maximum source size that can be resolved. The values of the correlation function intercept parameter are therefore modified from the values they attain for the perfect detector case. Using the core-halo picture of the source, we show that the values of the intercept parameter are influenced by the presence of a significant fraction of core pions coming from the decay of long-lived but slow-moving resonances. These findings serve as a benchmark to compare with future Monte Carlo studies that consider an Equation of State and thus allow for a phase transition within the studied energy domain.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of hidden-charm strange pentaquarks, we conduct a systematic study of the magnetic moments of the hidden-bottom strange pentaquarks in molecular picture. We calculate magnetic moments of hidden-bottom strange pentaquarks with strangeness-1 and 2. Magnetic moment gives valuable information about the inner structure and shape of the hadron. The obtained results may be helpful to determine the inner structure of these new yet hypothetical states.</description>
