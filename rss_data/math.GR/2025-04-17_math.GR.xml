      <description>arXiv:2504.11503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the finite groups $G$ in which every subset $A \subseteq G$ of cardinality dividing the order of $G$ is a \emph{factor}, i.e. has a complement $B \subseteq G$ of cardinality $|G|/|A|$ such that $G = A \cdot B$ or $G = B \cdot A$.</description>

      <title>Chasing finite shadows of infinite groups through geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are many situations in geometry and group theory where it is natural, convenient or necessary to explore infinite groups via their actions on finite objects, i.e. via the finite quotients of the group. But how much understanding can one really gain about an infinite group by examining its finite images? Which properties of the group can one recognise, and when does the set of finite images determine the group completely? How hard is it to decide what the finite images of a given infinite group are?
  These notes follow my plenary lecture at the ECM in Sevilla, July 2024. The goal of the lecture was to sketch some of the rich history of the preceding problems and to present results that illustrate how the field surrounding these questions has been transformed in recent years by input from low-dimensional topology and the study of non-positively curved spaces.</description>

      <title>A presentation of the pure cactus group of degree four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a simple presentation of the pure cactus group $PJ_4$ of degree four. This presentation is obtained by considering an action of $PJ_4$ on the hyperbolic plane and constructing a Dirichlet polygon for the action. As a corollary, we provide a direct alternative proof that $PJ_4$ is isomorphic to the fundamental group of the connected sum of five real projective planes.</description>

      <title>On finitely generated Hausdorff spectra of groups acting on rooted trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We answer two longstanding questions of Klopsch (1999) and Shalev (2000) by proving that the finitely generated Hausdorff spectrum of the closure of a finitely generated regular branch group with respect to the level-stabilizer filtration is the full interval [0,1]. Previous work related to the above questions include the celebrated result of Ab\'ert and Vir\'ag on the completeness of the finitely generated Hausdorff spectrum of the group of $p$-adic automorphisms $W_p$. We extend their result to any level-transitive iterated wreath product acting on a regular rooted tree, and more importantly, provide the first explicit examples of finitely generated subgroups with prescribed Hausdorff dimension. In fact, in $W_p$ such subgroups can be taken to be 2-generated, giving further evidence to a conjecture of Ab\'ert and Vir\'ag. Furthermore, we extend a well-known result of Klopsch (1999) for branch groups to closed level-transitive groups with fully dimensional rigid stabilizers: these have full Hausdorff spectrum with respect to the level-stabilizer filtration. In turn, we determine, for the first time, the Hausdorff spectum of many well-studied families of weakly branch groups. As an additional new contribution, we define {\it nice filtrations} (which include the level-stabilizer filtration). In fact, the first and the last result can be proven more generally with respect to these filtrations (under possibly some further assumptions). Finally, we also consider two standard filtrations, namely the $2$-central lower series, and the dimension subgroup or Jenning-Zassenhaus series in the closure of the first Grigorchuck group, and show that its finitely generated Hausdorff spectra with respect to these filtrations is the full interval [0,1], answering a recent question of de las Heras and Thillaisundaram (2022). This is obtained via a reduction to properties concerning to nice filtrations.</description>

      <title>Property $R_{\infty}$ for groups with infinitely many ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that an accessible group with infinitely many ends has property $R_{\infty}$. That is, it has infinitely many twisted conjugacy classes for any twisting automorphism. We deduce that having property $R_{\infty}$ is undecidable amongst finitely presented groups.
  We also show that the same is true for a wide class of relatively hyperbolic groups, filling in some of the gaps in the literature. Specifically, we show that a non-elementary, finitely presented relatively hyperbolic group with finitely generated peripheral subgroups which are not themselves relatively hyperbolic, has property $R_{\infty}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a class of finitely generated groups which have arbitrarily large conjugacy separability function, but in which the conjugacy problem can be solved in polynomial time, demonstrating that the McKinsey algorithm for the conjugacy problem can have complexity which lies arbitrarily far from the optimum.</description>

      <title>Advanced MST3 Encryption scheme based on generalized Suzuki 2-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a method for enhancing the encryption algorithm in the MST3 cryptosystem for generalized Suzuki 2-groups. The conventional MST cryptosystem based on Suzuki groups utilizes logarithmic signatures (LS) restricted to the center of the group, resulting in an expansive array of logarithmic signatures. We propose an encryption scheme based on multi-parameter non-commutative groups, specifically selecting multi-parameter generalized Suzuki 2-groups as the group construction framework. In our approach, the logarithmic signature extends across the entire group, with cipher security dependent on the group order. This design enables the development of encryption optimized for implementation efficiency determined by logarithmic signature size while maintaining robust security through appropriate key sizes and the finite field of group representation. The primary innovation in our encryption implementation lies in the sequential de-encapsulation of keys from ciphertext using logarithmic signatures and associated keys. The security evaluation of the cipher relies on attack complexity analysis, which is quantified through comprehensive key enumeration methodologies.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{L}^1$ full groups of flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.09009v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of an $\mathrm{L}^{1}$ full group associated with a measure-preserving action of a Polish normed group on a standard probability space. These groups carry a natural Polish group topology induced by an $\mathrm{L}^1$ norm. Our construction generalizes $\mathrm{L}^{1}$ full groups of actions of discrete groups, which have been studied recently by the first author.
  We show that under minor assumptions on the actions, topological derived subgroups of $\mathrm{L}^{1}$ full groups are topologically simple and -- when the acting group is locally compact and amenable -- are whirly amenable and generically two-generated. $\mathrm{L}^{1}$ full groups of actions of compactly generated locally compact Polish groups are shown to remember the $\mathrm{L}^{1}$ orbit equivalence class of the action.
  For measure-preserving actions of the real line (also often called measure-preserving flows), the topological derived subgroup of an $\mathrm{L}^{1}$ full groups is shown to coincide with the kernel of the index map, which implies that $\mathrm{L}^{1}$ full groups of free measure-preserving flows are topologically finitely generated if and only if the flow admits finitely many ergodic components. We also prove a reconstruction-type result: the $\mathrm{L}^{1}$ full group completely characterizes the associated ergodic flow up to flip Kakutani equivalence.
  Finally, we study the coarse geometry of the $\mathrm{L}^{1}$ full groups. The $\mathrm{L}^{1}$ norm on the derived subgroup of the $\mathrm{L}^{1}$ full group of an aperiodic action of a locally compact amenable group is proved to be maximal in the sense of C. Rosendal. For measure-preserving flows, this holds for the $\mathrm{L}^{1}$ norm on all of the $\mathrm{L}^{1}$ full group.</description>

      <title>Categories of hypermagmas, hypergroups, and related hyperstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09273v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to diagnose the cause of some defects in the category of canonical hypergroups, we investigate several categories of hyperstructures that generalize hypergroups. By allowing hyperoperations with possibly empty products, one obtains categories with desirable features such as completeness and cocompleteness, free functors, regularity, and closed monoidal structures. We show by counterexamples that such constructions cannot be carried out within the category of canonical hypergroups. This suggests that (commutative) unital, reversible hypermagmas -- which we call mosaics -- form a worthwhile generalization of (canonical) hypergroups from the categorical perspective. Notably, mosaics contain pointed simple matroids as a subcategory, and projective geometries as a full subcategory.</description>

      <title>Centraliser algebras of monomial representations and applications in combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Centraliser algebras of monomial representations of finite groups may be constructed and studied using methods similar to those employed in the study of permutation groups. Guided by results of D. G. Higman and others, we give an explicit construction for a basis of the centraliser algebra of a monomial representation. The character table of this algebra is then constructed via character sums over double cosets. We locate the theory of group-developed and cocyclic-developed Hadamard matrices within this framework. We apply Gr\"obner bases to produce a new classification of highly symmetric complex Hadamard matrices.</description>
