      <title>Small-time asymptotics and the emergence of complex singularities for the KdV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While real-valued solutions of the Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) equation have been studied extensively over the past 50 years, much less attention has been devoted to solution behaviour in the complex plane. Here we consider the analytic continuation of real solutions of KdV and investigate the role that complex-plane singularities play in early-time solutions on the real line. We apply techniques of exponential asymptotics to derive the small-time behaviour for dispersive waves that propagate in one direction, and demonstrate how the amplitude, wavelength and speed of these waves depend on the strength and location of double-pole singularities of the initial condition in the complex plane. Using matched asymptotic expansions in the limit $t\rightarrow 0^+$, we show how complex singularities of the time-dependent solution of the KdV equation emerge from these double-pole singularities. Generically, their speed as they move from their initial position is of $\mathcal{O}(t^{-2/3})$, while the direction in which these singularities propagate initially is dictated by a Painlev\'{e} II (P$_{\mathrm{II}}$) problem with decreasing tritronqu\'{e}e solutions. The well-known $N$-soliton solutions of KdV correspond to rational solutions of P$_{\mathrm{II}}$ with a finite number of singularities; otherwise, we postulate that infinitely many complex-plane singularities of KdV solutions are born at each double-pole singularity of the initial condition. We also provide asymptotic results for some non-generic cases in which singularities propagate more slowly than in the generic case. Our study makes progress towards the goal of providing a complete description of KdV solutions in the complex plane and, in turn, of relating this behaviour to the solution on the real line.</description>

      <title>General vector auxiliary differential equation finite-difference time-domain method for rotationally symmetric vector wave propagation in nonlinear optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper the theory and simulation results are presented for 3D vector cylindrical rotationally symmetric electromagnetic wave propagation in an isotropic nonlinear medium using a modified finite-difference time-domain general vector auxiliary differential equation method for nonlinear polarization vectors, the nonlinear dipole moment per unit volume, including both an isotropic part and an anisotropic part. The theory is presented for both the transverse magnetic and transverse electric cases along with the combined equations. The simulation results for transverse electric spatial soliton propagation in BK7, and the simulation results for transverse electric and transverse magnetic spatial soliton propagation in fused silica, assuming a purely isotropic polarization vector, are shown. The simulation results for both transverse magnetic and transverse electric spatial soliton propagation in carbon disulfide, including the anisotropic part of the polarization vector, are also shown.</description>

      <title>Empirical Discovery of Multi-Scale Transfer of Information in Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we quantify the timescales and information flow associated with multiscale energy transfer in a weakly turbulent system through a greedy optimization algorithm which looks to find the maximum conditional mutual information across lagged embeddings of time series localized by wavenumber. Our results provide a detailed understanding of how wavenumbers couple in order to maintain the weakly turbulent dynamic equilibrium. The algorithm is able to detect and characterize detailed differences of information flow with corresponding distinctions in time scales for both the forward and inverse cascades, and this can be done over both fast and slower time scales. This points to our approach being of broader applicability in real-world data coming from chaotic or turbulent dynamical systems.</description>
