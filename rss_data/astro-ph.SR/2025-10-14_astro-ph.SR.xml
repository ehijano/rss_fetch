      <title>Radial Velocity Monitoring and Analysis of Gaia Astrometry of Selected Intermediate Mass Stars to Constrain Their Multiplicity Status</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new radial velocity measurements of 13 selected intermediate mass stars (2 - 6 M$_\odot$). The measurements were performed between 29 April and 6 September 2024 at the University Observatory Jena using the \'echelle spectrograph FLECHAS. The radial velocity of eight stars was found to be constant during our spectroscopic monitoring, namely: 17 Dra A, HD 148374, HD 169487 A, 57 Cnc, $\gamma$ And, HD 11031, $\kappa$ And, and $\lambda$ Cas. In contrast, the radial velocity of five stars showed significant variability throughout or spectroscopic observation, namely: 7 CrB A, 7 CrB B, HD 214007, $\iota$ Her, and HD 201433 A. In all these cases, Keplerian orbital solutions were fitted to the observational data and the orbital elements of these spectroscopic binary systems were determined. In addition, we searched for wide companions of our targets using the third data release from ESA's Gaia mission, in order to determine the multiplicity status of these stars and contribute to the census of bright, nearby multiple stars.</description>

      <title>The ZZ Ceti Instability Strip for The Most Massive White Dwarf Pulsators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present time-series photometry of 31 massive DA white dwarfs with $M\gtrsim 0.9~M_\odot$ within the ZZ Ceti instability strip from the Montreal White Dwarf Database 100 pc sample. The majority of the targets had no previous time-series photometry available, though several were classified as non-variable or potential pulsators in the literature. Out of the 31 candidates, we confirm 16 as pulsating. Our observations at three observatories have led us to discover the most massive pulsating white dwarf currently known, J0959$-$1828 ($M=1.32$ or $1.27~M_\odot$ for a CO versus ONe core), which is slightly more massive than the previous record holder J0049$-$2525. We study the sample properties of massive ZZ Ceti white dwarfs, and find several trends with their weighted mean periods. As predicted by theory, we see an increase in the weighted mean periods with decreasing effective temperature, and a decrease in pulsation amplitudes at the red edge of the instability strip. Furthermore, the weighted mean periods decrease with increasing stellar mass. Our observations show that the ZZ Ceti instability strip may not be pure at high masses. This is likely because the non-variable white dwarfs in the middle of the strip may be weakly magnetic, which could escape detection in the available low-resolution spectroscopy data, but may be sufficient to suppress pulsations. Extensive follow-up observations of the most massive white dwarfs in our sample have the potential to probe the interior structures and core-compositions of these white dwarfs with significantly crystallized cores.</description>

      <title>Spectropolarimetric Inversion in Four Dimensions with Deep Learning (SPIn4D): II. A Physics-Informed Machine Learning Method for 3D Solar Photosphere Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferring the three-dimensional (3D) solar atmospheric structures from observations is a critical task for advancing our understanding of the magnetic fields and electric currents that drive solar activity. In this work, we introduce a novel, Physics-Informed Machine Learning method to reconstruct the 3D structure of the lower solar atmosphere based on the output of optical depth sampled spectropolarimetric inversions, wherein both the fully disambiguated vector magnetic fields and the geometric height associated with each optical depth are returned simultaneously. Traditional techniques typically resolve the 180-degree azimuthal ambiguity assuming a single layer, either ignoring the intrinsic non-planar physical geometry of constant optical-depth surfaces (e.g., the Wilson depression in sunspots), or correcting the effect as a post-processing step. In contrast, our approach simultaneously maps the optical depths to physical heights, and enforces the divergence-free condition for magnetic fields fully in 3D. Tests on magnetohydrodynamic simulations of quiet Sun, plage, and a sunspot demonstrate that our method reliably recovers the horizontal magnetic field orientation in locations with appreciable magnetic field strength. By coupling the resolutions of the azimuthal ambiguity and the geometric heights problems, we achieve a self-consistent reconstruction of the 3D vector magnetic fields and, by extension, the electric current density and Lorentz force. This physics-constrained, label-free training paradigm is a generalizable, physics-anchored framework that extends across solar magnetic environments while improving the understanding of various solar puzzles.</description>

      <title>PAH Spectral Diversity in NGC 7027 and the Evolution of Aromatic Carriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) constitute a significant fraction of the Universe's carbon budget, playing a key role in the cosmic carbon cycle and dominating the mid-infrared spectra of astrophysical environments in which they reside. Although PAHs are known to form in the circumstellar envelopes of post-AGB stars, their formation and evolution are still not well-understood. We aim to understand how pristine complex hydrocarbons and PAHs in circumstellar environments transition to the PAHs observed in the ISM. The mid-infrared PAH spectra (5-18 micron) of the planetary nebula, NGC 7027, are investigated using spectral cubes from JWST MIRI-MRS. We report the first detection of spatially-resolved variations of the PAH spectral profiles across class A, AB, and B in all major PAH bands (6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.2 micron) within a single source, NGC 7027. These variations are linked to morphological structures within NGC 7027. Clear correlations are revealed between the 6.2, 7.7, and 8.6 micron features, where the red components (6.26, 7.8, 8.65 micron) exhibit a strong correlation and the same is found for the blue components of the 6.2 and 7.7 (6.205 and 7.6 micron). The blue component of the 8.6 (8.56 micron) appears to be independent of the other components. We link this behaviour to differences in molecular structure of their PAH subpopulations. Decomposition of the 11.2 micron band confirms two previously identified components, with the broader 11.25 micron component attributed to emission from very small grains of PAH clusters rather than PAH emission. We show that PAH profile classes generally vary with proximity to the central star's UV radiation field, suggesting class B PAHs represent more processed species while class A PAHs remain relatively pristine, challenging current notions on the spectral evolution of PAHs.</description>

      <title>Chandra/HETG and NuSTAR Observations of V750 Ara, a $\gamma\,$Cas-type Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 197 ks HETG and 95 ks NuSTAR spectra of the $\gamma\,$Cas-type object V750 Ara. The high-resolution X-ray spectra show that the target is similar to other objects of this class. Data are interpreted under the assumption that the X-rays come from an accreting white dwarf, and our analysis implies an accretion rate of about $3\times10^{-11}M_\odot\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Emission lines are weak, and predominantly from hydrogen-like ions: Mg XII, Si XIV, and S XVI. H-like and He-like Fe are both present, but Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescence is weak, being significantly detected only in the NuSTAR spectrum, but was not obviously detected in the HETG dispersed or zeroth-order spectra. The flux was variable above a level expected by Poisson statistics. There were no significant changes in the spectral hardness, though we are limited by lack of soft signal below 1 keV. Emission lines of Mg and Si were strong enough to measure velocity offsets and widths which were found to be marginally inconsistent. The H-like Mg line is consistent with instrumental broadening only, but shows a 300 km/s blueshift. He-like Mg and H-like Si lines have no significant shift in velocity but are broadened by about 1000 km/s. This suggests either different physical origins or velocity structure differing with plasma temperature.</description>

      <title>Insights into Planet Formation from the Ages, Masses, and Elemental Abundances of Host Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How planetary systems form and evolve is a key question in astronomy. Revealing how host star properties, such as elemental abundances, age, and mass, differ from those of non-host stars, and how they correlate with planetary characteristics such as radius, provides new insights into the formation and evolutionary pathways of planetary systems. We determine precise ages for 18890 dwarfs and subgiants from the LAMOST-Kepler-Gaia sample with a mean age uncertainty of about 15 percent (median about 10 percent). Within the framework of Galactic chemical evolution, we find that about 86 percent of planet-hosting stars younger than 8 Gyr occupy the upper branch ([Fe/H] &gt; -0.2) of the characteristic V-shaped age-metallicity relation of the Galactic disk. Based on guiding radii (Rg), we further infer that about 19 percent of these young hosts likely originated in the inner disk and subsequently migrated to the solar neighborhood. Among stars older than 10 Gyr, host stars tend to be more metal-rich, with nearly 59 percent having [Fe/H] &gt; -0.2. This suggests that both young and old planet-hosting stars preferentially form in relatively metal-rich environments. However, for host stars with [Fe/H] &lt; -0.2, we find that their metallicities are on average lower by about 0.16 dex compared to non-host stars of similar age and mass, indicating that [Fe/H] is unlikely to be the dominant factor governing planet formation in metal-poor environments. We also identify a systematic depletion of volatile elements, especially carbon, in planet hosts. Moreover, host star [Fe/H] exhibits a weak correlation with planet radius, while [alpha/Fe] primarily support the formation of small planets.</description>

      <title>On the Propagation and Damping of Alfvenic Fluctuations in the Outer Solar Corona and Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze \textit{Parker Solar Probe} and \textit{Solar Orbiter} observations to investigate the propagation and dissipation of Alfv\'enic fluctuations from the outer corona to 1~AU. Conservation of wave-action flux provides the theoretical baseline for how fluctuation amplitudes scale with the Alfv\'en Mach number $M_a$, once solar-wind acceleration is accounted for. Departures from this scaling quantify the net balance between energy injection and dissipation. Fluctuation amplitudes follow wave-action conservation for $M_a &lt; M_a^{b}$ but steepen beyond this break point, which typically lies near the Alfv\'en surface ($M_a \approx 1$) yet varies systematically with normalized cross helicity $\sigma_c$ and fluctuation scale. In slow, quasi-balanced streams, the transition occurs at $M_a \lesssim 1$; in fast, imbalanced wind, WKB-like scaling persists to $M_a \gtrsim 1$. Outer-scale fluctuations maintain wave-action conservation to larger $M_a$ than inertial-range modes. The turbulent heating rate $Q$ is largest below $M_a^{b}$, indicating a preferential heating zone shaped by the degree of imbalance. Despite this, the Alfv\'enic energy flux $F_a$ remains elevated, and the corresponding damping length $\Lambda_d = F_a/Q$ remains sufficiently large to permit long-range propagation before appreciable damping occurs. Normalized damping lengths $\Lambda_d/H_A$, where $H_A$ is the inverse Alfv\'en-speed scale height, are near unity for $M_a \lesssim M_a^{b}$ but decline with increasing $M_a$ and decreasing $U$, implying that incompressible reflection-driven turbulence alone cannot account for the observed dissipation. Additional damping mechanisms -- such as compressible effects -- are likely required to account for the observed heating rates across much of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>LAMOST J064137.77+045743.8: A New Binary of an A7-type Pulsating Subgiant and an M-type Red Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the progressive release of data from numerous sky surveys, humanity has entered the era of astronomical big data. Multi-wavelength, multi-method research is playing an increasingly crucial role. Binaries account for a substantial fraction of all stellar systems and research into binaries is of fundamental importance. LAMOST J064137.77+045743.8 has not yet been recorded in the SIMBAD astronomical database. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of LAMOST J064137.77+045743.8 using multi-band spectroscopic, astrometric, and photometric data. The low-resolution spectra from Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) suggest that LAMOST J064137.77+045743.8 is a binary consisting of an A7-type subgiant star ($T_{\rm eff}$ $\sim$ 7500\,K and log\,$g$ $\sim$ 3.9) and a cool red dwarf star. Astrometric data from Globe Astrometric Interferometers for Astrophysics support the binary speculation with a Renormalized Unit Weight Error metric value of 1.9. Additional flux observations in the infrared bands further corroborate the presence of a red dwarf companion. The i-band flare detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) photometric observations bolsters the interpretation of an M-type red dwarf companion. The radial velocity variations in the H$\alpha$ lines from LAMOST medium-resolution spectra and the light curves from ZTF both support the classification of the A7 subgiant as a pulsating star. The binary either has a long orbital period, a non-eclipsing binary orbit, or extremely shallow eclipses. Future asteroseismology studies will further probe the internal physics of the A7 subgiants. Research on binaries is incredibly fascinating.</description>

      <title>Picoflares in the Quiet Solar Corona: Solar Orbiter Observations Halfway to the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray observations of the Sun led Eugene Parker to propose nanoflares as the basic energy-release units that heat the solar corona. Decades later, Solar Orbiter's Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (HRIEUV), operating halfway between Earth and the Sun, revealed thousands of even smaller brightenings in the quiet corona - tiny "campfires" that are smaller and far more frequent than the fundamental nanoflares observed from 1 AU.
  We analyze over 12,000 of these events, deriving their thermal energies using multiple geometric models to account for volume uncertainties. Although absolute values vary, all models yield consistent power-law energy distributions and ranges, confirming their flare-like behavior.
  These picoflares, spanning 10^20-10^24 erg, were detected exactly between the Sun and Earth. They occur up to sixty times more often than nanoflares seen from Earth orbit and supply about 1% of the quiet-Sun coronal heating power. This previously unseen energy source may be a missing component in the solar energy balance. Their discovery extends the flare energy spectrum to smaller scales, and future Solar Orbiter observations at 0.28 AU may reveal the most fundamental flare events that sustain the million-degree solar corona.</description>

      <title>Variation of the disk thickness across ice bands: A method to determine ice abundances in highly inclined protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope provides unprecedented information to study ices in protoplanetary disks. However, the saturation of ice bands in highly inclined disks hinders the measurement of ice abundances using classical spectroscopy. This is unfortunate as the presence and more importantly abundance of ices plays a key role in, e.g., the evolution of dust (because it modifies the sticking properties) and the composition of planetesimals and exoplanetary atmospheres. To overcome this issue and quantify the ice abundance within disks, we introduce a new method based on measuring the changes in the apparent disk thickness as a function of wavelength, which is directly and quantitatively related to the grain opacity. Specifically, we expect i) that the increased opacity within ice bands should result in a thicker disk than in the adjacent continuum, and ii) the thickness variations to be proportional to the abundance of ice. We extracted the disk thickness in model images of edge-on disks containing different abundances of water ice, as well as in James Webb Space Telescope spectral imaging of four edge-on disks. For both models and observations, the disk thickness decreases toward longer wavelengths except across the positions of ice absorption features where the thickness is enhanced across the band. In the model images, we demonstrate that this effect increases with ice abundance without any hint of saturation. This definitely demonstrates the presence of the ice species within each disk and confirms our expectation that this method can be applied to estimate ice abundances. Thanks to this method, it will thus be possible to constrain the ice abundance in highly inclined disks with disks model fitting. Unlike spectroscopic analysis, this method is not subject to saturation and should therefore be more robust and applicable to all disks for which the two surfaces can be resolved.</description>

      <title>Sunspot Observations in 1684-1702: John Flamsteed and Philippe de La Hire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present an extensive review and detailed analysis of sunspot measurements, drawings, and engravings made by John Flamsteed and, mainly, by Philippe de La Hire during the Maunder minimum. All available information and contemporary knowledge about the sunspot nature are shown. The coordinates, areas, and numbers of sunspots and sunspot groups are reconstructed. Based on these observations, La Hire, Jean-Dominique Cassini, and his son Jacques Cassini regularly published results that shed light on the purpose of sunspot measurements and the scientific paradigm of that time. In particular, astronomers believed that sunspots were recurrent over decades. We compare the reconstructed time-latitude diagram with those obtained by Spoerer (Ueber die periodicitat der sonnenflecken seit dem Jahre 1618..., 1889) and Ribes and Nesme-Ribes (Astron. Astrophys. 276, 549, 1993). The sidereal differential rotation rate is estimated, and its latitudinal profile is reconstructed. We also evaluate the fraction of sunspot groups that obey or violate Joy's law.</description>

      <title>Observational study of chromospheric jets in and around a sunspot observed by NVST and SDO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To better understand the characteristics, driving mechanisms, and potential heating contributions of chromospheric jets, we analyze two contrasting types: one originating from within the sunspot penumbra (inside jets), and the other originating from outside the penumbra (outside jets). Statistical analysis of 100 jets (50 inside jets and 50 outside jets) reveals that inside jets have a projected velocity range of 4--14~km\,s$^{-1}$, a length range of 1--4~Mm, a width range of 0.2--0.6~Mm, and a lifetime range of 135--450~s, with mean values of 7.90~km\,s$^{-1}$, 2.61~Mm, 0.41~Mm, and 260~s, respectively. About 52\% of inside jets are associated with brightenings in H$\alpha$ blue wing images, and some show high-temperature signatures, suggesting a connection with localized energy release. In contrast, outside jets have higher velocities (8--50~km\,s$^{-1}$, average 19.04~km\,s$^{-1}$), greater lengths (average 6.26~Mm, up to 27.27~Mm), slightly larger widths (average 0.46~Mm), and longer lifetimes (135--630~s, average 327~s). They typically originate from regions of opposite magnetic polarities and are associated with magnetic flux emergence and EUV brightenings. Some outside jets correspond to coronal jets with inverted Y-shaped structures and temperatures exceeding one million Kelvin. Our results suggest that both jet types are driven by magnetic reconnection occurring in distinct magnetic field configurations and contribute to chromospheric and coronal heating.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismic investigation of HD 140283: The Methuselah star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HD 140283 is a well-studied metal-poor subgiant and a Gaia benchmark star, often used for testing stellar models due to its proximity, brightness, and low metallicity ([Fe/H] = -2.3 dex).
  Here we present the first asteroseismic analysis of HD 140283, providing improved constraints on its fundamental properties.
  The star was observed by TESS in 20-second cadence during Sector 51. We extracted a custom light curve and performed a frequency analysis, revealing a rich spectrum of solar-like oscillations including mixed modes. These were combined with parameters from the literature to provide constraints on our model inference performed with BASTA.
  Using a dense grid of models, we find a mass of $0.75 \pm 0.01 \ \mathrm{M}_\odot$, a radius of $2.078 \substack{+0.012\\-0.011} \ \mathrm{R}_\odot$, and an age of $14.2 \pm 0.4$ Gyr, in agreement with the upper limit set by the age of the Universe within $1\sigma$. The observed frequency of maximum power, $\left(\nu_\mathrm{max}\right)_\mathrm{obs} = 611.3 \pm 7.4 \ \mu\mathrm{Hz}$, is significantly higher than predicted from standard scaling relations ($\left(\nu_\mathrm{max}\right)_\mathrm{mod} = 537.2 \substack{+2.9\\-1.8} \ \mu\mathrm{Hz}$), extending known deviations into the metal-poor regime.
  To our knowledge, the oscillations in HD 140283 have the highest $\nu_\mathrm{max}$ of any metal-poor star to date, which will help to advance our understanding of oscillations in metal-poor stars in general. The results demonstrate the value of asteroseismology for precise age determination in old halo stars and taking custom abundances and opacities into account during the modelling is probably important for further improving models of such stars. In addition, a detailed characterisation of metal-poor stars, such as HD 140283, will also help advance our understanding of Population III stars and their impact on future stellar generations.</description>

      <title>NGTS-EB-8: A double-lined eclipsing M+M binary discovered by citizen scientists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the identification and characterization of a new binary system composed of two near-equal mass M-dwarfs. The binary NGTS-EB-8 was identified as a planet candidate in data from the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) by citizen scientists participating in the Planet Hunters NGTS project. High-resolution spectroscopic observations reveal the system to be a double-lined binary. By modeling the photometric and radial velocity observations, we determine an orbital period of 4.2 days and the masses and radii of both stars to be $M_A=0.250^{+0.005}_{-0.004}$ M$_{\odot}$, $M_B=0.208^{+0.005}_{-0.004}$ M$_{\odot}$, $R_A=0.255^{+0.004}_{-0.005}$ R$_{\odot}$, $R_B=0.233^{+0.006}_{-0.005}$ R$_{\odot}$. We detect Balmer line emission from at least one of the stars but no significant flare activity. We note that both components lie in the fully convective regime of low-mass stars ($&lt;0.35$ M$_{\odot}$), therefore can be a valuable test for stellar evolutionary models. We demonstrate that the photometric observations, speckle imaging and initial radial velocity measurements were unable to identify the true nature of this system and highlight that high-resolution spectroscopic observations are crucial in determining whether systems such as this are in fact binaries.</description>

      <title>Precise boron abundance in a sample of metal-poor stars from far-ultraviolet lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The light elements beryllium (Be; $Z=4$) and boron (B; $Z=5$) are mainly produced by spallation reactions between cosmic rays and carbon (C; $Z=6$), nitrogen (N; $Z=7$), and oxygen (O; $Z=8$) nuclei. Only traces of Be or B would have been produced in the Big Bang, but there could be a contribution from the $\nu$-process in type II supernovae. Their abundances at very low metallicities have been debated in the literature, with the aim of
  understanding their origin.
  Our aim is to derive the boron abundance in a sample of metal-poor stars based for the first time on observations with the
  STIS spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope, using clean B lines measured in space ultraviolet.
  We identified a measurable line of B I at 2089.6 A.
  In our sample of metal-poor warm stars, this line is practically free from blending lines,
  and for this reason the precision of the presently derived boron abundances is unprecedented.
  We find that in the interval -2.6&lt;[Fe/H]&lt;-1.0, the slope of the relation A(B) versus [Fe/H] is significantly larger than 1, and thus steeper than that obtained with Be abundances. As a consequence, we find in this interval of metallicity a B/Be ratio that slightly increases with [Fe/H].
  Since at [Fe/H]=-1 the abundance of B is already close to the solar abundance, there should be a break in the B enrichment at a metallicity of about [Fe/H]=-1.</description>

      <title>Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients as "Failed" Gravitational Wave Sources: Helium Core$-$Black Hole Mergers Following Delayed Dynamical Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binaries in which a massive donor star undergoes an extended ($\gtrsim$ kyr) phase of stable mass transfer onto a black hole (BH) accretor offer a promising channel for creating LIGO gravitational wave sources. However, in many systems the mass transfer terminates prematurely in a dynamical instability at orbital periods of a few days, culminating in the BH plunging into the donor and potentially disrupting and accreting its helium core at highly super-Eddington rates. Combining a suite of binary evolution models with analytic estimates and population synthesis, we predict the population of luminous transients from delayed dynamical instability (DDI) and attribute them to the "luminous" class of fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs). The initial plunge of the BH into the partially stripped envelope typically ejects $\sim 10M_{\odot}$ of H/He-enriched material at speeds $\sim 10^{2}-10^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$, generating a compact circumstellar medium (CSM) of radius $\lesssim 1000R_{\odot}$ by the time the BH meets and tidally disrupts the HeC. Rapid BH accretion generates a highly aspherical wind-driven explosion into the environment, powering UV/optical emission via CSM interaction and X-ray reprocessing that rises over a few days to a luminosity $\sim 10^{44}-10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ before fading as the disk spreads outwards and accretion rate drops. Luminous radio/sub-mm emission is generated over several months as the jet collides with the slow quasi-spherical binary outflow, generated by the stable mass transfer preceding DDI, extending to radii $\sim 10^{17}$ cm, in agreement with the inferred CSM environments of LFBOTs. We estimate local rates of DDI merger transients $5-300$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, with a preference for low-metallicities, in agreement with LFBOT demographics. Taken together, our results support LFBOTs as being luminous signposts of "failed" gravitational wave sources.</description>

      <title>Time-Dilation Methods for Extreme Multiscale Timestepping Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many astrophysical simulations involve extreme dynamic range of timescales around 'special points' in the domain (e.g. black holes, stars, planets, disks, galaxies, shocks, mixing interfaces), where processes on small scales couple strongly to those on large scales. Adaptive resolution, multi-physics, and hybrid numerical methods have enabled tremendous progress on the spatial, physics, and numerical challenges involved. But often the limiter for following the long timescales of global evolution is the extremely short numerical timestep required in some subdomains (which leads to their dominating simulation costs). Recently several approaches have been developed for tackling this in problems where the short timescale solution is sampled and then projected as an effective subgrid model over longer timescales (e.g. 'zooming in and out'). We generalize these to a family of models where time evolution is modulated by a variable but continuous in space-and-time dilation/stretch factor $a({\bf x},\,t)$. This extends previous well-studied approaches (including reduced-speed-of-light and binary orbital dynamics methods), and ensures that the system comes to correct local steady-state solutions, and derive criteria that the dilation factor/timesteps/resolution must obey to ensure good behavior. We present a variety of generalizations to different physics or coupling scales. Compared to previous approaches, this method makes it possible to avoid imprinting arbitrary scales where there is no clear scale-separation, and couples well to Lagrangian or Eulerian methods. It is flexible and easily-implemented and we demonstrate its validity (and limitations) in test problems. We discuss the relationship between these methods and physical time dilation in GRMHD. We demonstrate how this can be used to obtain effective speedup factors exceeding $\gtrsim 10^{4}$ in multiphysics simulations.</description>

      <title>The influence of tight binaries on proto-planetary disk masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary systems are a common site of planet formation, despite the destructive effects of the binary on the disk. While surveys of planet forming material have found diminished disk masses around medium separation ($\sim$10--100 au) binaries, less is known about tight ($&lt;$10 au) binaries, where a significant circumbinary disk may escape the disruptive dynamical effects of the binary. We survey over 100 spectroscopic binaries in the Orion A region with ALMA, detecting significant continuum emission among 21 of them with disk masses ranging from 1--100 M$_{\oplus}$. We find evidence of systematically lower disk masses among the binary sample when compared to single star surveys, which may reflect a diminished planet forming potential around tight binaries. The infrared excess fraction among the binary sample is comparable to single stars, although the tight binaries without significant ALMA emission display tentative evidence of weaker 3-5$\mu$m excesses. The depletion of cold dust is difficult to explain by clearing alone, and the role of additional mechanisms needs to be explored. It may be the result of the formation pathway for these objects, systematic differences in intrinsic properties (e.g., opacity) or a bias in how the sample was constructed.</description>

      <title>TESS Discovers a Second System of Transiting Exocomets in the Extreme Debris Disk of RZ Psc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the TESS discovery of only the second system of transiting exocomets with a sufficient number of events to measure the size distribution in the RZ Psc system, enabling comparisons with the $\beta$ Pictoris and Solar System size distributions. Twenty-four transits with absorption depths (AD) of 1--20\% were observed across three TESS sectors of the 20-50 Myr K0V star, detected as part of our TESS survey of extreme debris disks identified by their IR excess. We discover that the ADs (and hence exocomet radii) follow a broken power-law cumulative frequency distribution not previously seen in extrasolar contexts but similar to that observed in Solar System Kuiper Belt Object sizes, with power-law slopes above and below the break of $\gamma_\mathrm{AD&gt;break}$=2.32$\pm$0.12 and $\gamma_\mathrm{AD&lt;break}$=0.11$\pm$0.04, respectively. We derive size distributions of 1--7~km from two independent lines of evidence. We use the RZ Psc exocomet rate to predict exocomet yields for the Early eVolution Explorer (EVE) NASA astrophysics Small Explorer (SMEX) mission concept to obtain simultaneous photometry of 10$^4$ young stars in NUV, optical, and NIR bands. Assuming occurrence rates scaled from RZ Psc, EVE would detect 590 exocomets from $\approx$70 young systems in the optical band, with $\approx$120 simultaneous 5$\sigma$ detections in all three bands. These data would enable grain sizes of 200--700~nm and graphite--olivine compositions of dozens of events to be distinguished at 2.5--3$\sigma$, as well as a 4$\sigma$ determination of the accuracy of the Herschel-derived M-debris disk fraction.</description>

      <title>The Green Bank Ammonia Survey: Data Release 2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an overview of the final data release (DR2) from the Green Bank Ammonia Survey (GAS). GAS is a Large Program at the Green Bank Telescope to map all Gould Belt star-forming regions with $A_\mathrm{V} \gtrsim 7$~mag visible from the northern hemisphere in emission from NH$_3$ and other key molecular tracers. This final release includes the data for all the regions observed: Heiles Cloud 2 and B18 in Taurus; Barnard 1, Barnard 1-E, IC348, NGC 1333, L1448, L1451, and Per7/34 in Perseus; L1688 and L1689 in Ophiuchus; Orion A (North and South) and Orion B in Orion; Cepheus, B59 in Pipe; Corona Australis (CrA) East and West; IC5146; and Serpens Aquila and MWC297 in Serpens. Similar to what was presented in GAS DR1, we find that the NH$_3$ emission and dust continuum emission from Herschel correspond closely. We find that the NH$_3$ emission is generally extended beyond the typical 0.1 pc length scales of dense cores, and we find that the transition between coherent core and turbulent cloud is a common result. This shows that the regions of coherence are common throughout different star forming regions, with a substantial fraction of the high column density regions displaying subsonic non-thermal velocity dispersions. We produce maps of the gas kinematics, temperature, and NH$_3$ column densities through forward modeling of the hyperfine structure of the NH$_3$ (1,1) and (2,2) lines. We show that the NH$_3$ velocity dispersion, $\sigma_v$, and gas kinetic temperature, $T_{\rm kin}$, vary systematically between the regions included in this release, with an increase in both the mean value and spread of $\sigma_v$ and $T_{\rm kin}$ with increasing star formation activity. The data presented in this paper are publicly available via \dataset[DOI: 10.11570/24.0091]{https://doi.org/10.11570/24.0091}.</description>

      <title>Proton-rich production of lanthanides: the {\nu}i process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The astrophysical origin of the lanthanides is an open question in nuclear astrophysics. Besides the widely studied $s$, $i$, and $r$ processes in moderately-to-strongly neutron-rich environments, an intriguing alternative site for lanthanide production could in fact be robustly $\textit{proton-rich}$ matter outflows from core-collapse supernovae under specific conditions -- in particular, high-entropy winds with enhanced neutrino luminosity and fast dynamical timescales. In this environment, excess protons present after charged particle reactions have ceased can continue to be converted to neutrons by (anti-)neutrino interactions, producing a neutron capture reaction flow up to A~200. This scenario, christened the $\nu i$ process in a recent paper, has previously been discussed as a possibility. Here, we examine the prospects for $\nu i$ process through the lens of stellar abundance patterns, bolometric lightcurves, and galactic chemical evolution models, with a particular focus on hypernovae as candidate sites. We identify specific lanthanide signatures for which the $\nu i$ process can provide a credible alternative to $r$/$i$ processes.</description>

      <title>The GAPS programme at TNG XYZ. A sub-Neptune suitable for atmospheric characterization in a multiplanet and mutually inclined system orbiting the bright K dwarf TOI-5789 (HIP 99452)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sub-Neptunes with planetary radii of $R_{p} \simeq 2-4 R_{\oplus}$ are the most common planets around solar-type stars in short-period ($P&lt;100$ d) orbits. It is still unclear, however, what their most likely composition is, that is whether they are predominantly gas dwarfs or water worlds. The sub-Neptunes orbiting bright host stars are very valuable because they are suitable for atmospheric characterization, which can break the well-known degeneracy in planet composition from the planet bulk density, when combined with a precise and accurate mass measurement. Here we report on the characterization of the sub-Neptune TOI-5789 c, which transits in front of the bright ($V=7.3$ mag and $K_{s}=5.35$ mag) and magnetically inactive K1V dwarf HIP 99452 every 12.93 days, thanks to TESS photometry and 141 high-precision radial velocities obtained with the HARPS-N spectrograph. We find that its radius, mass, and bulk density are $R_{c}=2.86^{+0.18}_{-0.15} R_\oplus$, $M_{c}=5.00 \pm 0.50 M_\oplus$, and $\rho_{c}=1.16 \pm 0.23$ g cm$^{-3}$, and we show that TOI-5789 c is a promising target for atmospheric characterization with both JWST and, in the future, Ariel. By analyzing the HARPS-N radial velocities with different tools, we also detect three additional non-transiting planets, namely TOI-5789 b, d, and e, with orbital periods and minimum masses of $P_{b}=2.76$ d, $M_{b}\sin{i}=2.12 \pm 0.28 M_\oplus$, $P_{d}=29.6$ d, $M_{d}\sin{i}=4.29 \pm 0.68 M_\oplus$, and $P_{e}=63.0$ d, $M_{e}\sin{i}=11.61 \pm 0.97 M_\oplus$. The mutual orbital inclination between planets b and c must be higher than $\sim4$ deg, which points to a dynamically hot system. Nevertheless, from sensitivity studies based on both the HARPS-N and archival HIRES radial-velocity measurements, we can exclude that such high mutual inclinations are due to the perturbation by an outer gaseous giant planet.</description>

      <title>Characterizing planetary systems with SPIRou: questions about the magnetic cycle of 55 Cnc A and two new planets around B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the first exoplanet hosts discovered thirty years ago, the star 55 Cnc has been constantly observed ever since. It is now known to host at least five planets with orbital periods ranging from 17 hours to 15 years. It is also one of the most extreme metal rich stars in the neighbourhood and it has a low-mass secondary star. In this article, we present data obtained at the Canada-France-Hawai'i Telescope with the SPIRou spectropolarimeter on both components of the 55 Cnc stellar system. We revisit the long-period radial-velocity signals of 55 Cnc A, with a focus on the role of the magnetic cycle, and propose the existence of a sixth planet candidate, whose period falls close to that of the magnetic cycle, or half of it. The other massive outer planet has a revised period of 13.15 years and a minimum mass of 3.8 MJup. Although some uncertainty remains on these outer planets, the characterization of the four inner planets is very robust through the combination of many different data sets, and all signals are consistent in the nIR and optical domains. In addition, the magnetic topology of the solar-type primary component of the system is observed by SPIRou at the minimum of its activity cycle, characterized by an amplitude ten times smaller than observed during its maximum in 2017. For the low-mass component 55 Cnc B, we report the discovery of two exoplanets in the system, with a period of 6.799+-0.0014 and 33.75+-0.04 days and a minimum mass of 3.5+-0.8 and 5.3+-1.4 MEarth, respectively. The secondary magnetic field is very weak and the current data set does not allow its precise characterization, setting an upper limit of 10 G. The system 55 Cnc stands out as the sixth binary system with planetary systems around both components, and the first one with non equal-mass stellar components.</description>

      <title>Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM): a spectroscopic VLT monitoring survey of massive stars in the SMC</title>

Abstract: Surveys in the Milky Way and Large Magellanic Cloud revealed that the majority of massive stars will interact with companions during their lives. However, knowledge of the binary properties of massive stars at low metallicity, which approaches the conditions of the Early Universe, remains sparse. We present the Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM) campaign - an ESO large programme designed to obtain 25 epochs of spectroscopy for 929 massive stars in the SMC - the lowest metallicity conditions in which multiplicity is probed to date (Z = 0.2 Zsun). BLOeM will provide (i) the binary fraction, (ii) the orbital configurations of systems with periods P &lt; 3 yr, (iii) dormant OB+BH binaries, and (iv) a legacy database of physical parameters of massive stars at low metallicity.
  The stars are observed with the LR02 setup of the giraffe instrument of the Very Large Telescope (3960-4570A, resolving power R=6200; typical signal-to-noise ratio S/N=70-100). This paper utilises the first 9 epochs obtained over a three-month time. We describe the survey and data reduction, perform a spectral classification of the stacked spectra, and construct a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of the sample via spectral-type and photometric calibrations. The sample covers spectral types from O4 to F5, spanning the effective temperature and luminosity ranges 6.5&lt;Teff/kK&lt;45 and 3.7&lt;log L/Lsun&lt;6.1 and initial masses 8&lt;Mini/Msun&lt;80. It comprises 159 O-type stars, 331 early B-type (B0-3) dwarfs and giants (luminosity classes V-III), 303 early B-type supergiants (II-I), and 136 late-type supergiants. At least 82 stars are Oe/Be stars: 20 O-type and 62 B-type (13% and 11% of the respective samples). In addition, it includes 4 high-mass X-ray binaries, 3 stars resembling luminous blue variables, 2 bloated stripped-star candidates, 2 candidate magnetic stars, and 74 eclipsing binaries.</description>

      <title>Spectropolarimetric Inversion in Four Dimensions with Deep Learning (SPIn4D): I. Overview, Magnetohydrodynamic Modeling, and Stokes Profile Synthesis</title>

Abstract: The National Science Foundation's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) will provide high-resolution, multi-line spectropolarimetric observations that are poised to revolutionize our understanding of the Sun. Given the massive data volume, novel inference techniques are required to unlock its full potential. Here, we provide an overview of our "SPIn4D" project, which aims to develop deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for estimating the physical properties of the solar photosphere from DKIST spectropolarimetric observations. We describe the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling and the Stokes profile synthesis pipeline that produce the simulated output and input data, respectively. These data will be used to train a set of CNNs that can rapidly infer the four-dimensional MHD state vectors by exploiting the spatiotemporally coherent patterns in the Stokes profile time series. Specifically, our radiative MHD model simulates the small-scale dynamo actions that are prevalent in quiet-Sun and plage regions. Six cases with different mean magnetic fields have been conducted; each case covers six solar-hours, totaling 109 TB in data volume. The simulation domain covers at least $25\times25\times8$ Mm with $16\times16\times12$ km spatial resolution, extending from the upper convection zone up to the temperature minimum region. The outputs are stored at a 40 s cadence. We forward model the Stokes profile of two sets of Fe I lines at 630 and 1565 nm, which will be simultaneously observed by DKIST and can better constrain the parameter variations along the line of sight. The MHD model output and the synthetic Stokes profiles are publicly available, with 13.7 TB in the initial release.</description>

      <title>A new sample of massive B-type contact binary candidates from the OGLE survey of the Magellanic Clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive contact binaries (CBs) are key to understanding close-binary evolution and stellar mergers, yet their study has been limited by the scarcity of observed systems, particularly of B-type binaries expected to dominate this class. We bridge this gap by mining a large sample of massive CB candidates from the OGLE-IV database, increasing their known numbers in the Magellanic Clouds by nearly an order of magnitude. Using main-sequence colour-magnitude limits, an observationally informed period-luminosity-colour relation for CBs, and a high morph-parameter cut ($c\geq0.7$), we identified 68 O- and B-type binaries that exhibit smooth, sinusoidal light curves with nearly equal eclipse depths. We then isolated a bona fide sample of 37 CB candidates (28 in the LMC and 9 in the SMC) that match theoretical colour-magnitude and period distributions derived from an extensive grid of MESA binary models. The bona fide sample, dominated by B-type systems with $P\approx0.6-1$ d, agrees with the predicted population and may contain many $q\approx1$ binaries, as expected from models showing mass equalization preceding temperature equalization during nuclear-timescale contact. Synthetic PHOEBE light curves of contact and near-contact phases of MESA models reveal a degeneracy between these configurations, suggesting possible misidentifications among these systems. Spectroscopic follow-up is required to test these predictions and refine the evolutionary framework of massive CBs.</description>

      <title>Binary mass transfer in 3D: Mass Transfer Rate and Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18255v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mass transfer is crucial in binary evolution, yet its theoretical treatment has long relied on analytic models whose key assumptions remain debated. We present a direct and systematic evaluation of these assumptions using high-resolution 3D hydrodynamical simulations including the Coriolis force. We simulate streams overflowing from both the inner and outer Lagrangian points, quantify mass transfer rates, and compare them with analytic solutions. We introduce scaling factors, including the overfilling factor, to render the problem dimensionless. The donor-star models are simplified, with either an isentropic initial stratification and adiabatic evolution or an isothermal structure and evolution, but the scalability of this formulation allows us to extend the results for a mass-transferring system to arbitrarily small overfilling factors for the adiabatic case. We find that the Coriolis force -- often neglected in analytic models -- strongly impacts the stream morphology: breaking axial symmetry, reducing the stream cross section, and shifting its origin toward the donor's trailing side. Contrary to common assumptions, the sonic surface is not flat and does not always intersect the Lagrangian point: instead, it is concave and shifted, particularly toward the accretor's trailing side. Despite these structural asymmetries, mass transfer rates are only mildly suppressed relative to analytic predictions and the deviation is remarkably small -- within a factor of two (ten) for the inner (outer) Lagrangian point over seven orders of magnitude in mass ratio. We use our results to extend the widely-used mass-transfer rate prescriptions by Ritter(1988) and Kolb&amp;Ritter(1990), for both the inner and outer Lagrangian points. These extensions can be readily adopted in stellar evolution codes like MESA, with minimal changes where the original models are already in use.</description>

      <title>Far-Ultraviolet Emission Line Investigation of Flares on AU Mic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The role of non-thermal proton energy transportation during solar and stellar flares is largely unknown; a better understanding of this physical process will allow us to rectify longstanding deficiencies in flare models. One way to detect the presence of non-thermal protons during flares is through the Orrall-Zirker (OZ) effect, proposed by Orrall &amp; Zirker (1976), whereby an enhanced red wing appears in hydrogen emission lines (e.g., Lyman-$\alpha$ at 1215.67 angstroms). We analyze archival Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph G130M (1060 - 1360 angstroms) observations of the young M dwarf, AU Mic to search for evidence of OZ effect during the impulsive phase of six stellar flares with $E_\textrm{flare} \approx 10^{30 - 31}$ erg. While we found non-detections of the OZ effect, we note there is a pronounced blue enhancement in several C II and C III emission lines during one of the high-energy flares. We propose that either filament eruptions or chromospheric evaporation could be the mechanism driving this observed blue enhancement. We compare the far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra to 1D radiative-hydrodynamic stellar flare models, which are unable to reproduce the blue enhancement and broadening in these cool flare lines. By completing a line-by-line analysis of the FUV spectrum of AU Mic, we provide further constraints on the physical mechanisms producing stellar flares on M dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Entering the Wind Roche Lobe Overflow realm in Symbiotic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a suite of dynamical simulations designed to explore the orbital and accretion properties of compact (2$-$7 AU) symbiotic systems, focusing on wind accretion, drag forces, and tidal interactions. Using three levels of physical complexity, we model systems of accreting white dwarfs (WDs) with masses of 0.7, 1.0, and 1.2 M$_\odot$ orbiting evolving Solar-like stars with 1, 2, and 3 M$_\odot$. We show that systems alternate between standard wind accretion and Wind Roche Lobe Overflow (WRLO) regimes during periods of high mass-loss rate experienced by the donor star (the peak of red giant phase and/or thermal pulses). For some configurations, the standard wind accretion has mass accretion efficiencies similar to those obtained by WRLO regime. Tidal forces play a key role in compact systems, leading to orbital shrinkage and enhanced accretion efficiency. We find that systems with high-mass WDs ($\geq 1$ M$_\odot$) and massive donors (2$-$3 M$_\odot$) are the only ones to reach the Chandrasekhar limit. Interestingly, the majority of our simulations reach the Roche lobe overflow condition that is not further simulated given the need of more complex hydrodynamical simulations. Our analysis shows that increasing physical realism, by including drag and tides, systematically leads to more compact final orbital configurations. Comparison with compact known symbiotic systems seems to suggest that they are very likely experiencing orbital decay produced by tidal forces.</description>

      <title>Solar Flux Atlases: The new HARPS-N Quiet Sun Benchmark and Ca II H &amp; K Lines Continuum Normalisation</title>

Abstract: Context. Solar flux atlases observe the spatially integrated light from the Sun, treating it as a star. They are fundamental tools for gaining insight into the composition of the Sun and other stars, and are utilized as reference material for a wide range of solar applications such as stellar chemical abundances, atmospheric physics, stellar activity, and radial velocity signals. Aims. We provide a detailed comparison of solar activity in some of the well-known solar atlases against the new High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N) Quiet Sun (QS) and measured activity (MA) atlases that are published, for the first time, in this work. Methods. Ten of the widely used individual spectral lines from each flux atlas were selected to compare solar activity using three methods: 1) Equivalent Widths 2) Activity number, a novel activity measure which we introduce in this work. 3) Bisectors and radial velocity. Results. The significantly smaller activity measured in the MA atlas compared to the other atlases, relative to the QS atlas, underscores the dominance of instrumental effects over solar activity in their impact on spectral lines, which cannot be corrected through simple line convolution to match resolutions of other atlases. Additionally, our investigation unexpectedly revealed a substantial intensity shift in the Ca ii H &amp; K lines of other atlases compared to our HARPS-N atlases, likely caused by assumptions in normalisation techniques used in the early Kitt Peak atlases. Conclusions. With an average spot number of zero, our QS atlas is well suited to serve as an absolute benchmark atlas representative of solar minimum for the visible spectrum that other atlases can be compared against. Our recommendations are 1) publication of a detailed log along with the observations, to include exact dates and indications of solar activity...</description>

      <title>Possible First Detection of Gyroresonance Emission from a Coronal Mass Ejection in the Middle Corona</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Routine measurements of the magnetic field of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) have been a key challenge in solar physics. Making such measurements is important both from a space weather perspective and for understanding the detailed evolution of the CME. In spite of significant efforts and multiple proposed methods, achieving this goal has not been possible to date. Here we report the first possible detection of gyroresonance emission from a CME. Assuming that the emission is happening at the third harmonic, we estimate that the magnetic field strength ranges from 7.9--5.6 G between 4.9-7.5 $R_\odot$. We also demonstrate that this high magnetic field is not the average magnetic field inside the CME, but most probably is related to small magnetic islands, which are also being observed more frequently with the availability of high-resolution and high-quality white-light images.</description>

      <title>How precisely can we measure the ages of subgiant and giant stars?</title>

Abstract: Precise stellar ages are fundamental to Galactic archaeology. However, obtaining reliable age estimates and uncertainties for field stars has been a long-standing challenge. We test the fidelity of ages from recent catalogs of giants and subgiants using wide binaries, whose components formed at the same time and thus should have consistent inferred ages. We find that subgiant ages based on spectroscopic metallicities from Xiang &amp; Rix (2022) are generally consistent within their reported uncertainties, implying that fractional uncertainties of 5-10% are realistically achievable. In contrast, we find that published photometric subgiant ages underestimate true uncertainties by factors of 2-3. Spectroscopic age estimates for red giant and red clump stars also show reliable uncertainties, but are generally less precise (25-30%). These results demonstrate that accurate metallicity and $\alpha$-element abundances are essential for precise subgiant ages and establish wide binaries as a powerful, model-independent benchmark for calibrating stellar age measurements in the era of large spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>Impact of dineutrons on nuclear compositions of a core-collapse supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the nuclear compositions in the central region of a core-collapse supernova, assuming the existence of dineutrons ($^2n$) and tetraneutrons ($^4n$). At 100~ms after core bounce, ${}^2n$ and ${}^4n$ are more abundant than deuterons within radii of approximately 100 and 50~km, respectively. Compared to the model ignoring the existence of ${}^2n$ and ${}^4n$, the mass fraction of neutrons up to a radius of 100~km reduces, while the mass fractions of protons, deuterons, and $\rm{{}^4He}$ increase. Due to the uncertainties in the properties of $^2n$ and $^4n$, we investigate the influence of their binding energies on the nuclear composition. We find the binding energy of $^2n$ has only a modest effect on the overall composition, except for its own mass fraction, while that of $^4n$ has a negligible impact.</description>

      <title>A binary model of long period radio transients and white dwarf pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-period radio transients (LPTs) represent a recently uncovered class of Galactic radio sources exhibiting minute-to-hour periodicities and highly polarised pulses of second-to-minute duration. Their phenomenology does not fit exactly in any other class, although it might resemble that of radio magnetars or white dwarf (WD) radio emitting binary systems. Notably, two LPTs with confirmed multi-wavelength counterparts have been identified as WD -- M dwarf binaries. Meanwhile, systems such as AR Scorpii and J1912-44 exhibit short-period pulsations in hrs-tight orbits, with polarised radio emission proposed to be generated by the interaction of the WD magnetosphere with the low-mass companion wind.
  Here, we investigate the longest-lived LPT known, GPM J1839-10, demonstrating that it has a ~8.75 hr orbital period. We show that its radio pulses can be modelled in the same geometric framework as WD binary pulsars, in which radio emission is triggered when the magnetic axis of a rotating WD intersects its companion's wind in the binary orbital plane. We use a 36-year timing baseline to infer the orbital period and binary geometry from radio data alone. The model naturally predicts its intermittent emission and double-pulse structure. Crucially, we show that the beat period between the spin and the orbit matches the observed pulse substructure and polarisation signatures, providing strong support for the model. Applying it to the WD pulsar J1912-44, it successfully reproduces the emission profile and geometry as well. Our results suggest analogous emission-site geometries in these related classes of binary system -- a possibility we extend to the broader LPT / WD pulsar population.</description>

      <title>High-resolution models of the vertical shear instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (abridged) Context: The vertical shear instability (VSI) is a promising mechanism to generate turbulence and transport angular momentum in protoplanetary discs. While most recent work has focused on adding more complex physics, the saturation properties of the instability in radially extended discs and its convergence as a function of resolution are still largely unknown. We tackle the question of VSI saturation and associated turbulence using radially extended fully 3D global disc models at very high resolution so as to capture both the largest VSI scales and the small-scale turbulent cascade. We use the GPU-accelerated code Idefix to achieve resolutions of up to 200 points per scale height in the 3 spatial directions, with a full 2pi azimuthal extent and disc aspect ratio H/R=0.1.
  Results: We demonstrate that large-scale transport properties are converged with 100 points per scale height, leading to a Shakura-Sunyaev alpha=1.3e-3. Inner boundary condition artifacts propagate deep inside the computational domain, leading to reduced alpha in these regions. The large-scale corrugation wave zones identified in 2D models survive in 3D, albeit with less coherence. Our models show no sign of long-lived zonal flows, pressure bumps or vortices, in contrast to lower-resolution simulations. Finally, we show that the turbulent cascade resulting from VSI saturation can be interpreted in the framework of critically balanced rotating turbulence.
  Conclusion: The VSI leads to vigorous turbulence in protoplanetary discs, associated with outward angular momentum transport but without any significant long-lived features that could enhance planet formation. The innermost regions of VSI simulations are always polluted by boundary-condition artifacts affecting the first VSI wave train, so radially extended domains should be used in a more systematic manner.</description>

      <title>When backgrounds become signals: neutrino interactions in xenon-based dark matter detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct detection dark matter experiments have proven to be compelling probes for studying low-energy neutrino interactions with both nuclei and atomic electrons, offering complementary information to accelerator and reactor-based neutrino experiments. Recently, the XENONnT and PandaX-4T collaborations reported the first evidence of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering from $^8\mathrm{B}$ solar neutrinos. Thanks to their excellent background rejection capabilities and distinctive signal signatures, dual-phase time projection chambers are also sensitive to $pp$ solar neutrinos via their elastic scattering off atomic electrons in the target material. Although this signal is subdominant within the Standard Model, it becomes significantly enhanced in many beyond the Standard Model scenarios, offering a unique opportunity to probe new physics in the low-energy regime. While the precision of current neutrino measurements from dark matter detectors remains lower than that achieved by dedicated neutrino experiments, their sensitivity to the tau neutrino component of solar neutrinos helps complete the overall picture, especially when investigating flavor-dependent new physics effects.</description>
