      <title>Multistable polar textures in geometrically frustrated nematic liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to manipulate polar entities with multiple external fields opens exciting possibilities for emerging functionalities and novel applications in spin systems, photonics, metamaterials, and soft matter. Liquid crystals (LCs), exhibiting both a crystalline structure and liquid fluidity, represent a promising platform for manipulating phases with polar molecular order, notably ferroelectric ones. However, achieving a polar symmetry is challenging with rod-shaped LC molecules, which form predominantly apolar nematic phases. We report an approach in which a geometric lattice confinement of nematic LCs is used to induce planar polar order on the scale of a mesoscopic metamaterial. We confine the nematic LC in a micropillar array, forming topological defect-pillar pairs of elastic dipoles with a free top interface in contact with an immiscible fluid. The resulting dipole lattice configurations can be programmed rheologically by flowing the top fluid and maintained even after flow cessation, a phenomenon attributed to orientational multistability of the dipoles. This multi-memory effect enables the encoding and reconfiguration of directional information. Overall, this research establishes a foundational understanding of topological dipoles under confinement and shear flow, enabling the detection, tracking, and recording of flow profiles and paving the way for future advances in soft matter physics and stimuli-responsive materials.</description>

      <title>Bipolar surface charging by evaporating water droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface charging is a ubiquitous phenomenon with important consequences. On one hand, surface charging underpins emerging technologies such as triboelectric nanogenerators; on the other, uncontrolled charging can damage delicate nanostructures and devices. Despite its significance, surface charging by evaporating water droplets remains poorly understood. Here, using Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy, we spatially resolve the surface-charge patterns from evaporating droplets and propose a physical model that quantitatively explains the origin of bipolar charging.</description>

      <title>When and How Ultrasound Enhances Nanoparticle Diffusion in Hydrogels: A Stick-and-Release Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoparticles (NPs) are widely used as drug carriers in cancer therapy due to their ability to accumulate in tumor tissue via the enhanced permeability and retention effect. However, their transport within tumors is often hindered by the dense extracellular matrix, where diffusion dominates. Several studies suggest that ultrasound (US) irradiation can enhance NP diffusion in ECM-mimicking hydrogels, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear, and experimental findings are often contradictory.
  Here, we use coarse-grained Langevin Dynamics simulations to investigate the conditions under which US can enhance NP diffusion in hydrogels. After validating our simulation framework against an exact analytical solution for NP motion under US in dilute buffer, we systematically explore NP diffusion in hydrogels with varying degrees of NP-network attraction.
  Our results reveal that acoustic enhancement arises from reduced contact time between NPs and the hydrogel matrix. This effect becomes significant only when NP-hydrogel interactions are sufficiently strong and US pulses are long enough to disrupt these interactions, following a "stick-and-release" mechanism.
  These findings reconcile previously conflicting experimental observations and explain why acoustic enhancement is observed in some studies but not others. Overall, our study provides a molecular-level explanation for US-enhanced NP diffusion in hydrogels and establishes design principles for optimizing therapeutic US protocols in drug delivery applications.</description>

      <title>ShearView: A Compact Stress- and Strain-Controlled Rheometer for Integrated Rheo-microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ShearView, a compact, cost-effective, and open-source rheometer that enables both strain- and stress-controlled oscillatory shear experiments, while being fully compatible with high-resolution optical microscopy. Designed for transparency and modularity, the device integrates mechanical simplicity, dual feedback control, and real-time synchronization of rheological and optical data, thereby enabling simultaneous investigation of macroscopic mechanical response and microscopic structural dynamics across a wide range of soft matter systems. ShearView is primarily constructed from off-the-shelf components and operated via custom LabVIEW software. Calibration procedures and feedback algorithms allow for the accurate application of arbitrary stress or strain waveforms in both linear and nonlinear regimes. We validate the instrument against a commercial rheometer (Anton Paar MCR 702e), demonstrating excellent agreement in frequency sweeps performed in the linear viscoelastic regime and large-amplitude oscillatory shear for the materials and frequency ranges tested here. In addition, we implement non-standard rheological protocols such as chirped oscillations and recovery rheology. We further illustrate the system capabilities through synchronized imaging during echo and shear-cessation protocols, highlighting its potential to link bulk rheological response with underlying microscopic dynamics. All hardware designs, control software, and example datasets are freely available to facilitate reuse, customization, and educational deployment.</description>

      <title>Translation Groups for arbitrary Gauge Fields in Synthetic Crystals with real hopping amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cayley-crystals introduced in [F. R. Lux and E. Prodan, Annales Henri Poincar\'e 25(8), 3563 (2024)] are a class of synthetic lattices whose Hamiltonians are symmetric under the simply transitive action of a generic discrete group G. We show that these systems naturally realize the generalization of the so-called magnetic translation groups to arbitrary discrete gauge groups. The one-body dynamics mimics that of a particle carrying multiple charges, each experiencing a distinct static gauge-field configuration. The possible types of gauge fields are determined by the irreducible representations of the commutator subgroup C of G, while the Wilson-loop configurations - which need not be homogeneous - are fixed by the embedding of C in G. We analyze in depth the role of other subgroups in shaping both the lattice geometry and the dynamics. For engineering relevance, we discuss a theorem that constructs all Cayley-crystals for a given abelian gauge group, and we provide two-dimensional examples corresponding to crystals threaded by inhomogeneous magnetic fluxes. Moreover, Cayley-crystals can be realized with only real hopping amplitudes and in scalable geometries that can fit higher-than-3D dynamics, enabling experimental exploration and eventual exploitation in metamaterials, cQED, and other synthetic platforms.</description>

      <title>Quadrupolar gyration of a Brownian particle in a confining ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a minimal theoretical model that reveals a structured steady-state flux field with four alternating local circulation, a phenomenon we refer to as quadrupolar gyration. A passive Brownian particle is confined to move in a ring-shaped trap and driven far from equilibrium solely by anisotropic thermal fluctuations from two orthogonal heat baths held at different temperatures. By breaking detailed balance, this fundamental temperature anisotropy induces a robust nonequilibrium steady state characterized by probability currents of the particle's motion. Remarkably, these currents self-organize into a distinctive quadrupolar vortex pattern, providing a clear signature of emergent symmetry breaking, irreversible entropy production, and coherent motion in minimal passive systems.</description>

      <title>Influence of attractive parts of interaction potentials on critical point parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how microscopic features of interparticle potentials influence macroscopic critical point parameters. Our analytical calculations are based on the cell model for continuous many-particle systems. We explore two types of pair interactions described by the Morse potential and a Curie-Weiss-type potential. For Morse fluids, we present numerical results obtained with microscopic parameters corresponding to the alkali metals sodium (Na) and potassium (K). The calculated dimensionless critical point parameters for liquid Na and K, expressed in dimensional units, allow for direct comparison with available experimental and simulation data. For the Curie-Weiss cell model with competing interactions, which exhibits a sequence of first-order phase transitions, we examine the critical parameters for the first three critical points. We analyze our results by varying the attractive part of the Morse potential and the Curie-Weiss attraction strength, providing insights into how these microscopic characteristics change critical point coordinates.</description>

      <title>Quantitative evaluation of methods to analyze motion changes in single-particle experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of live-cell single-molecule imaging experiments can reveal valuable information about the heterogeneity of transport processes and interactions between cell components. These characteristics are seen as motion changes in the particle trajectories. Despite the existence of multiple approaches to carry out this type of analysis, no objective assessment of these methods has been performed so far. Here, we report the results of a competition to characterize and rank the performance of these methods when analyzing the dynamic behavior of single molecules. To run this competition, we implemented a software library that simulates realistic data corresponding to widespread diffusion and interaction models, both in the form of trajectories and videos obtained in typical experimental conditions. The competition constitutes the first assessment of these methods, providing insights into the current limitations of the field, fostering the development of new approaches, and guiding researchers to identify optimal tools for analyzing their experiments.</description>

      <title>Theory of Microphase Separation in Elastomers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by recent experiments, we present a phase-field model of microphase separation in an elastomer swollen with a solvent. The imbalance between the molecular scale of demixing and the mesoscopic scale beyond which elasticity operates produces effective long-range interactions, forming stable finite-sized domains. Our predictions concerning the dependence of the domain size and transition temperature on the stiffness of the elastomer are in good agreement with the experiments. Analytical phase diagrams, aided by numerical findings, capture the richness of the microphase morphologies, paving the way to create stable, patterned elastomers for various applications.</description>

      <title>Random packing fraction of binary hyperspheres with small or large size difference: a geometric approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16005v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The random packing fraction of binary particles in D-dimensional Euclidean space R^D is studied using a geometric approach. First, the binary packing fraction of assemblies with small size difference are studied, using the excluded volume model by Onsager for particles in three-dimensional space (D = 3). According to this model the packing increase by bidispersity is proportional to (1 - f)(u^D - 1)^2, with f as monosized packing fraction, u as size ratio and D as space dimension. The model predictions are compared with computational results for disks in two dimensions (D = 2) and hyperspheres in the large-dimension limit (D to infinity), yielding good agreement. Subsequently, the packing of hyperspheres with large size difference is modeled, employing the classic theory of Furnas. This theory, developed for three dimensions, starts from an infinite size ratio of larger and smaller particles (u to infinity). Here, the pertaining equations are applied to hyperspheres, and successfully compared with computational results for hyperspheres in the large-dimension limit. Furthermore, an asymptotic approximation of the binary packing fraction for large size ratio is derived, which shows that the first order variation of the Furnas packing fraction (u^-1 = 0) is proportional to (2 - f)u^-1. Finally, a scaled D-dimensional binary packing graph is presented, governing a simplified phase diagram that borders the binary random packing fraction of amorphous assemblies. To summarize, basic space-filling and geometric (athermal) theories on simple hard spheres appear to be a valuable tool for the study of hyperspheres packing and amorphization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topology is an important determinant of the behavior of a great number of condensed-matter systems, but until recently has played a minor role in elasticity. We develop a theory for the deformations of a class of twisted non-Euclidean sheets which have a symmetry based on the celebrated Bonnet isometry. We show that non-orientability is an obstruction to realizing the symmetry globally, and induces a geometric phase that captures a memory analogous to a previously identified one in 2D metamaterials. However, we show that orientable ribbons can also obstruct realizing the symmetry globally. This new obstruction is mediated by how the unit normal vector winds around the centerline of the ribbon, and provides conditions for constructing soft modes of deformation compatible with the topology of multiply-twisted connected ribbons.</description>

      <title>Lattice-dependent orientational order in active crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Via mechanisms not accessible at equilibrium, self-propelled particles can form phases with positional order, such as crystals, and with orientational order, such as polar flocks. However, the interplay between these two types of order remains relatively unexplored. Here, we address this point by studying crystals of active particles that turn either towards or away from each other, which can be experimentally realised with phoretic or Janus colloids or with elastically-coupled walker robots. We show that, depending on how these interactions vary with interparticle distance, the particles align along directions determined by the underlying crystalline lattice. To explain the results, we map the orientational dynamics of the active crystal onto a lattice of spins that interact via (anti-)ferromagnetic alignment with each other plus nematic alignment with the lattice directions. Our findings indicate that orientational and positional order can be strongly coupled in active crystals, thus suggesting strategies to control orientational order by engineering the underlying crystalline lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rubber friction is of major practical importance in applications such as tires, rubber seals, and footwear. This review article focuses on the theory and experimental studies of rubber friction on substrates with random roughness. We examine both steady sliding and accelerated motion, with particular attention to the origins of the breakloose friction force and the influence of pre-slip, elasticity, and flash temperature on friction dynamics. We further discuss rolling friction for cylinders and spheres, as well as sliding friction for triangular sliders on dry and lubricated rubber surfaces. Theoretical predictions are compared with experimental results obtained using different materials, geometries, and environmental conditions, highlighting the importance of accounting for multiscale roughness. Open challenges, such as the role of adhesion enhancement, energy dissipation due to crack opening, and the physical origin of the short-distance roughness cut-off, are discussed.</description>
