      <title>TESS Investigation -- Demographics of Young Exoplanets (TI-DYE) II: a second giant planet in the 17-Myr system HIP 67522</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The youngest ($&lt;$50 Myr) planets are vital to understand planet formation and early evolution. The 17 Myr system HIP 67522 is already known to host a giant ($\simeq$10$R_\oplus$) planet on a tight orbit. In the discovery paper, Rizzuto et al. 2020 reported a tentative single transit detection of an additional planet in the system using TESS. Here, we report the discovery of HIP 67522 c which matches with that single transit event. We confirm the signal with ground-based multi-wavelength photometry from Sinistro and MuSCAT4. At a period of 14.33 days, planet c is close to a 2:1 mean motion resonance with b (6.96 days or 2.06:1). The light curve shows distortions during many of the transits, which are consistent with spot crossing events and/or flares. Fewer stellar activity events are seen in the transits of planet b, suggesting that planet c is crossing a more active latitude. Such distortions, combined with systematics in the TESS light curve extraction, likely explain why planet c was previously missed.</description>

      <title>Resonant and Ultra-short-period Planet Systems are at Opposite Ends of the Exoplanet Age Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanet systems are thought to evolve on secular timescales over billions of years. This evolution is impossible to directly observe on human timescales in most individual systems. While the availability of accurate and precise age inferences for individual exoplanet host stars with ages $\tau$ in the interval $1~\text{Gyr}\lesssim~\tau~\lesssim10~\text{Gyr}$ would constrain this evolution, accurate and precise age inferences are difficult to obtain for isolated field dwarfs like the host stars of most exoplanets. The Galactic velocity dispersion of a thin disk stellar population monotonically grows with time, and the relationship between age and velocity dispersion in a given Galactic location can be calibrated by a stellar population for which accurate and precise age inferences are possible. Using a sample of subgiants with precise age inferences, we calibrate the age--velocity dispersion relation in the Kepler field. Applying this relation to the Kepler field's planet populations, we find that Kepler-discovered systems plausibly in second-order mean-motion resonances have $1~\text{Gyr}\lesssim~\tau~\lesssim2~\text{Gyr}$. The same is true for systems plausibly in first-order mean-motion resonances, but only for systems likely affected by tidal dissipation inside their innermost planets. These observations suggest that many planetary systems diffuse away from initially resonant configurations on secular timescales. Our calibrated relation also indicates that ultra-short-period (USP) planet systems have typical ages in the interval $5~\text{Gyr}\lesssim~\tau~\lesssim6~\text{Gyr}$. We propose that USP planets tidally migrated from initial periods in the range $1~\text{d}\lesssim~P~\lesssim2~\text{d}$ to their observed locations at $P&lt;1~\text{d}$ over billions of years and trillions of cycles of secular eccentricity excitation and inside-planet damping.</description>

      <title>FAUST XVII: Super deuteration in the planet forming system IRS 63 where the streamer strikes the disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations suggest that planets formation starts early, in protostellar disks of $\le10^5$ yrs, which are characterized by strong interactions with the environment, e.g., through accretion streamers and molecular outflows. To investigate the impact of such phenomena on disk physical and chemical properties it is key to understand what chemistry planets inherit from their natal environment. In the context of the ALMA Large Program Fifty AU STudy of the chemistry in the disk/envelope system of Solar-like protostars (FAUST), we present observations on scales from ~1500 au to ~60 au of H$_2$CO, HDCO, and D$_2$CO towards the young planet-forming disk IRS~63. H$_2$CO probes the gas in the disk as well as in a large scale streamer (~1500 au) impacting onto the South-East (SE) disk side. We detect for the first time deuterated formaldehyde, HDCO and D$_2$CO, in a planet-forming disk, and HDCO in the streamer that is feeding it. This allows us to estimate the deuterium fractionation of H$_2$CO in the disk: [HDCO]/[H$_2$CO]$\sim0.1-0.3$ and [D$_2$CO]/[H$_2$CO]$\sim0.1$. Interestingly, while HDCO follows the H$_2$CO distribution in the disk and in the streamer, the distribution of D$_2$CO is highly asymmetric, with a peak of the emission (and [D]/[H] ratio) in the SE disk side, where the streamer crashes onto the disk. In addition, D$_2$CO is detected in two spots along the blue- and red-shifted outflow. This suggests that: (i) in the disk, HDCO formation is dominated by gas-phase reactions similarly to H$_2$CO, while (ii) D$_2$CO was mainly formed on the grain mantles during the prestellar phase and/or in the disk itself, and is at present released in the gas-phase in the shocks driven by the streamer and the outflow. These findings testify on the key role of streamers in the build-up of the disk both concerning the final mass available for planet formation and its chemical composition.</description>

      <title>MINDS. The DR Tau disk II: probing the hot and cold H$_2$O reservoirs in the JWST-MIRI spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MRS mode of the JWST-MIRI instrument gives insights into the chemical richness and complexity of the inner regions of planet-forming disks. Here, we analyse the H$_2$O-rich spectrum of the compact disk DR Tau. We probe the excitation conditions of the H$_2$O transitions observed in different wavelength regions across the entire spectrum using LTE slab models, probing both the rovibrational and rotational transitions. These regions suggest a radial temperature gradient, as the excitation temperature (emitting radius) decreases (increases) with increasing wavelength. To explain the derived emitting radii, we require a larger inclination for the inner disk (i~20-23 degrees) compared to the outer disk (i~5 degrees), agreeing with our previous analysis on CO. We also analyse the pure rotational spectrum (&lt;10 micron) using a large, structured disk (CI Tau) as a template, confirming the presence of the radial gradient, and by fitting multiple components to further characterise the radial and vertical temperature gradients present in the spectrum. At least three temperature components (T~180-800 K) are required to reproduce the rotational spectrum of H$_2$O arising from the inner ~0.3-8 au. These components describe a radial temperature gradient that scales roughly as ~R$^{-0.5}$ in the emitting layers. As the H$_2$O is mainly optically thick, we derive a lower limit on the abundance ratio of H$_2$O/CO~0.17, suggesting a potential depletion of H$_2$O. Similarly to previous work, we detect a cold H$_2$O component (T~180 K) originating from near the snowline. We cannot conclude if an enhancement of the H$_2$O reservoir is observed following radial drift. A consistent analysis of a larger sample of compact disks is necessary to study the importance of drift in enhancing the H$_2$O abundances.</description>

      <title>Irregular Fixation: I. Fixed points and librating orbits of the Brown Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In hierarchical triple systems, the inner binary is slowly perturbed by a distant companion, giving rise to large-scale oscillations in eccentricity and inclination, known as von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) oscillations. Stable systems with a mild hierarchy, where the period ratio is not too small, require an additional corrective term, known as the Brown Hamiltonian, to adequately account for their long-term evolution. Although the Brown Hamiltonian has been used to accurately describe the highly eccentric systems on circulating orbits where the periapse completes a complete revolution, the analysis near its elliptical fixed points had been overlooked. We derive analytically the modified fixed points including the Brown Hamiltonian and analyse its librating orbits (where the periapse motion is limited in range). We compare our result to the direct three-body integrations of millions of orbits and discuss the regimes of validity. We numerically discover the regions of orbital instability, allowed and forbidden librating zones with a complex, fractal, structure. The retrograde orbits, where the mutual inclination is $\iota &gt; 90\ \rm deg$, are more stable and allowed to librate for larger areas of the parameter space. We find numerical fits for the librating-circulating boundary. Finally, we discuss the astrophysical implications for systems of satellites, stars and compact objects. In a companion paper (paper II), we apply our formalism to the orbits of irregular satellites around giant planets.</description>

      <title>Irregular Fixation II: The orbits of irregular satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Irregular satellites (IS) are believed to have been captured during the Solar system's dynamical history and provide clues for the Solar system's formation and evolution. IS occupy a large fraction of the Hill sphere of their host planet and their orbits are highly perturbed by the Sun. Nevertheless, the phase portrait is much better described by the Brown Hamiltonian for all satellites. We use a novel formalism developed in paper I to characterise their orbits in terms of an effective secular Hamiltonian (the Brown Hamiltonian) that accounts for their large orbital separations. We find that prograde satellites generally follow the Brown Hamiltonian, while retrograde satellites (which extend further) deviate more significantly. We construct a semi-analytic criterion that predicts the librating orbit based on the effective energy due to the Brown Hamiltonian. We also check our results with highly accurate N-body integrations of satellite orbits, where initial conditions are loaded directly from the updated ephemeris from the NASA Horizons database. Although the retrograde librating orbits occupy more area in the parameter space, the vast majority of librating IS are prograde. Using our method we find $13$ librating satellites, $8$ of them previously known to librate, and the rest shown to librate for the first time. Further observations of existing and new satellites could shed more light on the dynamical history of the Solar system and satellite formation and test our results.</description>

      <title>Abundance, Sizes, and Major Element Compositions of Components in CR and LL Chondrites: Formation from Single Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abundances, apparent sizes, and individual chemical compositions of chondrules, refractory inclusions, other objects and surrounding matrix have been determined for Semarkona (LL3.00) and Renazzo (CR2) using consistent methods and criteria on x-ray element intensity maps. These represent the non-carbonaceous (NC, Semarkona) and carbonaceous chondrite (CC, Renazzo) superclans of chondrite types. We compare object and matrix abundances with similar data for CM, CO, K, and CV chondrites. We assess, pixel-by-pixel, the major element abundance in each object and in the entire matrix. We determine the abundance of "metallic chondrules" in LL chondrites. Chondrules with high Mg/Si and low Fe/Si and matrix carrying opposing ratios complement each other to make whole rocks with near-solar major element ratios in Renazzo. Similar Mg/Si and Fe/Si chondrule-matrix relationships are seen in Semarkona, which is within 11% of solar Mg/Si but significantly Fe-depleted. These results provide a robust constraint in support of single-reservoir models for chondrule formation and accretion, ruling out whole classes of astrophysical models and constraining processes of chondrite component formation and accretion into chondrite parent bodies.</description>

      <title>Comparison of optical spectra between asteroids Ryugu and Bennu: II. High-precision analysis for space weathering trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of space weathering on the observed spectra of C-complex asteroids remains uncertain. This has long hindered our understanding of their composition through telescope observations. Multi-band imaging of Ryugu by ONC-T on Hayabusa2 and that of Bennu by MapCam on OSIRIS-REx found opposite spectral trends of space weathering; Ryugu darkened/reddened while Bennu brightened/blued. How the spectra of Ryugu and Bennu evolved relative to each other would place a constraint for understanding their origins and evolutions. In this study, we compared the space weathering trends on Ryugu and Bennu by applying the results of cross calibration between ONC-T and MapCam. We show that the average Bennu surface is brighter by 18.0 $\pm$ 1.5% at 550 nm and bluer by 0.18 $\pm$ 0.03 $\mu$m$^{-1}$ (480-850 nm slope) than Ryugu. The spectral slopes of surface materials are more uniform on Bennu than on Ryugu at spatial scales $\gtrsim$1 m, but Bennu is more heterogeneous at $\lesssim$1 m. This suggests that lateral mixing due to resurfacing may have been more efficient on Bennu. The reflectance-spectral slope distributions of craters on Ryugu and Bennu appeared to follow two trend lines with an offset before cross calibration, but they converged to a single straight trend without a bend after cross calibration. We show that the spectra of the freshest craters on Ryugu and Bennu are indistinguishable within the uncertainty of cross calibration. These results suggest that Ryugu and Bennu initially had similar spectra before space weathering and that they evolved in completely opposite directions along the same trend line, subsequently evolving into asteroids with different disk-averaged spectra. These findings further suggest that space weathering likely expanded the spectral slope variation of C-complex asteroids, implying that they may have formed from materials with more uniform spectral slopes.</description>

      <title>A deep analysis for New Horizons' KBO search images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observation datasets acquired by the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) on the Subaru Telescope for NASA's New Horizons mission target search were analyzed through a method devised by JAXA. The method makes use of Field Programmable Gate arrays and was originally used to detect fast-moving objects such as space debris or near-Earth asteroids. Here we present an application of the method to detect slow-moving Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) in the New Horizons target search observations. A cadence that takes continuous images of one HSC field of view for half a night fits the method well. The observations for the New Horizons Kuiper Belt Extended Mission (NH/KEM) using HSC began in May 2020, and are ongoing. Here we show our result of the analysis of the dataset acquired from May 2020 through June 2021 that have already passed the proprietary period and are open to the public. We detected 84 KBO candidates in the June 2020 and June 2021 datasets, when the observation field was close to opposition.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Machine Learning Approach for Detecting Albedo Anomalies on the Lunar Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a data-driven approach using machine learning (ML) techniques to explore and predict albedo anomalies on the Moon's surface. The research leverages diverse planetary datasets, including high-spatial-resolution albedo maps and element maps (LPFe, LPK, LPTh, LPTi) derived from laser and gamma-ray measurements. The primary objective is to identify relationships between chemical elements and albedo, thereby expanding our understanding of planetary surfaces and offering predictive capabilities for areas with incomplete datasets. To bridge the gap in resolution between the albedo and element maps, we employ Gaussian blurring techniques, including an innovative adaptive Gaussian blur. Our methodology culminates in the deployment of an Extreme Gradient Boosting Regression Model, optimized to predict full albedo based on elemental composition. Furthermore, we present an interactive analytical tool to visualize prediction errors, delineating their spatial and chemical characteristics. The findings not only pave the way for a more comprehensive understanding of the Moon's surface but also provide a framework for similar studies on other celestial bodies.</description>

      <title>A novel metric for assessing climatological surface habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary surface habitability has so far been, in the main, considered in its entirety. The increasing popularity of 3D modelling studies of (exo)planetary climate has highlighted the need for a new measure of surface habitability. Combining the observed thermal limits of modern Earth-based life with surface water fluxes, we introduce such a measure which can be calculated from the climatological outputs from general circulation model simulations. In particular, we pay attention to not only the thermal bounds of macroscopic complex life, but additionally the limits of microbial and extremophilic life which have been vital to the generation of Earth's own biosignatures. This new metric is validated on Earth, using ERA5 reanalysis data to predict the distribution of surface habitability which is compared to the observed habitability generated from satellite-derived data of photosynthetic life. The validation against observed habitability is additionally repeated for a selection of other defined metrics of surface habitability, allowing for the first time a comparison of metric performance with respect to Earth-based surface life, finding that future climatologically-based metric definitions should include both conditions for temperature and water/nutrient availability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the interiors of the outer planets is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of our planetary system, and provides key knowledge on the origin of the solar system, the behavior of materials at extreme conditions, the relation between the planetary interior and atmosphere, and exoplanet characterization. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the interiors and atmospheres of the giant planets in the solar system: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. We describe the principles of interior structure and evolution models and discuss the link between the planetary atmospheres and deep interiors. We summarize the current understanding of the bulk compositions and internal structures of the outer planets and the remaining future challenges.</description>

Abstract: We present the first prediction for the mass distribution function of Galactic free-floating planets (FFPs) that aims to accurately include the relative contributions of multiple formation pathways and stellar populations. We derive our predicted distribution from dedicated simulations of planet birth, growth, migration, and ejection around circumbinary systems and extend these results to also include the contributions from single and wide binary systems. Our resulting FFP mass distribution shows several distinct features, including a strong peak at $\sim 8 M_{\oplus}$ arising from the transition between pebble and gas accretion regimes and a trough at $\sim 1 M_{\oplus}$ due to the shift in the dominant ejection process from planet-planet scattering to ejection through interactions with stars in circumbinary systems. We find that interactions with the central binary in close circumbinary systems are likely the dominant progenitor for FFPs more massive than Earth, leading to a steep power-law dependence in mass that agrees well with existing observations. In contrast, we find planet-planet scattering events in single and wide binary systems likely produce the majority of planets at Mars mass and below, resulting in a shallower power-law dependence. Our results suggest that existing extrapolations into the sub-terrestrial mass range may significantly overestimate the true FFP abundance. The features we predict in the mass distribution of FFPs will be detectable by upcoming space-based microlensing surveys and, if observed, will provide key insight into the origins of FFPs and the environments in which they form.</description>

      <title>Argon in beta Pictoris -- entrapment and release of volatile in disks</title>

Abstract: Chemical compositions of planets reveal much about their formation environments. Such information is well sought-after in studies of Solar System bodies and extra-solar ones. Here, we investigate the composition of planetesimals in the beta Pic debris disk, by way of its secondary gas disk. We are stimulated by the recent JWST detection of an Ar II emission line, and aim to reproduce extensive measurements from the past four decades. Our photo-ionization model reveals that the gas has to be heavily enriched in C, N, O, and Ar (but not S and P), by a uniform factor of about 100 relative to other metals. Such an abundance pattern is both reminiscent of, and different from, that of Jupiter's atmosphere. The fact that Ar, the most volatile and therefore the hardest to capture into solids, is equally enriched as C/N/O suggests that the planetesimals were formed in a very cold region (T &lt; 35K) with abundant water ice. In the debris disk phase, these volatile are preferentially outgassed from the dust grains, likely via photo-desorption. The debris grains must be 'dirty' aggregates of icy and refractory clusters. Lastly, the observed strength of the Ar II line can only be explained if the star beta Pic (a young A6V star) has sizable chromospheric and coronal emissions, on par with those from the modern Sun. In summary, observations of the beta Pic gas disk rewind the clock to reveal the formation environment of planetesimals.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of the Warm-Jupiter TOI-1130 system with CHEOPS and photo-dynamical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the thousands of exoplanets discovered to date, approximately a few hundred gas giants on short-period orbits are classified as "lonely" and only a few are in a multi-planet system with a smaller companion on a close orbit. The processes that formed multi-planet systems hosting gas giants on close orbits are poorly understood, and only a few examples of this kind of system have been observed and well characterised. Within the contest of multi-planet system hosting gas-giant on short orbits, we characterise TOI-1130 system by measuring masses and orbital parameters. This is a 2-transiting planet system with a Jupiter-like planet (c) on a 8.35 days orbit and a Neptune-like planet (b) on an inner (4.07 days) orbit. Both planets show strong anti-correlated transit timing variations (TTVs). Furthermore, radial velocity (RV) analysis showed an additional linear trend, a possible hint of a non-transiting candidate planet on a far outer orbit. Since 2019, extensive transit and radial velocity observations of the TOI-1130 have been acquired using TESS and various ground-based facilities. We present a new photo-dynamical analysis of all available transit and RV data, with the addition of new CHEOPS and ASTEP+ data that achieve the best precision to date on the planetary radii and masses and on the timings of each transit. We were able to model interior structure of planet b constraining the presence of a gaseous envelope of H/He, while it was not possible to assess the possible water content. Furthermore, we analysed the resonant state of the two transiting planets, and we found that they lie just outside the resonant region. This could be the result of the tidal evolution that the system underwent. We obtained both masses of the planets with a precision less than 1.5%, and radii with a precision of about 1% and 3% for planet b and c, respectively.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen sulfide and metal-enriched atmosphere for a Jupiter-mass exoplanet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the closest transiting hot Jupiter to Earth, HD 189733b has been the benchmark planet for atmospheric characterization. It has also been the anchor point for much of our theoretical understanding of exoplanet atmospheres from composition, chemistry, aerosols to atmospheric dynamics, escape, and modeling techniques. Prior studies of HD 189733b have detected carbon and oxygen-bearing molecules H2O and CO in the atmosphere. The presence of CO2 and CH4 has been claimed but later disputed. The inferred metallicity based on these measurements, a key parameter in tracing planet formation locations, varies from depletion to enhancement, hindered by limited wavelength coverage and precision of the observations. Here we report detections of H2O (13.4 sigma), CO2 (11.2 sigma), CO (5 sigma), and H2S (4.5 sigma) in the transmission spectrum (2.4-5 micron) of HD 189733b. With an equilibrium temperature of ~1200K, H2O, CO, and H2S are the main reservoirs for oxygen, carbon, and sulfur. Based on the measured abundances of these three major volatile elements, we infer an atmospheric metallicity of 3-5 times stellar. The upper limit on the methane abundance at 5 sigma is 0.1 ppm which indicates a low carbon-to-oxygen ratio (&lt;0.2), suggesting formation through the accretion of water-rich icy planetesimals. The low oxygen-to-sulfur and carbon-to-sulfur ratios also support the planetesimal accretion formation pathway.</description>

      <title>Inevitable Endgame of Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS (C/2023 A3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hopes are being widely expressed that C/2023 A3 could become a naked-eye object about the time of its perihelion passage in late 2024. However, based on its past and current performance, the comet is expected to disintegrate before reaching perihelion. Independent lines of evidence point to its forthcoming inevitable collapse. The first issue, which was recently called attention to by I. Ferrin, is this Oort cloud comet's failure to brighten at a heliocentric distance exceeding 2 AU, about 160 days preperihelion, accompanied by a sharp drop in the production of dust (Af\rho). Apparent over a longer period of time, but largely ignored, has been the barycentric original semimajor axis inching toward negative numbers and the mean residual increasing after the light-curve anomaly, suggesting a fragmented nucleus whose motion is being affected a nongravitational acceleration; and an unusually narrow, teardrop dust tail with its peculiar orientation, implying copious emission of large grains far from the Sun but no microscopic material recently. This evidence suggests that the comet has entered an advanced phase of fragmentation, in which increasing numbers of dry, fractured refractory solids stay assembled in dark, porous blobs of exotic shape, becoming undetectable as they gradually disperse in space.</description>

      <title>The Radio Continuum Source Projected Near HR 8799</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HR 8799 is an A5/F0 V star where exoplanets were first directly imaged. Four exoplanets were found within $\simeq 2\rlap.{''}0$ from the star. Here we report the VLA detection of a faint (19.1$\pm$2.7 $\mu$Jy) radio continuum (3.0 GHz) source projected at $\simeq 2\rlap.{''}2$ from the star. The \sl a priori \rm probability of finding a background source with this flux density within a radius of $2\rlap.{''}2$ is only 0.0046. However, the astrometry made with the VLA and ALMA images, separated by 5.5 years, indicates no significant proper motions and rules out the association of the radio source with the HR 8799 system and suggests it is a background millimeter galaxy with dust emission in the millimeter and partially thick synchrotron emission in the centimeter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.03748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for Life in the Universe generally assumes three basic life's needs: I) building block elements (i.e., CHNOPS), II) a solvent to life's reactions (generally, liquid water) and III) a thermodynamic disequilibrium. It is assumed that similar requirements might be universal in the Cosmos. On our planet, life is able to harvest energy from a wide array of thermodynamic disequilibria, generally in the form of redox disequilibrium. The amount of different redox couples used by living systems has been estimated to be in the range of several thousands of reactions. Each of these energy yielding reactions requires specialised proteins called oxidoreductases, that have one or more metal cofactors acting as catalytic centres to exchange electrons. These metals are de facto the key component of the engines that life uses to tap into the thermodynamic disequilibria needed to fuel metabolism. The availability of these transition metals is not uniform in the Universe, and it is a function of the distribution (in time and space) of complex dynamics. Despite this, Life's need for specific metals to access thermodynamic disequilibria has been so far completely overlooked in identifying astrobiological targets. We argue that the availability of at least some transition elements appears to be an essential feature of habitability, and should be considered a primary requisite in selecting exoplanetary targets in the search for life.</description>

      <title>Rebuilding the Habitable Zone from the Bottom Up with Computational Zones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computation, if treated as a set of physical processes that act on information represented by states of matter, encompasses biological systems, digital systems, and other constructs, and may be a fundamental measure of living systems. The opportunity for biological computation, represented in the propagation and selection-driven evolution of information-carrying organic molecular structures, has been partially characterized in terms of planetary habitable zones based on primary conditions such as temperature and the presence of liquid water. A generalization of this concept to computational zones is proposed, with constraints set by three principal characteristics: capacity (including computation rates), energy, and instantiation (or substrate, including spatial extent). Computational zones naturally combine traditional habitability factors, including those associated with biological function that incorporate the chemical milieu, constraints on nutrients and free energy, as well as element availability. Two example applications are presented by examining the fundamental thermodynamic work efficiency and Landauer limit of photon-driven biological computation on planetary surfaces and of generalized computation in stellar energy capture structures (a.k.a. Dyson structures). It is suggested that computational zones involving nested structures or substellar objects could manifest unique observational signatures as cool far-infrared emitters. While these latter scenarios are entirely hypothetical, they offer a useful, complementary, introduction to the potential universality of computational zones.</description>

      <title>The Resident Space Objects Network: a complex system approach for shaping space sustainability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14795v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near-Earth space continues to be the focus of critical services and capabilities provided to the society. With the steady increase of space traffic, the number of Resident Space Objects (RSOs) has recently boomed in the context of growing concern due to space debris. The need of a holistic and unified approach for addressing orbital collisions, assess the global in-orbit risk, and define sustainable practices for space traffic management has emerged as a major societal challenge. Here, we introduce and discuss a versatile framework rooted on the use of the complex network paradigm to introduce a novel risk index for space sustainability criteria. With an entirely data-driven, but flexible, formulation, we introduce the Resident Space Object Network (RSONet) by connecting RSOs that experience near-collisions events over a finite-time window. The structural collisional properties of RSOs are thus encoded into the RSONet and analysed with the tools of network science. We formulate a geometrical index highlighting the key role of specific RSOs in building up the risk of collisions with respect to the rest of the population. Practical applications based on Two-Line Elements and Conjunction Data Message databases are presented.</description>

      <title>Infrared-Radio-follow-up Observations for Detection of the Magnetic Radio Emission of Extra-Solar Planets: A New Window to Detect Exoplanets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are several methods for indirectly detecting exoplanets, such as transit, radial velocity, astrometry, and the conventional gravitational microlensing approach. These methods rely on observing the effects of exoplanets on the emission or motion of observed stars. All these techniques have focused on the optical or infrared domains. However, an alternative method for exoplanet detection via microlensing events involves planets orbiting the source star, creating a binary source system. In this study, we explore a novel approach to detecting and studying exoplanets exclusively through their radio emissions resulting from magnetospheric processes. We propose utilizing the Roman telescope as a survey observer to detect microlensing events. Subsequently, we investigate the potential for detecting planetary radio signals through follow-up observations of these microlensing events in the radio band using the SKA telescope. This method is viable due to the comparable radio emission levels of exoplanets and their parent stars, unlike optical and infrared emissions. We conduct a Monte Carlo simulation to replicate the observations by the Nancy Roman Telescope, followed by a follow-up observation in radio frequencies using the SKA telescope. We determine that approximately 1317 exoplanets exhibit detectable signals by the SKA telescope during the 7-season observations by the Nancy Roman Telescope. This result indicates that such a method cannot only facilitate the direct detection of exoplanets but also enable the measurement of their magnetic field strength through analysis of their radio emissions.</description>

      <title>Artificial Greenhouse Gases as Exoplanet Technosignatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atmospheric pollutants such as CFCs and NO$_{2}$ have been proposed as potential remotely detectable atmospheric technosignature gases. Here we investigate the potential for artificial greenhouse gases including CF$_{4}$, C$_{2}$F$_{6}$, C$_{3}$F$_{8}$, SF$_{6}$, and NF$_{3}$ to generate detectable atmospheric signatures. In contrast to passive incidental byproducts of industrial processes, artificial greenhouse gases would represent an intentional effort to change the climate of a planet with long-lived, low toxicity gases and would possess low false positive potential. An extraterrestrial civilization may be motivated to undertake such an effort to arrest a predicted snowball state on their home world or to terraform an otherwise uninhabitable terrestrial planet within their system. Because artificial greenhouse gases strongly absorb in the thermal mid-infrared window of temperate atmospheres, a terraformed planet will logically possess strong absorption features from these gases at mid-IR wavelengths ($\sim$8-12 $\mu$m), possibly accompanied by diagnostic features in the near-IR. As a proof of concept, we calculate the needed observation time to detect 1 [10](100) ppm of C$_{2}$F$_{6}$/C$_{3}$F$_{8}$/SF$_{6}$ on TRAPPIST-1f with JWST MIRI/LRS and NIRSpec. We find that a combination of 1[10](100) ppm each of C$_{2}$F$_{6}$, C$_{3}$F$_{8}$, and SF$_{6}$ can be detected with an S/N $\geq$ 5 in as few as 25[10](5) transits with MIRI/LRS. We further explore mid-infrared direct-imaging scenarios with the LIFE mission concept and find these gases are more detectable than standard biosignatures at these concentrations. Consequently, artificial greenhouse gases can be readily detected (or excluded) during normal planetary characterization observations with no additional overhead.</description>

      <title>Time transformation between the solar system barycenter and the surfaces of the Earth and Moon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transformation of time between the surface of the Earth, the solar system barycenter, and the surface of the Moon involves relativistic corrections. For solar system Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB), we also require that there be no rate difference between Terrestrial Time (TT) and TDB. The IAU has addressed these transformations with several resolutions. A series of robotic and crewed landings on the Moon are planned. The analogous transformation between TDB and time on the surface of the Moon (TL) needs a review and discussion. In this paper, we compute the rate terms involved in that transformation. We also present the TDB-compatible spatial scale and Lorentz contraction of Moon-centered positional coordinates. These transformations have been implemented in the JPL programs used to generate ephemerides of the Moon and planets. Finally, we provide expressions that can be used to synchronize TT and TL using either TDB or TT. The relevant transformations contain a small secular drift between the two time scales, along with additional small periodic terms that can be numerically evaluated using the solar system and lunar ephemerides.</description>

Abstract: In the era of space exploration, coronal holes on the sun play a significant role due to their impact on satellites and aircraft through their open magnetic fields and increased solar wind emissions. This study employs computer vision techniques to detect coronal hole regions and estimate their sizes using imagery from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Additionally, we utilize deep learning methods, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to analyze trends in the area of coronal holes and predict their areas across various solar regions over a span of seven days. By examining time series data, we aim to identify patterns in coronal hole behavior and understand their potential effects on space weather. This research enhances our ability to anticipate and prepare for space weather events that could affect Earth's technological systems.</description>

Abstract: Decameter hectometric (DH; 1-14 MHz) type-IV radio bursts are produced by flare-accelerated electrons trapped in post-flare loops or the moving magnetic structures associated with the CMEs. From a space weather perspective, it is important to systematically compile these bursts, explore their spectro-temporal characteristics, and study the associated CMEs. We present a comprehensive catalog of DH type-IV bursts observed by the Radio and Plasma Wave Investigation (WAVES) instruments onboard Wind and STEREO spacecraft, covering the period of white-light CME observations by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) onboard the SOHO mission between November 1996 and May 2023. The catalog has 139 bursts, of which 73% are associated with a fast (&gt;900 km/s) and wide (&gt;60$^o$) CME, with a mean CME speed of 1301 km/s. All DH type-IV bursts are white-light CME-associated, with 78% of the events associated with halo CMEs. The CME source latitudes are within $\pm$45$^o$. 77 events had multi-vantage point observations from different spacecraft, letting us explore the impact of line of sight on the dynamic spectra. For 48 of the 77 events, there was good data from at least two spacecraft. We find that, unless occulted by nearby plasma structures, a type-IV burst is best viewed when observed within $\pm$60$^o$ line of sight. Also, the bursts with a duration above 120 min, have source longitudes within $\pm$60$^o$. Our inferences confirm the inherent directivity in the type-IV emission. Additionally, the catalog forms a sun-as-a-star DH type-IV burst database.</description>
