      <title>Minimizers of the Allen-Cahn energy with sub-quadratic growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish Liouville theorems for global minimizers $u$ of the Allen-Cahn energy $$\int |\nabla u|^2 + W(u) \, dx,$$ which have subquadratic growth at infinity. In particular we extend the results of \cite{S1,S3} concerning the De Giorgi's conjecture to the setting of unbounded solutions. Part of the analysis relies on the regularity of minimizers for a Dirichlet/perimeter functional which was studied by Athanasopoulous-Caffarelli-Kenig-Salsa in \cite{ACKS}.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of solutions to the porous medium equation near conical singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, on a manifold with conical singularities, the geometry of the cross-section is reflected in the solutions to the porous medium equation near the conic points: We prove that the asymptotics of the solutions near the conical points are determined by the spectrum of the Laplacian on the cross-section. The key to this result is a precise description of the maximal domain of the cone Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many self-similar blow-up profiles for the Keller-Segel system in dimensions 3 to 9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the method of matched asymptotic expansions and Banach fixed point theorem, we rigorously construct infinitely many self-similar blow-up profiles for the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system \begin{equation*} \left\{\begin{array}{l} \partial_{t} u=\Delta u-\nabla \cdot\left(u \nabla \Phi_{u}\right), \\ 0=\Delta \Phi_{u}+u,\\ u(\cdot,0)=u_0 \geq 0 \end{array}\quad \text{in}\ \mathbb{R}^{d},\right. \end{equation*} where $d\in \{3,\cdots,9\}$. Our findings demonstrate that the infinitely many backward self-similar profiles approximate the rescaling radial steady-state near the origin (i.e. $0&lt;|x|\ll1$) and $\frac{2(d-2)}{|x|^2}$ at spatial infinity (i.e. $|x|\gg1$). We also establish the convergence of the self-similar blow-up solutions as time tends to the blow-up time $T&gt;0$. Our results can give a refined description of backward self-similar profiles for all $|x|\geq 0$ rather than for $0&lt;|x|\ll1$ or $|x|\gg1$, indicating that the blow-up point is the origin and $$ u(x,t)\sim \frac{1}{|x|^2},\ \ \ x\ne0,\ \text{as}\ t\to T. $$</description>

      <title>Singular flows with time-varying weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mean field limit for singular dynamics with time evolving weights. Our results are an extension of the work of Serfaty \cite{duerinckx2020mean} and Bresch-Jabin-Wang \cite{bresch2019modulated}, which consider singular Coulomb flows with weights which are constant time. The inclusion of time dependent weights necessitates the commutator estimates of \cite{duerinckx2020mean,bresch2019modulated}, as well as a new functional inequality. The well-posedness of the mean field PDE and the associated system of trajectories is also proved.</description>

      <title>Sharp stability for critical points of the Sobolev inequality in the absence of bubbling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When $u$ is close to a single Talenti bubble $v$ of the $p$-Sobolev inequality, we show that
  \begin{equation*}
  \|Du-Dv\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)}^{\max\{1,p-1\}}\le C \|-{\rm div}(|Du|^{p-2}Du)-|u|^{p^*-2}u\|_{W^{-1,q}(\mathbb{R}^n)}, \end{equation*} where $C=C(n,p)&gt;0$. This estimate provides a sharp stability estimate for the Struwe-type decomposition in the single bubble case, generalizing the result of Ciraolo, Figalli, and Maggi \cite{CFM2018} (focusing on the case $p=2$) to the arbitrary $p$. Also, in the Sobolev setting, this answers an open problem raised by Zhou and Zou in \cite[Remark 1.17]{ZZ2023}.</description>

      <title>Absence of blow-up in a fully parabolic chemotaxis system with weak singular sensitivity and logistic damping in dimension two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown in this paper that blow-up does not occur in the following chemotaxis system under homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions in a smooth, open, bounded domain \(\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2\): \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  u_t = \Delta u - \chi \nabla \cdot \left( \frac{u}{v^k} \nabla v \right) + ru - \mu u^2, \qquad &amp;\text{in } \Omega \times (0,T_{\rm max}),
  v_t = \Delta v - \alpha v + \beta u, \qquad &amp;\text{in } \Omega \times (0,T_{\rm max}),
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} where \( k \in (0,1) \), and \(\chi, r, \mu, \alpha, \beta \) are positive parameters. Known results have already established the same conclusion for the parabolic-elliptic case. Here, we complement these findings by extending the result to the fully parabolic case.</description>

      <title>Linear Instability of the Prandtl Equations via Hypergeometric Functions and the Harmonic Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a deep connection between the Prandtl equations linearised around a quadratic shear flow, confluent hypergeometric functions of the first kind, and the Schr\"odinger operator.
  Our first result concerns an ODE and a spectral condition derived in [10], associated with unstable quasi-eigenmodes of the Prandtl equations. We entirely determine the space of solutions in terms of Kummer's functions. By classifying their asymptotic behaviour, we verify that the spectral condition has a unique, explicitly determined pair of eigenvalue and eigenfunction, the latter being expressible as a combination of elementary functions.
  Secondly, we prove that any quasi-eigenmode solution of the linearised Prandtl equations around a quadratic shear flow can be explicitly determined from algebraic eigenfunctions of the Schr\"odinger operator with quadratic potential.
  We show finally that the obtained analytical formulation of the velocity align with previous numerical simulations in the literature.</description>

      <title>The critical Fujita exponent for one-dimensional semilinear heat equations with potentials and space-dependent nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the existence/nonexistence of nontrivial global-in-time solutions to the Cauchy problem \begin{equation}
  \begin{cases}\tag{P}\partial_tu-\partial_x^2u+Vu=(1+x^2)^{-\frac{m}{2}}u^p,&amp;x\in\mathbb{R},\ t&gt;0,\\ u(x,0)=u_0(x)\ge0,&amp;x\in\mathbb{R},
  \end{cases} \end{equation} where $p&gt;1$, $m\ge0$, $u_0\in BC(\mathbb{R})$ and the potential $V=V(x)\in BC(\mathbb{R})$ satisfies a certain property. More precisely, we determine the critical Fujita exponent for (P), that is, the threshold for the global existence/nonexistence of (P).</description>

      <title>Regularity for free boundary surfaces minimizing degenerate area functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an epsilon-regularity theorem at points in the free boundary of almost-minimizers of the energy $\mathrm{Per}_{w}(E)=\int_{\partial^*E}w\,\mathrm{d} {\mathscr{H}}^{n-1}$, where $w$ is a weight asymptotic to $d(\cdot,\mathbb{R}^n\setminus\Omega)^a$ near $\partial\Omega$ and $a&gt;0$.
  This implies that the boundaries of almost-minimizers are $C^{1,\gamma_0}$-surfaces that touch $\partial \Omega$ orthogonally, up to a Singular Set $\mathrm{Sing}(\partial E)$ whose Hausdorff dimension satisfies the bound
  $d_{\mathscr{H}}(\mathrm{Sing}(\partial E)) \leq n +a -(5+\sqrt{8})$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate uniqueness of solutions to certain classes of elliptic and parabolic equations posed on metric graphs. In particular, we address the linear Schr\"odinger equation with a potential, and the heat equation with a variable density. We assume suitable growth conditions on the solutions, which are related to the behaviour at infinity of the potential or of the density.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of dissipative solutions to the Hardy-Sobolev parabolic equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long-time behaviour of solutions to the Hardy-Sobolev parabolic equation in critical function spaces for any spatial dimension $d \geq 5$. By employing the Fourier splitting method, we establish precise decay rates for dissipative solutions, meaning those whose critical norm vanishes as time approaches infinity. Our findings offer a deeper understanding of the asymptotic properties and dissipation mechanisms governing this equation.</description>

      <title>The importance of Luis Caffarelli's work in the study of fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we describe the work of Luis Caffarelli in the area of fluid mechanics and related topics. Not only has his work on fluid mechanics been very influential, but many of his contributions that do not directly relate to fluid mechanics, such as his important results on the fractional Laplacian or the regularity of solutions to linear parabolic equations with oscillating coefficients, have been used in the study of fluids in many important ways. Thus, any review of his work has to include his contributions to the general (partial) regularity theory of solutions of Navier-Stokes equations and other studies related to fluid motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish new asymptotic results for the solutions of the second-grade fluids equations and characterize their decay rate in terms of the behavior of the initial data. Moreover, assuming more regularity for the initial data, we study the large-time behavior of these solutions by comparing them to the solutions of the linearized equations. As a consequence, we obtain lower bounds for the solutions. Other auxiliary results of interest are discussed.</description>

      <title>Local and global minimality of level sets in phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the level sets of entire solutions of the Allen-Cahn equation and we prove local and global minimality of the zero level set with respect to certain perimeter functional with density. This provides a direct relationship between phase transition type problems and minimal surfaces with some weight. In particular, we establish that the zero level set of minimizers of the Allen-Cahn equation locally minimizes a perimeter type functional. As an application, we establish the De Giorgi conjecture, proved by O. Savin, by reducing it to a Bernstein type result for anisotropic perimeter functionals obtained by L. Simon, thus directly linking it to the geometric problem.</description>

      <title>Mode stability of blow-up for wave maps in the absence of symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wave maps equation in three spatial dimensions with a spherical target admits an explicit blow-up solution. Numerical studies suggest this solution captures the generic blow-up behaviour in the backward light cone of the singularity. In this work, we establish the mode stability of this blow-up solution in the backward light cone of the blow-up point without any assumptions on the symmetries of the perturbation. We classify all smooth mode solutions for growth rates $\lambda$ with $\mathrm{Re} \, \lambda \geq 0$ and demonstrate that the blow-up solution is stable up to the mode solutions arising from the symmetry group of the wave maps equation. Our proof relies on a decomposition of the linearised wave maps equation into a tractable system of symmetry-equivariant ordinary differential equations (ODEs), utilising the representation theory of the stabiliser of the blow-up solution. We then use the quasi-solution method of Costin-Donninger-Glogi\'{c} to show the absence of non-zero smooth solutions for the resulting system of ODEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the hydrostatic approximation for the 3D Oldroyd-B model. Firstly, we derive the hydrostatic approximate system for this model and prove the global well-posedness of the limit system with small analytic initial data in horizontal variable. Then we justify the hydrostatic limit strictly from the re-scaled Oldroyd-B model to the hydrostatic Oldroyd-B model and obtain the precise convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equations in the Wasserstein Space for the Optimal Control of the Kushner-Stratonovich Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a comparison theorem for viscosity solutions of a new class of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations, which is used to solve the separated problem governed by the K-S equation in the Wasserstein space. A distinctive feature of these HJB equations is the simultaneous presence of variational and Lions derivatives, an inevitable consequence of a nonzero observation function. Moreover, the presence of state-dependent correlated noise adds further complexity to the analysis, making the proof of the comparison theorem more challenging. The core proof strategy for the comparison theorem is to introduce a novel adaptation of the doubling variables argument, specifically tailored to tackle the challenges posed by the Wasserstein space. To this end, we construct an entirely new bivariate functional that combines viscosity sub/supsolutions, a smooth gauge-type function, and two Gaussian regularized entropy penalizations. The gauge-type function compensates for the non-differentiability (in the Lions sense) of the 2-Wasserstein distance, while the entropy penalizations ensure that the maximal point of the functional is well-behaved. Another major contribution of this paper is the derivation of the second-order variational and Lions derivatives of the gauge-type function and entropy functional, which are crucial for dealing with the second-order HJB equation. Meanwhile, the simple structure and pleasing regularity of these derivatives make the methodologies developed in this paper applicable within a wider range of theoretical settings. This paper gives the first result concerning the uniqueness of viscosity solutions for second-order HJB equations with variational derivatives in the Wasserstein space.</description>

      <title>Potential-based versus non potential-based cohesive models accounting for loading and unloading with application to sliding elastic laminates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rigorous unified perspective of cohesive zone models is presented, including and comparing potential-based and non potential-based formulations, and encompassing known examples studied in literature. The main novelty of the work consists in the natural inclusion of loading and unloading effects in a general mixed-mode framework, incorporated through an intrinsic construction of energy densities or tensions. The proposed mathematical investigation identifies and proves the limitations of variational models with respect to non-variational ones, the latter yielding a feasible description of real instances in all relevant situations and regimes. This validates existing empirical and numerical observations. An application to a mechanical process of two elastic laminates sliding one on each other along their cohesive interface is finally analyzed, and existence results in both potential-based and non potential-based versions are obtained, extending previous contributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the fractional dispersion of solutions to the Helmholtz equation with periodic scattering data. We show that, under appropriate rescaling, the interaction between the different frequencies exhibits the same fluctuating behavior as for the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. To achieve this, we first establish an asymptotic fractional uncertainty principle for solutions to the Helmholtz equation.</description>

      <title>Action-Driven Flows for Causal Variational Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce action-driven flows for causal variational principles, being a class of non-convex variational problems emanating from applications in fundamental physics. In the compact setting, H\"older continuous curves of measures are constructed by using the method of minimizing movements. As is illustrated in examples, these curves will in general not have a limit point, due to the non-convexity of the action. This leads us to introducing a novel penalization which ensures the existence of a limit point, giving rise to approximate solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equations. The methods and results are adapted and generalized to the causal action principle in the finite-dimensional case. As an application, we construct a flow of measures for causal fermion systems in the infinite-dimensional situation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the convergence rates of policy iteration (PI) for nonconvex viscous Hamilton--Jacobi equations using a discrete space-time scheme, where both space and time variables are discretized. We analyze the case with an uncontrolled diffusion term, which corresponds to a possibly degenerate viscous Hamilton--Jacobi equation. We first obtain an exponential convergent result of PI for the discrete space-time schemes. We then investigate the discretization error.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Stefan problem on moving hypersurfaces: an approach by a new framework of nonhomogeneous monotonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to establish the well-posedness of the stochastic Stefan problem on moving hypersurfaces. Through a specially designed transformation, it turns out we need to solve stochastic partial differential equations on a fixed hypersurface with a new kind of nonhomogeneous monotonicity involving a family of time-dependent operators. This new class of SPDEs is of independent interest and can also be applied to solve many other interesting models such as the stochastic $p$-Laplacian equations, stochastic Allen-Cahn equation and stochastic heat equations on time-dependent domains or hypersurfaces. (Monotone) Operator-valued calculus and geometric analysis of moving hypersurfaces play important roles in the study. Moreover, a forthcoming result on the well-posedness of stochastic 2D Navier-Stokes equation on moving domains is also based on our framework.</description>

      <title>Derivations and Sobolev functions on extended metric-measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the first-order differential calculus over extended metric-topological measure spaces. The latter are quartets $\mathbb X=(X,\tau,{\sf d},\mathfrak m)$, given by an extended metric space $(X,{\sf d})$ together with a weaker topology $\tau$ (satisfying suitable compatibility conditions) and a finite Radon measure $\mathfrak m$ on $(X,\tau)$. The class of extended metric-topological measure spaces encompasses all metric measure spaces and many infinite-dimensional metric-measure structures, such as abstract Wiener spaces. In this framework, we study the following classes of objects:
  - The Banach algebra ${\rm Lip}_b(X,\tau,{\sf d})$ of bounded $\tau$-continuous ${\sf d}$-Lipschitz functions on $X$.
  - Several notions of Lipschitz derivations on $X$, defined in duality with ${\rm Lip}_b(X,\tau,{\sf d})$.
  - The metric Sobolev space $W^{1,p}(\mathbb X)$, defined in duality with Lipschitz derivations on $X$.
  Inter alia, we generalise both Weaver's and Di Marino's theories of Lipschitz derivations to the extended setting, and we discuss their connections. We also introduce a Sobolev space $W^{1,p}(\mathbb X)$ via an integration-by-parts formula, along the lines of Di Marino's notion of Sobolev space, and we prove its equivalence with other approaches, studied in the extended setting by Ambrosio, Erbar and Savar\'{e}. En route, we obtain some results of independent interest, among which are:
  - A Lipschitz-constant-preserving extension result for $\tau$-continuous ${\sf d}$-Lipschitz functions.
  - A novel and rather robust strategy for proving the equivalence of Sobolev-type spaces defined via an integration-by-parts formula and those obtained with a relaxation procedure.
  - A new description of an isometric predual of the metric Sobolev space $W^{1,p}(\mathbb X)$.</description>

      <title>Quantitative spectral stability for the Neumann Laplacian in domains with small holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05999v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of the present paper is to investigate the behavior of the spectrum of the Neumann Laplacian in domains with little holes excised from the interior. More precisely, we consider the eigenvalues of the Laplacian with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions on a bounded, Lipschitz domain. Then, we singularly perturb the domain by removing Lipschitz sets which are "small" in a suitable sense and satisfy a uniform extension property. In this context, we provide an asymptotic expansion for all the eigenvalues of the perturbed problem which are converging to simple eigenvalues of the limit one. The eigenvalue variation turns out to depend on a geometric quantity resembling the notion of (boundary) torsional rigidity: understanding this fact is one of the main contributions of the present paper. In the particular case of a hole shrinking to a point, through a fine blow-up analysis, we identify the exact vanishing order of such a quantity and we establish some connections between the location of the hole and the sign of the eigenvalue variation.</description>

      <title>A Pontryagin Maximum Principle for agent-based models with convex state space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a first order optimality condition for a class of agent-based systems, as well as for their mean-field counterpart. A relevant difficulty of our analysis is that the state equation is formulated on possibly infinite-dimensional convex subsets of Banach spaces. This is a typical feature of many problems in multi-population dynamics, where a convex set of probability measures may account for the population, the degree of influence or the strategy attached to each agent. Due to the lack of a linear structure and of local compactness, the usual tools of needle variations and linearisation procedures used to derive Pontryagin type conditions have to be generalised to the setting at hand. This is done by considering suitable notions of differentials and by a careful inspection of the underlying functional structures.</description>

      <title>Note on the existence of classical solutions of derivative semilinear models for one dimensional wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06378v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note is a supplement with a new result to the review paper by Takamura [13] on nonlinear wave equations in one space dimension. We are focusing here to the long-time existence of classical solutions of semilinear wave equations in one space dimension, especially with derivative nonlinear terms of product-type. Our result is an extension of the single component case, but it is meaningful to provide models as possible as many to cover the optimality of the general theory. The proof is based on the classical iteration argument of the point-wise estimate of the solution.</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with the following nonlocal system of equations: \begin{align}\tag{$\mathcal S$}\label{MAT1} (-\Delta_p)^s u = \frac{\alpha}{p_s^*}|u|^{\alpha-2}u|v|^{\beta}+f(x) \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^{d}, \, (-\Delta_p)^s v = \frac{\beta}{p_s^*}|v|^{\beta-2}v|u|^{\alpha}+g(x) \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^{d},\, u,v &gt;0 \mbox{ in } \mathbb{R}^{d}, \end{align} where $s\in(0,1)$, $p\in(1,\infty)$, $d&gt;sp$, $\alpha,\beta&gt;1$, $\alpha+\beta=dp/(d-sp)$, and $f,\, g$ are nonnegative functionals in the dual space of $\mathcal{D}^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$. When $f=g=0$, we prove a uniqueness result for the ground state solution of \eqref{MAT1}. On the other hand, when $f \not \equiv 0, g \not \equiv 0$, the primary objective is to present a global compactness result that offers a complete characterization of the Palais-Smale sequences of the energy functional associated with \eqref{MAT1}. Using this characterization, within a certain range of $s$, we establish the existence of a solution with negative energy for \eqref{MAT1} when $\ker(f)=\ker(g)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $T_a$ be a pseudo-differential operator defined by exotic symbol $a$ in H\"{o}rmander class $S^m_{0,\delta}$ with $m \in \mathbb{R} $ and $0 \leq \delta \leq 1 $. It is well-known that the weak type (1,1) behavior of $T_a $ is not fully understood when the index $m $ is equal to the possibly optimal value $-\frac{n}{2} - \frac{n}{2} \delta $ for $0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 $, and that $T_a $ is not of weak type (1,1) when $m = -n$ and $\delta = 1 $.
  In this note, we prove that $T_a $ is of weighted weak type (1,1) if $a \in S^{-n}_{0, \delta}$ with $0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 $. Additionally, we show that the dual operator $T_a^* $ is of weighted weak type (1,1) if $a \in L^\infty S^{-n}_0 $. We also identify $m = -n$ as a critical index for these weak type estimates. As applications, we derive weighted weak type (1,1) estimates for certain classes of Fourier integral operators.</description>

We obtain a new approach for asymptotic expressions of the solutions and prove that the coefficients of the Dirac system can be determined uniquely by a dense subset of the nodal points (zeros of the first component of the eigenfunction). We also provide an algorithm for constructing the solution of this inverse nodal problem.</description>

Abstract: We prove that if we fill without gaps a bag with infinitely many potatoes, in such a way that they touch each other in few points, then the total surface area of the potatoes must be infinite. In this context potatoes are measurable subsets of the Euclidean space, the bag is any open set of the same space. As we show, this result also holds in the general context of doubling (even locally) metric measure spaces satisfying Poincar\'e inequality, in particular in smooth Riemannian manifolds and even in some sub-Riemannian spaces.</description>
