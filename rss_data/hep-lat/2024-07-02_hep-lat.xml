      <title>Accelerating Lattice QCD Simulations using GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving discretized versions of the Dirac equation represents a large share of execution time in lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) simulations. Many high-performance computing (HPC) clusters use graphics processing units (GPUs) to offer more computational resources. Our solver program, DDalphaAMG, previously was unable to fully take advantage of GPUs to accelerate its computations. Making use of GPUs for DDalphaAMG is an ongoing development, and we will present some current progress herein. Through a detailed description of our development, this thesis should offer valuable insights into using GPUs to accelerate a memory-bound CPU implementation.
  We developed a storage scheme for multiple tuples, which allows much more efficient memory access on GPUs, given that the element at the same index is read from multiple tuples simultaneously. Still, our implementation of a discrete Dirac operator is memory-bound, and we only achieved improvements for large linear systems on few nodes at the JUWELS cluster. These improvements do not currently overcome additional introduced overheads. However, the results for the application of the Wilson-Dirac operator show a speedup of around 3 for large lattices. If the additional overheads can be eliminated in the future, GPUs could reduce the DDalphaAMG execution time significantly for large lattices.
  We also found that a previous publication on the GPU acceleration of DDalphaAMG, underrepresented the achieved speedup, because small lattices were used. This further highlights that GPUs often require large-scale problems to solve in order to be faster than CPUs</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD Calculation of $x$-dependent Meson Distribution Amplitudes at Physical Pion Mass with Threshold Logarithm Resummation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD calculation of the $x$-dependent pion and kaon distribution amplitudes (DA) in the framework of large momentum effective theory. This calculation is performed on a fine lattice of $a=0.076$~fm at physical pion mass, with the pion boosted to $1.8$~GeV and kaon boosted to $2.3$~GeV. We renormalize the matrix elements in the hybrid scheme and match to $\overline{\rm MS}$ with a subtraction of the leading renormalon in the Wilson-line mass. The perturbative matching is improved by resumming the large logarithms related to the small quark and gluon momenta in the soft-gluon limit. After resummation, we demonstrate that we are able to calculate a range of $x\in[x_0,1-x_0]$ with $x_0=0.25$ for pion and $x_0=0.2$ for kaon with systematics under control. The kaon DA is shown to be slighted skewed, and narrower than pion DA. Although the $x$-dependence cannot be direct calculated beyond these ranges, we estimate higher moments of the pion and kaon DAs {by complementing} our calculation with short-distance factorization.</description>

      <title>The Ising Model on $\mathbb S^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a 2-dimensional Ising model on a triangulated sphere,
  $\mathbb S^2$, designed to approach the exact conformal field theory (CFT)
  in the continuum limit. Surprisingly, the derivation leads to a set
  of geometric constraints that the lattice field theory must
  satisfy. Monte Carlo simulations are in agreement with the exact
  Ising CFT on $\mathbb S^2$. We discuss the inherent benefits of using
  non-uniform simplicial lattices and how these methods may be
  generalized for use with other quantum theories on curved manifolds.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Polarisability of Octet Baryons via Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drawing on recent advances in lattice-QCD background-field techniques, the magnetic polarisability of octet baryons is calculated from the first principles of QCD. The results are presented in the context of new constituent quark-model calculations providing a framework for understanding the lattice results and a direct comparison with simulation results at unphysical quark masses. Using smeared quark sources, low-lying Laplacian eigenmode projection and final-state Landau mode projection, considerable attention is devoted to ensuring single-state isolation in the lattice correlation functions. We also introduce new weighting methods to reduce the sensitivity to correlation-function fits, averaging over many fits based on merit drawn from the full correlated $\chi^2$ of the fits. The techniques are implemented on the $32^3 \times 64$, 2+1-flavour dynamical-fermion lattices provided by the PACS-CS collaboration following the introduction of uniform magnetic fields quantised to the lowest nontrivial values available. After some fine tuning of the constituent quark model parameters, we find the model captures the patterns observed in the lattice QCD results very well, providing important insights into the physics underpinning the magnetic polarisabilities. Finally, comparison with the most recent results from experiment proceeds through an effective field theory formalism which incorporates estimates of finite-volume corrections and small electro-quenching corrections as the results are brought to the physical point. We find excellent agreement with experiment where available, including the proton and neutron polarisabilities.</description>

      <title>Landscape of QCD Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The moduli space of covariantly constant gauge fields is infinite-dimensional and describes non-perturbative solutions of the Yang-Mills equation of superposed chromomagnetic flux tubes (vortices) of opposite magnetic charges. These gauge field configurations are stretched along the potential valleys of a constant energy density and are separated by potential barriers between classically degenerate vacua that are forming a complicated potential landscape of the QCD vacuum. It is suggested that the solutions describe the condensate of dense chromomagnetic vortices representing a dual analog of the Cooper pairs condensate in a superconductor.</description>

      <title>The Nambu-Goto string as higher-derivative Liouville theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I propose a generalization of the Liouville action which corresponds to the Nambu-Goto string like the usual Liouville action corresponds to the Polyakov string. The two differ by higher-derivative terms which are negligible classically but revive quantumly. Based on the equivalence with the four-derivative action I argue that the Nambu-Goto string in four dimensions is described by the (4,3) minimal model analogously to the critical Ising model on a dynamical lattice. While critical indices are the same as in the usual Liouville theory, the domain of applicability becomes broader.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation with Gauge Fixing: from Ising Lattice Gauge Theory to Dynamical Flux Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of synthetic dynamic gauge field has attracted much attentions in recent years. There are two traditional ways to simulate gauge theories. One is to directly simulate the full Hamiltonian of gauge theories with local gauge symmetries. And the other is to engineer the projected Hamiltonian in one gauge subsector. In this work, we provide the third way towards the simulation of gauge theories based on \emph{gauge fixing}. To demonstrate this concept, we fix the gauge of an Ising lattice gauge field coupled with spinless fermions on a ladder geometry. After the gauge fixing, this gauge theory is reduced to a simpler model, in which fermions hop on a ladder with a fluctuating dynamical $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ flux. Then we shows that this model can be realized via Floquet engineering in ultracold atomic gases. By analytical and numerical studies of this dynamical flux model, we deduce that there is confinement to deconfinement phase transition in the original unfixed gauge theory. This work paves the way to quantum simulate lattice gauge theory using the concept of gauge fixing, relevant both for condensed matter and high energy physics.</description>

      <title>Action of the axial $U(1)$ non-invertible symmetry on the 't~Hooft line operator: A lattice gauge theory study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how the symmetry operator of the axial $U(1)$ non-invertible symmetry acts on the 't~Hooft line operator in the $U(1)$ gauge theory by employing the modified Villain-type lattice formulation. We model the axial anomaly by a compact scalar boson, the ``QED axion''. For the gauge invariance, the simple 't~Hooft line operator, which is defined by a line integral of the dual $U(1)$ gauge potential, must be ``dressed'' by the scalar and $U(1)$ gauge fields. A careful consideration on the basis of the anomalous Ward--Takahashi identity containing the 't~Hooft operator with the dressing factor and a precise definition of the symmetry operator on the lattice shows that the symmetry operator leaves no effect when it sweeps out a 't~Hooft loop operator. This result appears inequivalent with the phenomenon concluded in the continuum theory. In an appendix, we demonstrate that the half-space gauging of the magnetic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 1-form symmetry, when formulated in an appropriate lattice framework, leads to the same conclusion as above. A similar result is obtained for the axion string operator.</description>

      <title>Complex path simulations of geometrically frustrated ladders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum systems with geometrical frustration remain an outstanding challenge for numerical simulations due to the infamous numerical sign problem. Here, we overcome this obstruction via complex path integration in a geometrically frustrated ladder of interacting bosons at finite density. This enables studies of the many-body ground state properties, otherwise inaccessible with standard quantum Monte Carlo methods. Specifically, we study a chemical potential tuned quantum phase transition, along which we track the emergence of quasi-long-range order and critical softening of the single particle gap. We chart future methodological improvements and applications in generalized geometrically frustrated lattice models.</description>

      <title>Properties of the ground and excited states of triply heavy spin-1/2 baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14348v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the triply heavy spin-1/2 baryons with quark contents $ ccb $ and $ bbc $, and calculate their mass and residue using QCD sum rules. In the calculations, we consider the ground (1S), first orbitally excited (1P) and first radially excited (2S) states. Aiming to achieve higher accuracies in the results, we perform the computations by taking into account the non-perturbative operators up to eight mass dimensions. We compare our results with the predictions of other theoretical studies existing in the literature. The obtained results may help experimental groups in their search for these yet unseen, but previously predicted by the quark model, interesting particles.</description>

      <title>Mass spectra of heavy hybrid quarkonia and $\overline{b}gc$ mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Masses and current couplings of the charmonium and bottomonium hybrids $ \overline{c}gc$ and $\overline{b}gb$ with spin-parities $J^{\mathrm{PC} }=0^{++},\ 0^{+-},\ 0^{-+},\ 0^{--}$ and $1^{++},\ 1^{+-},\ 1^{-+},\ 1^{--}$ are calculated using QCD two-point sum rule method. Computations are performed by taking into account gluon condensates up to dimension 12 including terms $\sim \langle g_{s}^{3}G^{3}\rangle ^{2}$. The parameters of the bottom-charm hybrids $\overline{b}gc$ with quantum numbers $J^{\mathrm{PC }}=0^{+},\ 0^{-},\ 1^{+}$, and $1^{-}$ are calculated as well. In computations the dominance of the pole contribution to sum rule results is ensured. It is demonstrated that all charmonia hybrids decay strongly to two-meson final states. The bottomonium hybrids $0^{-+}$ and $1^{-+}$ as well as the bottom-charm hybrid mesons $0^{-(+)}$ and $1^{-(+)}$ may be stable against strong two-meson decay modes. Results of the present work are compared with ones obtained using the sum rule and alternative approaches. Our predictions for parameters of the heavy hybrid mesons may be useful to study their various decay channels which are important for interpretation of ongoing and future experiments.</description>

      <title>Total Gluon Helicity from Lattice without Effective Theory Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00693v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose two approaches for extracting the total gluon helicity contribution to proton spin from lattice QCD, one from local operator matrix elements in a fixed gauge accessible on lattice with feasible renormalization, and the other from gauge-invariant nonlocal gluon correlators. Neither of these approaches requires a matching procedure when converted to the MS scheme. Our proposal resolves a long-standing inconsistency in the literature regarding lattice calculations of the total gluon helicity, and has the potential to greatly facilitate these calculations.</description>
