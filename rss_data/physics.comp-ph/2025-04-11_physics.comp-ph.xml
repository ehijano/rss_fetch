      <title>Physical significance of artificial numerical noise in direct numerical simulation of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using clean numerical simulation (CNS) in which artificial numerical noise is negligible over a finite, sufficiently long interval of time, we provide evidence, for the first time, that artificial numerical noise in direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulence is approximately equivalent to thermal fluctuation and/or stochastic environmental noise. This confers physical significance on the artificial numerical noise of DNS of the Navier-Stokes equations. As a result, DNS on a fine mesh should correspond to turbulence under small internal/external physical disturbance, whereas DNS on a sparse mesh corresponds to turbulent flow under large physical disturbance, respectively. The key point is that: all of them have physical meanings and so are correct in terms of their deterministic physics, even if their statistics are quite different. This is illustrated herein. Our paper provides a positive viewpoint regarding the presence of artificial numerical noise in DNS.</description>

      <title>Scattering modeling by a nonlinear slab: exact solution of the full vector problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the computation of the scattering of light by a non-linear slab for conical incidence and arbitrary polarization. We consider an anisotropic slab, defined entirely by its susceptibility tensors, consequently we must consider the full vector problem. The 2-dimensional problem is reduced to a 1-dimensional problem using symmetry arguments, which is then solved by an iterative process using the finite element method. Energetic considerations are also addressed. Several numerical experiments are shown, including the incident TE and TM cases.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of magnetized turbulence in the interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interstellar medium (ISM) of our Galaxy is magnetized, compressible and turbulent, influencing many key ISM properties, like star formation, cosmic ray transport, and metal and phase mixing. Yet, basic statistics describing compressible, magnetized turbulence remain uncertain. Utilizing grid resolutions up to $10,080^3$ cells, we simulate highly-compressible, magnetized ISM-style turbulence with a magnetic field maintained by a small-scale dynamo. We measure two coexisting kinetic energy cascades, $\mathcal{E}_{{\rm kin}}(k) \propto k^{-n}$, in the turbulence, separating the plasma into scales that are non-locally interacting, supersonic and weakly magnetized $(n=2.01\pm 0.03\approx 2)$ and locally interacting, subsonic and highly magnetized $(n=1.465\pm 0.002\approx 3/2)$, where $k$ is the wavenumber. We show that the $3/2$ spectrum can be explained with scale-dependent kinetic energy fluxes and velocity-magnetic field alignment. On the highly magnetized modes, the magnetic energy spectrum forms a local cascade $(n=1.798\pm 0.001\approx 9/5)$, deviating from any known \textit{ab initio} theory. With a new generation of radio telescopes coming online, these results provide a means to directly test if the ISM in our Galaxy is maintained by the compressible turbulent motions from within it.</description>

      <title>Advanced measurement techniques in quantum Monte Carlo: The permutation matrix representation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a typical finite temperature quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation, estimators for simple static observables such as specific heat and magnetization are known. With a great deal of system-specific manual labor, one can sometimes also derive more complicated non-local or even dynamic observable estimators. Within the permutation matrix representation (PMR) flavor of QMC, however, we show that one can derive formal estimators for arbitrary static observables. We also derive exact, explicit estimators for general imaginary-time correlation functions and non-trivial integrated susceptibilities thereof. We demonstrate the practical versatility of our method by estimating various non-local, random observables for the transverse-field Ising model on a square lattice.</description>

      <title>Euler-Lagrange study of Microbubble-Laden Turbulent Flow over Superhydrophobic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For slow-speed ships, underwater vehicles, and pipe transportation systems, viscous resistance accounts for a large proportion of the total energy losses. As such, various technologies have been developed to reduce viscous resistance and enhance energy efficiency in these applications. Air injection and surface treatment are two representative drag reduction techniques. Additionally, efforts to combine multiple drag-reduction techniques have been the subject of extensive research. In this study, the synergistic effects of integrating microbubble injection and superhydrophobic Surface(SHS) drag reduction approaches were analyzed. A 2-way coupling Euler-Lagrange approach was used alongside direct numerical simulation, based on the spectral element method, to investigate the synergistic effects of applying two separate drag reduction methods. Three types of SHS were investigated in our simulations; post type, transverse ridge type, and ridge type. The drag reduction performances and flow characteristics of the various configurations, with and without microbubble injection, were compared in a turbulent horizontal channel flow with $Re_{\tau}=180$. The results of these tests showed that, combining post-type SHS with microbubbles was the most effective, producing a synergistic drag reduction effect. However, combining microbubble injection with ridge-type SHS increased drag relative to ridge-type SHS alone, showing the importance of carefully selecting wall type for the best possible performance.</description>

      <title>Parton Distribution Functions in the Schwinger model from Tensor Network States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) describe the inner, non-perturbative structure of hadrons. Their computation involves matrix elements with a Wilson line along a direction on the light cone, posing significant challenges in Euclidean lattice calculations, where the time direction is not directly accessible. We propose implementing the light-front Wilson line within the Hamiltonian formalism using tensor network techniques. The approach is demonstrated in the massive Schwinger model (quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions), a toy model that shares key features with quantum chromodynamics. We present accurate continuum results for the fermion PDF of the vector meson at varying fermion masses, obtained from first principle calculations directly in Minkowski space. Our strategy also provides a useful path for quantum simulations and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Atomic structure analysis of PL5 in silicon carbide with single-spin spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Divacancy (VV) spin defects in 4H polytype of silicon carbide (4H-SiC) are emerging candidates for quantum information processing and quantum sensing. Among these defects, PL5 and PL6 stand out due to their superior charge stability and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) properties at room temperature. However, their atomic structures remain unresolved, with ongoing controversy regarding their potential association with stacking faults. Previous measurements relying on spin ensemble detection are insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In this study, we conduct correlative imaging of stacking faults and PL5-6 at single-defect level, conclusively demonstrating that PL5-6 are not associated with stacking faults. Further investigation of PL5 through single-spin ODMR spectroscopy allows us to determine its six spatial orientations, as well as to measure the orientation of its transverse anisotropy spin splitting (E) and the statistical distribution of hyperfine splitting. These results and ab initio calculations suggest that PL5 should be VsiVc(hk) divacancy coupled with a nearby antisite atom (VVA). The structure resolution of PL5 starts the first step toward its controllable fabrication, paving the way for various applications.</description>

      <title>Molecular excited state in the interaction quench dynamics of two different atoms in a two-dimensional anisotropic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the interaction quench dynamics of two atoms with different masses and subject to different trapping potentials. Notably, under such anisotropic conditions, the nonequilibrium dynamics can lead to the occupation of molecular excited states. We consider cases of quenching from attractive to repulsive interaction and vice versa, analyzing the impact of the pre- and postquench states. The analysis of overlap integrals for the both states reveals a significant contribution from the molecular excited state. Moreover, the overlap with the prequench states might serve as an indicator of when this excited state may emerge. Additionally, we calculate the energy spectrum for the lowest levels in the both isotropic and anisotropic harmonic traps. Throughout our study, we use a Gaussian-shaped finite-range interaction potential.</description>

      <title>UQ of 2D Slab Burner DNS: Surrogates, Uncertainty Propagation, and Parameter Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to demonstrate and address challenges related to all aspects of performing a complete uncertainty quantification analysis of a complicated physics-based simulation like a 2D slab burner direct numerical simulation (DNS). The UQ framework includes the development of data-driven surrogate models, propagation of parametric uncertainties to the fuel regression rate--the primary quantity of interest--and Bayesian calibration of the latent heat of sublimation and a chemical reaction temperature exponent using experimental data. Two surrogate models, a Gaussian Process (GP) and a Hierarchical Multiscale Surrogate (HMS) were constructed using an ensemble of 64 simulations generated via Latin Hypercube sampling. HMS is superior for prediction demonstrated by cross-validation and able to achieve an error &lt; 15% when predicting multiscale boundary quantities just from a few far field inputs. Subsequent Bayesian calibration of chemical kinetics and fuel response parameters against experimental observations showed that the default values used in the DNS should be higher to better match measurements. This study highlights the importance of surrogate model selection and parameter calibration in quantifying uncertainty in predictions of fuel regression rates in complex combustion systems.</description>

      <title>Physics-tailored machine learning reveals unexpected physics in dusty plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05273v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dusty plasma is a mixture of ions, electrons, and macroscopic charged particles that is commonly found in space and planetary environments. The particles interact through Coulomb forces mediated by the surrounding plasma, and as a result, the effective forces between particles can be non-conservative and non-reciprocal. Machine learning (ML) models are a promising route to learn these complex forces, yet their structure should match the underlying physical constraints to provide useful insight. Here we demonstrate and experimentally validate an ML approach that incorporates physical intuition to infer force laws in a laboratory dusty plasma. Trained on 3D particle trajectories, the model accounts for inherent symmetries, non-identical particles, and learns the effective non-reciprocal forces between particles with exquisite accuracy (R^2&gt;0.99). We validate the model by inferring particle masses in two independent yet consistent ways. The model's accuracy enables precise measurements of particle charge and screening length, discovering large deviations from common theoretical assumptions. Our ability to identify new physics from experimental data demonstrates how ML-powered approaches can guide new routes of scientific discovery in many-body systems. Furthermore, we anticipate our ML approach to be a starting point for inferring laws from dynamics in a wide range of many-body systems, from colloids to living organisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the main theoretical support of quantum metrology, quantum parameter estimation must follow the steps of quantum metrology towards the applied science and industry. Hence, optimal scheme design will soon be a crucial and core task for quantum parameter estimation. To efficiently accomplish this task, software packages aimed at computer-aided design are in high demand. In response to this need, we hereby introduce QuanEstimation.jl, an open-source Julia framework for scheme evaluation and design in quantum parameter estimation. It can be used either as an independent package or as the computational core of the recently developed hybrid-language (Python-Julia) package QuanEstimation [Phys. Rev. Res. 4 (4) (2022) 043057]. Utilizing this framework, the scheme evaluation and design in quantum parameter estimation can be readily performed, especially when quantum noises exist.</description>

      <title>Model order reduction of parametric dynamical systems by slice sampling tensor completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the great potential of reduced order modeling for parametric dynamical systems using low-rank tensor decompositions (LRTD). In particular, within the framework of interpolatory tensorial reduced order models (ROM), LRTD is computed for tensors composed of snapshots of the system's solutions, where each parameter corresponds to a distinct tensor mode. This approach requires full sampling of the parameter domain on a tensor product grid, which suffers from the curse of dimensionality, making it practical only for systems with a small number of parameters. To overcome this limitation, we propose a sparse sampling of the parameter domain, followed by a low-rank tensor completion. The resulting specialized tensor completion problem is formulated for a tensor of order $C + D$, where $C$ fully sampled modes correspond to the snapshot degrees of freedom, and $D$ partially sampled modes correspond to the system's parameters. To address this non-standard tensor completion problem, we introduce a low-rank tensor format called the hybrid tensor train. Completion in this format is then integrated into an interpolatory tensorial ROM. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both the completion method and the ROM on several examples of dynamical systems derived from finite element discretizations of parabolic partial differential equations with parameter-dependent coefficients or boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Neutron Beam Shaping by Ghost Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method to shape a neutron beam and project any specified target image using a single universal patterned mask that is transversely displaced. The method relies on ``ghost projection'', which is a reversed form of classical ghost imaging. A set of sub-mask regions that combine to construct the required beam shape is computed; illumination of each region with the determined exposure time projects the shaped beam. We demonstrate this method experimentally, using the Dingo neutron imaging beamline at the OPAL nuclear research reactor (Australia). The ability to shape a neutron beam ``on demand'' allows selective dose delivery away from sensitive areas of samples, such as in cultural heritage artifacts. It also benefits irradiation techniques, e.g., in testing resilience of electronic components for space and defense technologies or neutron therapies.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced non-relativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the large time-reversal-odd ($\mathcal{T}$-odd) spin current generated by the non-relativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect (ASSE) has demonstrated significant potential for spintronic applications, with both computational and experimental validations. However, considering the broad application prospects and the scarcity of conductive altermagnetic materials, the development of novel reliable methods for inducing altermagnetism is necessary. Here, strain engineering is proposed as a simple yet effective approach. This work focuses on $\mathrm{OsO}_2$--the $5d$ counterpart of $\mathrm{RuO}_2$ sharing the rutile structure--employing $ab~initio$ calculations to systematically investigate strain effects on its ASSE. We find that applying a minor equibiaxial tensile strain $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{ts}}$ to $\mathrm{OsO}_2$ can induce a transition from non-magnetic to altermagnetic states. Only $3\%$ $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{ts}}$ is required to achieve a spin-charge conversion ratio ($\theta_{\text{AS}}$) of $\sim7\%$ for the $\mathcal{T}$-odd spin current generated by ASSE, far exceeding the intrinsic spin Hall angle $\theta_{\text{IS}}$ produced by the conventional spin Hall effect (CSHE). Calculations reveal that substantial $\theta_{\text{AS}}$ persists even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, with its magnitude positively correlating to non-relativistic spin splitting magnitude, which further confirms the strain-induced ASSE's non-relativistic origin. Further calculations reveal that $\mathrm{RuO}_2$ exhibits analogous phenomena, which may resolve recent controversies regarding its magnetic properties. Our research opens new simple pathways for developing next-generation altermagnetic spintronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Finding new materials with previously unknown atomic structure or materials with optimal set of properties for a specific application greatly benefits from computational modeling. Recently, such screening has been dramatically accelerated by the invent of universal machine-learning interatomic potentials that offer first principles accuracy at orders of magnitude lower computational cost. Their application to the screening of defects with desired properties or to finding new stable compounds with high density of defects, however, has not been explored. Here, we show that the universal machine-learning interatomic potentials have reached sufficient accuracy to enable large-scale screening of defective materials. We carried out vacancy calculations for 86 259 materials in the Materials Project database and analyzed the formation energies in terms of oxidation numbers. We further demonstrate the application of these models for finding new materials at or below the convex hull of known materials and for simulated etching of low-dimensional materials.</description>
