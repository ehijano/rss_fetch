      <title>TrainVerify: Equivalence-Based Verification for Distributed LLM Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) at scale requires parallel execution across thousands of devices, incurring enormous computational costs. Yet, these costly distributed trainings are rarely verified, leaving them prone to silent errors and potentially wasting millions of GPU hours. We introduce TrainVerify, a system for verifiable distributed training of LLMs. Given a deep learning model's logical specification as the ground truth, TrainVerify formally verifies that a distributed parallel execution plan is mathematically equivalent to it. Direct verification is notoriously difficult due to the sheer scale of LLMs which often involves billions of variables and highly intricate computation graphs. Therefore, TrainVerify introduces shape-reduction techniques and a stage-wise parallel verification algorithm that significantly reduces complexity while preserving formal correctness. TrainVerify scales to frontier LLMs, including the successful verification of the Llama3 (405B) and DeepSeek-V3 (671B) training plans.</description>

      <title>NetSenseML: Network-Adaptive Compression for Efficient Distributed Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training large-scale distributed machine learning models imposes considerable demands on network infrastructure, often resulting in sudden traffic spikes that lead to congestion, increased latency, and reduced throughput, which would ultimately affect convergence times and overall training performance. While gradient compression techniques are commonly employed to alleviate network load, they frequently compromise model accuracy due to the loss of gradient information.
  This paper introduces NetSenseML, a novel network adaptive distributed deep learning framework that dynamically adjusts quantization, pruning, and compression strategies in response to real-time network conditions. By actively monitoring network conditions, NetSenseML applies gradient compression only when network congestion negatively impacts convergence speed, thus effectively balancing data payload reduction and model accuracy preservation.
  Our approach ensures efficient resource usage by adapting reduction techniques based on current network conditions, leading to shorter convergence times and improved training efficiency. We present the design of the NetSenseML adaptive data reduction function and experimental evaluations show that NetSenseML can improve training throughput by a factor of 1.55 to 9.84 times compared to state-of-the-art compression-enabled systems for representative DDL training jobs in bandwidth-constrained conditions.</description>

      <title>A Study of Synchronization Methods for Concurrent Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The size of collections, maps, and data structures in general, constitutes a fundamental property. An implementation of the size method is required in most programming environments. Nevertheless, in a concurrent environment, integrating a linearizable concurrent size introduces a noticeable overhead on all operations of the data structure, even when the size method is not invoked during the execution. In this work we present a study of synchronization methods in an attempt to improve the performance of the data structure. In particular, we study a handshake technique that is commonly used with concurrent garbage collection, an optimistic technique, and a lock-based technique. Evaluation against the state-of-the-art size methodology demonstrates that the overhead can be significantly reduced by selecting the appropriate synchronization approach, but there is no one-size-fits-all method. Different scenarios call for different synchronization methods, as rigorously shown in this study. Nevertheless, our findings align with general trends in concurrent computing. In scenarios characterized by low contention, optimistic and lock-based approaches work best, whereas under high contention, the most effective solutions are the handshake approach and the wait-free approach.</description>

      <title>Parallel Point-to-Point Shortest Paths and Batch Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Orionet, efficient parallel implementations of Point-to-Point Shortest Paths (PPSP) queries using bidirectional search (BiDS) and other heuristics, with an additional focus on batch PPSP queries. We present a framework for parallel PPSP built on existing single-source shortest paths (SSSP) frameworks by incorporating pruning conditions. As a result, we develop efficient parallel PPSP algorithms based on early termination, bidirectional search, A$^*$ search, and bidirectional A$^*$ all with simple and efficient implementations.
  We extend our idea to batch PPSP queries, which are widely used in real-world scenarios. We first design a simple and flexible abstraction to represent the batch so PPSP can leverage the shared information of the batch. Orionet formalizes the batch as a query graph represented by edges between queried sources and targets. In this way, we directly extended our PPSP framework to batched queries in a simple and efficient way.
  We evaluate Orionet on both single and batch PPSP queries using various graph types and distance percentiles of queried pairs, and compare it against two baselines, GraphIt and MBQ. Both of them support parallel single PPSP and A$^*$ using unidirectional search. On 14 graphs we tested, on average, our bidirectional search is 2.9$\times$ faster than GraphIt, and 6.8$\times$ faster than MBQ. Our bidirectional A$^*$ is 4.4$\times$ and 6.2$\times$ faster than the A$^*$ in GraphIt and MBQ, respectively. For batched PPSP queries, we also provide in-depth experimental evaluation, and show that Orionet provides strong performance compared to the plain solutions.</description>

      <title>Enabling Blockchain Interoperability Through Network Discovery Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Web3 technologies have experienced unprecedented growth in the last decade, achieving widespread adoption. As various blockchain networks continue to evolve, we are on the cusp of a paradigm shift in which they could provide services traditionally offered by the Internet, but in a decentralized manner, marking the emergence of the Internet of Blockchains. While significant progress has been achieved in enabling interoperability between blockchain networks, existing solutions often assume that networks are already mutually aware. This reveals a critical gap: the initial discovery of blockchain networks remains largely unaddressed. This paper proposes a decentralized architecture for blockchain network discovery that operates independently of any centralized authority. We also introduce a mechanism for discovering assets and services within a blockchain from external networks. Given the decentralized nature of the proposed discovery architecture, we design an incentive mechanism to encourage nodes to actively participate in maintaining the discovery network. The proposed architecture implemented and evaluated, using the Substrate framework, demonstrates its resilience and scalability, effectively handling up to 130,000 concurrent requests under the tested network configurations, with a median response time of 5.5 milliseconds, demonstrating the ability to scale its processing capacity further by increasing its network size.</description>

      <title>JANUS: Resilient and Adaptive Data Transmission for Enabling Timely and Efficient Cross-Facility Scientific Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern science, the growing complexity of large-scale projects has increased reliance on cross-facility workflows, where institutions share resources and expertise to accelerate discovery. These workflows often involve transferring massive data over wide-area networks. While high-speed networks like ESnet and data transfer services like Globus have improved data mobility, challenges remain. Large data volumes can strain bandwidth, TCP suffers from retransmissions due to packet loss, and traditional fault-tolerance methods like erasure coding introduce significant overhead.
  This paper presents JANUS, a resilient and adaptive data transmission approach for cross-facility scientific workflows. JANUS uses UDP, integrates erasure coding for fault tolerance, and applies error-bounded lossy compression to reduce overhead. This design enables users to balance transmission time and accuracy based on specific needs. JANUS also adapts coding parameters to real-time network conditions and uses optimization models to determine ideal configurations. Experiments show that JANUS significantly improves data transfer efficiency while preserving fidelity.</description>

      <title>A System Level Compiler for Massively-Parallel, Spatial, Dataflow Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a novel compiler called the Multiple-Architecture Compiler for Advanced Computing Hardware (MACH) designed specifically for massively-parallel, spatial, dataflow architectures like the Wafer Scale Engine. Additionally, MACH can execute code on traditional unified-memory devices. MACH addresses the complexities in compiling for spatial architectures through a conceptual Virtual Machine, a flexible domain-specific language, and a compiler that can lower high-level languages to machine-specific code in compliance with the Virtual Machine concept. While MACH is designed to be operable on several architectures and provide the flexibility for several standard and user-defined data mappings, we introduce the concept with dense tensor examples from NumPy and show lowering to the Wafer Scale Engine by targeting Cerebras' hardware specific languages.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Trajectory Optimization for UAVs in Disaster Zone Using Henry Gas Optimization Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a disaster-prone environment plays important role in assisting the rescue services and providing the internet connectivity with the outside world. However, in such a complex environment the selection of optimum trajectory of UAVs is of utmost importance. UAV trajectory optimization deals with finding the shortest path in the minimal possible time. In this paper, a cluster optimization scheme (COS) is proposed using the Henry gas optimization (HGO) metaheuristic algorithm to identify the shortest path having minimal transportation cost and algorithm complexity. The mathematical model is designed for COS using the HGO algorithm and compared with the state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey wolf optimization (GWO), cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) and barnacles mating optimizer (BMO). In order to prove the robustness of the proposed model, four different scenarios are evaluated that includes ambient environment, constrict environment, tangled environment, and complex environment. In all the aforementioned scenarios, the HGO algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms. Particularly, in the ambient environment, the HGO algorithm achieves a 39.3% reduction in transportation cost and a 16.8% reduction in computational time as compared to the PSO algorithm. Hence, the HGO algorithm can be used for autonomous trajectory optimization of UAVs in smart cities.</description>

      <title>PNCS:Power-Norm Cosine Similarity for Diverse Client Selection in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for leveraging diverse datasets from multiple sources while preserving data privacy by avoiding centralized storage. However, many existing approaches fail to account for the intricate gradient correlations between remote clients, a limitation that becomes especially problematic in data heterogeneity scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel FL framework utilizing Power-Norm Cosine Similarity (PNCS) to improve client selection for model aggregation. By capturing higher-order gradient moments, PNCS addresses non-IID data challenges, enhancing convergence speed and accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a simple algorithm ensuring diverse client selection through a selection history queue. Experiments with a VGG16 model across varied data partitions demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>HetGPU: The pursuit of making binary compatibility towards GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous GPU infrastructures present a binary compatibility challenge: code compiled for one vendor's GPU will not run on another due to divergent instruction sets, execution models, and driver stacks . We propose hetGPU, a new system comprising a compiler, runtime, and abstraction layer that together enable a single GPU binary to execute on NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Tenstorrent hardware. The hetGPU compiler emits an architecture-agnostic GPU intermediate representation (IR) and inserts metadata for managing execution state. The hetGPU runtime then dynamically translates this IR to the target GPU's native code and provides a uniform abstraction of threads, memory, and synchronization. Our design tackles key challenges: differing SIMT vs. MIMD execution (warps on NVIDIA/AMD vs. many-core RISC-V on Tenstorrent), varied instruction sets, scheduling and memory model discrepancies, and the need for state serialization for live migration. We detail the hetGPU architecture, including the IR transformation pipeline, a state capture/reload mechanism for live GPU migration, and an abstraction layer that bridges warp-centric and core-centric designs. Preliminary evaluation demonstrates that unmodified GPU binaries compiled with hetGPU can be migrated across disparate GPUs with minimal overhead, opening the door to vendor-agnostic GPU computing.</description>

      <title>Incentivizing High-quality Participation From Federated Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) provides a promising paradigm for facilitating collaboration between multiple clients that jointly learn a global model without directly sharing their local data. However, existing research suffers from two caveats: 1) From the perspective of agents, voluntary and unselfish participation is often assumed. But self-interested agents may opt out of the system or provide low-quality contributions without proper incentives; 2) From the mechanism designer's perspective, the aggregated models can be unsatisfactory as the existing game-theoretical federated learning approach for data collection ignores the potential heterogeneous effort caused by contributed data. To alleviate above challenges, we propose an incentive-aware framework for agent participation that considers data heterogeneity to accelerate the convergence process. Specifically, we first introduce the notion of Wasserstein distance to explicitly illustrate the heterogeneous effort and reformulate the existing upper bound of convergence. To induce truthful reporting from agents, we analyze and measure the generalization error gap of any two agents by leveraging the peer prediction mechanism to develop score functions. We further present a two-stage Stackelberg game model that formalizes the process and examines the existence of equilibrium. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism.</description>

      <title>Comparison of substructured non-overlapping domain decomposition and overlapping additive Schwarz methods for large-scale Helmholtz problems with multiple sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving large-scale Helmholtz problems discretized with high-order finite elements is notoriously difficult, especially in 3D where direct factorization of the system matrix is very expensive and memory demanding, and robust convergence of iterative methods is difficult to obtain. Domain decomposition methods (DDM) constitute one of the most promising strategy so far, by combining direct and iterative approaches: using direct solvers on overlapping or non-overlapping subdomains, as a preconditioner for a Krylov subspace method on the original Helmholtz system or as an iterative solver on a substructured problem involving field values or Lagrange multipliers on the interfaces between the subdomains. In this work we compare the computational performance of non-overlapping substructured DDM and Optimized Restricted Additive Schwarz (ORAS) preconditioners for solving large-scale Helmholtz problems with multiple sources, as is encountered, e.g., in frequency-domain Full Waveform Inversion. We show on a realistic geophysical test-case that, when appropriately tuned, the non-overlapping methods can reduce the convergence gap sufficiently to significantly outperform the overlapping methods.</description>

      <title>Persistent HyTM via Fast Path Fine-Grained Locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing hardware transactional memory (HTM) in conjunction with non-volatile memory (NVM) to achieve persistence is quite difficult and somewhat awkward due to the fact that the primitives utilized to write data to NVM will abort HTM transactions. We present several persistent hybrid transactional memory (HyTM) that, perhaps counterintuitively, utilize an HTM fast path primarily to read or acquire fine-grained locks which protect data items. Our implementations guarantee durable linearizable transactions and the STM path satisfies either weak progressiveness or strong progressiveness. We discuss the design choices related to the differing progress guarantees and we examine how these design choices impact performance. We evaluate our persistent HyTM implementations using various microbenchmarks. Our implementations achieve improved performance especially for read dominant workloads compared to state of the art persistent STMs and persistent HyTMs despite the challenges and apparent awkwardness of using current implementation HTM to achieve persistence.</description>

      <title>KVCache Cache in the Wild: Characterizing and Optimizing KVCache Cache at a Large Cloud Provider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Serving large language models (LLMs) is important for cloud providers, and caching intermediate results (KV\$) after processing each request substantially improves serving throughput and latency. However, there is limited understanding of how LLM serving benefits from KV\$ caching, where system design decisions like cache eviction policies are highly workload-dependent. In this paper, we present the first systematic characterization of the KV\$ workload patterns from one of the leading LLM service providers. We draw observations that were not covered by previous studies focusing on synthetic workloads, including: KV\$ reuses are skewed across requests, where reuses between single-turn requests are equally important as multi-turn requests; the reuse time and probability are diverse considering all requests, but for a specific request category, the pattern tends to be predictable; and the overall cache size required for an ideal cache hit ratio is moderate. Based on the characterization, we further propose a workload-aware cache eviction policy that improves the serving performance under real-world traces, especially with limited cache capacity.</description>

      <title>Serving Large Language Models on Huawei CloudMatrix384</title>

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), driven by growing parameter scales, adoption of mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures, and expanding context lengths, imposes unprecedented demands on AI infrastructure. Traditional AI clusters face limitations in compute intensity, memory bandwidth, inter-chip communication, and latency, compounded by variable workloads and strict service-level objectives. Addressing these issues requires fundamentally redesigned hardware-software integration. This paper introduces Huawei CloudMatrix, a next-generation AI datacenter architecture, realized in the production-grade CloudMatrix384 supernode. It integrates 384 Ascend 910 NPUs and 192 Kunpeng CPUs interconnected via an ultra-high-bandwidth Unified Bus (UB) network, enabling direct all-to-all communication and dynamic pooling of resources. These features optimize performance for communication-intensive operations, such as large-scale MoE expert parallelism and distributed key-value cache access. To fully leverage CloudMatrix384, we propose CloudMatrix-Infer, an advanced LLM serving solution incorporating three core innovations: a peer-to-peer serving architecture that independently scales prefill, decode, and caching; a large-scale expert parallelism strategy supporting EP320 via efficient UB-based token dispatch; and hardware-aware optimizations including specialized operators, microbatch-based pipelining, and INT8 quantization. Evaluation with the DeepSeek-R1 model shows CloudMatrix-Infer achieves state-of-the-art efficiency: prefill throughput of 6,688 tokens/s per NPU and decode throughput of 1,943 tokens/s per NPU (&lt;50 ms TPOT). It effectively balances throughput and latency, sustaining 538 tokens/s per NPU even under stringent 15 ms latency constraints, while INT8 quantization maintains model accuracy across benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Alto: Orchestrating Distributed Compound AI Systems with Nested Ancestry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compound AI applications chain together subcomponents such as generative language models, document retrievers, and embedding models. Applying traditional systems optimizations such as parallelism and pipelining in compound AI systems is difficult because each component has different constraints in terms of the granularity and type of data that it ingests. New data is often generated during intermediate computations, and text streams may be split into smaller, independent fragments (such as documents to sentences) which may then be re-aggregated at later parts of the computation. Due to this complexity, existing systems to serve compound AI queries do not fully take advantage of parallelism and pipelining opportunities.
  We present Alto, a framework that automatically optimizes execution of compound AI queries through streaming and parallelism. Bento introduces a new abstraction called nested ancestry, a metadata hierarchy that allows the system to correctly track partial outputs and aggregate data across the heterogeneous constraints of the components of compound AI applications. This metadata is automatically inferred from the programming model, allowing developers to express complex dataflow patterns without needing to reason manually about the details of routing and aggregation. Implementations of four applications in Alto outperform or match implementations in LangGraph, a popular existing AI programming framework. Alto implementations match or improve latency by between 10-30%.</description>

      <title>LAECIPS: Large Vision Model Assisted Adaptive Edge-Cloud Collaboration for IoT-based Embodied Intelligence System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embodied intelligence (EI) enables manufacturing systems to flexibly perceive, reason, adapt, and operate within dynamic shop floor environments. In smart manufacturing, a representative EI scenario is robotic visual inspection, where industrial robots must accurately inspect components on rapidly changing, heterogeneous production lines. This task requires both high inference accuracy especially for uncommon defects and low latency to match production speeds, despite evolving lighting, part geometries, and surface conditions. To meet these needs, we propose LAECIPS, a large vision model-assisted adaptive edge-cloud collaboration framework for IoT-based embodied intelligence systems. LAECIPS decouples large vision models in the cloud from lightweight models on the edge, enabling plug-and-play model adaptation and continual learning. Through a hard input mining-based inference strategy, LAECIPS routes complex and uncertain inspection cases to the cloud while handling routine tasks at the edge, achieving both high accuracy and low latency. Experiments conducted on a real-world robotic semantic segmentation system for visual inspection demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy, processing latency, and communication overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods. LAECIPS provides a practical and scalable foundation for embodied intelligence in smart manufacturing, especially in adaptive robotic inspection and quality control scenarios.</description>

      <title>Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Based AoI-Aware Resource Allocation for RIS-Aided IoV Networks</title>

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) is a pivotal technology in communication, offering an alternative path that significantly enhances the link quality in wireless communication environments. In this paper, we propose a RIS-assisted internet of vehicles (IoV) network, considering the vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication method. In addition, in order to improve the timeliness of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links and the stability of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links, we introduce the age of information (AoI) model and the payload transmission probability model. Therefore, with the objective of minimizing the AoI of V2I links and prioritizing transmission of V2V links payload, we construct this optimization problem as an Markov decision process (MDP) problem in which the BS serves as an agent to allocate resources and control phase-shift for the vehicles using the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm, which gradually converges and maintains a high stability. A AoI-aware joint vehicular resource allocation and RIS phase-shift control scheme based on SAC algorithm is proposed and simulation results show that its convergence speed, cumulative reward, AoI performance, and payload transmission probability outperforms those of proximal policy optimization (PPO), deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) and stochastic algorithms.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Assisted VEC Based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is an emerging technology that enables vehicles to perform high-intensity tasks by executing tasks locally or offloading them to nearby edge devices. However, obstacles such as buildings may degrade the communications and incur communication interruptions, and thus the vehicle may not meet the requirement for task offloading. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) is introduced to support vehicle communication and provide an alternative communication path. The system performance can be improved by flexibly adjusting the phase-shift of the RIS. For RIS-assisted VEC system where tasks arrive randomly, we design a control scheme that considers offloading power, local power allocation and phase-shift optimization. To solve this non-convex problem, we propose a new deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that employs modified multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) approach to optimize the power allocation for vehicle users (VUs) and block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm to optimize the phase-shift of the RIS. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme outperforms the centralized deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) scheme and random scheme.</description>

      <title>DRL-Based Federated Self-Supervised Learning for Task Offloading and Resource Allocation in ISAC-Enabled Vehicle Edge Computing</title>

Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) leverage Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) to enhance data exchange between vehicles and infrastructure in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). This integration inevitably increases computing demands, risking real-time system stability. Vehicle Edge Computing (VEC) addresses this by offloading tasks to Road Side Unit (RSU), ensuring timely services. Our previous work FLSimCo algorithm, which uses local resources for Federated Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), though vehicles often can't complete all iterations task. Our improved algorithm offloads partial task to RSU and optimizes energy consumption by adjusting transmission power, CPU frequency, and task assignment ratios, balancing local and RSU-based training. Meanwhile, setting an offloading threshold further prevents inefficiencies. Simulation results show that the enhanced algorithm reduces energy consumption, improves offloading efficiency and the accuracy of Federated SSL.</description>

      <title>Medha: Efficiently Serving Multi-Million Context Length LLM Inference Requests Without Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17264v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) handle increasingly longer contexts, serving long inference requests of millions of tokens presents unique challenges. We show that existing work for long context inference is largely based on techniques from long context training, and does not handle the high variability in input lengths during inference. This leads to inefficient resource utilization, server fragmentation, and head-of-line (HOL) blocking.
  We present Medha, an end-to-end system for efficient long-context LLM inference that addresses these challenges through fine-grained time sharing. Medha introduces three key innovations: (1) the mechanism of adaptive prefill chunking to help mitigate HOL blocking with preemption; (2) two new parallelism strategies: Sequence Pipeline Parallelism (SPP) to reduce time-to-first-token by pipelining prefill chunks, and KV-Cache Parallelism (KVP) to lower time-peroutput-token by distributing decoding across servers; and (3) a novel input-length aware least remaining slack scheduling to meet Service Level Objectives (SLOs).
  Medha enables exact inference scaling beyond 10 million tokens, maintaining high throughput and low latency across mixed-length workloads. Compared to state-of-the-art systems, Medha reduces server fragmentation, cuts median latency by up to 30x, and improves throughput by over 5x, delivering production-scale long-context inference without compromising performance on shorter requests.</description>

      <title>Ladder-residual: parallelism-aware architecture for accelerating large model inference with communication overlapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06589v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language model inference is both memory-intensive and time-consuming, often requiring distributed algorithms to efficiently scale. Various model parallelism strategies are used in multi-gpu training and inference to partition computation across multiple devices, reducing memory load and computation time. However, using model parallelism necessitates communication of information between GPUs, which has been a major bottleneck and limits the gains obtained by scaling up the number of devices. We introduce Ladder Residual, a simple architectural modification applicable to all residual-based models that enables straightforward overlapping that effectively hides the latency of communication. Our insight is that in addition to systems optimization, one can also redesign the model architecture to decouple communication from computation. While Ladder Residual can allow communication-computation decoupling in conventional parallelism patterns, we focus on Tensor Parallelism in this paper, which is particularly bottlenecked by its heavy communication. For a Transformer model with 70B parameters, applying Ladder Residual to all its layers can achieve 29% end-to-end wall clock speed up at inference time with TP sharding over 8 devices. We refer the resulting Transformer model as the Ladder Transformer. We train a 1B and 3B Ladder Transformer from scratch and observe comparable performance to a standard dense transformer baseline. We also show that it is possible to convert parts of the Llama-3.1 8B model to our Ladder Residual architecture with minimal accuracy degradation by only retraining for 3B tokens. We release our code for training and inference for easier replication of experiments.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning for MRI-based BrainAGE: a multicenter study on post-stroke functional outcome prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\textbf{Objective:}$ Brain-predicted age difference (BrainAGE) is a neuroimaging biomarker reflecting brain health. However, training robust BrainAGE models requires large datasets, often restricted by privacy concerns. This study evaluates the performance of federated learning (FL) for BrainAGE estimation in ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy, and investigates its association with clinical phenotypes and functional outcomes.
  $\textbf{Methods:}$ We used FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients across 16 hospital centers. We implemented standard machine learning and deep learning models for BrainAGE estimates under three data management strategies: centralized learning (pooled data), FL (local training at each site), and single-site learning. We reported prediction errors and examined associations between BrainAGE and vascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking), as well as functional outcomes at three months post-stroke. Logistic regression evaluated BrainAGE's predictive value for these outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, stroke severity, time between MRI and arterial puncture, prior intravenous thrombolysis, and recanalisation outcome.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ While centralized learning yielded the most accurate predictions, FL consistently outperformed single-site models. BrainAGE was significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus across all models. Comparisons between patients with good and poor functional outcomes, and multivariate predictions of these outcomes showed the significance of the association between BrainAGE and post-stroke recovery.
  $\textbf{Conclusion:}$ FL enables accurate age predictions without data centralization. The strong association between BrainAGE, vascular risk factors, and post-stroke recovery highlights its potential for prognostic modeling in stroke care.</description>
