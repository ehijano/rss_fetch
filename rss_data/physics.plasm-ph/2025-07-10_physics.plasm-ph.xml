      <title>Universal energy cascade and relaxation in three-dimensional inertial electron magnetohydrodynamic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron magnetohydrodynamics (EMHD) provides a realistic model for electron-scale heating and acceleration in weakly collisional space plasmas. A divergence-free Banerjee-Galtier type (Banerjee and Galtier, JoPA, 2017) exact relation is derived for three-dimensional homogeneous and not necessarily isotropic EMHD turbulence. By explicit calculation, it has been shown that the energy cascade is not affected by the presence of a uniform background magnetic field Bo. Using direct numerical simulations, a Kolmogorov-like energy cascade with a constant flux rate is observed across the electron inertial scale $d_e$. However, as expected, for length scales greater than $d_e$, a magnetic power spectra of $k^{-7/3}$ is obtained whereas for scales smaller than $d_e$, a $k^{-5/3}$ spectra is obtained. Similar universal cascade rate is also calculated from the scale-by-scale budget in Fourier space and is found to be equal to the one calculated using the exact law in real space. Finally, quenching the turbulence drive, the relaxation of a fully-developed EMHD turbulence is studied using the recently proposed principle of vanishing nonlinear transfers (Banerjee, Halder and Pan, PRE(L), 2023) which convincingly shows the existence of a pressure-balanced relaxed state.</description>

      <title>Phase-Space Synchronization Driven by Moon-Magnetosphere Coupling in Gas Giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new theoretical framework to describe the rapid and spatially localized loss of energetic particles in planetary radiation belts, focusing on interactions between gas giant magnetospheres and their moons. Observations show that flux depletions--known as microsignatures--often refill on timescales comparable to a single drift period, which conflicts with traditional quasi-linear radial diffusion models that assume slow, gradual transport and predict refilling only over many drift periods. To resolve this inconsistency, we develop a drift-kinetic model that explicitly captures localized losses occurring on timescales similar to the azimuthal drift period. We demonstrate that such localized loss regions can synchronize the azimuthal Fourier modes of the particle distribution function, producing apparent refilling through phase-space synchronization rather than diffusion. The resulting governing equations are mathematically equivalent to a generalized Kuramoto model, widely used to describe synchronization phenomena. This framework provides a first-principles, non-diffusive explanation for the evolution of microsignatures near moons, highlighting synchronization as a fundamental yet overlooked mechanism in magnetized plasma environments.</description>

      <title>Exact Solutions for Bimodal Distributions under Stochastic Plasma Irradiation in Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A persistent paradox complicates the study of plasma-irradiated thin films, where bimodal grain distributions and ambiguous scaling laws, roughly shifting between $\Phi^{-1/2}$ and $\Phi^{-1}$, or a general inverse dependence on plasma flux, are empirical yet remain theoretically unreconciled. Existing models fail to unify noise-driven evolution, defect saturation kinetics, and nucleation-loss balance within a single, self-consistent formalism. This work resolves these discrepancies by developing the first exact analytical theory for this system. We derive the closed-form steady-state grain area distribution, $P_{ss}(A)$, establish the precise dimensionless threshold for bimodality onset at $\Pi_c = 4/(3\sqrt{3})$, and demonstrate that defect saturation physics mandate a universal $\langle A \rangle \propto \kappa^2 \Phi^{-1} e^{+2E_b/k_B T_s}$ scaling law. The framework reveals how competition between stochastic impingement and deterministic growth triggers microstructure fragmentation, resolving long-standing ambiguities in irradiation-induced surface evolution and providing a predictive foundation for materials processing.</description>

      <title>MHD Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions for shock waves in van der Waals gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we have presented non-relativistic boundary conditions across a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shock front propagating in van der Waals gases. The expression for the strength of the non-relativistic MHD shock wave has been obtained, and the Rankine-Hugoniot (R-H) shock jump relations, or boundary conditions, for the pressure, the density, and the particle velocity across an MHD shock front have been derived in terms of a shock compression ratio. The simplified forms of shock jump relations have been written simultaneously for the weak and strong MHD shock waves in terms of the magnetic field strength, the non-idealness parameter, and the ratio of specific heats of the gas. Further, the case of weak shocks has been explored under two distinct conditions, viz., (i) when the applied magnetic field is weak and (ii) when the field is strong, respectively. The case of strong shocks has also been investigated under two distinct ways: (i) as in the purely non-magnetic case, when the ratio of densities on either side of the shock nearly equals $(\gamma+1)/(\gamma-1)$ or (ii) when the applied magnetic field is large. This is when the ambient magnetic pressure is large as compared with the ambient gas pressure. Finally, the effects on the shock strength and the pressure across the MHD shock front are studied due to the magnetic field strength and the non-idealness parameter of the gases. This study presents an overview of the influence of the magnetic field strength and the non-idealness parameter on the shock strength, the pressure, the density, and the particle velocity across the MHD shock front in van der Waals gases.</description>

      <title>Milestone toward an ECRIPAC accelerator demonstrator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Plasma ACcelerator (ECRIPAC) is an original accelerator concept proposed in the nineties for the generation of highly energetic pulsed ion beams, suitable for a wide array of applications. The initial studies on the subject were characterized by an important calculation mistake, leading to an incomplete and erroneous literature on the topic. Nevertheless, the simple and well mastered techniques involved in the system (radio frequency and magnetic field), together with the device compactness, are strong motivations for further studies on ECRIPAC. The working principle and physical theory behind the ECRIPAC accelerator concept are thoroughly reviewed in this paper, incorporating significant corrections to the existing literature on the subject, making this work a suitable reference for future studies. A detailed theoretical investigation of the stability condition for the ion acceleration is presented, highlighting more stringent limitations than previously anticipated. Next, the impact of several physical parameters on the accelerator design is analyzed. This study led to the design of a compact demonstrator device able to accelerate He2+ ions up to 9.5 MeV per nucleon inside a 1.8 m long accelerating cavity. Finally, the results of a Monte-Carlo simulation, developed to model the electron dynamics inside the system, are used to validate the theoretical framework of ECRIPAC.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear skin effect regime when a radio frequency electromagnetic field penetrates into a background plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03508v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional, electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations are employed to study particle kinetics and power deposition in the skin layer when a Radio Frequency (RF) electromagnetic field penetrates into a background plasma. We identify a new regime at low frequency ($\sim\mathrm{MHz}$) and low pressure, where the motion of electrons can be highly nonlinear in the skin region. Through most of the RF cycle, the electrons are trapped in the effective potential formed by the vector and electrostatic potentials, with energy deposition being small and magnetic moment $\mu$ no longer being an adiabatic invariant. However, for a brief period around the null of the oscillating magnetic field, the electrons get detrapped, causing a jet-like current penetrating into the bulk plasma. During these brief periods, the power deposition becomes high, exhibiting a periodic burst nature. Based on kinetic theory, we provide analytical expressions for the plasma current and energy deposition in the new regime. A criterion for transition between the newly identified low-frequency, periodic-burst regime and the usual anomalous non-local skin effect regime is proposed and verified.</description>

      <title>Surrogate-based multilevel Monte Carlo methods for uncertainty quantification in the Grad-Shafranov free boundary problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a hybrid technique to quantify the variability in the numerical solutions to a free boundary problem associated with magnetic equilibrium in axisymmetric fusion reactors amidst parameter uncertainties. The method aims at reducing computational costs by integrating a surrogate model into a multilevel Monte Carlo method. The resulting surrogate-enhanced multilevel Monte Carlo methods reduce the cost of simulation by factors as large as $10^4$ compared to standard Monte Carlo simulations involving direct numerical solutions of the associated Grad-Shafranov partial differential equation. Accuracy assessments also show that surrogate-based sampling closely aligns with the results of direct computation, confirming its effectiveness in capturing the behavior of plasma boundary and geometric descriptors.</description>

      <title>Collider-quality electron bunches from an all-optical plasma photoinjector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for generating collider-quality electron bunches using a plasma photoinjector. The approach leverages recently developed techniques for the spatiotemporal control of laser pulses to produce a moving ionization front in a nonlinear plasma wave. The moving ionization front generates an electron bunch with a current profile that balances the longitudinal electric field of an electron beam-driven plasma wave, creating a uniform accelerating field across the bunch. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of the ionization stage show the formation of an electron bunch with 220 pC charge and low emittance ($\epsilon_x = 171$ nm-rad, $\epsilon_y = 76$ nm-rad). Quasistatic PIC simulations of the acceleration stage show that the bunch is efficiently accelerated to 20 GeV over 2 meters with a final energy spread of less than 1\% and emittances of $\epsilon_x = 177$ nm-rad and $\epsilon_y = 82$ nm-rad. This high-quality electron bunch meets the requirements outlined by the Snowmass process for intermediate-energy colliders and compares favorably to the beam quality of proposed and existing accelerator facilities. The results establish the feasibility of plasma photoinjectors for future collider applications making a significant step towards the realization of high-luminosity, compact accelerators for particle physics research.</description>

      <title>Plasma refilling of the lunar wake: plasma-vacuum interactions, electrostatic shocks, and electromagnetic instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A plasma void forms downstream of the Moon when the solar wind impacts the lunar surface. This void gradually refills as the solar wind passes by, forming the lunar wake. We investigate this refilling process using a fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. The early stage of refilling follows plasma-vacuum interaction theory, characterized by exponential decay of plasma density into the wake, along with ion acceleration and cooling in the expansion direction. Our PIC simulation confirms these theoretical predictions. In the next stage of the refilling process, the counter-streaming supersonic ion beams collide, generating Debye-scale electrostatic shocks at the wake's center. These shocks decelerate and thermalize the ion beams while heating electrons into flat-top velocity distributions along magnetic field lines. Additionally, fast magnetosonic waves undergo convective growth via anomalous cyclotron resonance as they co-propagate with temperature-anisotropic ion beams toward the wake's center. Electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves may also be excited through normal cyclotron resonance, counter-propagating with these anisotropic ion beams. Our findings provide new insights into the kinetic aspects of lunar wake refilling and may enhance interpretation of spacecraft observations.</description>
