      <title>Models of Set Theory: Extensions and Dead-ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a contribution to the study of extensions of arbitrary models of ZF (Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory), with no regard to countability or well-foundedness of the models involved. We present some new constructions of certain types of extensions, and also establish the existence of models of ZF that cannot be properly end extended.</description>

      <title>An independence of the MIN principle from the PHP principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minimization principle MIN($\prec$) studied in bounded arithmetic in [Chiari, M. and Kraj\'i\v{c}ek, J. Witnessing Functions in Bounded Arithmetic and Search Problems, Journal of Symbolic Logic, 63(3):1095-1115, 1998] says that a strict linear ordering $\prec$ on any finite interval $[0,\dots,n)$ has the minimal element. We shall prove that bounded arithmetic theory $T^1_2(\prec)$ augmented by instances of the pigeonhole principle for all $\Delta^b_1(\prec)$ formulas does not prove MIN($\prec$).</description>

      <title>Subresiduated Nelson Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we generalize the well known relation between Heyting algebras and Nelson algebras in the framework of subresiduated lattices. In order to make it possible, we introduce the variety of subresiduated Nelson algebras. The main tool for its study is the construction provided by Vakarelov. Using it, we characterize the lattice of congruences of a subresiduated Nelson algebra through some of its implicative filters. We use this characterization to describe simple and subdirectly irreducible algebras, as well as principal congruences. Moreover, we prove that the variety of subresiduated Nelson algebras has equationally definable principal congruences and also the congruence extension property. Additionally, we present an equational base for the variety generated by the totally ordered subresiduated Nelson algebras. Finally, we show that there exists an equivalence between the algebraic category of subresiduated lattices and the algebraic category of centedred subresiduated Nelson algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this memoir, we seek to construct a dynamical theory as complete as possible to describe the algebraic properties of the field of real numbers in constructive mathematics without axiom of dependent choice. We propose a theory which turns out to be very close to the theory of real closed local rings in classical mathematics. The theory of real closed rings is presented here in constructive form as a natural purely equational theory, which uses virtual root functions introduced in previous work. This work is also a first step through an essential goal for the future, which is to obtain a constructive version of o-minimal structures.</description>

      <title>Model Equivalences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We look at equivalence relations on the set of models of a theory -- MERs, for short -- such that the class of equivalent pairs is itself an elementary class, in a language appropriate for pairs of models. We provide many examples of definable MERs, along with the first steps of a classification theory for them. We characterize the special classes of definable MERs associated with preservation of formulas, either in classical first order logic or in continuous logic, and uncover an intrinsic role for the latter. We bring out a nontrivial relationship with interpretations (imaginary sorts), leading to a wider hierarchy of classes related to the preservation of reducts. We give results about the relationship between these classes, both for general theories and for theories satisfying additional model-theoretic properties, such as stability.</description>

      <title>On Stability and Existence of Models in Abstract Elementary Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an abstract elementary class $\mathbf{K}$ and a cardinal $\lambda \geq LS(\mathbf{K})$, we prove under mild cardinal arithmetic assumptions, categoricity in two succesive cardinals, almost stability for $\lambda^+$-minimal types and continuity of splitting in $\lambda$, that stability in $\lambda$ is equivalent to the existence of a model in $\lambda^{++}$. The forward direction holds without any cardinal or categoricity assumptions, this result improves both [Vas18b, 12.1] and [MaYa24, 3.14].
  Moreover, we prove a categoricity theorem for abstract elementary classes with weak amalgamation and tameness under mild structural assumptions in $\lambda$. A key feature of this result is that we do not assume amalgamation or arbitrarily large models.</description>

      <title>Model-theoretic properties of nilpotent groups and Lie algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a systematic study of the model theory of generic nilpotent groups and Lie algebras. We show that the Fra\"iss\'e limit of 2-nilpotent groups of exponent $p$ studied by Baudisch is 2-dependent and NSOP$_{1}$. We prove that the class of $c$-nilpotent Lie algebras over an arbitrary field, in a language with predicates for a Lazard series, is closed under free amalgamation. We show that for $2 &lt; c$, the generic $c$-nilpotent Lie algebra over $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ is strictly NSOP$_{4}$ and $c$-dependent. Via the Lazard correspondence, we obtain the same result for $c$-nilpotent groups of exponent $p$, for an odd prime $p &gt; c$.</description>

      <title>C-minimal fields have the exchange property</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that C-minimal fields (i.e., C-minimal expansions of ACVF) have the exchange property, answering a question of Haskell and Macpherson. Additionally, we strengthen some theorems of Cubides Kovacsics and Delon on C-minimal fields. First, we show that definably complete C-minimal fields of characteristic 0 have generic differentiability. Second, we show that if the induced structure on the residue field is a pure ACF, then polynomial boundedness holds. In fact, polynomial boundedness can only fail if there are unexpected definable automorphisms of the multiplicative group of the residue field.</description>

      <title>On Quantifiers for Quantitative Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04936v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a kind of first-order predicate logic with intended semantics in the reals. Compared to other approaches in the literature, we work predominantly in the multiplicative reals $[0,\infty]$, showing they support three generations of connectives, that we call non-linear, linear additive, and linear multiplicative. Means and harmonic means emerge as natural candidates for bounded existential and universal quantifiers, and in fact we see they behave as expected in relation to the other logical connectives. We explain this fact through the well-known fact that min/max and arithmetic mean/harmonic mean sit at opposite ends of a spectrum, that of p-means. We give syntax and semantics for this quantitative predicate logic, and as example applications, we show how softmax is the quantitative semantics of argmax, and R\'enyi entropy/Hill numbers are additive/multiplicative semantics of the same formula. Indeed, the additive reals also fit into the story by exploiting the Napierian duality $-\log \dashv 1/\exp$, which highlights a formal distinction between 'additive' and 'multiplicative' quantities. Finally, we describe two attempts at a categorical semantics via enriched hyperdoctrines. We discuss why hyperdoctrines are in fact probably inadequate for this kind of logic.</description>

      <title>Goldblat-Thomason Theorems for Fundamental (Modal) Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Holliday recently introduced a non-classical logic called Fundamental Logic, which intends to capture exactly those properties of the connectives "and", "or" and "not" that hold in virtue of their introduction and elimination rules in Fitch's natural deduction system for propositional logic. Holliday provides an intuitive relational semantics for fundamental logic which generalizes both Goldblatt's semantics for orthologic and Kripke semantics for intuitionistic logic. In this paper, we further the analysis of this semantics by providing a Goldblatt-Thomason theorem for Fundamental Logic. We identify necessary and sufficient conditions on a class K of fundamental frames for it to be axiomatic, i.e., to be the class of frames satisfying some logic extending Fundamental Logic. As a straightforward application of our main result, we also obtain a Goldblatt-Thomason theorem for Fundamental Modal Logic, which extends Fundamental Logic with standard Box and Diamond operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.01190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a theorem of Groves and Wilton, we propose the study of the lattice of numberings of isomorphism classes of marked groups as a rigorous and comprehensive framework to study global decision problems for finitely generated groups. We establish the Rice and Rice-Shapiro Theorems for recursive presentations, and establish similar results for co-recursive presentations. We give an algorithmic characterization of finitely presentable groups in terms of semi-decidability of two decision problems: the word problem and the marked quotient problem, which we introduce. We explain how this result can be used to define algorithmic generalizations of finite presentations. Finally, we discuss how the Adian-Rabin Theorem provides incomplete answers in several respects.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Theories of Classes Defined by Forbidden Homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.01404v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the first-order almost-sure theories for classes of finite structures that are specified by homomorphically forbidding a set $\mathcal{F}$ of finite structures. If $\mathcal{F}$ consists of undirected graphs, a full description of these theories can be derived from the Kolaitis-Pr\"omel-Rothschild theorem, which treats the special case where $\mathcal{F} = \{K_n\}$. The corresponding question for finite sets $\mathcal{F}$ of finite directed graphs is wide open. We present a full description of the almost-sure theories of classes described by homomorphically forbidding finite sets $\mathcal{F}$ of oriented trees; all of them are $\omega$-categorical. In our proof, we establish a result of independent interest, namely that every constraint satisfaction problem for a finite digraph has first-order convergence, and that the corresponding asymptotic theory can be described as a finite linear combination of $\omega$-categorical theories.</description>
