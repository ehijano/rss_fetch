      <title>The Useful Side of Motion: Using Head Motion Parameters to Correct for Respiratory Confounds in BOLD fMRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acquiring accurate external respiratory data during functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is challenging, prompting the exploration of machine learning methods to estimate respiratory variation (RV) from fMRI data. Respiration induces head motion, including real and pseudo motion, which likely provides useful information about respiratory events. Recommended notch filters mitigate respiratory-induced motion artifacts, suggesting that a bandpass filter at the respiratory frequency band isolates respiratory-induced head motion. This study seeks to enhance the accuracy of RV estimation from resting-state BOLD-fMRI data by integrating estimated head motion parameters. Specifically, we aim to determine the impact of incorporating raw versus bandpass-filtered head motion parameters on RV reconstruction accuracy using one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs). This approach addresses the limitations of traditional filtering techniques and leverages the potential of head motion data to provide a more robust estimation of respiratory-induced variations.</description>

      <title>Training Compute-Optimal Vision Transformers for Brain Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal training of a vision transformer for brain encoding depends on three factors: model size, data size, and computational resources. This study investigates these three pillars, focusing on the effects of data scaling, model scaling, and high-performance computing on brain encoding results. Using VideoGPT to extract efficient spatiotemporal features from videos and training a Ridge model to predict brain activity based on these features, we conducted benchmark experiments with varying data sizes (10k, 100k, 1M, 6M) and different model configurations of GPT-2, including hidden layer dimensions, number of layers, and number of attention heads. We also evaluated the effects of training models with 32-bit vs 16-bit floating point representations. Our results demonstrate that increasing the hidden layer dimensions significantly improves brain encoding performance, as evidenced by higher Pearson correlation coefficients across all subjects. In contrast, the number of attention heads does not have a significant effect on the encoding results. Additionally, increasing the number of layers shows some improvement in brain encoding correlations, but the trend is not as consistent as that observed with hidden layer dimensions. The data scaling results show that larger training datasets lead to improved brain encoding performance, with the highest Pearson correlation coefficients observed for the largest dataset size (6M). These findings highlight that the effects of data scaling are more significant compared to model scaling in enhancing brain encoding performance. Furthermore, we explored the impact of floating-point precision by comparing 32-bit and 16-bit representations. Training with 16-bit precision yielded the same brain encoding accuracy as 32-bit, while reducing training time by 1.17 times, demonstrating its efficiency for high-performance computing tasks.</description>

      <title>Threshold-Based Automated Pest Detection System for Sustainable Agriculture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a threshold-based automated pea weevil detection system, developed as part of the Microsoft FarmVibes project. Based on Internet-of-Things (IoT) and computer vision, the system is designed to monitor and manage pea weevil populations in agricultural settings, with the goal of enhancing crop production and promoting sustainable farming practices. Unlike the machine learning-based approaches, our detection approach relies on binary grayscale thresholding and contour detection techniques determined by the pea weevil sizes. We detail the design of the product, the system architecture, the integration of hardware and software components, and the overall technology strategy. Our test results demonstrate significant effectiveness in weevil management and offer promising scalability for deployment in resource-constrained environments. In addition, the software has been open-sourced for the global research community.</description>

      <title>Advancing Histopathology with Deep Learning Under Data Scarcity: A Decade in Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years witnessed remarkable progress in computational histopathology, largely fueled by deep learning. This brought the clinical adoption of deep learning-based tools within reach, promising significant benefits to healthcare, offering a valuable second opinion on diagnoses, streamlining complex tasks, and mitigating the risks of inconsistency and bias in clinical decisions. However, a well-known challenge is that deep learning models may contain up to billions of parameters; supervising their training effectively would require vast labeled datasets to achieve reliable generalization and noise resilience. In medical imaging, particularly histopathology, amassing such extensive labeled data collections places additional demands on clinicians and incurs higher costs, which hinders the art's progress. Addressing this challenge, researchers devised various strategies for leveraging deep learning with limited data and annotation availability. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of deep learning applications in histopathology, with a focus on the challenges posed by data scarcity over the past decade. We systematically categorize and compare various approaches, evaluate their distinct contributions using benchmarking tables, and highlight their respective advantages and limitations. Additionally, we address gaps in existing reviews and identify underexplored research opportunities, underscoring the potential for future advancements in this field.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we addressed the challenge of multi-class anomaly classification in Video Capsule Endoscopy (VCE)[1] with a variety of deep learning models, ranging from custom CNNs to advanced transformer architectures. The purpose is to correctly classify diverse gastrointestinal disorders, which is critical for increasing diagnostic efficiency in clinical settings. We started with a proprietary CNN and improved performance with ResNet[7] for better feature extraction, followed by Vision Transformer (ViT)[2] to capture global dependencies. Multiscale Vision Transformer (MViT)[6] improved hierarchical feature extraction, while Dual Attention Vision Transformer (DaViT)[4] delivered cutting-edge results by combining spatial and channel attention methods. This methodology enabled us to improve model accuracy across a wide range of criteria, greatly surpassing older methods.</description>

      <title>Transforming Precision: A Comparative Analysis of Vision Transformers, CNNs, and Traditional ML for Knee Osteoarthritis Severity Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis(KO) is a degenerative joint disease that can cause severe pain and impairment. With increased prevalence, precise diagnosis by medical imaging analytics is crucial for appropriate illness management. This research investigates a comparative analysis between traditional machine learning techniques and new deep learning models for diagnosing KO severity from X-ray pictures. This study does not introduce new architectural innovations but rather illuminates the robust applicability and comparative effectiveness of pre-existing ViT models in a medical imaging context, specifically for KO severity diagnosis. The insights garnered from this comparative analysis advocate for the integration of advanced ViT models in clinical diagnostic workflows, potentially revolutionizing the precision and reliability of KO assessments. This study does not introduce new architectural innovations but rather illuminates the robust applicability and comparative effectiveness of pre-existing ViT models in a medical imaging context, specifically for KO severity diagnosis. The insights garnered from this comparative analysis advocate for the integration of advanced ViT models in clinical diagnostic workflows, potentially revolutionizing the precision &amp; reliability of KO assessments. The study utilizes an osteoarthritis dataset from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) comprising images with 5 severity categories and uneven class distribution. While classic machine learning models like GaussianNB and KNN struggle in feature extraction, Convolutional Neural Networks such as Inception-V3, VGG-19 achieve better accuracy between 55-65% by learning hierarchical visual patterns. However, Vision Transformer architectures like Da-VIT, GCViT and MaxViT emerge as indisputable champions, displaying 66.14% accuracy, 0.703 precision, 0.614 recall, AUC exceeding 0.835 thanks to self-attention processes.</description>

      <title>Super-resolved virtual staining of label-free tissue using diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual staining of tissue offers a powerful tool for transforming label-free microscopy images of unstained tissue into equivalents of histochemically stained samples. This study presents a diffusion model-based super-resolution virtual staining approach utilizing a Brownian bridge process to enhance both the spatial resolution and fidelity of label-free virtual tissue staining, addressing the limitations of traditional deep learning-based methods. Our approach integrates novel sampling techniques into a diffusion model-based image inference process to significantly reduce the variance in the generated virtually stained images, resulting in more stable and accurate outputs. Blindly applied to lower-resolution auto-fluorescence images of label-free human lung tissue samples, the diffusion-based super-resolution virtual staining model consistently outperformed conventional approaches in resolution, structural similarity and perceptual accuracy, successfully achieving a super-resolution factor of 4-5x, increasing the output space-bandwidth product by 16-25-fold compared to the input label-free microscopy images. Diffusion-based super-resolved virtual tissue staining not only improves resolution and image quality but also enhances the reliability of virtual staining without traditional chemical staining, offering significant potential for clinical diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Community Vision Screening -- AI Driven Retinal Photography for Early Disease Detection and Patient Trust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community vision screening plays a crucial role in identifying individuals with vision loss and preventing avoidable blindness, particularly in rural communities where access to eye care services is limited. Currently, there is a pressing need for a simple and efficient process to screen and refer individuals with significant eye disease-related vision loss to tertiary eye care centers for further care. An ideal solution should seamlessly and readily integrate with existing workflows, providing comprehensive initial screening results to service providers, thereby enabling precise patient referrals for timely treatment. This paper introduces the Enhancing Community Vision Screening (ECVS) solution, which addresses the aforementioned concerns with a novel and feasible solution based on simple, non-invasive retinal photography for the detection of pathology-based visual impairment. Our study employs four distinct deep learning models: RETinal photo Quality Assessment (RETQA), Pathology Visual Impairment detection (PVI), Eye Disease Diagnosis (EDD) and Visualization of Lesion Regions of the eye (VLR). We conducted experiments on over 10 datasets, totaling more than 80,000 fundus photos collected from various sources. The models integrated into ECVS achieved impressive AUC scores of 0.98 for RETQA, 0.95 for PVI, and 0.90 for EDD, along with a DICE coefficient of 0.48 for VLR. These results underscore the promising capabilities of ECVS as a straightforward and scalable method for community-based vision screening.</description>

      <title>Guidance Disentanglement Network for Optics-Guided Thermal UAV Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optics-guided Thermal UAV image Super-Resolution (OTUAV-SR) has attracted significant research interest due to its potential applications in security inspection, agricultural measurement, and object detection. Existing methods often employ single guidance model to generate the guidance features from optical images to assist thermal UAV images super-resolution. However, single guidance models make it difficult to generate effective guidance features under favorable and adverse conditions in UAV scenarios, thus limiting the performance of OTUAV-SR. To address this issue, we propose a novel Guidance Disentanglement network (GDNet), which disentangles the optical image representation according to typical UAV scenario attributes to form guidance features under both favorable and adverse conditions, for robust OTUAV-SR. Moreover, we design an attribute-aware fusion module to combine all attribute-based optical guidance features, which could form a more discriminative representation and fit the attribute-agnostic guidance process. To facilitate OTUAV-SR research in complex UAV scenarios, we introduce VGTSR2.0, a large-scale benchmark dataset containing 3,500 aligned optical-thermal image pairs captured under diverse conditions and scenes. Extensive experiments on VGTSR2.0 demonstrate that GDNet significantly improves OTUAV-SR performance over state-of-the-art methods, especially in the challenging low-light and foggy environments commonly encountered in UAV scenarios. The dataset and code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Jocelyney/GDNet.</description>

      <title>Search Wide, Focus Deep: Automated Fetal Brain Extraction with Sparse Training Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20532v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated fetal brain extraction from full-uterus MRI is a challenging task due to variable head sizes, orientations, complex anatomy, and prevalent artifacts. While deep-learning (DL) models trained on synthetic images have been successful in adult brain extraction, adapting these networks for fetal MRI is difficult due to the sparsity of labeled data, leading to increased false-positive predictions. To address this challenge, we propose a test-time strategy that reduces false positives in networks trained on sparse, synthetic labels. The approach uses a breadth-fine search (BFS) to identify a subvolume likely to contain the fetal brain, followed by a deep-focused sliding window (DFS) search to refine the extraction, pooling predictions to minimize false positives. We train models at different window sizes using synthetic images derived from a small number of fetal brain label maps, augmented with random geometric shapes. Each model is trained on diverse head positions and scales, including cases with partial or no brain tissue. Our framework matches state-of-the-art brain extraction methods on clinical HASTE scans of third-trimester fetuses and exceeds them by up to 5\% in terms of Dice in the second trimester as well as EPI scans across both trimesters. Our results demonstrate the utility of a sliding-window approach and combining predictions from several models trained on synthetic images, for improving brain-extraction accuracy by progressively refining regions of interest and minimizing the risk of missing brain mask slices or misidentifying other tissues as brain.</description>

      <title>Sebica: Lightweight Spatial and Efficient Bidirectional Channel Attention Super Resolution Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) is a vital technique for improving the visual quality of low-resolution images. While recent deep learning models have made significant advancements in SISR, they often encounter computational challenges that hinder their deployment in resource-limited or time-sensitive environments. To overcome these issues, we present Sebica, a lightweight network that incorporates spatial and efficient bidirectional channel attention mechanisms. Sebica significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining high reconstruction quality, achieving PSNR/SSIM scores of 28.29/0.7976 and 30.18/0.8330 on the Div2K and Flickr2K datasets, respectively. These results surpass most baseline lightweight models and are comparable to the highest-performing model, but with only 17% and 15% of the parameters and GFLOPs. Additionally, our small version of Sebica has only 7.9K parameters and 0.41 GFLOPS, representing just 3% of the parameters and GFLOPs of the highest-performing model, while still achieving PSNR and SSIM metrics of 28.12/0.7931 and 0.3009/0.8317, on the Flickr2K dataset respectively. In addition, Sebica demonstrates significant improvements in real-world applications, specifically in object detection tasks, where it enhances detection accuracy in traffic video scenarios.</description>

      <title>Super Resolution Based on Deep Operator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) to perform super-resolution reconstruction of the solutions of two types of partial differential equations and compare the model predictions with the results obtained using conventional interpolation methods to verify the advantages of DeepONets. We employ two pooling methods to downsample the origin data and conduct super-resolution reconstruction under three different resolutions of input images. The results show that the DeepONet model can predict high-frequency oscillations and small-scale structures from low-resolution inputs very well. For the two-dimensional problem, we introduce convolutional layers to extract information from input images at a lower cost than purer MLPs. We adjust the size of the training set and observe the variation of prediction errors. In both one-dimensional and two-dimensional cases, the super-resolution reconstruction using the DeepONet model demonstrates much more accurate prediction results than cubic spline interpolation, highlighting the superiority of operator learning methods in handling such problems compared to traditional interpolation techniques.</description>

      <title>CardiacNet: Learning to Reconstruct Abnormalities for Cardiac Disease Assessment from Echocardiogram Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Echocardiogram video plays a crucial role in analysing cardiac function and diagnosing cardiac diseases. Current deep neural network methods primarily aim to enhance diagnosis accuracy by incorporating prior knowledge, such as segmenting cardiac structures or lesions annotated by human experts. However, diagnosing the inconsistent behaviours of the heart, which exist across both spatial and temporal dimensions, remains extremely challenging. For instance, the analysis of cardiac motion acquires both spatial and temporal information from the heartbeat cycle. To address this issue, we propose a novel reconstruction-based approach named CardiacNet to learn a better representation of local cardiac structures and motion abnormalities through echocardiogram videos. CardiacNet is accompanied by the Consistency Deformation Codebook (CDC) and the Consistency Deformed-Discriminator (CDD) to learn the commonalities across abnormal and normal samples by incorporating cardiac prior knowledge. In addition, we propose benchmark datasets named CardiacNet-PAH and CardiacNet-ASD to evaluate the effectiveness of cardiac disease assessment. In experiments, our CardiacNet can achieve state-of-the-art results in three different cardiac disease assessment tasks on public datasets CAMUS, EchoNet, and our datasets. The code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/xmed-lab/CardiacNet.</description>

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) has gained increasing attention at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing. Its capability to interpret radiological images and deliver precise answers to clinical inquiries positions MedVQA as a valuable tool for supporting diagnostic decision-making for physicians and alleviating the workload on radiologists. While recent approaches focus on using unified pre-trained large models for multi-modal fusion like cross-modal Transformers, research on more efficient fusion methods remains relatively scarce within this discipline. In this paper, we introduce a novel fusion model that integrates Orthogonality loss, Multi-head attention and Bilinear Attention Network (OMniBAN) to achieve high computational efficiency and strong performance without the need for pre-training. We conduct comprehensive experiments and clarify aspects of how to enhance bilinear attention fusion to achieve performance comparable to that of large models. Experimental results show that OMniBAN outperforms traditional models on key MedVQA benchmarks while maintaining a lower computational cost, which indicates its potential for efficient clinical application in radiology and pathology image question answering.</description>

      <title>KaLDeX: Kalman Filter based Linear Deformable Cross Attention for Retina Vessel Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background and Objective: In the realm of ophthalmic imaging, accurate vascular segmentation is paramount for diagnosing and managing various eye diseases. Contemporary deep learning-based vascular segmentation models rival human accuracy but still face substantial challenges in accurately segmenting minuscule blood vessels in neural network applications. Due to the necessity of multiple downsampling operations in the CNN models, fine details from high-resolution images are inevitably lost. The objective of this study is to design a structure to capture the delicate and small blood vessels. Methods: To address these issues, we propose a novel network (KaLDeX) for vascular segmentation leveraging a Kalman filter based linear deformable cross attention (LDCA) module, integrated within a UNet++ framework. Our approach is based on two key components: Kalman filter (KF) based linear deformable convolution (LD) and cross-attention (CA) modules. The LD module is designed to adaptively adjust the focus on thin vessels that might be overlooked in standard convolution. The CA module improves the global understanding of vascular structures by aggregating the detailed features from the LD module with the high level features from the UNet++ architecture. Finally, we adopt a topological loss function based on persistent homology to constrain the topological continuity of the segmentation. Results: The proposed method is evaluated on retinal fundus image datasets (DRIVE, CHASE_BD1, and STARE) as well as the 3mm and 6mm of the OCTA-500 dataset, achieving an average accuracy (ACC) of 97.25%, 97.77%, 97.85%, 98.89%, and 98.21%, respectively. Conclusions: Empirical evidence shows that our method outperforms the current best models on different vessel segmentation datasets.

      <title>Movie Trailer Genre Classification Using Multimodal Pretrained Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for movie genre classification, capitalizing on a diverse set of readily accessible pretrained models. These models extract high-level features related to visual scenery, objects, characters, text, speech, music, and audio effects. To intelligently fuse these pretrained features, we train small classifier models with low time and memory requirements. Employing the transformer model, our approach utilizes all video and audio frames of movie trailers without performing any temporal pooling, efficiently exploiting the correspondence between all elements, as opposed to the fixed and low number of frames typically used by traditional methods. Our approach fuses features originating from different tasks and modalities, with different dimensionalities, different temporal lengths, and complex dependencies as opposed to current approaches. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art movie genre classification models in terms of precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP). To foster future research, we make the pretrained features for the entire MovieNet dataset, along with our genre classification code and the trained models, publicly available.</description>

      <title>A New Perspective to Boost Performance Fairness for Medical Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving the fairness of federated learning (FL) benefits healthy and sustainable collaboration, especially for medical applications. However, existing fair FL methods ignore the specific characteristics of medical FL applications, i.e., domain shift among the datasets from different hospitals. In this work, we propose Fed-LWR to improve performance fairness from the perspective of feature shift, a key issue influencing the performance of medical FL systems caused by domain shift. Specifically, we dynamically perceive the bias of the global model across all hospitals by estimating the layer-wise difference in feature representations between local and global models. To minimize global divergence, we assign higher weights to hospitals with larger differences. The estimated client weights help us to re-aggregate the local models per layer to obtain a fairer global model. We evaluate our method on two widely used federated medical image segmentation benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our method achieves better and fairer performance compared with several state-of-the-art fair FL methods.</description>

      <title>Upsampling DINOv2 features for unsupervised vision tasks and weakly supervised materials segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The features of self-supervised vision transformers (ViTs) contain strong semantic and positional information relevant to downstream tasks like object localization and segmentation. Recent works combine these features with traditional methods like clustering, graph partitioning or region correlations to achieve impressive baselines without finetuning or training additional networks. We leverage upsampled features from ViT networks (e.g DINOv2) in two workflows: in a clustering based approach for object localization and segmentation, and paired with standard classifiers in weakly supervised materials segmentation. Both show strong performance on benchmarks, especially in weakly supervised segmentation where the ViT features capture complex relationships inaccessible to classical approaches. We expect the flexibility and generalizability of these features will both speed up and strengthen materials characterization, from segmentation to property-prediction.</description>

      <title>Scene-Segmentation-Based Exposure Compensation for Tone Mapping of High Dynamic Range Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel scene-segmentation-based exposure compensation method for multi-exposure image fusion (MEF) based tone mapping. The aim of MEF-based tone mapping is to display high dynamic range (HDR) images on devices with limited dynamic range. To achieve this, this method generates a stack of differently exposed images from an input HDR image and fuses them into a single image. Our approach addresses the limitations of MEF-based tone mapping with existing segmentation-based exposure compensation, which often result in visually unappealing outcomes due to inappropriate exposure value selection. The proposed exposure compensation method first segments the input HDR image into subregions based on luminance values of pixels. It then determines exposure values for multi-exposure images to maximize contrast between regions while preserving relative luminance relationships. This approach contrasts with conventional methods that may invert luminance relationships or compromise contrast between regions. Additionally, we present an improved technique for calculating fusion weights to better reflect the effects of exposure compensation in the final fused image. In a simulation experiment to evaluate the quality of tone-mapped images, the MEF-based tone mapping with the proposed method outperforms three typical tone mapping methods including conventional MEF-based one, in terms of the tone mapped image quality index (TMQI).</description>

      <title>Resolving Domain Shift For Representations Of Speech In Non-Invasive Brain Recordings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques have enabled researchers to leverage neuroimaging data to decode speech from brain activity, with some amazing recent successes achieved by applications built using invasive devices. However, research requiring surgical implants has a number of practical limitations. Non-invasive neuroimaging techniques provide an alternative but come with their own set of challenges, the limited scale of individual studies being among them. Without the ability to pool the recordings from different non-invasive studies, data on the order of magnitude needed to leverage deep learning techniques to their full potential remains out of reach. In this work, we focus on non-invasive data collected using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We leverage two different, leading speech decoding models to investigate how an adversarial domain adaptation framework augments their ability to generalize across datasets. We successfully improve the performance of both models when training across multiple datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first ever application of feature-level, deep learning based harmonization for MEG neuroimaging data. Our analysis additionally offers further evidence of the impact of demographic features on neuroimaging data, demonstrating that participant age strongly affects how machine learning models solve speech decoding tasks using MEG data. Lastly, in the course of this study we produce a new open-source implementation of one of these models to the benefit of the broader scientific community.</description>

      <title>Photon-Counting CT in Cancer Radiotherapy: Technological Advances and Clinical Benefits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon-counting computed tomography (PCCT) marks a significant advancement over conventional energy-integrating detector (EID) CT systems. This review highlights PCCT's superior spatial and contrast resolution, reduced radiation dose, and multi-energy imaging capabilities, which address key challenges in radiotherapy, such as accurate tumor delineation, precise dose calculation, and treatment response monitoring. PCCT's improved anatomical clarity enhances tumor targeting while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissues. Additionally, metal artifact reduction (MAR) and quantitative imaging capabilities optimize workflows, enabling adaptive radiotherapy and radiomics-driven personalized treatment. Emerging clinical applications in brachytherapy and radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) show promising outcomes, although challenges like high costs and limited software integration remain. With advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and dedicated radiotherapy packages, PCCT is poised to transform precision, safety, and efficacy in cancer radiotherapy, marking it as a pivotal technology for future clinical practice.</description>

Abstract: Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and Digital Image Processing (DIP) with Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are popular research areas in Computer Vision and related fields. We highlight transformative applications in image enhancement, filtering techniques, and pattern recognition.

      <title>Wavelet-based Mamba with Fourier Adjustment for Low-light Image Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency information (e.g., Discrete Wavelet Transform and Fast Fourier Transform) has been widely applied to solve the issue of Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE). However, existing frequency-based models primarily operate in the simple wavelet or Fourier space of images, which lacks utilization of valid global and local information in each space. We found that wavelet frequency information is more sensitive to global brightness due to its low-frequency component while Fourier frequency information is more sensitive to local details due to its phase component. In order to achieve superior preliminary brightness enhancement by optimally integrating spatial channel information with low-frequency components in the wavelet transform, we introduce channel-wise Mamba, which compensates for the long-range dependencies of CNNs and has lower complexity compared to Diffusion and Transformer models. So in this work, we propose a novel Wavelet-based Mamba with Fourier Adjustment model called WalMaFa, consisting of a Wavelet-based Mamba Block (WMB) and a Fast Fourier Adjustment Block (FFAB). We employ an Encoder-Latent-Decoder structure to accomplish the end-to-end transformation. Specifically, WMB is adopted in the Encoder and Decoder to enhance global brightness while FFAB is adopted in the Latent to fine-tune local texture details and alleviate ambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed WalMaFa achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer computational resources and faster speed. Code is now available at: https://github.com/mcpaulgeorge/WalMaFa.</description>

      <title>Depth Attention for Robust RGB Tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RGB video object tracking is a fundamental task in computer vision. Its effectiveness can be improved using depth information, particularly for handling motion-blurred target. However, depth information is often missing in commonly used tracking benchmarks. In this work, we propose a new framework that leverages monocular depth estimation to counter the challenges of tracking targets that are out of view or affected by motion blur in RGB video sequences. Specifically, our work introduces following contributions. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a depth attention mechanism and to formulate a simple framework that allows seamlessly integration of depth information with state of the art tracking algorithms, without RGB-D cameras, elevating accuracy and robustness. We provide extensive experiments on six challenging tracking benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that our approach provides consistent gains over several strong baselines and achieves new SOTA performance. We believe that our method will open up new possibilities for more sophisticated VOT solutions in real-world scenarios. Our code and models are publicly released: https://github.com/LiuYuML/Depth-Attention.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interrupted X-ray computed tomography (X-CT) has been the common way to observe the deformation of materials during an experiment. While this approach is effective for quasi-static experiments, it has never been possible to reconstruct a full 3d tomography during a dynamic experiment which cannot be interrupted. In this work, we propose that neural rendering tools can be used to drive the paradigm shift to enable 3d reconstruction during dynamic events. First, we derive theoretical results to support the selection of projections angles. Via a combination of synthetic and experimental data, we demonstrate that neural radiance fields can reconstruct data modalities of interest more efficiently than conventional reconstruction methods. Finally, we develop a spatio-temporal model with spline-based deformation field and demonstrate that such model can reconstruct the spatio-temporal deformation of lattice samples in real-world experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Co-examination of second-harmonic generation (SHG) and bright-field (BF) microscopy enables the differentiation of tissue components and collagen fibers, aiding the analysis of human breast and pancreatic cancer tissues. However, large discrepancies between SHG and BF images pose challenges for current learning-based registration models in aligning SHG to BF. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal registration framework that employs fidelity-imposed displacement editing to address these challenges. The framework integrates batch-wise contrastive learning, feature-based pre-alignment, and instance-level optimization. Experimental results from the Learn2Reg COMULISglobe SHG-BF Challenge validate the effectiveness of our method, securing the 1st place on the online leaderboard.</description>

      <title>Robust Segmentation of CPR-Induced Capnogram Using U-net: Overcoming Challenges with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: The accurate segmentation of capnograms during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is essential for effective patient monitoring and advanced airway management. This study aims to develop a robust algorithm using a U-net architecture to segment capnograms into inhalation and non-inhalation phases, and to demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art (SoA) methods in the presence of CPR-induced artifacts.
  Materials and methods: A total of 24354 segments of one minute extracted from 1587 patients were used to train and evaluate the model. The proposed U-net architecture was tested using patient-wise 10-fold cross-validation. A set of five features was extracted for clustering analysis to evaluate the algorithm performance across different signal characteristics and contexts. The evaluation metrics included segmentation-level and ventilation-level metrics, including ventilation rate and end-tidal-CO$_2$ values.
  Results: The proposed U-net based algorithm achieved an F1-score of 98% for segmentation and 96% for ventilation detection, outperforming existing SoA methods by 4 points. The root mean square error for end-tidal-CO$_2$ and ventilation rate were 1.9 mmHg and 1.1 breaths per minute, respectively.
  Detailed performance metrics highlighted the algorithm's robustness against CPR-induced interferences and low amplitude signals. Clustering analysis further demonstrated consistent performance across various signal characteristics.
  Conclusion: The proposed U-net based segmentation algorithm improves the accuracy of capnogram analysis during CPR. Its enhanced performance in detecting inhalation phases and ventilation events offers a reliable tool for clinical applications, potentially improving patient outcomes during cardiac arrest.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, learned image compression methods have demonstrated superior rate-distortion performance compared to traditional image compression methods. Recent methods utilize convolutional neural networks (CNN), variational autoencoders (VAE), invertible neural networks (INN), and transformers. Despite their significant contributions, a main drawback of these models is their poor performance in capturing local redundancy. Therefore, to leverage global features along with local redundancy, we propose a CNN-based solution integrated with a feature encoding module. The feature encoding module encodes important features before feeding them to the CNN and then utilizes cross-scale window-based attention, which further captures local redundancy. Cross-scale window-based attention is inspired by the attention mechanism in transformers and effectively enlarges the receptive field. Both the feature encoding module and the cross-scale window-based attention module in our architecture are flexible and can be incorporated into any other network architecture. We evaluate our method on the Kodak and CLIC datasets and demonstrate that our approach is effective and on par with state-of-the-art methods.</description>

Abstract: Treatment selection in breast cancer is guided by molecular subtypes and clinical characteristics. Recurrence risk assessment plays a crucial role in personalizing treatment. Current methods, including genomic assays, have limited accuracy and clinical utility, leading to suboptimal decisions for many patients. We developed a test for breast cancer patient stratification based on digital pathology and clinical characteristics using novel AI methods. Specifically, we utilized a vision transformer-based pan-cancer foundation model trained with self-supervised learning to extract features from digitized H&amp;E-stained slides. These features were integrated with clinical data to form a multi-modal AI test predicting cancer recurrence and death. The test was developed and evaluated using data from a total of 8,161 breast cancer patients across 15 cohorts originating from seven countries. Of these, 3,502 patients from five cohorts were used exclusively for evaluation, while the remaining patients were used for training. Our test accurately predicted our primary endpoint, disease-free interval, in the five external cohorts (C-index: 0.71 [0.68-0.75], HR: 3.63 [3.02-4.37, p&lt;0.01]). In a direct comparison (N=858), the AI test was more accurate than Oncotype DX, the standard-of-care 21-gene assay, with a C-index of 0.67 [0.61-0.74] versus 0.61 [0.49-0.73], respectively. Additionally, the AI test added independent information to Oncotype DX in a multivariate analysis (HR: 3.11 [1.91-5.09, p&lt;0.01)]). The test demonstrated robust accuracy across all major breast cancer subtypes, including TNBC (C-index: 0.71 [0.62-0.81], HR: 3.81 [2.35-6.17, p=0.02]), where no diagnostic tools are currently recommended by clinical guidelines. These results suggest that our AI test can improve accuracy, extend applicability to a wider range of patients, and enhance access to treatment selection tools.</description>

Abstract: The credibility of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in medical imaging, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, has been challenged by reproducibility issues and obscured clinical insights. To address these concerns, we propose a Virtual Imaging Trials (VIT) framework, utilizing both clinical and simulated datasets to evaluate AI systems. This study focuses on using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for COVID-19 diagnosis using computed tomography (CT) and chest radiography (CXR). We developed and tested multiple AI models, 3D ResNet-like and 2D EfficientNetv2 architectures, across diverse datasets. Our evaluation metrics included the area under the curve (AUC). Statistical analyses, such as the DeLong method for AUC confidence intervals, were employed to assess performance differences. Our findings demonstrate that VIT provides a robust platform for objective assessment, revealing significant influences of dataset characteristics, patient factors, and imaging physics on AI efficacy. Notably, models trained on the most diverse datasets showed the highest external testing performance, with AUC values ranging from 0.73 to 0.76 for CT and 0.70 to 0.73 for CXR. Internal testing yielded higher AUC values (0.77 to 0.85 for CT and 0.77 to 1.0 for CXR), highlighting a substantial drop in performance during external validation, which underscores the importance of diverse and comprehensive training and testing data. This approach enhances model transparency and reliability, offering nuanced insights into the factors driving AI performance and bridging the gap between experimental and clinical settings. The study underscores the potential of VIT to improve the reproducibility and clinical relevance of AI systems in medical imaging.</description>

      <title>Immunohistochemistry guided segmentation of benign epithelial cells, in situ lesions, and invasive epithelial cells in breast cancer slides</title>

Abstract: Digital pathology enables automatic analysis of histopathological sections using artificial intelligence (AI). Automatic evaluation could improve diagnostic efficiency and help find associations between morphological features and clinical outcome. For development of such prediction models, identifying invasive epithelial cells, and separating these from benign epithelial cells and in situ lesions would be the first step. In this study, we aimed to develop an AI model for segmentation of epithelial cells in sections from breast cancer. We generated epithelial ground truth masks by restaining hematoxylin and eosin (HE) sections with cytokeratin (CK) AE1/AE3, and by pathologists' annotations. HE/CK image pairs were used to train a convolutional neural network, and data augmentation was used to make the model more robust. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) from 839 patients, and whole slide images from two patients were used for training and evaluation of the models. The sections were derived from four cohorts of breast cancer patients. TMAs from 21 patients from a fifth cohort was used as a second test set. In quantitative evaluation, a mean Dice score of 0.70, 0.79, and 0.75 for invasive epithelial cells, benign epithelial cells, and in situ lesions, respectively, were achieved. In qualitative scoring (0-5) by pathologists, results were best for all epithelium and invasive epithelium, with scores of 4.7 and 4.4. Scores for benign epithelium and in situ lesions were 3.7 and 2.0. The proposed model segmented epithelial cells in HE stained breast cancer slides well, but further work is needed for accurate division between the classes. Immunohistochemistry, together with pathologists' annotations, enabled the creation of accurate ground truths. The model is made freely available in FastPathology and the code is available at https://github.com/AICAN-Research/breast-epithelium-segmentation</description>

      <title>Self-supervised learning for skin cancer diagnosis with limited training data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early cancer detection is crucial for prognosis, but many cancer types lack large labelled datasets required for developing deep learning models. This paper investigates self-supervised learning (SSL) as an alternative to the standard supervised pre-training on ImageNet data for scenarios with limited training data using the ResNet-50 deep learning model. We first demonstrate that SSL pre-training on ImageNet (via the Barlow Twins SSL algorithm) outperforms supervised pre-training (SL) using a skin lesion dataset with limited training samples. We then consider further SSL pre-training (of the two ImageNet pre-trained models) on task-specific datasets, where our implementation is motivated by supervised transfer learning. The SSL significantly enhances initially SL pre-trained models, closing the performance gap with initially SSL pre-trained ones. Surprisingly, further pre-training on just the limited fine-tuning data achieves this performance equivalence. We implement a linear probe training strategy in the RestNet-50 model, and our experiments reveal that improvement stems from enhanced feature extraction. We find that minimal further SSL pre-training on task-specific data can be as effective as large-scale SSL pre-training on ImageNet for medical image classification tasks with limited labelled data. We validate these results on an oral cancer histopathology dataset, suggesting broader applicability across medical imaging domains facing labelled data scarcity.</description>

      <title>Radiative Gaussian Splatting for Efficient X-ray Novel View Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04116v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray is widely applied for transmission imaging due to its stronger penetration than natural light. When rendering novel view X-ray projections, existing methods mainly based on NeRF suffer from long training time and slow inference speed. In this paper, we propose a 3D Gaussian splatting-based framework, namely X-Gaussian, for X-ray novel view synthesis. Firstly, we redesign a radiative Gaussian point cloud model inspired by the isotropic nature of X-ray imaging. Our model excludes the influence of view direction when learning to predict the radiation intensity of 3D points. Based on this model, we develop a Differentiable Radiative Rasterization (DRR) with CUDA implementation. Secondly, we customize an Angle-pose Cuboid Uniform Initialization (ACUI) strategy that directly uses the parameters of the X-ray scanner to compute the camera information and then uniformly samples point positions within a cuboid enclosing the scanned object. Experiments show that our X-Gaussian outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 6.5 dB while enjoying less than 15% training time and over 73x inference speed. The application on sparse-view CT reconstruction also reveals the practical values of our method. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/caiyuanhao1998/X-Gaussian . A video demo of the training process visualization is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDVf_Ngeghg .</description>

      <title>Virtual Lung Screening Trial (VLST): An In Silico Replica of the National Lung Screening Trial for Lung Cancer Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objectives: To demonstrate that a virtual imaging trial platform can accurately emulate a major clinical trial, specifically the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) that compared computed tomography (CT) and chest radiography (CXR) imaging for lung cancer screening.
  Design, Setting, and Participants: A virtual patient population of 294 subjects was created from human models (XCAT) emulating the NLST, with two types of simulated cancerous lung nodules. Each virtual patient in the cohort was assessed using simulated CT and CXR systems to generate images reflecting the NLST imaging technologies. Deep learning models trained for lesion detection, AI CT-Reader, and AI CXR-Reader served as virtual readers.
  Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the difference in the Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (AUC) for CT and CXR modalities.
  Results: The study analyzed paired CT and CXR simulated images from 294 virtual patients. The AI CT-Reader outperformed the AI CXR-Reader across all levels of analysis. At the patient level, CT demonstrated superior diagnostic performance with an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.90 to 0.95), compared to CXR AUC of 0.72 (0.67 to 0.77). Subgroup analyses of lesion types revealed CT had significantly better detection of homogeneous lesions (AUC 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95 to 0.98) compared to heterogeneous lesions(0.89; 0.86 to 0.93). Furthermore, when the specificity of the AI CT-Reader was adjusted to match the NLST sensitivity of 94% for CT, the VLST results closely mirrored the NLST findings, further highlighting the alignment between the two studies.
  Conclusion and Relevance: The VIT results closely replicated those of the earlier NLST, underscoring its potential to replicate real clinical imaging trials. Integration of virtual trials may aid in the evaluation and improvement of imaging-based diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Does Diffusion Beat GAN in Image Super Resolution?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a prevalent opinion that diffusion-based models outperform GAN-based counterparts in the Image Super Resolution (ISR) problem. However, in most studies, diffusion-based ISR models employ larger networks and are trained longer than the GAN baselines. This raises the question of whether the high performance stems from the superiority of the diffusion paradigm or if it is a consequence of the increased scale and the greater computational resources of the contemporary studies. In our work, we thoroughly compare diffusion-based and GAN-based Super Resolution models under controlled settings, with both approaches having matched architecture, model and dataset sizes, and computational budget. We show that a GAN-based model can achieve results comparable or superior to a diffusion-based model. Additionally, we explore the impact of popular design choices, such as text conditioning and augmentation on the performance of ISR models, showcasing their effect in several downstream tasks. We will release the inference code and weights of our scaled GAN.</description>

      <title>R$^2$-Gaussian: Rectifying Radiative Gaussian Splatting for Tomographic Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has shown promising results in image rendering and surface reconstruction. However, its potential in volumetric reconstruction tasks, such as X-ray computed tomography, remains under-explored. This paper introduces R$^2$-Gaussian, the first 3DGS-based framework for sparse-view tomographic reconstruction. By carefully deriving X-ray rasterization functions, we discover a previously unknown integration bias in the standard 3DGS formulation, which hampers accurate volume retrieval. To address this issue, we propose a novel rectification technique via refactoring the projection from 3D to 2D Gaussians. Our new method presents three key innovations: (1) introducing tailored Gaussian kernels, (2) extending rasterization to X-ray imaging, and (3) developing a CUDA-based differentiable voxelizer. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy and efficiency. Crucially, it delivers high-quality results in 4 minutes, which is 12$\times$ faster than NeRF-based methods and on par with traditional algorithms. Code and models are available on the project page https://github.com/Ruyi-Zha/r2_gaussian.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Stereo Image Compression with Cross-Dimensional Entropy Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of stereo vision technologies, stereo image compression has emerged as a crucial field that continues to draw significant attention. Previous approaches have primarily employed a unidirectional paradigm, where the compression of one view is dependent on the other, resulting in imbalanced compression. To address this issue, we introduce a symmetric bidirectional stereo image compression architecture, named BiSIC. Specifically, we propose a 3D convolution based codec backbone to capture local features and incorporate bidirectional attention blocks to exploit global features. Moreover, we design a novel cross-dimensional entropy model that integrates various conditioning factors, including the spatial context, channel context, and stereo dependency, to effectively estimate the distribution of latent representations for entropy coding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed BiSIC outperforms conventional image/video compression standards, as well as state-of-the-art learning-based methods, in terms of both PSNR and MS-SSIM.</description>

      <title>deepmriprep: Voxel-based Morphometry (VBM) Preprocessing via Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Voxel-based Morphometry (VBM) has emerged as a powerful approach in neuroimaging research, utilized in over 7,000 studies since the year 2000. Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data, VBM assesses variations in the local density of brain tissue and examines its associations with biological and psychometric variables. Here, we present deepmriprep, a neural network-based pipeline that performs all necessary preprocessing steps for VBM analysis of T1-weighted MR images using deep neural networks. Utilizing the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), deepmriprep is 37 times faster than CAT12, the leading VBM preprocessing toolbox. The proposed method matches CAT12 in accuracy for tissue segmentation and image registration across more than 100 datasets and shows strong correlations in VBM results. Tissue segmentation maps from deepmriprep have over 95% agreement with ground truth maps, and its non-linear registration, using supervised SYMNet, predicts smooth deformation fields comparable to CAT12. The high processing speed of deepmriprep enables rapid preprocessing of extensive datasets and thereby fosters the application of VBM analysis to large-scale neuroimaging studies and opens the door to real-time applications. Finally, deepmripreps straightforward, modular design enables researchers to easily understand, reuse, and advance the underlying methods, fostering further advancements in neuroimaging research. deepmriprep can be conveniently installed as a Python package and is publicly accessible at https://github.com/wwu-mmll/deepmriprep.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Multicenter Experts in Multimodal Generative AI for Advanced Radiotherapy Target Delineation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clinical experts employ diverse philosophies and strategies in patient care, influenced by regional patient populations. However, existing medical artificial intelligence (AI) models are often trained on data distributions that disproportionately reflect highly prevalent patterns, reinforcing biases and overlooking the diverse expertise of clinicians. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Mixture of Multicenter Experts (MoME) approach. This method strategically integrates specialized expertise from diverse clinical strategies, enhancing the AI model's ability to generalize and adapt across multiple medical centers. The MoME-based multimodal target volume delineation model, trained with few-shot samples including images and clinical notes from each medical center, outperformed baseline methods in prostate cancer radiotherapy target delineation. The advantages of MoME were most pronounced when data characteristics varied across centers or when data availability was limited, demonstrating its potential for broader clinical applications. Therefore, the MoME framework enables the deployment of AI-based target volume delineation models in resource-constrained medical facilities by adapting to specific preferences of each medical center only using a few sample data, without the need for data sharing between institutions. Expanding the number of multicenter experts within the MoME framework will significantly enhance the generalizability, while also improving the usability and adaptability of clinical AI applications in the field of precision radiation oncology.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Latent Diffusion Model for Enhanced Feature Extraction from Medical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04000</link>

Abstract: Various imaging modalities are used in patient diagnosis, each offering unique advantages and valuable insights into anatomy and pathology. Computed Tomography (CT) is crucial in diagnostics, providing high-resolution images for precise internal organ visualization. CT's ability to detect subtle tissue variations is vital for diagnosing diseases like lung cancer, enabling early detection and accurate tumor assessment. However, variations in CT scanner models and acquisition protocols introduce significant variability in the extracted radiomic features, even when imaging the same patient. This variability poses considerable challenges for downstream research and clinical analysis, which depend on consistent and reliable feature extraction. Current methods for medical image feature extraction, often based on supervised learning approaches, including GAN-based models, face limitations in generalizing across different imaging environments. In response to these challenges, we propose LTDiff++, a multiscale latent diffusion model designed to enhance feature extraction in medical imaging. The model addresses variability by standardizing non-uniform distributions in the latent space, improving feature consistency. LTDiff++ utilizes a UNet++ encoder-decoder architecture coupled with a conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) at the latent bottleneck to achieve robust feature extraction and standardization. Extensive empirical evaluations on both patient and phantom CT datasets demonstrate significant improvements in image standardization, with higher Concordance Correlation Coefficients (CCC) across multiple radiomic feature categories. Through these advancements, LTDiff++ represents a promising solution for overcoming the inherent variability in medical imaging data, offering improved reliability and accuracy in feature extraction processes.</description>

      <title>NeuroClips: Towards High-fidelity and Smooth fMRI-to-Video Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Reconstruction of static visual stimuli from non-invasion brain activity fMRI achieves great success, owning to advanced deep learning models such as CLIP and Stable Diffusion. However, the research on fMRI-to-video reconstruction remains limited since decoding the spatiotemporal perception of continuous visual experiences is formidably challenging. We contend that the key to addressing these challenges lies in accurately decoding both high-level semantics and low-level perception flows, as perceived by the brain in response to video stimuli. To the end, we propose NeuroClips, an innovative framework to decode high-fidelity and smooth video from fMRI. NeuroClips utilizes a semantics reconstructor to reconstruct video keyframes, guiding semantic accuracy and consistency, and employs a perception reconstructor to capture low-level perceptual details, ensuring video smoothness. During inference, it adopts a pre-trained T2V diffusion model injected with both keyframes and low-level perception flows for video reconstruction. Evaluated on a publicly available fMRI-video dataset, NeuroClips achieves smooth high-fidelity video reconstruction of up to 6s at 8FPS, gaining significant improvements over state-of-the-art models in various metrics, e.g., a 128% improvement in SSIM and an 81% improvement in spatiotemporal metrics. Our project is available at https://github.com/gongzix/NeuroClips.</description>

      <title>An Improved Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter for Visual-Inertial Odometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.08117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast pose estimation (PE) is of vital importance for successful mission performance of agile autonomous robots. Global Positioning Systems such as GPS and GNSS have been typically used in fusion with Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) for PE. However, the low update rate and lack of proper signals make their utility impractical for indoor and urban applications. On the other hand, Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) is gaining popularity as a practical alternative for GNSS/INS systems in GPS-denied environments. Among the many VIO-based methods, the Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter (MSCKF) has received a greater attention due to its robustness, speed and accuracy. To this end, the high computational cost associated with image processing for real-time implementation of MSCKF on resource-constrained vehicles is still a challenging ongoing research. In this paper, an enhanced version of the MSCKF is proposed. To this aim, different feature marginalization and state pruning strategies are suggested that result in a much faster algorithm. The proposed algorithm is tested both on an open-source dataset and in real-world experiments for validation. It is demonstrated that the proposed Fast-MSCKF (FMSCKF) is about six times faster and at least 20% more accurate in final position estimation than the standard MSCKF algorithm.</description>

      <title>Binomial Self-compensation for Motion Error in Dynamic 3D Scanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06693v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase shifting profilometry (PSP) is favored in high-precision 3D scanning due to its high accuracy, robustness, and pixel-wise property. However, a fundamental assumption of PSP that the object should remain static is violated in dynamic measurement, making PSP susceptible to object moving, resulting in ripple-like errors in the point clouds. We propose a pixel-wise and frame-wise loopable binomial self-compensation (BSC) algorithm to effectively and flexibly eliminate motion error in the four-step PSP. Our mathematical model demonstrates that by summing successive motion-affected phase frames weighted by binomial coefficients, motion error exponentially diminishes as the binomial order increases, accomplishing automatic error compensation through the motion-affected phase sequence, without the assistance of any intermediate variable. Extensive experiments show that our BSC outperforms the existing methods in reducing motion error, while achieving a depth map frame rate equal to the camera's acquisition rate (90 fps), enabling high-accuracy 3D reconstruction with a quasi-single-shot frame rate.</description>

      <title>Looks Too Good To Be True: An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Hallucinations in Generative Restoration Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16475v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of high perceptual quality in image restoration has driven the development of revolutionary generative models, capable of producing results often visually indistinguishable from real data. However, as their perceptual quality continues to improve, these models also exhibit a growing tendency to generate hallucinations - realistic-looking details that do not exist in the ground truth images. Hallucinations in these models create uncertainty about their reliability, raising major concerns about their practical application. This paper investigates this phenomenon through the lens of information theory, revealing a fundamental tradeoff between uncertainty and perception. We rigorously analyze the relationship between these two factors, proving that the global minimal uncertainty in generative models grows in tandem with perception. In particular, we define the inherent uncertainty of the restoration problem and show that attaining perfect perceptual quality entails at least twice this uncertainty. Additionally, we establish a relation between distortion, uncertainty and perception, through which we prove the aforementioned uncertainly-perception tradeoff induces the well-known perception-distortion tradeoff. We demonstrate our theoretical findings through experiments with super-resolution and inpainting algorithms. This work uncovers fundamental limitations of generative models in achieving both high perceptual quality and reliable predictions for image restoration. Thus, we aim to raise awareness among practitioners about this inherent tradeoff, empowering them to make informed decisions and potentially prioritize safety over perceptual performance.</description>

      <title>Neural Graphics Texture Compression Supporting Random Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in rendering have led to tremendous growth in texture assets, including resolution, complexity, and novel textures components, but this growth in data volume has not been matched by advances in its compression. Meanwhile Neural Image Compression (NIC) has advanced significantly and shown promising results, but the proposed methods cannot be directly adapted to neural texture compression. First, texture compression requires on-demand and real-time decoding with random access during parallel rendering (e.g. block texture decompression on GPUs). Additionally, NIC does not support multi-resolution reconstruction (mip-levels), nor does it have the ability to efficiently jointly compress different sets of texture channels. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to texture set compression that integrates traditional GPU texture representation and NIC techniques, designed to enable random access and support many-channel texture sets. To achieve this goal, we propose an asymmetric auto-encoder framework that employs a convolutional encoder to capture detailed information in a bottleneck-latent space, and at decoder side we utilize a fully connected network, whose inputs are sampled latent features plus positional information, for a given texture coordinate and mip level. This latent data is defined to enable simplified access to multi-resolution data by simply changing the scanning strides. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach provides much better results than conventional texture compression, and significant improvement over the latest method using neural networks.</description>

      <title>Denoising: A Powerful Building-Block for Imaging, Inverse Problems, and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06219v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Denoising, the process of reducing random fluctuations in a signal to emphasize essential patterns, has been a fundamental problem of interest since the dawn of modern scientific inquiry. Recent denoising techniques, particularly in imaging, have achieved remarkable success, nearing theoretical limits by some measures. Yet, despite tens of thousands of research papers, the wide-ranging applications of denoising beyond noise removal have not been fully recognized. This is partly due to the vast and diverse literature, making a clear overview challenging.
  This paper aims to address this gap. We present a clarifying perspective on denoisers, their structure, and desired properties. We emphasize the increasing importance of denoising and showcase its evolution into an essential building block for complex tasks in imaging, inverse problems, and machine learning. Despite its long history, the community continues to uncover unexpected and groundbreaking uses for denoising, further solidifying its place as a cornerstone of scientific and engineering practice.</description>

      <title>Non-Interrupting Rail Track Geometry Measurement System Using UAV and LiDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The safety of train operations is largely dependent on the health of rail tracks, necessitating regular and meticulous inspection and maintenance. A significant part of such inspections involves geometric measurements of the tracks to detect any potential problems. Traditional methods for track geometry measurements, while proven to be accurate, require track closures during inspections, and consume a considerable amount of time as the inspection area grows, causing significant disruptions to regular operations. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a track geometry measurement system (TGMS) that utilizes an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform equipped with a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor. Integrated with a state-of-the-art machine-learning-based computer vision algorithm, and a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, this platform can conduct rail geometry inspections seamlessly over a larger area without interrupting rail operations. In particular, this semi- or fully automated measurement is found capable of measuring critical rail geometry irregularities in gauge, curvature, and profile with sub-inch accuracy. Cross-level and warp are not measured due to the absence of gravity data. By eliminating operational interruptions, our system offers a more streamlined, cost-effective, and safer solution for inspecting and maintaining rail infrastructure.</description>

      <title>DRACO: A Denoising-Reconstruction Autoencoder for Cryo-EM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models in computer vision have demonstrated exceptional performance in zero-shot and few-shot tasks by extracting multi-purpose features from large-scale datasets through self-supervised pre-training methods. However, these models often overlook the severe corruption in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) images by high-level noises. We introduce DRACO, a Denoising-Reconstruction Autoencoder for CryO-EM, inspired by the Noise2Noise (N2N) approach. By processing cryo-EM movies into odd and even images and treating them as independent noisy observations, we apply a denoising-reconstruction hybrid training scheme. We mask both images to create denoising and reconstruction tasks. For DRACO's pre-training, the quality of the dataset is essential, we hence build a high-quality, diverse dataset from an uncurated public database, including over 270,000 movies or micrographs. After pre-training, DRACO naturally serves as a generalizable cryo-EM image denoiser and a foundation model for various cryo-EM downstream tasks. DRACO demonstrates the best performance in denoising, micrograph curation, and particle picking tasks compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>
