      <title>Photoemission Insights to Electronic Orders in Kagome Superconductor AV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome superconductors AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, and Cs) have attracted considerable attention due to their intriguing combination of unique electron correlations and nontrivial band topology. The interplay of these fundamental aspects gives rise to a diverse array of exotic electronic phenomena, including superconductivity and charge density wave (CDW) states. In this review, we present recent advancements in the study of the electronic band structure of AV3Sb5 using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), including the identification of the multiple van Hove singularities near the Fermi level and their close relationship with the CDW transition, spectroscopic features related to CDW-induced symmetry breakings, as well as direct observations of nodeless superconducting gaps and moderate electron-phonon couplings through ultrahigh-resolution ARPES, providing critical insights into the origins of CDW order and electron pairing symmetry. By synthesizing these key ARPES findings, this review aims to deepen our understanding of kagome-related physics.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic Josephson junction: nonreciprocity and sublattice selective transport of Cooper triplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Josephson junction under consideration is composed of two s-wave superconducting contacts deposited on the top of a two-dimensional antiferromagnet (AF). Triplet Cooper correlations in AF are provided by thin ferromagnetic spacers between AF and superconducting contacts. The problem is considered in the regime of a weak tunneling of electrons between these contacts and AF. The transport of electron Cooper's pairs under the stationary phase bias in the disordered AF is treated within the formalism of equilibrium Green functions and the Born approximation for electrons which are scattered by nonmagnetic impurities. The system of diffusion equations is derived for three triplet components of Cooper-correlated electron pairs. These spin projections are coupled to each other due to interplay of the spin-orbit interaction and AF order. Moreover, the diffusion equations are sublattice-dependent. It is shown that such a staggered behavior will lead to the nonreciprocal Josephson current, if the tunneling of electrons between contacts and AF is different for different sublattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current-phase relation for a ballistic SNS junction in a 1D wire at T = 0 was derived by Thuneberg [1] neglecting phase gradients in superconducting leads. This invalidates the derivation, since the charge conservation law is violated. The theory of Ref. [1] predicts an unphysical phase jump in the limit of zero normal-layer thickness. In this limit the SNS junction becomes an ideal uniform superconductor, in which the currentis supported by a constant phase gradient without any phase jump.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Transition as a Promising Route to Enhance the Critical Current in Kagome Superconductor CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing strategies to systematically increase the critical current, the threshold current below which the superconductivity exists, is an important goal of materials science. Here, the concept of quantum phase transition is employed to enhance the critical current of a kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, which exhibits a charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity that are both affected by hydrostatic pressure. As the CDW phase is rapidly suppressed under pressure, a large enhancement in the self-field critical current ($I_{\rm c,sf}$) is recorded. The observation of a peak-like enhancement of $I_{\rm c,sf}$ at the zero-temperature limit ($I_{\rm c,sf}(0)$) centred at $p^*\approx 20$~kbar, the same pressure where the CDW phase transition vanishes, further provides strong evidence of a zero-temperature quantum anomaly in this class of pressure-tuned superconductor. Such a peak in $I_{\rm c,sf}(0)$ resembles the findings in other well-established quantum-critical superconductors, hinting at the presence of enhanced quantum fluctuations associated with the CDW phase in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$.</description>

      <title>Field-free superconducting diode effect and magnetochiral anisotropy in FeTe0.7Se0.3 junctions with the inherent asymmetric barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal electrical transport, characterized by an asymmetric relationship between current and voltage, plays a crucial role in modern electronic industries. Recent studies have extended this phenomenon to superconductors, introducing the concept of the superconducting diode effect (SDE). The SDE is characterized by unequal critical supercurrents along opposite directions. Due to the requirement on broken inversion symmetry, the SDE is commonly accompanied by electrical magnetochiral anisotropy (eMCA) in the resistive state. Achieving a magnetic field-free SDE with field tunability is pivotal for advancements in superconductor devices. Conventionally, the field-free SDE has been achieved in Josephson junctions by intentionally intercalating an asymmetric barrier layer. Alternatively, internal magnetism was employed. Both approaches pose challenges in the selection of superconductors and fabrication processes, thereby impeding the development of SDE. Here, we present a field-free SDE in FeTe0.7Se0.3 (FTS) junction with eMCA, a phenomenon absent in FTS single nanosheets. The field-free property is associated with the presence of a gradient oxide layer on the upper surface of each FTS nanosheet, while the eMCA is linked to spin-splitting arising from the absence of inversion symmetry. Both the SDE and eMCA respond to magnetic fields with distinct temperature dependencies. This work presents a versatile and straightforward strategy for advancing superconducting electronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay between repulsive interaction and superfluidity in flat band system. We consider spatially indirect excitons in the Lieb lattice bilayer as an example. We show that due to the presence of repulsive interaction, the excitons may form an incoherent fluid. By increasing the quantum metric, the exciton fluid experiences a transition into the superfluid phase. Such transition may be captured by a model of Josephson junction array, which is beyond mean field description.</description>

Abstract: Instability of the charged pion vacuum resulting in the pion condensation is studied within the $\lambda|\phi|^4$ model at the rapid rotation of the system in presence of external fields. Case of the static external scalar and electric square potential wells and the uniform magnetic field is studied in detail. The Meissner and Aharonov-Bohm effects and the London moment are taken into account. Analogies and differences with the behavior of metallic superconductors under the action of the rotation and the external magnetic field are analysed.</description>

      <title>Electronic glasses from a broken gauge symmetry in disorder-free systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glass phases can be stabilized by quenched disorders, as in most spin-glass materials, or self-generated through kinetic freezing in disorder-free systems. A canonical example of the latter is structural glasses, which have been extensively studied for many decades. Yet, how the rugged energy landscape of a glass phase is spontaneously generated in disorder-free systems remains one of the key questions in glass physics. Here we present a general electronic mechanism for the emergence of glassy phase using the example of itinerant electrons coupled to XY spins on a lattice. This model can also be be viewed as the mean-field theory of a superconducting system with attractive density-density interactions. Intriguingly, the electron gauge symmetry in the strong pairing limit gives rise to a macroscopic degeneracy of XY spins. In the presence of electron hopping that breaks the gauge symmetry, the lifting of the extensive degeneracy leads to a glass phase with disordered pairings. Our findings highlight a novel scenario in which a glassy state originates from the breaking of quantum gauge symmetry without quenched disorders.</description>

      <title>Superconducting flux qubit with ferromagnetic Josephson $\pi$-junction operating at zero magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14597v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional superconducting flux qubits require the application of a precisely tuned magnetic field to set the operation point at half a flux quantum through the qubit loop, which complicates the on-chip integration of this type of device. It has been proposed that by inducing a $\pi$-phase shift in the superconducting order parameter using a precisely controlled nanoscale-thickness superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor Josephson junction, commonly referred to as $\pi$-junction, it is possible to realize a flux qubit operating at zero magnetic flux. Here, we report the realization of a zero-flux-biased flux qubit based on three NbN/AlN/NbN Josephson junctions and a NbN/PdNi/NbN ferromagnetic $\pi$-junction. The qubit lifetime is in the microsecond range, which we argue is limited by quasiparticle excitations in the metallic ferromagnet layer. Our results pave the way for developing quantum coherent devices, including qubits and sensors, that utilize the interplay between ferromagnetism and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity of transparent SNS weak links decreases sharply with length</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductor-normal material-superconductor (SNS) junctions are being integrated into microwave circuits for fundamental and applied research goals. The short junction limit is a common simplifying assumption for experiments with SNS junctions, but this limit constrains how small the nonlinearity of the microwave circuit can be. Here, we show that a finite length of the weak link strongly suppresses the nonlinearity compared to its zero-length limit -- the suppression can be up to a factor of ten even when the length remains shorter than the induced coherence length. We tie this behavior to the nonanalytic dependence of nonlinearity on length, which the critical current does not exhibit. Further, we identify additional experimentally observable consequences of nonzero length, and we conjecture that anharmonicity is bounded between zero and a maximally negative value for any non-interacting Josephson junction in the presence of time-reversal symmetry. We promote SNS junction length as a useful parameter for designing weakly nonlinear microwave circuits.</description>

Abstract: The dynamics of overdamped Josephson junctions under varying microwave-driving conditions have been studied through numerical simulations using the resistively-shunted junction (RSJ) model. The aim is to determine the optimal junction characteristics and external microwave (rf) parameters that maximize the width of quantum voltage levels (Shapiro steps) from order n = 0 to n &gt; 1. Both the rf and dc power requirements, along with the junction parameter spread and power attenuation, are analyzed as key factors that need to be optimized for improved performance of the quantum device. This work aims to advance the development of next-generation Programmable Josephson Voltage Standards with logic architectures that surpass the conventional binary and ternary codifications used in present quantum voltage arrays, while significantly reducing the overall number of junctions as well as the number of sub-arrays and bias lines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient heat management at cryogenic temperatures is crucial for superconducting quantum technologies. This study demonstrates the controlled manipulation of the heat flow and heat rectification through an asymmetric superconducting tunnel junction. The system exhibits a non-reciprocal behavior, developing a thermoelectric regime exclusively when the electrode with the larger gap is heated. This feature significantly boosts thermal rectification effectively classifying the device as a heat diode. At the same time when operating as a thermoelectric engine, the same device also functions as a heat pipe, expelling heat from the cryogenic environment, minimizing losses at the cold terminal. This dual functionality is inherently passive, and the performance of the heat pipe and the heat diode can be finely adjusted by modifying the external electrical load.</description>
