      <title>Prime simplicial complexes of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prime simplicial complex $\Pi(G)$ of a finite group $G$ is composed of all sets of primes $S$ where $G$ has an element of order the product of primes in $S$, with the subsets partially ordered by inclusion. This complex was introduced by Peter Cameron as the generalisation of the well-studied prime (or Gruenberg-Kegel) graphs. In this paper, we establish new results concerning two key properties of $\Pi(G)$: recognisability and purity. We demonstrate that recognisability by the prime simplicial complex is strictly stronger than recognisability by the prime graph. Notably, we present the first known example of a group that is recognisable by its prime simplicial complex and spectrum, but not by its prime graph, and is not a direct product of two isomorphic simple groups. Furthermore, we classify groups with pure prime simplicial complexes (i.e., all maximal simplices have the same size) across several infinite families of finite simple groups. We also provide a partial classification for non-abelian finite simple groups whose prime simplicial complex has maximal simplices of size at most 2.</description>

      <title>Weakly $G$-slim complexes and the non-positive immersion property for generalized Wirtinger presentations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate weakly $G$-slim complexes, a more flexible variant of Helfer and Wise's slim complexes, which can be defined on any regular $G$-covering. We prove that if a $2$-complex $X$ associated to a group presentation is weakly $H$-slim for some regular $H$-covering, and $\pi_1X$ is left-orderable, then $X$ is slim and, in particular, it has non-positive immersions. We apply this result to study conditions on generalized Wirtinger presentations that guarantee the non-positive immersion property for their associated $2$-complexes. This class of presentations includes classical Wirtinger presentations of (perhaps high-dimensional) knots in spheres, some classes of Adian presentations and LOTs presentations. On the one hand, our results provide a wide variety of examples of presentation complexes with the non-positive immersion property via a condition that can be checked with a simple algorithm. On the other hand, as an application of these methods, we derive an extension of a result by Wise on Adian presentations and prove a stronger formulation of a result of Howie on LOT presentations.</description>

      <title>Stallings' Group is Simply Connected at Infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F_2$ be the free group on two generators and let $B_n$ ($n \geq 2$) denote the kernel of the homomorphism $$F_2 \times \cdots (n) \cdots \times F_2 \rightarrow {\mathbb Z}$$ sending all generators to the generator $1$ of $\mathbb Z$. The groups $B_k$ are called the {\it Bieri-Stallings} groups and $B_k$ is type $\mathcal F_{k-1}$ but not $\mathcal F_k$. For $n\geq 3$ there are short exact sequences of the form
  $$1 \rightarrow B_{n-1} \rightarrow B_n \rightarrow F_2 \rightarrow 1.$$
  This exact sequence can be used to show that $B_n$ is $(n-3)$-connected at infinity for $n\geq 3$. Stallings' proved that $B_2$ is finitely generated but not finitely presented. We conjecture that for $n\geq 2$, $B_n$ is $(n-2)$-connected at infinity. For $n=2$, this means that $B_2$ is 1-ended and for $n=3$ that $B_3$ (typically called Stallings' group) is simply connected at infinity. We verify the conjecture for $n=2$ and $n=3$. Our main result is the case $n=3$: Stalling's group is simply connected at $\infty$.</description>

      <title>Perturbation Effects on Word Lengths in Three-Reflection Symmetric Presentations of Dihedral Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of word lengths of elements from a three-reflection symmetric generating set of the dihedral group $D_n$. More specifically, we provide upper bounds for a quantity $\lambda_1$, which measures the stability of a group under perturbations in the words corresponding to certain elements with respect to specific presentations.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Filling Invariants Associated to Conjugacy in Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brick and Corson introduced annular Dehn functions in 1998 to quantify the conjugacy problem for finitely generated groups and gave the fundamental relationships between it, the Dehn function, and the conjugator length function. We furnish the theory with diverse examples groups. In particular, we show that these three invariants are independent -- no two of the three functions determine the other.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The action of $SL(2, {\bf Z})$ on the integer torus and its quotient by central symmetry and Artin's presentation of three strings braid group $B_{3}$, produces a presentation with parabolic generators $\pmatrix{1&amp; -1\cr 0&amp; 1\cr}$ and $\pmatrix{1&amp; 0\cr 1&amp; 1\cr}$. This braided presentation describes the action of the derived group on Poincar\'e's half plane and its quotient the modular torus, just as Nielsen's theorem giving the group of direct automorphisms of the free group on two generators as semi-direct product, amalgamated on the index $2$ subgroup of the center of $B_{3}$, of inner automorphisms with $B_{3}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hutchcroft and Pete showed that countably infinite groups with Property (T) admit cost one actions, resolving a question of Gaboriau. We give a streamlined proof of their theorem, and extend it both to locally compact second countable groups and unimodular random graphs. We prove unimodular random graph analogues of the Connes--Weiss and Glasner--Weiss theorem characterising Property (T).</description>

      <title>On the global breadth of finite groups with nontrivial partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a series of recent contributions on the notion of global breadth $\mathbf{B}(G)$ of a finite group $G$, it was interesting to observe the structural conditions arising from the classification of finite groups of $\mathbf{B}(G)=8$. This motivated the study of a new class of finite groups, namely $\mathcal{H}=\{G \ | \ G \ \mbox{satisfies the condition } \ |G| \le \mathbf{B}(G)(\mathbf{B}(G) + 1)\}$ and very little is known about $\mathcal{H}$. Here we focus on the groups with nontrivial partitions (according to the terminology of Baer, Kegel and Kontorovich), determining first that $\mathbf{B}(G)$ is achieved via the local breadth in connection with the order of maximal cyclic subgroups. Then we show that $\mathcal{H}$ contains projective special linear groups, projective general linear groups and Suzuki groups, supporting the conjecture that all finite groups with nontrivial partitions belong to $\mathcal{H}$. The presence of large families of simple groups in $\mathcal{H}$ is shown for the first time here.</description>

      <title>On the intersection of Sylow subgroups in almost simple groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite almost simple group and let $H$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$. As a special case of a theorem of Zenkov, there exist $x,y \in G$ such that $H \cap H^x \cap H^y = 1$. In fact, if $G$ is simple, then a theorem of Mazurov and Zenkov reveals that $H \cap H^x = 1$ for some $x \in G$. However, it is known that the latter property does not extend to all almost simple groups. For example, if $G = S_8$ and $p=2$, then $H \cap H^x \ne 1$ for all $x \in G$. Further work of Zenkov in the 1990s shows that such examples are rare (for instance, there are no such examples if $p \geqslant 5$) and he reduced the classification of all such pairs to the situation where $p=2$ and $G$ is an almost simple group of Lie type defined over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ and either $q=9$ or $q$ is a Mersenne or Fermat prime. In this paper, by adopting a probabilistic approach based on fixed point ratio estimates, we complete Zenkov's classification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main result of this paper is an explicit construction of the free commutative skew brace -- that is, a skew brace whose circle group is commutative -- on an arbitrary generating set $X$. We embed this object into a set of rational functions and show that a simple linear equation characterizes the image of this embedding. As a consequence, comparing elements in this skew brace is no more difficult than comparing elements in the free commutative group generated by $X$.</description>

      <title>Symmetry groups of origami structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Origami is the art of folding paper into various patterns without cutting or tearing the paper. By viewing the paper as the complex plane, we iteratively compute and record all intersection points to construct mathematical origami sets. Additionally, we include the various lines to create a repeating pattern that can be viewed as a wallpaper group if the angle set contains fewer than 3 angles. There are 17 wallpaper groups up to isomorphism, so we determine which such groups can be constructed in this way, depending on the rotational and reflectional symmetries present in the given pattern. If the angle set contains more than 4 angles, the resulting pattern will be dense and hence no longer a wallpaper group. In this case, the classification of the symmetry group is done algorithmically.</description>

      <title>Characterizing quantum resourcefulness via group-Fourier decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present a general framework for studying the resourcefulness in pure states for quantum resource theories (QRTs) whose free operations arise from the unitary representation of a group. We argue that the group Fourier decompositions (GFDs) of a state, i.e., its projection onto the irreducible representations (irreps) of the Hilbert space, operator space, and tensor products thereof, constitute fingerprints of resourcefulness and complexity. By focusing on the norm of the irrep projections, dubbed GFD purities, we find that low-resource states live in the small dimensional irreps of operator space, whereas high-resource states have support in more, and higher dimensional ones. Such behavior not only resembles that appearing in classical harmonic analysis, but is also universal across the QRTs of entanglement, fermionic Gaussianity, spin coherence, and Clifford stabilizerness. To finish, we show that GFD purities carry operational meaning as they lead to resourcefulness witnesses as well as to notions of state compressibility.</description>

      <title>The nilpotent graph of a finite0-dimensional Lie algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $L$ be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field $F$. In This paper we introduce the \emph{nilpotent graph} $\Gamma_\mathfrak{N}(L)$ as the graph whose vertices are the elements of $L \setminus \nil(L)$, where \[\nil(L) = \{x \in L \mid \langle x, y \rangle \text{ is nilpotent for all } y \in L\},\] and where two vertices $x, y$ are adjacent if the Lie subalgebra they generate is nilpotent. We give some characterizations of $\nil(L)$ and its connection with the hypercenter $Z^*(L)$, for example, they are equal when $F$ has characteristic zero. We prove that the nilpotentizer behaves well under direct sums, allowing a decomposition of $\Gamma_\mathfrak{N}(L)$ between components. The paper also investigates the structural and combinatorial properties of $\Gamma_\mathfrak{N}(L)$, including the conditions under which the graph is connected. We characterize the existence of strongly self-centralizing subalgebras in relation to connectivity and vertex isolation. Explicit computations are carried out for the algebra $\mathfrak{t}(2,\mathbb{F}_q)$, where $\Gamma_\mathfrak{N}(L)$ decomposes into $q+1$ components, each of size $q(q-1)$, forming a $(q^2-q-1)$-regular graph. We conclude with algorithms for constructing $\Gamma_\mathfrak{N}(L)$ in SageMath, and pose open problems concerning bipartiteness, regularity, and structural implications in higher dimensions over finite fields.</description>

      <title>Projective length, phantom extensions, and the structure of torsion modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.03477v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of phantom extension of order a given ordinal $\alpha $ has been introduced in collaboration with Casarosa, as an algebraic analogue of the order of a phantom map in topology, to study the structure of flat modules. In this companion paper we characterize phantom extension of \emph{torsion} modules over a countable Dedekind domain $R$. After localizing, one can assume that $R$ is a discrete valuation domain with maximal ideal generated by $p\in R$. In this case, the phantom extensions of order $\alpha $ of a countable torsion module are precisely the $p^{\omega \left( 1+\alpha\right) }$-pure extensions introduced by Nunke in the 1960s. A module has projective length at most $\alpha $ if and only if it is a projective object with respect to the exact structure defined by phantom extensions of order $\alpha $. We prove that a countable torsion module has projective length at most $\alpha $ if and only if it is reduced and has Ulm length at most $1+\alpha $, if and only if it is the colimit of a presheaf of finite torsion modules over a countable well-founded forest of rank at most $1+\alpha $.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18753v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G\leqslant\mathrm{Sym}(\Omega)$ be a finite transitive permutation group with point stabiliser $H$. We say that a subgroup $K$ of $G$ is a fixer if every element of $K$ has fixed points, and we say that $K$ is large if $|K| \geqslant |H|$. There is a special interest in studying large fixers due to connections with Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado type problems. In this paper, we classify up to conjugacy the large fixers of the almost simple primitive groups with socle $\mathrm{PSL}_2(q)$, and we use this result to verify a special case of a conjecture of Spiga on permutation characters. We also present some results on large fixers of almost simple primitive groups with socle an alternating or sporadic group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A partial group with $n+1$ elements is, when regarded as a symmetric simplicial set, of dimension at most $n$. This dimension is $n$ if and only if the partial group is a group. As a consequence of the first statement, finite partial groups are genuinely finite, despite being seemingly specified by infinitely much data. In particular, finite partial groups have only finitely many im-partial subgroups. We also consider dimension of partial groupoids.</description>

      <title>A classification of finite groups with small Davenport constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group. By a sequence over $G$, we mean a finite unordered string of terms from $G$ with repetition allowed, and we say that it is a product-one sequence if its terms can be ordered so that their product is the identity element of $G$. Then, the Davenport constant $\mathsf D (G)$ is the maximal length of a minimal product-one sequence, that is a product-one sequence which cannot be factored into two non-trivial product-one subsequences. The Davenport constant is a combinatorial group invariant that has been studied fruitfully over several decades in additive combinatorics, invariant theory, and factorization theory, etc. Apart from a few cases of finite groups, the precise value of the Davenport constant is unknown. Even in the abelian case, little is known beyond groups of rank at most two. On the other hand, for a fixed positive integer $r$, structural results characterizing which groups $G$ satisfy $\mathsf D (G) = r$ are rare. We only know that there are finitely many such groups. In this paper, we study the classification of finite groups based on the Davenport constant.</description>

      <title>Latent symmetry of graphs and stretch factors in Out(Fr)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19446v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every irreducible outer automorphism of the free group of rank r is topologically represented by an irreducible train track map $f$ on some graph $\Gamma$ of rank r. Moreover, $f$ can always be written as a composition of folds and a graph isomorphism. We give a lower bound on the stretch factor of an irreducible outer automorphism in terms of the number of folds of $f$ and the number of edges in $\Gamma$. In the case that $f$ is periodic on the vertex set of $\Gamma$, we show a precise notion of the latent symmetry of $\Gamma$ gives a lower bound on the number of folds required. We use this notion of latent symmetry to classify all possible irreducible single fold train track maps.</description>

      <title>Irredundant bases for soluble groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Delta$ be a finite set and $G$ be a subgroup of $\operatorname{Sym}(\Delta)$. An irredundant base for $G$ is a sequence of points of $\Delta$ yielding a strictly descending chain of pointwise stabilisers, terminating with the trivial group. Suppose that $G$ is primitive and soluble. We determine asymptotically tight bounds for the maximum length of an irredundant base for $G$. Moreover, we disprove a conjecture of Seress on the maximum length of an irredundant base constructed by the natural greedy algorithm, and prove Cameron's Greedy Conjecture for $|G|$ odd.</description>

      <title>Profinite Rigidity over Noetherian Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of profinite rigidity for modules over a Noetherian domain: to what extent are these objects determined by their finite images? We establish foundational statements in analogy to classical results in the category of groups. We describe three profinite invariants of modules over any Noetherian domain $\Lambda$. We show that free modules are profinitely rigid when $\Lambda$ satisfies a homological condition, and characterise the profinite genus of all modules when $\Lambda$ is a Dedekind domain. In the case where $\Lambda$ is a PID, we find that all finitely generated modules are profinitely rigid. As an application, we prove that solvable Baumslag--Solitar groups are profinitely rigid in the absolute sense. These are the first examples of absolute profinite rigidity among non-abelian one-relator groups and among non-LERF groups.</description>

      <title>On the Number of Regular Integers Modulo $n$ and Its Significance to Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02471v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give four alternative proofs to a formula on the number of non-congruent regular integers modulo $n$, where an integer $m$ is regular modulo $n$ if $m^2 x \equiv m \pmod{n}$ has a solution for $x$ in $\mathbb{Z}$. The formula, which expresses this number in terms of Euler totients of unitary divisors of $n$, is related to some recent variant of the RSA cryptosystem for regular integers modulo $n$, which is briefly outlined to underpin its significance.</description>

      <title>Amenability of group actions on compact spaces and the associated Banach algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08357v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a topological group $G$ , amenability can be characterized by the amenability of the convolution Banach algebra $L^1(G)$. Here a Banach algebra $A$ is called amenable if every bounded derivation from $A$ into any dual-type $A$-$A$-Banach bimodule are inner. We extend this classical result to discrete group actions on compact Hausdorff spaces. By introducing a Banach algebra naturally associated with the action and adopting a suitably weakened notion of amenability for Banach algebras, we obtain an analogous characterization of amenable actions. As a lemma, we also proved a fixed-point property for amenable actions that strengthens the theorem of Dong and Wang (2015).</description>
