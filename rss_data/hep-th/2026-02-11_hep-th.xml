      <title>Area Scaling of Dynamical Degrees of Freedom in Regularised Scalar Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How many canonical degrees of freedom does a quantum field theory actually use during its Hamiltonian evolution? For a UV/IR-regularised classical scalar field, we address this question directly at the level of phase-space dynamics by identifying the minimal symplectic dimension required to reproduce a single trajectory by an autonomous Hamiltonian system. Using symplectic model order reduction as a structure-preserving diagnostic, we show that for the free scalar field this minimal dimension is controlled not by the volume-extensive number of discretised field variables, but by the much smaller number of distinct normal-mode frequencies below the ultraviolet cutoff. In flat space, this leads to an area-type scaling with the size of the region, up to slowly varying corrections. On geodesic balls in maximally symmetric curved spaces, positive curvature induces mild super-area growth, while negative curvature suppresses the scaling, with the flat result recovered smoothly in the small-curvature limit. Numerical experiments further indicate that this behaviour persists in weakly interacting $\lambda\phi^4$ theory over quasi-integrable time scales. Beyond counting, the reduced dynamics exhibits a distinctive internal structure: it decomposes into independent oscillator blocks, while linear combinations of these blocks generate a larger family of apparent field modes whose Poisson brackets are governed by a projector rather than the identity. This reveals a purely classical and dynamical mechanism by which overlapping degrees of freedom arise, without modifying canonical structures by hand. Our results provide a controlled field-theoretic setting in which area-type scaling and overlap phenomena can be studied prior to quantisation, helping to identify which aspects of such structures--often discussed in holographic contexts--can already arise from classical Hamiltonian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Families of QFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RG flows and IR phases of QFTs can be constrained by generalized symmetries and their anomalies. Broken symmetries act on the space of coupling constants of families of theories, and can also have IR-constraining family anomalies. We generalize family anomaly considerations to cases of broken generalized/categorical symmetries, including higher-group and non-invertible symmetries. We consider the anomaly inflow and SymTFTs of such generalized families of QFTs, and their implications for RG flows and constraints on the IR phases. As examples, we apply family anomalies to study the IR phases of $4d$ QCD-like theories deformed by irrelevant, multi-fermion interactions.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of flat connections and Fay identities on arbitrary Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A flat connection on a Riemann surface with values in an infinite dimensional Lie algebra provides a systematic and effective tool for generating an infinite family of polylogarithms via iterated integrals. The recent literature offers different types of connections, in one or several variables, on compact Riemann surfaces with or without punctures, and in the meromorphic or single-valued categories. In this work, we show that the flatness conditions for the single-valued and modular DHS connection in multiple variables, which was introduced in the companion paper arXiv:2602.01461, are equivalent to the union of all the interchange and Fay identities among DHS integration kernels that were proven in arXiv:2407.11476. Based on the same combinatorial techniques, the flatness conditions on the multivariable Enriquez connection is shown to imply the union of all the interchange and Fay identities for Enriquez kernels.</description>

      <title>Boundary bound states and integrable Wilson loops in ABJM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an integrable reflection matrix for the scattering of excitations from a boundary with a degree of freedom when the reflection process preserves an $SU(1|2)$ symmetry. As this residual symmetry is not sufficient to fully determine the reflection matrix, we use the boundary remnant of the Yangian symmetry invariance and obtain a family of integrable solutions. A concrete realization of this setup is found when studying insertions in the 1/2 BPS Wilson loop in ABJM theory. The boundary degree of freedom appears as a boundary bound state due to poles in the dressing phase of the reflection matrix. We also compare our results with those obtained from the boundary bound state bootstrap procedure. The ABJM Wilson loop example enables us to perform perturbative verifications of our results.</description>

      <title>On the structure of interactions of mass dimension one fermions: a functional renormalization group perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide the first systematic investigation of renormalization group properties of mass dimension one fermions described by ELKO spinors. By construction, ELKOs must be neutral under any Standard Model charge, therefore, providing a natural candidate for dark matter. We consider two versions of scalar-ELKO systems: the first characterized by a derivative Yukawa-like interaction, while the second involves ELKO four-fermion interactions as well as a scalar-ELKO portal. We also considered a system composed of ELKOs interacting with an Abelian gauge field via Pauli-like term. In all cases, we identified the minimal set of interactions that are required by a consistent renormalization group flow, and we discussed the possibility of constructing UV-complete trajectories based on asymptotic freedom. We used the functional renormalization group as a method of investigation.</description>

      <title>Analytical methods in Quantum Field Theories: from loop integrals to defect correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis expands the available techniques at weak coupling by investigating the linear space of Feynman integrals and the role that (super)symmetry plays in reducing the number of integrals necessary to calculate correlators in the presence of a one-dimensional extended operator - the line defect. In the first part, linear relations among Feynman parametrized integrals are derived from their properties as projective forms; these relations are then tested on one- and multi-loop examples, and their connection to the algebra of polynomial ideals is uncovered. In the second part, made of two chapters, the defect CFT formed by the N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory in the presence of a Maldacena-Wilson line is studied through bulk-defect-defect and multipoint correlation functions up to next-to-next-to-leading order in the perturbative expansion at weak coupling. The investigations into this defect CFT lead to the identification of classes of integrals containing all the perturbative information necessary to compute the correlators, which turn out to be either rational functions or Goncharov polylogarithms.</description>

      <title>Four-point functions with fractional R-symmetry excitations in the D1-D5 CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study correlation functions with fractional-mode excitations of the R-symmetry currents in D1-D5 CFT. We show how fractional-mode excitations lift to the covering surface associated with correlation functions as a specific sum of integer-mode excitations, with coefficients that can be determined exactly from the covering map in terms of Bell polynomials. We consider the four-point functions of fractional excitations of two chiral/anti-chiral NS fields, Ramond ground states and the twist-two scalar modulus deformation operator that drives the CFT away from the free point. We derive explicit formulas for classes of these functions with twist structures $(n)$-$(2)$-$(2)$-$(n)$ and $(n_1)(n_2)$-$(2)$-$(2)$-$(n_1)(n_2)$, the latter involving double-cycle fields. The final answer for the four-point functions always depends only on the lift of the base-space cross-ratio. We discuss how this relates to Hurwitz blocks associated with different conjugacy classes of permutations, the corresponding OPE channels and fusion rules.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Implementation of the Constraints in Conformal Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a first-order geometric Lagrangian for four-dimensional conformal gravity within the Cartan formulation, which yields, dynamically, the standard constraints on the fields, expected for conformal gravity. Upon imposing the dynamical constraints, together with the request of conformal invariance of the off-shell Lagrangian, the theory reduces to the standard expression for conformal gravity, in terms of quadratic curvature invariants. Our results clarify the geometric status of conformal gravity as a gauge theory and open the way to a similar dynamical implementation of the constraints in higher dimensions and supersymmetric extensions.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Complex Phase Diagram for the Born-Infeld AdS Black Holes with Reentrant Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lee-Yang phase transition theory applied in the anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole has inspired the exploration of complex phase diagram and supercritical phenomena in black hole thermodynamics. In this study, we extend the approach to the four dimensional Born-Infeld AdS black hole. This system exhibits a rich phase structure, including reentrant phase transitions, due to the modulation of the Born-Infeld nonlinear parameter. Through the analysis by Lee-Yang zeros, we obtained the complex phase diagram of the Born-Infeld AdS black hole and derived the supercritical crossover line -- Widom line. It strictly originates from the first-order stable critical point. The results indicate that Born-Infeld nonlinear effects significantly alter the types and characteristics of phase transition in critical region, while do not disrupt the uniqueness of the Widom line in supercritical region. Our study uncovers a universal simplified feature of the thermodynamic behavior of nonlinear gravitational systems in supercritical region. It also deepens our understanding of the fundamental connection between critical phenomena and continuous phase transitions in the extended phase space of black holes.</description>

      <title>More on 5d Wilson Loops in Higher-Rank Theories and Blowup Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we further explore the construction and computation of expectation values for Wilson loops in higher-rank 5d $\mathcal{N} = 1$ gauge theories on $\mathbb{C}_2 \times S_1$, by explicitly computing the Wilson loops via Chern-character insertion and qq-characters, including cases with the exceptional gauge group $G_2$. In particular, we propose a systematic way to write down the general blowup equations for Wilson loops by using the constraints from the one-form symmetry and low-instanton data from the instanton partition function. In addition, for one-instanton contributions in a large family of Wilson loop representations, we observe that they admit a $q_1q_2$-expansion, similar to the Hilbert-series structure of instanton partitions in pure gauge theories.</description>

      <title>The Deformed Dirac Oscillator in Linear-Fractional Doubly Special Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $(1+1)$-dimensional Dirac oscillator within a class of doubly special relativity (DSR) models generated by linear-fractional (projective) transformations on momentum space that preserve both the invariant speed of light and a high-energy observer-independent scale $\Ep$. Starting from the associated deformed Casimir invariants, we construct the coordinate-space Dirac equations for three inequivalent choices of the deformation vector (time-like, space-like, and light-like). For the time-like and light-like realizations the deformation induces momentum-dependent effective mass operators, which makes the coordinate-space formulation sensitive to operator ordering. To retain locality and obtain solvable second-order equations we adopt a reverted-product ordering prescription. Closed-form relativistic energy spectra and eigenfunctions are obtained in all three geometries, and the standard Dirac-oscillator results are recovered smoothly in the limit $\Ep\to\infty$. Finally, we derive the nonrelativistic expansion of the positive-energy branch and show that the deformation geometry controls the leading rest-energy shift and the renormalization of the oscillator level spacing.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine spectral- and split representations to factorize multi-loop momentum space diagrams, in the Schwinger-Keldysh formulation for cosmological correlators, with massive scalars in the loop. This allows us to extend the resummation of loop contributions from flat to de Sitter space. Furthermore, in our split representation the signal part of the correlators can be identified directly on the integrand level from the spectral function. We apply this to describe the non-perturbative flow of the EFT background and the cosmological collider signals in a large-N model.</description>

      <title>The canonical energy-momentum currents in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The parallel theory of relativity predicts conserved energy-momentum currents for an arbitrary metric, without invoking Killing symmetries. By treating the reference frame as an independent variational field and requiring it to carry no energy, the theory naturally unifies Einstein's two formulations of gravity and yields uniquely defined covariant charges. In isotropic and homogeneous cosmology, the canonical time direction selected by the reference frame coincides with the Kodama vector, and the associated Noether energy reproduces the Misner-Sharp mass.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves in a minimal gravitational SME</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the generation and propagation of gravitational waves within a minimal gravitational SME (Standard Model Extension). Starting from the modified graviton dispersion relation derived in the linearized gravity sector, we analyze the polarization properties of gravitational waves in the transverse-traceless tensor sector. We then construct the retarded Green function associated with the Lorentz-violating wave operator, explicitly verifying the causal structure of the theory and identifying the modified propagation speeds of the tensorial modes. In addition, we study the source-induced emission of gravitational waves from a binary black-hole system. We show that the gravitational waveform preserves the standard quadrupolar amplitude and polarization structure, while Lorentz-violating effects enter exclusively through a modification of the retarded time. As a result, the spatial components of the metric perturbation $h_{ij}(t,r)$ acquire a phase shift determined by the SME coefficients. Finally, we estimate phenomenological bounds to the model under consideration.</description>

      <title>Towards a quantitative characterization of gravitational universality classes for order-4 random tensor models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random tensor models can be used as combinatorial devices to generate Euclidean dynamical triangulations. A physical continuum limit of dynamical triangulations requires a suitable generalization of the double-scaling limit of random matrices. This limit corresponds to a fixed point of a pregeometric Renormalization Group flow in which the tensor size $N$ serves as the Renormalization Group scale. We search for corresponding fixed points in order-4 random tensor models associated to dynamical triangulations in 4 dimensions. In a $O(N)^{\otimes 4}$ symmetric setting, we discuss the resulting phase portrait as a function of the regulator parameters. We optimize our results, identifying parameter values for which the results are minimally sensitive to parameter changes. We find three fixed-point candidates: only one of them is real across the entire parameter range, but only has two relevant directions. This should be contrasted with the university class of the Reuter fixed point in continuum quantum gravity, very likely characterized by three relevant directions. We conclude that simple combinatorial models of Euclidean triangulations and the Reuter fixed point most likely lie in different universality classes.</description>

      <title>Highly suppressed tensor-to-scalar ratio from a modified Lennard-Jones inflationary potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasingly stringent observational bounds on primordial gravitational waves strongly constrain inflationary model building, favoring scenarios that predict highly suppressed tensor perturbations. While many viable constructions rely on non-canonical kinetic terms, non-minimal couplings, or modifications of gravity, it remains an open question whether comparably small tensor amplitudes can emerge within a minimal, single-field framework driven solely by potential dynamics. In this work we propose a novel inflationary scenario based on a modified Lennard-Jones potential. Inspired by a well-known interaction potential in molecular physics, the proposed form naturally combines a smooth minimum with an extended flat plateau at large field values. This intrinsic structure supports slow-roll inflation and ensures a graceful exit without introducing additional degrees of freedom. We perform a detailed analysis of the inflationary dynamics and confront the model with current observational constraints. We find that the scalar spectral index is fully consistent with CMB data, while the tensor-to-scalar ratio is predicted to be extremely small, reaching values as low as $r\sim10^{-7}$. Finally, the running of the scalar spectral index is also found to be small, well withing the 1$\sigma$ recent observational bounds from Atacama Cosmology Telescope.</description>

Abstract: We analyse the homogeneous parts of Clifford and meson algebras and point out that for the Clifford algebra it is related to fermionic statistics, that is, to fermionic parastatistics of order 1 while for the meson algebra it is related to fermionic parastatistics of order 2. We extend these homogeneous algebras into corresponding algebras related to fermionic parastatistics of all orders. We then define correspondingly higher order generalizations of Clifford and meson algebras.</description>

      <title>Colour confinement and gauge-invariant field-strength correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we produce evidence that confinement of colour is due to dual superconductivity of $QCD$ vacuum. To do that we put together results of old numerical simulations and results of more recent investigations. The starting point is the expectation that gauge theories admit a dual description in terms of monopoles. The strategy is then to construct the creation operator $\mu$ of a monopole and to compute its vacuum expectation value $\langle \mu \rangle$ , the disorder parameter which indicates dual superconductivity. The Imechanism of confinement is dual superconductivity of vacuum if $\langle \mu \rangle \neq 0 $ in the confined phase , and $\langle \mu \rangle =0$ in the deconfined phase. Confinement has to be certified by independent methods.
  It is shown that gauge invariance requires that field strengths be replaced by gauge invariant field strengths, which are their parallel transports to infinity. The resulting disorder parameter is a sum of correlation functions of gauge invariant field strength, and its behaviour understood by use of existing lattice data of two-point gauge invariant correlations.
  As a byproduct an apparent existing inconsistency, the lack of preferred orientation in colour space of the chromo-electric field inside confining flux tubes, is resolved.</description>

      <title>Non-minimally Coupled Running Curvaton: A Unified Approach to Early-Universe Inflation and Phantom Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024, combined with CMB and SNIa data, indicate a preference for a dynamical dark energy equation of state that crosses the phantom divide ($w &lt; -1$). This finding challenges the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and minimally coupled scalar field scenarios, including the original Running Curvaton model, which is typically constrained to the quintessence regime. In this work, we propose a unified cosmological framework by extending the Running Curvaton model via a non-minimal gravitational coupling of the form $\xi \chi^2 R$. We demonstrate that this geometric modification allows the effective equation of state to naturally evolve from a quintessence-like to a phantom-like regime in the Jordan frame, thereby providing a superior fit to the DESI observational contours ($w_0 &gt; -1, w_a &lt; 0$). Crucially, we show that the introduction of non-minimal coupling does not compromise the model's success in describing the early universe. Through a parameter re-tuning mechanism involving the coupling constant ($g_0^{obs} = g_0 + 2\xi$), the predictions for the primordial power spectrum (spectral index $n_s$) and local-type non-Gaussianity ($f_{NL}$) remain strictly preserved and consistent with Planck data. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive stability analysis within the Horndeski framework, verifying that the model remains free from ghost and gradient instabilities ($c_s^2 = 1$). Our results suggest that the non-minimally coupled Running Curvaton offers a robust, stable, and unified description of inflation and late-time accelerated expansion compatible with the latest precision cosmology data.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Multiple Polylogarithms with Arbitrary Arguments in \textsc{GiNaC}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for the numerical evaluation of elliptic multiple polylogarithms for arbitrary arguments and to arbitrary precision. The cornerstone of our approach is a procedure to obtain a convergent $q$-series representation of elliptic multiple polylogarithms. Its coefficients are expressed in terms of ordinary multiple polylogarithms, which can be evaluated efficiently using existing libraries. In a series of preparation steps the elliptic polylogarithms are mapped into a region where the $q$-series converges rapidly. We also present an implementation of our algorithm into the \texttt{GiNaC} framework. This release constitutes the first public package capable of evaluating elliptic multiple polylogarithms to high precision and for arbitrary values of the arguments.</description>

      <title>The Too Visible QCD Axion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Murayama proposed a GeV-scale axion theory where the up-quark mass term is generated dynamically by the QCD chiral condensate, spontaneously breaking a Peccei-Quinn symmetry. It predicts a too large mass splitting between neutral and charged pions. Trying to solve this problem we explore extensions. Despite some partial improvements, we identify a structural obstruction: the new Peccei-Quinn spurion breaks the accidental isospin symmetry of the chiral Lagrangian, leading to an enhanced higher-order operator. As a consequence, pion scatterings too are distorted. We also examine the limit in which the axion becomes light, finding that it is excluded by fifth-force constraints.</description>

      <title>Simplicity of confinement in SU(3) Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel observable associated to Abelian monopole currents defined in the Maximal Abelian Projection of SU(3) Yang-Mills theory that captures the topology of the current loop. This observable, referred to as the $\textit{simplicity}$, is defined as the ratio of the zeroth over the first Betti number of the current graph for a given field configuration. A numerical study of the expectation value of the simplicity performed in the framework of Lattice Gauge Theories enables us to determine the deconfinement temperature to a higher degree of accuracy than that reached by conventional methods at a comparable computational effort. Our results suggest that Abelian current loops are strongly correlated with the degrees of freedoms of the theory that determine confinement. Our investigation opens new perspectives for the definition of an order parameter for deconfinement in Quantum Chromodynamics able to expose the potentially rich phase structure of the theory.</description>

      <title>Resummed energy loss in extreme-mass-ratio scattering using critical orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent efforts to bridge between weak-field and strong-field descriptions of black-hole binary dynamics, we develop a resummation scheme for post-Minkowskian radiative observables in extreme-mass-ratio scattering, augmented with post-Newtonian terms. Specifically, we derive universal interpolation formulas for the total energy emitted in gravitational waves out to infinity and down the event horizon of the large black hole, valid to leading order in the small mass ratio. We test our formulas using numerical results from direct calculations in black hole perturbation theory. The central idea of our approach is to utilize as a strong-field diagnostic the known form of divergence in the radiated energy along geodesics near the parameter-space separatrix between scattering and plunge. The dominant, logarithmic term of this divergence can be expressed in terms of instantaneous energy fluxes calculated along the unstable circular geodesics that form the separatrix, fluxes that we obtain using interpolation of highly accurate numerical data. The same idea could be applied to bound-orbit radiative observables via either unbound-to-bound mapping or a direct resummation of bound-orbit post-Newtonian expressions.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we consider effective field theories for light fields transforming under the fundamental or adjoint representation of a continuous group. We demonstrate that in the presence of gravity, crossing symmetry combined with two subtraction sum rules, leads to stringent constraints on the spectrum of its ultraviolet (UV) completion. Such constraints come in the form of necessary conditions on the symmetry group irreps of the UV states. This is in sharp contrast with non-gravitational theories where anything goes. Beautifully, the graviton pole is the anchor of our argument, not an obstruction. Using numerical methods, we also demonstrate that the massless spin-2 must be a singlet under said symmetry group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate higher-order asymptotic symmetries for a $p$-form gauge field in $(p + 2)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, where Hodge duality with a scalar holds. Employing symplectic renormalization, we identify $N + 1$ independent asymptotic charges, with each charge being parametrised by an arbitrary function of the angular variables. By means of the Hodge decomposition, these charges share the same formal structure independently from p and are manifestly dual to a scalar charge. We work in Lorenz gauge, therefore the gauge parameters require a radial expansion involving logarithmic (subleading) terms to ensure nontrivial angular dependence at leading order. At the same time we assume a power expansion for the field strength, allowing logarithms in the gauge field expansions within pure gauge sectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04666v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisited the equivalence between the second- and first-order formulations of the Yang-Mills (YM) and gravity using the path integral formalism. We demonstrated that structural identities can be derived to relate Green's functions of auxiliary fields, computed in the first-order formulation, to Green's functions of composite fields in the second-order formulation. In YM theory, these identities can be verified at the integrand level of the loop integrals. For gravity, the path integral was obtained through the Faddeev-Senjanovi\'c procedure. The Senjanovi\'c determinant plays a key role in canceling tadpole-like contributions, which vanish in the dimensional regularization scheme but persist at finite temperature. Thus, the equivalence between the two formalisms is maintained at finite temperature. We also studied the coupling to matter. In YM theory, we investigated both minimal and non-minimal couplings. We derived first-order formulations, equivalent to the respective second-order formulations, by employing a procedure that introduces Lagrange multipliers (LM). This procedure can be easily generalized to gravity. We also considered an alternative gravity model, which is both renormalizable and unitary, that uses LM to restrict the loop expansion to one-loop order. However, this approach leads to a doubling of one-loop contributions due to the additional degrees of freedom associated with Ostrogradsky instabilities. To address this, we proposed a modified formalism that resolves these issues by requiring the path integral to be invariant under field redefinitions. This introduces ghost fields responsible for canceling the extra one-loop contributions arising from the LM fields, while also removing unphysical degrees of freedom. We also demonstrated that the modified formalism and the Faddeev-Popov procedure commute, indicating that the LM can be viewed as purely quantum fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graviweak theory seeks to unify gravity (specifically in its self-dual formulation) with the weak interaction, preying on their parallel chiral $SU(2)$ structures. In this paper we further this idea by folding it with the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking. We do this first with a standard Higgs field and potential, starting with a unifying parity-invariant theory which splits into the usual gravity and weak sector under spontaneous symmetry breaking. By rewriting the theory in the two-spin framework we are then prompted to discuss generalizations, within the generic approach known as MacDowell-Mansouri theories where a larger internal gauge group is broken. One of the predictions of the ensuing construction is a non-minimal coupling in the low energy broken phase between curvature and the weak gauge fields, translating at the quantum level to a direct channel between the graviton and the weak bosons.</description>

      <title>Quantum correlation beyond entanglement: Holographic discord and multipartite generalizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While entanglement is a cornerstone of quantum theory and holography, quantum correlations arising from superposition, such as quantum discord, offer a broader perspective that has remained largely unexplored in holography. We construct gravity duals of quantum discord and classical correlation. In both holographic systems and Haar random states, discord exceeds entanglement, revealing an additional quantum correlation linked to the Markov gap and non-distillable entanglement, suggesting holographic states are intrinsically non-bipartite. In black hole setups, discord can increase despite decoherence and persists beyond the sudden death of distillable entanglement. Motivated by the holographic formula, we define reflected discord -- an optimization-free boundary quantity based on reflected entropy -- which remains effective even outside the holographic regime. We also propose several multipartite generalizations of correlation measures. It includes holography-inspired correlations based on multi-entropy, which are shown to be UV-finite and reduce to bipartite measures in the bipartite limit. These results provide new tools for quantifying quantum correlations beyond entanglement in strongly coupled many-body systems and offer a novel approach to multipartite correlation measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For general one-matrix models in the large $N$ limit, we introduce the cap amplitude $\psi(b)$ as the expansion coefficient of the 1-form $ydx$ on the spectral curve. We find that the dilaton equation for the discrete volume $N_{g,n}$ of the moduli space of genus-$g$ Riemann surfaces with $n$ boundaries is interpreted as gluing the cap amplitude along one of the boundaries. In this process, one of the boundaries is capped and the number of boundaries decreases by one. In a similar manner, the genus-$g$ free energy $F_g$ is obtained by gluing the cap amplitude to $N_{g,1}$.</description>

      <title>Boundary Actions and Loop Groups: A Geometric Picture of Gauge Symmetries at Null Infinity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08725v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous work arXiv:2407.13556, we proposed an extended phase space structure at null infinity accommodating large gauge symmetries for sub$^n$-leading soft theorems in Yang-Mills, via dressing fields arising in the Stueckelberg procedure. Here, we give an explicit boundary action controlling the dynamics of these fields. This allows for a derivation from first principles of the associated charges, together with an explicit renormalization procedure when taking the limit to null and spatial infinity, matching with charges proposed in previous work. Using the language of fibre bundles, we relate the existence of Stueckelberg fields to the notion of extension/reduction of the structure group of a principal bundle, thereby deriving their transformation rules in a natural way, thus realising them as Goldstone-like objects. Finally, this allows us to give a geometric picture of the gauge transformation structure at the boundary, via a loop group coming from formal expansions in the coordinate transversal to the boundary.</description>

      <title>Local vertices, quadratic propagators and double-copy structure of one-loop integrands from forward limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By worldsheet approach, $n$-point one-loop integrand can be expressed as a combination of $(n+2)$-point tree-level bi-adjoint scalar (BS) amplitudes under forward limit. The integrands constructed by this approach have two closely related features which differ from conventional Feynman diagrams. First, the denominators of loop propagators are linear functions of the loop momentum. Second, the local vertex expression is not manifest. In our previous work, a systematic approach was proposed to handle the nonlocal terms in the one-loop integrand of Yang-Mills-scalar (YMS) theory. Upon canceling the nonlocalities, quadratic propagator forms of both YMS and Yang-Mills (YM) integrands are naturally obtained. In this paper, we generalize the calculation to theories involving gravitons by introducing the one-loop double Yang-Mills-scalar (dYMS) integrands. The cancellation of the nonlocalities of the dYMS integrand in the forward limit coincides with the emergence of local multi-point vertices. We provide two equivalent methods for extracting the vertices and give the final expression of the dYMS integrand with quadratic propagators. In this formula, tree-level effective subcurrents are attached to the loop propagator line via local vertices. Each of the effective subcurrents exhibits double-copy structure, in the sense that it is expressed as a combination of tree-level BS subcurrents associated with two copies of kinematic coefficients. The quadratic propagator formulas for Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) and gravity (GR) integrands are further derived, by the help of the formula for dYMS. The extraction of local vertices in one-loop dYMS integrand also applies at tree-level, thus we have the corresponding expressions of tree-level dYMS, EYM, and GR amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Exact BPS double-kinks in generalized $\phi^4$, $\phi^6$ and sine-Gordon models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a $(1+1)$-dimensional theory with a single real scalar field $\phi$ whose kinematics is modified by a generalizing function $f(\phi)$. After briefly reviewing its Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) structure, we focus on a particular $f(\phi)$ to obtain analytic BPS double-kink solutions in three different models governed by the $\phi^4$, $\phi^6$, and sine-Gordon superpotentials. In all cases, the resulting double-kinks approach the boundaries by following an exponential decay, with the generalizing function controlling its dependence on $x$ and mass. We also calculate the BPS bound explicitly and study how the double kinks behave near the origin. The energy distribution of the novel BPS states engenders symmetric two-lump profiles for the $\phi^4$ and sine-Gordon superpotentials. Whereas, for the $\phi^6$ superpotential, the BPS energy profiles form asymmetric two-lumps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the classical limit of relativistic scattering amplitudes, we compute the coupling between a general super-renormalizable gravity and massive scalar particles. This allows us to derive the $D$-dimensional metric corrections at both tree-level and one-loop level-the latter containing the first calculation by using newly derived three-graviton Feynman rules. By introducing Newtonian potential function $\Phi\equiv\frac{h_{00}}{2}$, we reproduce at tree level, $\mathcal{O}(G)$, the well-known result proportional to the error function in four-dimensional spacetime. Furthermore, we obtain the loop-level contributions to the potential function at order $\mathcal{O}(G^2)$ and perform a numerical analysis of its behavior at large distances. Our results indicate that, at the one-loop level, the magnitude of the potential increases gradually with distance in the asymptotic regime.</description>

Abstract: We study configurations of two $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theories of unitary gauge groups connected by the BPS interfaces involving line operators. We find strong evidence of S-duality of the configurations as precise matching of the line defect half-indices which enumerate the BPS local operators at the junctions of the interfaces and line operators. The interface line defect half-indices are expressible as intriguing closed-form formulae involving the $q$-binomial coefficients and the principal specializations of the Schur functions.</description>

      <title>The Unitarity Flow Conjecture: An On-shell Approach to the Renormalization Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that the broad architecture of the renormalization group flow in quantum field theories is, at least in part, fixed by unitarity. The precise statement is summarized in the Unitarity Flow Conjecture, which states that the non-linear $S$-matrix identities obtained by imposing unitarity imply those needed to derive the renormalization group equations. As a proof of principle, we verify this conjecture to all loops at the leading and subleading logarithmic order in the four-dimensional massless $\lambda\phi^4$ theory using on-shell techniques, without reference to any counterterms or Feynman diagrams.</description>

      <title>An algebra for covariant observers in de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In $d$-dimensional de Sitter spacetime, consistency of the perturbative expansion necessitates imposing all second-order gravitational constraints associated with the $SO(1,d)$ isometry group, rather than restricting to the $\R\times SO(d-1)$ subgroup, to address linearization instability. Since generic de Sitter isometries do not preserve a fixed static patch, these constraints cannot be implemented within a fixed local algebra. In this paper, we develop a framework that consistently imposes all $SO(1,d)$ constraints while incorporating multiple observers on arbitrary timelike geodesics. This is achieved by introducing the concept of covariant observer,  whose geodesic transforms covariantly under the isometry group. Upon quantization, the observer is described by a superposition of geodesics, with the associated static patches fluctuating, providing a quantum reference frame $L^2(SO(1,d))$. We realize this structure in an action model in which a particle carries a set of conserved charges, each one corresponding to a generator of de Sitter isometry group, which parametrize its geodesic and upon quantization lead to a fluctuating geodesic.

Inspired by the timelike tube theorem, we propose that the algebra of observables accessible to a covariant observer is generated by all degrees of freedom within its fluctuating static patch, including quantum field modes and other observers, which are treated as part of the matter system. Imposing the $SO(1,d)$ constraints yields a gauge-invariant algebra that takes the form of an averaged modular crossed product algebra over static patches and configurations of other geodesics, thereby generalizing the notion of a local algebra associated with a fixed region to that of a fluctuating region. We show this algebra is of type II by explicitly constructing a faithful normal trace, leading to an observer-dependent notion of von Neumann entropy. For semiclassical states, by imposing a UV cutoff in QFT and proposing a quantum generalization of the first law, we demonstrate the agreement between the algebraic and generalized entropies.</description>

Abstract: Here we investigate analytical properties of Weyl fermions in (2+1)-dimensional Lifshitz spacetimes. In particular, we are interested in obtaining geometric phases and verifying the existence of well-behaved fermionic zero modes. Using the Dirac phase method, we show how geometric phases naturally arise from the coupling between the fermionic fields and the Lifshitz geometry. We also present exact solutions of the zero modes by rewriting the Weyl equation as a system of supersymmetric equations.</description>

      <title>Unitary and Nonunitary A-D-E minimal models: Coset graph fusion algebras, defects, entropies, SREEs and dilogarithm identities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider both unitary and nonunitary A-D-E minimal models on the cylinder with topological defects along the non-contractible cycle of the cylinder. We define the coset graph $A \otimes G/\mathbb{Z}_2$ and argue that it encodes not only the (i) coset graph fusion algebra, but also (ii) the Affleck-Ludwig boundary g-factors; (iii) the defect g-factors (quantum dimensions) and (iv) the relative symmetry resolved entanglement entropy. By studying A-D-E restricted solid-on-solid models, we find that these boundary conformal field theory structures are also present on the lattice: defects (seams) are implemented by face weights with special values of the spectral parameter. Integrability allows the study of lattice transfer matrix T- and Y-system functional equations to reproduce the fusion algebra of defect lines. The effective central charges and conformal weights are expressed in terms of dilogarithms of the braid and bulk asymptotics of the Y-system expressed in terms of the quantum dimensions.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of perfect fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quantum field theory of zero temperature perfect fluids. Such systems are defined by quantizing a classical field theory of scalar fields $\phi^I$ that act as Lagrange coordinates on an internal spatial manifold of fluid configurations. Invariance under volume preserving diffeomorphisms acting on these scalars implies that the long-wavelength spectrum contains vortex (transverse modes) with an exact $\omega_T=0$ dispersion relation. As a consequence, physically interpreting the results obtained via perturbative quantization of this theory has proven to be challenging. In this paper, we show that correlators evaluated in a class of semi-classical (Gaussian) initial states prepared at $t=0$ are well-defined and accessible via perturbation theory. The width of the initial state effectively acts as an infrared regulator without explicitly breaking diffeomorphism invariance of the classical action. As an application, we compute the stress tensor two-point correlators and show that vortex modes give a non-trivial contribution to the response function, non-local in both space and time.</description>

      <title>Tame Complexity of Effective Field Theories in the Quantum Gravity Landscape</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective field theories consistent with quantum gravity obey surprising finiteness constraints, appearing in several distinct but interconnected forms. In this work we develop a framework that unifies these observations by proposing that the defining data of such theories, as well as the landscape of effective field theories that are valid at least up to a fixed cutoff, admit descriptions with a uniform bound on complexity. To make this precise, we use tame geometry and work in sharply o-minimal structures, in which tame sets and functions come with two integer parameters that quantify their information content; we call this pair their tame complexity. Our Finite Complexity Conjectures are supported by controlled examples in which an infinite Wilsonian expansion nevertheless admits an equivalent finite-complexity description, typically through hidden rigidity conditions such as differential or recursion relations. We further assemble evidence from string compactifications, highlighting the constraining role of moduli space geometry and the importance of dualities. This perspective also yields mathematically well-defined notions of counting and volume measures on the space of effective theories, formulated in terms of effective field theory domains and coverings, whose finiteness is naturally enforced by the conjectures.</description>

      <title>Computational quantum field theory for fermion pair creation in 2-dimensional curved spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Similarly to the well-known phenomenon of particle / anti-particle pair production in strong electromagnetic fields (the Schwinger effect), the na\"ive matter field vacuum state can be excited by time-dependent, curved spacetime geometries. This gravitational pair creation corresponds to tunnelling out of a false vacuum. In this work, we study this non-perturbative process using a spacetime resolved numerical approach in the interaction picture. To achieve this, we extend the framework of Computational Quantum Field Theory (CQFT), which allows for efficient numerical time evolution of quantum fields, to spin-$1/2$ fermions in curved spacetime.
  Using this extended framework, we investigate vacuum excitation of a Dirac field induced by a spacetime-curvature quench. In particular, we evolve the fermionic Minkowski vacuum in a $1\!+\!1$-dimensional idealized curved spacetime characterized by a localized ``curvature bump'' generated by a smooth, localized Gaussian deformation of flat spacetime. Vacuum excitation is quantified by computing the fermion--antifermion pair numbers defined with respect to the basis corresponding to flat-spacetime (Minkowski) which is the asymptotic metric corresponding to an observor at infinity.
  We analyze how the excitation depends on the strength and spatial extent of the curvature deformation and discuss the numerical implementation of CQFT in curved backgrounds. While the post-quench geometry considered here is static and no electromagnetic field is included, the present work establishes a foundation for future investigations of particle creation in genuinely time-dependent curved spacetimes and in the presence of electromagnetic backgrounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00781v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study universal solutions to reflection equations with a spectral parameter, so-called K-operators, within a general framework of universal K-matrices - an extended version of the approach introduced by Appel-Vlaar. Here, the input data is a quasi-triangular Hopf algebra $H$, its comodule algebra $B$ and a pair of consistent twists. In our setting, the universal K-matrix is an element of $B\otimes H$ satisfying certain axioms, and we consider the case $H$ is the quantum loop algebra for $sl_2$, and $B={\cal A}_q$ is the alternating central extension of the $q$-Onsager algebra. Considering tensor products of evaluation representations of $H$ in "non-semisimple" cases, the new set of axioms allows us to introduce and study fused K-operators of spin-$j$; in particular, to prove that for all $j\in\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{N}$ they satisfy the spectral-parameter dependent reflection equation. We provide their explicit expression in terms of elements of the algebra ${\cal A}_q$ for small values of spin-$j$. The precise relation between the fused K-operators of spin-$j$ and evaluations of a universal K-matrix for ${\cal A}_q$ is conjectured based on supporting evidences. We finally discuss implications of our results on the K-operators for quantum integrable systems.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we explore topological phases of matter obtained by effectively gauging or fermionizing a system, where the Gauss law constraint is only enforced energetically. In contrast to conventional gauging or fermionization, the symmetry that is effectively gauged at low energies still generates a global symmetry that acts on the whole Hilbert space faithfully. This symmetry turns out to protect a nontrivial topological phase together with other symmetries, or it can carry a nontrivial emergent 't Hooft anomaly. We provide a precise formula for the topological response action involving these symmetries in a general setup, as well as a formula for 't Hooft anomalies. As an application, we apply the general treatment of the procedure to gapless systems and find various new gapless SPT phases, such as the one carrying the Gu-Wen fermionic anomalies at low energy.</description>

      <title>From equivalent Lagrangians to inequivalent open quantum system dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14752v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lagrangians can differ by a total derivative without altering the equations of motion, thus encoding the same physics. This is true both classically and quantum mechanically. We show, however, that in the context of open quantum systems, two Lagrangians that differ by a total derivative can lead to inequivalent reduced dynamics. While these Lagrangians are connected via unitary transformations at the level of the global system-plus-environment description, the equivalence breaks down after tracing out the environment. We argue that only those Lagrangians for which the canonical and mechanical momenta of the system coincide lead to operationally meaningful dynamics. Applying this insight to quantum electrodynamics (QED), we derive the master equation for bremsstrahlung due to an accelerated non-relativistic electron upto second order in the interaction. The resulting reduced dynamics predicts decoherence in the position basis and closely matches the Caldeira-Leggett form, thus resolving previous discrepancies in the literature. Our findings have implications for both QED and gravitational decoherence, where similar ambiguities arise.</description>

Abstract: We explore topological manipulations in one spatial dimension, which are defined for a system with a global symmetry and map the system to another one with a dual symmetry. In particular, we discuss fusion category symmetries enhanced by the invariance of the actions of topological manipulations, i.e., self-$G$-alities for topological manipulations. Based on the self-$G$-ality conditions, we provide LSM-type constraints on the ground states of many-body Hamiltonians. We clarify the relationship between different enhanced symmetries and introduce the notion of $\textit{codimension-two transitions}$. We explore concrete lattice models for such self-$G$-alities and find how the self-$G$-ality structures match the IR critical theories.</description>

      <title>Direction-dependent linear response for gapped nodal-line semimetals in planar-Hall configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the magnetoelectric conductivity for ideal nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs), with a finite but tiny mass-gap, in distinct planar-Hall set-ups. Each differing configuration results from the relative orientation of the nodal-ring's plane with respect to the plane spanned by the electric ($\mathbf E $) and magnetic ($\mathbf B$) fields. The net conductivity tensor has components comprising the Drude, anomalous-Hall, in-plane (with $\mathbf E$ and $\mathbf B$) longitudinal and transverse, and Lorentz-force-operator-induced parts. Our results feature the signatures of the inherent topology of a gapped NLSM, revealed through nonzero values of the Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment. In particular, we show that both of these vector fields, arising in the momentum space, give rise to terms of comparable magnitudes in the resulting response. Our explicit theoretical expressions will help identify unique signatures of NLSMs in contemporary experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21799v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how to compute the probability distributions of the order parameter of the $O(n)$ model at two-loop order of perturbation theory generalizing the methods developed for computing the same in case of the Ising model \cite{Sahu:2025bkp}. We show that even for the $O(n)$ model, there exists not one but a family of these probability distribution functions indexed by $\zeta$ which is the ratio of system size $L$ to the bulk correlation length $\xi_{\infty}$. We also compare these PDFs to the Monte-Carlo simulations and the existing FRG results for the $O(2)$ and $O(3)$ models.</description>

      <title>Error-resilient Reversal of Quantum Chaotic Dynamics Enabled by Scramblons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of the arrow of time in quantum many-body systems stems from the inherent tendency of Hamiltonian evolution to scramble quantum information and increase entanglement. While, in principle, one might counteract this temporal directionality by engineering a perfectly inverted Hamiltonian to reverse entanglement growth, such a scenario is fundamentally unstable because even minor imperfections in the backward evolution can be exponentially amplified, a hallmark of quantum many-body chaos. Therefore, successfully reversing quantum many-body dynamics demands a deep understanding of the underlying structure of quantum information scrambling and chaotic dynamics. In this letter, by using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance on a macroscopic ensemble of randomly interacting spins, we measure the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) and validate key predictions of scramblon theory, a universal theoretical framework for information scrambling. Crucially, this theory enables us to isolate and mitigate errors in the OTOC caused by imperfections in the backward evolution. As a result, this protocol uncovers the anticipated exponential behavior of quantum many-body chaos and extracts the quantum Lyapunov exponent in a many-body experimental system for the first time. Our results push the fundamental limits of dynamical reversibility of complex quantum systems, with implications for quantum simulation and metrology.</description>

      <title>Coupling Electromagnetism to Torsion: Black Holes and Spin-Charge Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coupling between matter fields and gravity, encoded in the geometry of spacetime, can be realized in various ways. Most commonly, a minimal coupling principle is employed, meaning that all matter fields, except spinors, couple only to the spacetime metric, while spinors additionally couple to the spacetime connection. Non-minimal couplings between matter fields and spacetime curvature can arise, for example, from quantum field theory on curved spacetime through renormalization corrections, in gauge theories of gravity, and in effective field theories. In this article, we consider a non-minimal coupling $F^{\mu\nu}\tilde{R}_{\mu\nu}$ between the field strength tensor of the electromagnetic field $F_{\mu\nu}$ and the antisymmetric part of the Ricci tensor $\tilde{R}_{[\mu\nu]}$ in Riemann--Cartan geometry, which is based on a general metric-compatible connection with torsion. We find an exact four-dimensional vacuum solution that generalizes the Reissner--Nordstr{\"o}m black hole from Einstein--Maxwell and reveals new interactions between the intrinsic torsion-spin charge and the electric charge. Qualitatively, this solution exhibits two distinct features: the effective charge is not constrained to be positive, and the sign of the electric charge influences its gravitational effects. We also derive slowly rotating solutions in three dimensions, representing a generalized slowly rotating BTZ black hole solution with couplings among the magnetic and electric charges, the angular momentum, and the intrinsic torsion-spin charge.</description>

      <title>A multi-parameter expansion for the evolution of asymmetric binaries in astrophysical environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compact binaries with large mass asymmetries - such as Extreme and Intermediate Mass Ratio Inspirals - are unique probes of the astrophysical environments in which they evolve. Their long-lived and intricate dynamics allow for precise inference of source properties, provided waveform models are accurate enough to capture the full complexity of their orbital evolution. In this work, we develop a multi-parameter formalism, inspired by vacuum perturbation theory, to model asymmetric binaries embedded in general matter distributions with both radial and tangential pressures. In the regime of small deviations from the Schwarzschild metric, relevant to most astrophysical scenarios, the system admits a simplified description, where both metric and fluid perturbations can be cast into wave equations closely related to those of the vacuum case. This framework offers a practical approach to modeling the dynamics and the gravitational wave emission from binaries in realistic matter distributions, and can be modularly integrated with existing results for vacuum sources.</description>

      <title>Probing small-scale primordial power spectra with induced gravitational waves</title>

Abstract: Large-scale primordial perturbations have been well constrained by current cosmological observations, but the properties of small-scale perturbations remain elusive. This study focuses on second-order induced gravitational waves generated by large-amplitude primordial scalar and tensor perturbations on small scales. In this case, the induced gravitational waves include contributions from three types of source terms: scalar-scalar, tensor-scalar, and tensor-tensor. To distinguish them from second-order scalar induced gravitational waves (SIGWs), we refer to those generated by these three source terms as tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves (TSIGWs). We provide the analytical expressions for the kernel functions and the corresponding energy density spectra of second-order TSIGWs. By combining observations of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) across different scales, TSIGWs can be used to constrain small-scale primordial curvature perturbations and primordial gravitational waves. Furthermore, we discuss the feasibility of TSIGWs dominating the current pulsar timing array (PTA) observations under various primordial power spectra scenarios. Our results indicate that TSIGWs generated by monochromatic primordial power spectra might be more likely to dominate the current PTA observations.</description>

Abstract: The study of quantum Hall effect (QHE) is a foundation of topological physics, inspiring extensive explorations of its high-dimensional generalizations. Notably, the four dimensional (4D) QHE has been experimentally realized in synthetic quantum systems, including cold atoms, photonic lattices, and metamaterials. However, the many-body effect in the 4D QHE system remains poorly understood. In this study, we explore this problem by formulating the microscopic wavefunctions inspired by Laughlin's seminal work. Employing a generalized pseudo-potential framework, we derive an exact microscopic Hamiltonian consisting of two-body projectors that annihilate the microscopic wavefunctions. Diagonalizations on a small size system show that the quasi-hole states remain zero energy while the quasi-particle states exhibit a finite gap, in consistency with an incompressible state. Furthermore, the pairing distribution is calculated to substantiate the liquid-like nature of the wavefunction. Our work provides a preliminary understanding to the fractional topological states in high dimension.</description>

      <title>A Tensor Category Construction of the $W_{p,q}$ Triplet Vertex Operator Algebra and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For coprime $p,q\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 2}$, the triplet vertex operator algebra $W_{p,q}$ is a non-simple extension of the universal Virasoro vertex operator algebra of central charge $c_{p,q}=1-\frac{6(p-q)^2}{pq}$, and it is a basic example of a vertex operator algebra appearing in logarithmic conformal field theory. Here, we give a new construction of $W_{p,q}$ different from the original screening operator definition of Feigin-Gainutdinov-Semikhatov-Tipunin. Using our earlier work on the tensor category structure of modules for the Virasoro algebra at central charge $c_{p,q}$, we show that the simple modules appearing in the decomposition of $W_{p,q}$ as a module for the Virasoro algebra have $\mathrm{PSL}_2$-fusion rules and generate a symmetric tensor category equivalent to $\operatorname{Rep}\mathrm{PSL}_2$. Then we use the theory of commutative algebras in braided tensor categories to construct $W_{p,q}$ as an appropriate non-simple modification of the canonical algebra in the Deligne tensor product of $\operatorname{Rep}\mathrm{PSL}_2$ with this Virasoro subcategory. As a consequence, we show that the automorphism group of $W_{p,q}$ is $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{C})$. We also define a braided tensor category $\mathcal{O}_{c_{p,q}}^0$ consisting of modules for the Virasoro algebra at central charge $c_{p,q}$ that induce to untwisted modules of $W_{p,q}$. We show that $\mathcal{O}_{c_{p,q}}^0$ tensor embeds into the $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{C})$-equivariantization of the category of $W_{p,q}$-modules and is closed under contragredient modules. We conjecture that $\mathcal{O}_{c_{p,q}}^0$ has enough projective objects and is the correct category of Virasoro modules for constructing logarithmic minimal models in conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential revisited in the context of Warm Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Warm Inflation is a scenario in which the inflaton field dissipates its energy during inflation to maintain a subdominant constant radiation bath. Two of its remarkable features are (i) inflation can be realized even by very steep potentials and (ii) such a scenario doesn't call for a separate post-inflation reheating phase. We exploit the first feature to show that Warm Inflation can successfully take place on the very steep left wing of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential while remaining in excellent agreement with current cosmological data (joint analysis of Planck, ACT and DESI). The Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential has a flatter right wing as well, which opens up the possibility of dark energy when the field rolls along this wing. However in order to successfully realize quintessential inflation one needs to (i) normalize the two wings of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential differently in order to bridge between the two extreme energy scales of inflation and dark energy, (ii) allow the quintessence field to be dissipative, which is consistent with the presence of a dissipative term in warm inflation. The dissipative dynamics of the quintessence field is needed in order to sustain slow-roll in the right wing. With these modifications, we demonstrate that the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential can give rise to a unified model of warm inflation (on the left wing) and transient dark energy (on the right wing).</description>

      <title>Local Scale Invariance in Quantum Theory: A Non-Hermitian Pilot-Wave Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03567v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Weyl's abandoned idea of local scale invariance has a natural realization at the quantum level in pilot-wave (de Broglie-Bohm) theory. We obtain the Weyl covariant derivative by complexifying the electromagnetic gauge coupling parameter. The resultant non-hermiticity has a natural interpretation in terms of local scale invariance in pilot-wave theory. The conserved current density is modified from $|\psi|^2$ to the local scale invariant, trajectory-dependent ratio $|\psi|^2/ \mathbf 1^2[\mathcal C]$, where $\mathbf 1[\mathcal C]$ is a scale factor that depends on the pilot-wave trajectory $\mathcal C$ in configuration space. All physical predictions are local scale invariant, even in the presence of mass terms. Our approach is general, and we implement it for the Schr\"odinger and Pauli equations, and for the Dirac equation in curved spacetime, each coupled to an external electromagnetic field. We also implement it in quantum field theory for the case of a quantized axion field interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field. We discuss the equilibrium probability density and show that the corresponding trajectories are unique. Our results provide a pivotal understanding of local scale invariance in quantum theory.</description>
