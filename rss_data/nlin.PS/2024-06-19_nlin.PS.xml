      <title>Solitons in higher-order topological insulator created by unit cell twisting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that higher-order topological insulators can be created from usual square structure by twisting waveguides in each unit cell around the axis passing through the center of the unit cell, even without changing intracell distance between waveguides. When applied to usual square array, this approach produces two-dimensional generalization of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) structure supporting topological corner modes with propagation constants belonging to two forbidden spectral gaps opening only for twist angles from certain interval. In contrast to usual SSH arrays, where higher-order topology is typically introduced by diagonal waveguide shifts and only one type of corner states exists, our SSH-like structure in topological phase supports two co-existing types of in-phase and out-of-phase corner modes appearing in two different topological gaps that open in the spectrum. Therefore, twisting of the unit cell qualitatively changes topological properties of the system, offering a new degree of freedom in creation of higher-order topological phases. In material with focusing cubic nonlinearity two coexisting types of topological corner solitons emerge from these modes, whose existence and stability properties are studied here. Despite different internal structure, both such modes can be simultaneously dynamically stable in the appreciable part of the topological gap.</description>

      <title>Vegetation clustering and self-organization in inhomogeneous environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to climatic changes, excessive grazing, and deforestation, semi-arid and arid ecosystems are vulnerable to desertification and land degradation. Adversely affected biological productivity has a negative impact on social, economic, and environmental factors. The term 'arid ecosystems' refers not only to water-scarce landscapes but also to nutrient-poor environments. Specifically, the vegetation cover loses spatial homogeneity as aridity increases, and the self-organized heterogeneous vegetation patterns developed could eventually collapse into a bare state. It is still unclear whether this transition would be gradual or abrupt, leading to the often-called catastrophic shift of ecosystems. Several studies suggest that environmental inhomogeneities in time or space can promote a gradual transition to bare soil, thus avoiding catastrophic shifts. Environmental inhomogeneities include non-uniformities in the spatial distribution of precipitation, spatial irregularities in topography and other external factors. Employing a generic mathematical model including environmental inhomogeneities in space, we show how two branches of vegetation patterns create a hysteresis loop when the effective mortality level changes. These two branches correspond to qualitatively distinct vegetation self-organized responses. In an increasing mortality scenario, one observes an equilibrium branch of high vegetation biomass forming self-organized patterns with a well-defined wavelength. However, reversing the mortality trend, one observes a low biomass branch lacking a wavelength. We call this phenomenon the clustering of vegetation patches. This behavior can be connected to historically significant trends of climate change in arid ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Manipulation and control of temporal cavity solitons with trapping potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal cavity solitons (CSs) are stable, localized particle-like objects in the form of optical pulses that circulate indefinitely in coherently driven nonlinear resonators. In the spectral domain, they form highly coherent frequency combs. Owing to their remarkable stability, they are attracting attention for applications in sensing, metrology, or optical signal synthesis. In this work, we report on the dynamics of CSs interacting with a trapping potential. We demonstrate that this interaction provides a powerful means to control their properties such as position, speed, and central frequency. Our theoretical analysis predicts fundamental limitations on the spectral shift of CSs relative to the driving frequency. Specifically, it reveals that within a broad range of detunings, frequency-shifted CSs encounter destabilization through a Hopf bifurcation. Moreover, we find that with periodic potentials, the Kelly sidebands emitted by trapped solitons undergo Bloch oscillations. In our experiments, we use an intracavity phase modulator to create the equivalent of an external real potential. We observe stable blue- and red- shifted solitons up to a limit close to our theoretical predictions. We then show theoretically and experimentally that this unprecedented level of control over the CS spectrum can be leveraged to cancel the Raman-induced self-frequency shift and even to stabilize CSs beyond the limitation imposed by stimulated Raman scattering. Our results provide valuable insights for applications requiring robust and potentially rapid tunable control over the cavity soliton properties.</description>

      <title>Strongly anisotropic vortices in dipolar quantum droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct strongly anisotropic quantum droplets with embedded vorticity in the 3D space, with mutually perpendicular vortex axis and polarization of atomic magnetic moments. Stability of these anisotropic vortex quantum droplets (AVQDs) is verified by means of systematic simulations. Their stability area is identified in the parametric plane of the total atom number and scattering length of the contact interactions. We also construct vortex-antivortex-vortex bound states and find their stability region in the parameter space. The application of a torque perpendicular to the vorticity axis gives rise to robust intrinsic oscillations or rotation of the AVQDs. The effect of three-body losses on the AVQD stability is considered too. The results show that the AVQDs can retain the topological structure (vorticity) for a sufficiently long time if the scattering length exceeds a critical value.</description>
