      <title>Direct measurement of photons from the electron-hadron bremsstrahlung at the EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct detection of bremsstrahlung photons, in principle, offers the most straightforward and most robust method of luminosity determination at the EIC, but requires an extraordinary performance of the photon detector. In this paper, we first discuss the extreme working conditions for such detectors at the EIC and the resulting technology choices. Then, we report the initial results of Monte Carlo simulations, using Geant4, of the proposed sampling calorimeter, which is made of a copper absorber with embedded quartz fibres read out by silicon photomultipliers. Finally, the tentative requirements for appropriate readout electronics are formulated.</description>

      <title>Analytic timing calculations and timing limits with prompt photons, high-aspect-ratio crystals, and complex TOF-kernels in TOF-PET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the timing performance of light-based radiation detectors accurately is essential for optimizing time-of-flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET). We present an analytic framework that combines existing models to predict the timing behavior of high-aspect ratio crystals, including contributions from prompt photons such as Cherenkov radiation. This framework is built on a closed-form solution for optical light transport, convolved with the photodetector response and photon production characteristics. Using conditional and joint probability distributions, we compute the first-photon arrival time distribution for hybrid detectors with scintillation and Cherenkov light. The detection time distribution is then self-convolved to derive the time delay spectra and three timing metrics are used to characterize complex TOF kernels. Additionally, we perform Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound calculations with and without depth-of-interaction bias to evaluate the theoretical timing limits. Our analytic predictions align well with Monte Carlo simulations for BGO detectors under varying crystal thicknesses and single photon time resolution considering a digital photodetector. We show that the TOF shape is significantly affected by prompt photon statistics, crystal thickness, scintillation yield, and photodetector properties resulting in distinct metric-dependent timing performance. The proposed model enables rapid timing predictions for polished crystals, with the calculation time of a detector configuration in under a second, allowing for comprehensive parametric studies. This makes it a powerful tool for guiding detector development in fast-timing applications.</description>

      <title>Studies of ultrafast dynamics in substrate-free nanoparticles at ELI using Timepix3 optical camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel application of the Timepix3 optical camera (Tpx3Cam) for investigating ultrafast dynamics in substrate-free nanoparticles at the Extreme Light Infrastructure European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ELI ERIC). The camera, integrated into an ion imaging system based on a micro-channel plate (MCP) and a fast P47 scintillator, enables individual time-stamping of incoming ions with nanosecond timing precision and high spatial resolution. The detector successfully captured laser-induced ion events originating from free nanoparticles disintegrated by intense laser pulses. Owing to the broad size distribution of the nanoparticles (10-500 nm) and the variation in laser intensities within the interaction volume, the detected events range in occupancy from near-zero to extremely high, approaching the readout limits of the detector. By combining time-of-flight and velocity map imaging (VMI) techniques, detailed post-processing and analysis were performed. The results presented here focus on the performance of Tpx3Cam under high-occupancy conditions, which are of particular relevance to this study. These conditions approach the limitations imposed by the camera readout capabilities and challenge the effectiveness of standard post-processing algorithms. We investigated these limitations and associated trade-offs, and we present improved methods and algorithms designed to extract the most informative features from the data.</description>

      <title>Low-energy threshold demonstration for dark matter searches in TREX-DM with an $^{37}$Ar source produced at CNA HiSPANoS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the successful implementation of an $^{37}$Ar calibration source in the TREX-DM detector, a high-pressure time projection chamber designed for low-mass dark matter searches. The $^{37}$Ar source was produced through fast neutron activation of CaO powder at the HiSPANoS facility of Centro Nacional de Aceleradores (CNA) in Spain, yielding $O(1)$ kBq of activity. Using a novel combined GEM-Micromegas readout system, we successfully detected both characteristic emissions from $^{37}$Ar decay (2.82 keV and 270 eV) and achieved unprecedented energy threshold performance in TREX-DM, approaching the single-electron ionization energy of argon.</description>

      <title>Low-energy Cross Section Measurements of ${}^{\mathsf{12}}\mathsf{C}(\mathsf{p},\gamma)$ Deep Underground at LUNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ${}^{\mathsf{12}}\mathsf{C}(\mathsf{p},\gamma)$ reaction cross section is currently under investigation in the low-background environment of the Laboratory for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics (LUNA). It is being studied using different types of solid targets, and employing two complementary detection techniques: HPGe spectroscopy and activation counting. To reduce systematic uncertainties, targets have been accurately characterized and their degradation under the intense beam of the LUNA-400 accelerator monitored. We present the experimental techniques and the corresponding analyses used to extract the reaction cross section.</description>

      <title>A fluorescence microscopy platform for time-resolved studies of spin-correlated radical pairs in biological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The importance of spin-correlated radical pairs in biology is increasingly recognized, with roles in biological effects of weak magnetic fields and emerging quantum spin-based biomedical applications. Fluorescence microscopy offers sufficient sensitivity to study magnetic field effects on radical pair reactions in living cells, but conventional techniques cannot directly resolve their dynamics because most biologically relevant radical pairs are non-emissive. To overcome this challenge, we introduce two novel microscopy techniques: single color pump-probe (PP) and pump-field-probe (PFP) fluorescence. Here, we describe their working principles, provide their mathematical formulation, and validate both techniques through theoretical analysis and experiments on well-established flavin-based magnetic field sensitive reactions. These approaches offer a sensitive and broadly applicable platform for quantifying and visualizing the quantum spin dynamics of radical pair chemical reactions in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detectors based on NbRe nitride ultrafilms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The influence of the reactive DC sputtering parameters on the superconducting properties of NbReN ultrathin films was investigated. A detailed study of the current-voltage characteristics of the plasma was performed to optimize the superconducting critical temperature, Tc. The thickness dependence of Tc for the films deposited under different conditions was analyzed down to the ultrathin limit. Optimized films were used to fabricate superconducting nanowire single photon detectors which, at T=3.5 K, show saturated internal detection efficiency (IDE) up to a wavelength of 1301 nm and 95% IDE at 1548 nm with recovery times and timing jitter of about 8 ns and 28 ps, respectively.</description>

      <title>Advances in Radiative Capture Studies at LUNA with a Segmented BGO Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies of charged-particle reactions for low-energy nuclear astrophysics require high sensitivity, which can be achieved by means of detection setups with high efficiency and low backgrounds, to obtain precise measurements in the energy region of interest for stellar scenarios. High-efficiency total absorption spectroscopy is an established and powerful tool for studying radiative capture reactions, particularly if combined with the cosmic background reduction by several orders of magnitude obtained at the Laboratory for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics (LUNA). We present recent improvements in the detection setup with the Bismuth Germanium Oxide (BGO) detector at LUNA, aiming to reduce high-energy backgrounds and to increase the summing detection efficiency. The new design results in enhanced sensitivity of the BGO setup, as we demonstrate and discuss in the context of the first direct measurement of the 65 keV resonance ($E_{x} = 5672$ keV) of the $^{17}$O($p,\gamma$)$^{18}$F reaction. Moreover, we show two applications of the BGO detector, which exploit its segmentation. In case of complex $\gamma$-ray cascades, e.g. the de-excitation of $E_{x} = 5672$ keV in $^{18}$F, the BGO segmentation allows to identify and suppress the beam-induced background signals that mimic the sum peak of interest. We demonstrate another new application for such a detector in form of in-situ activation measurements of a reaction with $\beta ^{+}$ unstable product nuclei, e.g., the $^{14}$N($p,\gamma$)$^{15}$O reaction.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Muon-induced Backgrounds for the Colorado Underground Research Institute (CURIE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation of muon-induced backgrounds for the Colorado Underground Research Institute (CURIE), a shallow-underground facility with $\approx 415$~m.w.e. overburden. Using coupled \textsc{mute} and \textsc{geant4} frameworks, we characterize the production and transport of muon-induced secondaries through site-specific rock compositions and geometries, establishing a proof-of-concept for high-precision, end-to-end simulations. Our simulations employ angular-dependent muon energy distributions, which improve secondary flux accuracy. For the Subatomic Particle Hideout and Cryolab I research spaces, we predict total muon-induced neutron fluxes of $(3.78 \pm 0.61_{\text{sys}}) \times 10^{-3}$~m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and $(3.97 \pm 0.65_{\text{sys}}) \times 10^{-3}$~m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, respectively, consistent with empirical depth parameterizations. The simulated neutron energy spectra exhibit the expected thermal, epithermal, evaporation, and spallation components extending to GeV energies. Electromagnetic backgrounds are expected to dominate the total flux, with $\gamma$-ray components of $(5.54 \pm 0.91_{\text{sys}}) \times 10^{-1}$~m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and $(6.51 \pm 1.06_{\text{sys}}) \times 10^{-1}$~m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for the Subatomic Particle Hideout and Cryolab I facilities, respectively. These results provide quantitative background predictions for experimental design and sensitivity projections at shallow- and deep-underground facilities. They further demonstrate that local geology and overburden geometry influence muon-induced secondary yields and energy spectra, emphasizing the need for site-specific simulations for accurate underground background characterization. Therefore, the simulation framework has been made publicly available for the broader low-background physics community to enable meaningful inter-facility comparisons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The TRIUMF Ultracold Advanced Neutron (TUCAN) collaboration has been developing a high-intensity ultracold neutron (UCN) source aimed at searching for the neutron electric dipole moment (EDM) with a sensitivity goal of $10^{-27}\ e{\rm cm}$. This article reports on recent progress in commissioning of the UCN source and in the development of the neutron EDM spectrometer. In its final configuration, the accelerator-driven super-thermal UCN source will enable a neutron EDM experiment with two orders of magnitude improved statistics compared to the current best experiment. Substantial progress in 2024 allowed the collaboration to operate the complete source system, with the exception of the liquid deuterium cold moderator, resulting in the first production of UCNs. The status of the EDM spectrometer is also presented, with emphasis on UCN handling components and magnetic subsystems relevant to field control, shielding, and magnetometry.</description>

      <title>Full Spectrum Modeling of In Situ Gamma-ray Detector Measurements with a Focus on Precipitation-Induced Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-ray detectors that are deployed outdoors experience increased event rates during precipitation due to the attendant increase in Rn-222 progeny at ground level. The increased radiation due to these decay products (Pb-214 and Bi-214) has been studied for many decades in applications such as atmospheric science and radiation protection. For those applications radon progeny signatures are the signal of interest, while in the fields of radiological and nuclear security and aerial radiological mapping they are a nuisance. When searching for radiological contamination or missing sources, an analyst must take precipitation into account to reduce false alarms, in addition to accounting for static background signatures. To train advanced search algorithms, an effort has been underway to generate synthetic gamma-ray event data that represent a realistic urban area, including occasional rain events to add to the realism. This manuscript describes an effort to analyze and model gamma-ray spectra measured during rainfall by a NaI(Tl) detector located outdoors in order to derive accurate source terms for Pb-214 and Bi-214 at a high frequency (less than 1 minute). All known sources of background were quantitatively modeled across the full gamma-ray spectrum, so that the Pb-214 and Bi-214 activity concentrations on the ground could be inferred from a linear model fit to each spectrum. A physically motivated model was applied to the data to further smooth the fits, which had the benefit of yielding information about the concentrations of the progeny in rainwater and their apparent age, making this the first time full-spectrum modeling has been used for continuous measurements of radon progeny. This approach could lead to studies of radon progeny on shorter timescales than previously possible.</description>

      <title>PhysDNet: Physics-Guided Decomposition Network of Side-Scan Sonar Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Side-scan sonar (SSS) has become an essential tool for seafloor mapping and underwater exploration. However, the measured intensity is entangled with seabed reflectivity, terrain elevation, and acoustic path loss, making the imagery highly view dependent and hindering robust interpretation. To address this challenge, we propose PhysDNet, a physics-guided multi-branch network that explicitly decouples SSS images into three interpretable fields: reflectivity, elevation, and path loss. The network employs attention augmented encoder decoder branches, imposes range wise consistency constraints on path loss, and incorporates a Lambertian based reconstruction to enable progressive selfsupervised training, thereby ensuring stable multi-task optimization while embedding physical priors into the learning process. Experiments demonstrate that the decomposed fields preserve geological structures, recover physically consistent illumination and attenuation, and enable accurate shadow prediction. These findings confirm that physics guided decomposition establishes a stable and interpretable domain for SSS analysis, enhancing both physical consistency and downstream applications such as registration and shadow interpretation.</description>

Abstract: Resistive Plate Chambers detectors are extensively used in several domains of Physics. In High Energy Physics, they are typically operated in avalanche mode with a high-performance gas mixture based on Tetrafluoroethane (C2H2F4), a fluorinated high Global Warming Potential greenhouse gas. The RPC EcoGas@GIF++ Collaboration has pursued an intensive R\&amp;D activity to search for new gas mixtures with low environmental impact, fulfilling the performance expected for the LHC operations as well as for future and different applications. Here, results obtained with new eco-friendly gas mixtures based on Tetrafluoropropene and carbon dioxide, even under high-irradiation conditions, will be presented. Long-term aging tests carried out at the CERN Gamma Irradiation Facility will be discussed along with their possible limits and future perspectives.</description>

      <title>Probing Earth's core using atmospheric neutrino oscillations in the presence of NSI at INO-ICAL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos can serve as a complementary and independent tool to gravitational and seismic studies in exploring the interior of Earth, thanks to their unique properties: extremely low interaction cross sections and flavor oscillations. With the precise measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters and observation of the non-zero value of mixing angle $\theta_{13}$, it has become feasible to detect the forward scattering of GeV-energy atmospheric neutrinos passing through Earth with ambient electrons in the form of matter effects on neutrino oscillation probabilities. These matter effects depend on both the neutrino energy and electron density distribution along their path, making them ideally suited for exploring the inner structure of Earth. Furthermore, in the presence of non-standard interactions (NSI) of neutrinos with matter, oscillation patterns undergo additional modifications. In this study, we quantify the capability of an atmospheric neutrino experiment, such as a magnetized iron calorimeter detector, to validate the Earth's core and measure the position of the core-mantle boundary in the presence of NSI. We perform this study considering a three-layered density profile of Earth. Our analysis demonstrates that neutrino non-standard interactions impact these Earth tomography measurements in comparison to standard interactions.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of an Early Dark Matter Search using the Electromagnetic Calorimeter as a Target for the Light Dark Matter eXperiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Light Dark Matter eXperiment (LDMX) is proposed to employ a thin tungsten target and a multi-GeV electron beam to carry out a missing momentum search for the production of dark matter candidate particles. We study the sensitivity for a complementary missing-energy-based search using the LDMX Electromagnetic Calorimeter as an active target with a focus on early running. In this context, we construct an event selection from a limited set of variables that projects sensitivity into previously-unexplored regions of light dark matter phase space -- down to an effective dark photon interaction strength $y$ of approximately $2\times10^{-13}$ ($5\times10^{-12}$) for a 1MeV (10MeV) dark matter candidate mass.</description>

      <title>CCAT: Magnetic Sensitivity Measurements of Kinetic Inductance Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The CCAT Observatory is a ground-based submillimeter to millimeter experiment located on Cerro Chajnantor in the Atacama Desert, at an altitude of 5,600 meters. CCAT features the 6-meter Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST), which will cover frequency bands from 210 GHz to 850 GHz using its first-generation science instrument, Prime-Cam. The detectors used in Prime-Cam are feedhorn-coupled, lumped-element superconducting microwave kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). The telescope will perform wide-area surveys at speeds on the order of degrees per second. During telescope operation, the KIDs are exposed to changes in the magnetic field caused by the telescope's movement through Earth's magnetic field and internal sources within the telescope. We present and compare measurements of the magnetic sensitivity of three different CCAT KID designs at 100 mK. The measurements are conducted in a dilution refrigerator (DR) with a set of room temperature Helmholtz coils positioned around the DR. We discuss the implications of these results for CCAT field operations.</description>
