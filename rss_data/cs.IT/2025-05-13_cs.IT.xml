      <title>Limitations to Computing Quadratic Functions on Reed-Solomon Encoded Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of low-bandwidth non-linear computation on Reed-Solomon encoded data. Given an $[n,k]$ Reed-Solomon encoding of a message vector $\vec{f} \in \mathbb{F}_q^k$, and a polynomial $g \in \mathbb{F}_q[X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k]$, a user wishing to evaluate $g(\vec{f})$ is given local query access to each codeword symbol. The query response is allowed to be the output of an arbitrary function evaluated locally on the codeword symbol, and the user's aim is to minimize the total information downloaded in order to compute $g(\vec{f})$.
  We show that when $k=2$ and $q = p^e$ for odd $e$ and prime $p$ satisfying $p\equiv 3 \mod 4$, then any scheme that evaluates the quadratic monomial $g(X_1, X_2) := X_1 X_2$ must download at least $2\lceil \log_2(q-1) \rceil - 3$ bits of information. Compare this with the straightforward scheme of Reed-Solomon interpolation which recovers $\vec{f}$ in its entirety, which downloads $2 \lceil \log_2(q) \rceil$ bits. Our result shows that dimension-2 Reed-Solomon codes do not admit any meaningful low-bandwidth scheme for the evaluation of quadratic functions over the encoded data. This contrasts sharply with prior work for low-bandwidth evaluation of linear functions $g(\vec{f})$ over Reed-Solomon encoded data, for which it is possible to substantially improve upon the naive bound of $k \lceil \log_2(q) \rceil$ bits.</description>

      <title>Generalized LDPC codes with low-complexity decoding and fast convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider generalized low-density parity-check (GLDPC) codes with component codes that are duals of Cordaro-Wagner codes. Two efficient decoding algorithms are proposed: one based on Hartmann-Rudolph processing, analogous to Sum-Product decoding, and another based on evaluating two hypotheses per bit, referred to as the Min-Sum decoder. Both algorithms are derived using latent variables and an appropriate message-passing schedule. A quantized, protograph-based density evolution procedure is used to optimize GLDPC codes for Min-Sum decoding. Compared to 5G LDPC codes, the proposed GLDPC codes offer similar performance at 50 iterations and significantly better convergence and performance at 10 iterations.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Polarforming Antenna Enhanced Sensing and Communication: Modeling and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel intelligent polarforming antenna (IPA) to achieve cost-effective wireless sensing and communication. Specifically, the IPA can enable polarforming by adaptively controlling the antenna's polarization electrically as well as its position/rotation mechanically, so as to effectively exploit polarization and spatial diversity to reconfigure wireless channels for improving sensing and communication performance. We study an IPA-enhanced integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system that utilizes user location sensing to facilitate communication between an IPA-equipped base station (BS) and IPA-equipped users. First, we model the IPA channel in terms of transceiver antenna polarforming vectors and antenna positions/rotations. We then propose a two-timescale ISAC protocol, where in the slow timescale, user localization is first performed, followed by the optimization of the BS antennas' positions and rotations based on the sensed user locations; subsequently, in the fast timescale, transceiver polarforming is adapted to cater to the instantaneous channel state information (CSI), with the optimized BS antennas' positions and rotations. We propose a new polarforming-based user localization method that uses a structured time-domain pattern of pilot-polarforming vectors to extract the common stable components in the IPA channel across different polarizations based on the parallel factor (PARAFAC) tensor model. Moreover, we maximize the achievable average sum-rate of users by jointly optimizing the fast-timescale transceiver polarforming, including phase shifts and amplitude variations, along with the slow-timescale antenna rotations and positions at the BS. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of polarforming-based localization algorithm and demonstrate the performance advantages of polarforming, antenna placement, and their joint design.</description>

      <title>Semantic De-boosting in e-commerce Query Autocomplete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ecommerce search, query autocomplete plays a critical role to help users in their shopping journey. Often times, query autocomplete presents users with semantically similar queries, which can impede the user's ability to find diverse and relevant results. This paper proposes a novel strategy to enhance this service by refining the presentation of typeahead suggestions based on their semantic similarity.
  Our solution uniquely demotes semantically equivalent queries using an embedding similarity of query suggestions at runtime. This strategy ensures only distinct and varied queries are prioritized, thereby promoting more diverse suggestions for users. To maintain comprehensive query coverage, we incorporate this deduplication process within the query suggestion reranking step. This approach ensures that the broad spectrum of possible queries remains available to users, while eliminating the redundancy and repetitiveness in the suggestion list.
  In extending this work, we propose using the distance between query embeddings to offer even more diverse suggestions to users using an algorithm similar to maximal marginal relevance. This approach will further ensure the delivery of non-redundant, unique, and pertinent suggestions to users, thus enriching their search experience.
  We evaluated our method through rigorous AB testing, demonstrating substantial improvements in key metrics. Notably, we observed a statistically significant rise in the search Add-to-Cart rate, signifying an enhanced user engagement and conversion rate. Furthermore, we observed a statistically significant decrease in clicks to ATC, implying that the feature improved the efficiency of the customer's product search journey. Finally, we also noticed a marked reduction in the null page view rate, indicating the increased pertinence and efficiency of user search sessions.</description>

      <title>On Analysis of Superimposed Pilot in Multi-User Massive MIMO with Massive Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simultaneous transmission of numerous users presents substantial challenges due to the inherent trade-off between channel estimation and information transmission in multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. In this paper, we explore the use of the superimposed pilot (SP) scheme to tackle the large transmitting users, where the number of users may exceed the coherent time. SP scheme incorporates both transmitted data and noise in the channel estimation process, which is significant different from the counterpart of RP scheme. We provide an in-depth analysis of the interaction between interference caused by channel estimation errors and noise. We then derive the explicit expression for the scaling law of the mutual information lower bound (MILB) in relation to the number of users and the levels of transmitted power. Besides, the optimal power allocation between pilots and data transmission is also derived analytically. The analytical results demonstrate that the SP scheme significantly improves performance compared to traditional RP scheme in our consider case. Numerical results are also presented to validate our theoretical derivations.</description>

      <title>Coding Theorem for Generalized Reed-Solomon Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the sub-field images of generalized Reed-Solomon (RS) codes can achieve the symmetric capacity of p-ary memoryless channels. Unlike the totally random linear code ensemble, as a class of maximum distance separable (MDS) codes, the generalized RS code ensemble lacks the pair-wise independence among codewords and has non-identical distributions of nonzero codewords. To prove the coding theorem for the p-ary images of generalized RS codes, we analyze the exponential upper bound on the error probability of the generalized RS code in terms of its spectrum using random coding techniques. In the finite-length region, we present an ML decoding algorithm for the generalized RS codes over the binary erasure channels (BECs). In particular, the algebraic structure of the generalized RS codes allows us to implement the parallel Lagrange interpolation to derive an ordered systematic matrix. Subsequently, we can reconstruct the ML codeword through a change of basis, accelerating the conventional Gaussian elimination (GE), as validated in the simulation results. Additionally, we apply this decoding technique to the LC-OSD algorithm over the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels with binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation and three-level pulse amplitude modulation (3PAM). Simulation results show that, in the high-rate region, generalized RS codes defined over fields of characteristic three with 3-PAM perform better than those defined over fields of characteristic two with BPSK.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian-Constrained Holographic Beamforming Optimization in Multi-user Networks with Dynamic Metasurface Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are promising alternatives to fully digital (FD) architectures, enabling hybrid beamforming via low-cost reconfigurable metasurfaces. In DMAs, holographic beamforming is achieved through tunable elements by Lorentzian-constrained holography (LCH), significantly reducing the need for radio-frequency (RF) chains and analog circuitry. However, the Lorentzian constraints and limited RF chains introduce a trade-off between reduced system complexity and beamforming performance, especially in dense network scenarios. This paper addresses resource allocation in multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MISO) networks under the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) constraints, aiming to minimize total transmit power. We propose a holographic beamforming algorithm based on the Generalized Method of Lorentzian-Constrained Holography (GMLCH), which optimizes DMA weights, yielding flexibility for using various LCH techniques to tackle the aforementioned trade-offs. Building upon GMLCH, we further propose a new algorithm, Adaptive Radius Lorentzian Constrained Holography (ARLCH), which achieves optimization of DMA weights with additional degree of freedom in a greater optimization space, and provides lower transmitted power, while improving scalability for higher number of users. Numerical results show that ARLCH reduces power consumption by over 20% compared to benchmarks, with increasing effectiveness as the number of users grows.</description>

      <title>Low-complexity Detection for Noncoherent Massive MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies a point-to-point MIMO uplink in which user equipment transmits data to a base station equipped with a massive array. Signal detection is noncoherent and fading is assumed to follow the Weichselberger model. By exploiting the spatial stationarity of fading at the base station, a cyclostationary structure emerges naturally in the space-time representation, which suggests formulating the statistical properties of the received signal in the Karhunen-Lo\`eve domain. This allows the derivation of a low-complexity receiver that approximates maximum likelihood detection even for a moderate array size. The spectral analysis of the problem provides valuable insights on the design of space-time codewords.</description>

      <title>On the hull-variation problem of equivalent vector rank metric codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intersection of a linear code with its dual is called the hull of the code. It is known that, for classical linear codes under the Hamming metric, the dimension of the hull can be reduced up to equivalence. This phenomenon leads to the so-called hull-variation problem formulated by Hao Chen in 2023. In this paper, we consider the analogous problem for vector rank metric codes, along with their associated matrix codes and extended block codes. We also discuss the implications in the context of $(q,m)$-polymatroids.</description>

      <title>Dual-UAV-Enabled Secure Communication and Sensing for A2G-ISAC Systems with Maneuverable Jamming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a dual-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled secure communication and sensing (SCS) scheme for an air-to-ground integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, in which a dual-functional source UAV and jamming UAV collaborate to enhance both the secure communication and target sensing performance. From a perspective of hybrid monostatitc-bistatic radar, the jamming UAV maneuvers to aid the source UAV to detect multiple ground targets by emitting artificial noise, meanwhile interfering with the ground eavesdropper. Residual interference is considered to reflect the effects of imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) on the receive signal-plus-interference-to-noise ratios, which results in a degraded system performance. To maximize the average secrecy rate (ASR), the dual-UAV trajectory and dual-UAV beamforming are jointly optimized subject to the transmit power budget, UAV maneuvering constraint, and sensing requirements. To tackle the highly complicated non-convex ASR maximization problem, the dual-UAV trajectory and dual-UAV beamforming are optimized for the secure communication (SC) purpose and the SCS purpose, sequentially. In the SC phase, a block coordinate descent algorithm is proposed to optimize the dual-UAV trajectory and dual-UAV beamforming iteratively, using the trust-region successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques. Then, a weighted distance minimization problem is formulated to determine the dual-UAV maneuvering positions suitable for the SCS purpose, which is solved by a heuristic greedy algorithm, followed by the joint optimization of source beamforming and jamming beamforming.</description>

      <title>Zak-OTFS for Spread Spectrum Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An attractive feature of spread spectrum technologies such as code division multiple access (CDMA) is that it is harder to intercept or jam signals, and this feature was lost when orthogonal frequency domain modulation prevailed over CDMA in wireless standards. Legacy spread carrier waveforms are not matched to delay and Doppler shifts characteristic of 6G wireless environments, and this makes equalization very challenging. Zak-OTFS modulation is a communication framework that parameterizes the wireless channel in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, where the parameters map directly to physical attributes of the scatterers that comprise the scattering environment. Hence, the channel can be efficiently acquired and equalized. The Zak-OTFS carrier is a pulse in the DD domain, and the Zak transform converts it to a pulse train modulated by a tone (pulsone) in the time domain. The pulsone waveform is localized rather than spread, and it suffers from high PAPR. We describe how to transform Zak-OTFS into a spread spectrum communication system, where the spread carrier waveforms have low PAPR and are matched to the delay and Doppler characteristics of the wireless channel. This transformation is realized by a unitary transform that is a generalization of the discrete affine Fourier transform. The transform maps a pulsone to a time domain waveform which yields a CAZAC sequence after sampling. The family of CAZAC sequences includes the Zadoff-Chu sequences incorporated in LTE and 5G-NR standards. We describe the end-to-end time-domain transceiver signal processing, comprising channel estimation and data demodulation, for the proposed system. We quantify system performance through BER simulations using a six-path Veh-A channel model, showing that the proposed system achieves similar uncoded BER as pulsone-based Zak-OTFS, where the PAPR of each spread carrier waveform is only 3.58 dB.</description>

      <title>Multi-Layer Hierarchical Federated Learning with Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Almost all existing hierarchical federated learning (FL) models are limited to two aggregation layers, restricting scalability and flexibility in complex, large-scale networks. In this work, we propose a Multi-Layer Hierarchical Federated Learning framework (QMLHFL), which appears to be the first study that generalizes hierarchical FL to arbitrary numbers of layers and network architectures through nested aggregation, while employing a layer-specific quantization scheme to meet communication constraints. We develop a comprehensive convergence analysis for QMLHFL and derive a general convergence condition and rate that reveal the effects of key factors, including quantization parameters, hierarchical architecture, and intra-layer iteration counts. Furthermore, we determine the optimal number of intra-layer iterations to maximize the convergence rate while meeting a deadline constraint that accounts for both communication and computation times. Our results show that QMLHFL consistently achieves high learning accuracy, even under high data heterogeneity, and delivers notably improved performance when optimized, compared to using randomly selected values.</description>

      <title>Uniform Universal Sets, Splitters, and Bisectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a subset of size $k$ of a very large universe a randomized way to find this subset could consist of deleting half of the universe and then searching the remaining part. With a probability of $2^{-k}$ one will succeed. By probability amplification, a randomized algorithm needs about $2^k$ rounds until it succeeds. We construct bisectors that derandomize this process and have size~$2^{k+o(k)}$. One application is derandomization of reductions between average case complexity classes. We also construct uniform $(n,k)$-universal sets that generalize universal sets in such a way that they are bisectors at the same time. This construction needs only linear time and produces families of asymptotically optimal size without using advanced combinatorial constructions as subroutines, which previous families did, but are basedmainly on modulo functions and refined brute force search.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form Information Capacity of Canonical Signaling Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a unified framework for computing the information capacity of biological signaling systems using Fisher Information. By deriving closed-form or easily computable information capacity formulas, we quantify how well different signaling models, including binomial, multinomial, Poisson, Gaussian, and Gamma distributions, can discriminate among input signals. These expressions clarify how key features such as signal range, noise scaling, pathway length, and receivers' diversity shape the theoretical limits of sensing. In particular, we show how signal-to-noise ratio and fold-change sensitivity arise naturally within the Fisher formalism, and how signal degradation in cascades imposes linear information loss. Our results provide intuitive, analytically grounded tools to benchmark and guide the analysis of real signaling systems, without requiring computationally expensive mutual information estimation. While motivated by cellular communication, the framework generalizes to any system where noisy input-output relationships constrain transmission fidelity, including synthetic biology, sensor networks, and engineered communication channels.</description>

      <title>On the Average Secrecy Performance of Satellite Networks in Short Packet Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the secrecy performance of satellite networks in short packet communication systems under shadowed Rician fading (SRF). We derive a lower bound on the average achievable secrecy rate in the finite blocklength regime (FBL) and provide analytical insights into the impact of key secrecy-related performance indicators (KPIs). Monte Carlo simulations validate the theoretical framework, and demonstrate that increasing the blocklength and improving the legitimate receiver's signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) enhance secrecy, while a stronger eavesdropper degrades it. Additionally, we show that directional antenna patterns can effectively reduce information leakage and provide secure satellite communications in the short packet regime. These findings offer valuable guidance for designing secure and efficient satellite-based communication systems, particularly in IoT and space-based networks.</description>

      <title>On lattice tilings of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ by limited magnitude error balls $\mathcal{B}(n,2,k_{1},k_{2})$ with $k_1&gt;k_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice tilings of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ by limited-magnitude error balls correspond to linear perfect codes under such error models and play a crucial role in flash memory applications. In this work, we establish three main results. First, we fully determine the existence of lattice tilings by $\mathcal{B}(n,2,3,0)$ in all dimensions $n$. Second, we completely resolve the case $k_1=k_2+1$. Finally, we prove that for any integers $k_1&gt;k_2\ge0$ where $k_1+k_2+1$ is composite, no lattice tiling of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ by the error ball $\mathcal{B}(n,2,k_1,k_2)$ exists for sufficiently large $n$.</description>

      <title>Memorization-Compression Cycles Improve Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove theoretically that generalization improves not only through data scaling but also by compressing internal representations. To operationalize this insight, we introduce the Information Bottleneck Language Modeling (IBLM) objective, which reframes language modeling as a constrained optimization problem: minimizing representation entropy subject to optimal prediction performance. Empirically, we observe an emergent memorization-compression cycle during LLM pretraining, evidenced by oscillation positive/negative gradient alignment between cross-entropy and Matrix-Based Entropy (MBE), a measure of representation entropy. This pattern closely mirrors the predictive-compressive trade-off prescribed by IBLM and also parallels the biological alternation between awake learning and sleep consolidation. Motivated by this observation, we propose Gated Phase Transition (GAPT), a training algorithm that adaptively switches between memorization and compression phases. When applied to GPT-2 pretraining on FineWeb dataset, GAPT reduces MBE by 50% and improves cross-entropy by 4.8%. GAPT improves OOD generalizatino by 35% in a pretraining task on arithmetic multiplication. In a setting designed to simulate catastrophic forgetting, GAPT reduces interference by compressing and separating representations, achieving a 97% improvement in separation - paralleling the functional role of sleep consolidation.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Uncertainty and Calibration on Likelihood-Ratio Membership Inference Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10686v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a membership inference attack (MIA), an attacker exploits the overconfidence exhibited by typical machine learning models to determine whether a specific data point was used to train a target model. In this paper, we analyze the performance of the likelihood ratio attack (LiRA) within an information-theoretical framework that allows the investigation of the impact of the aleatoric uncertainty in the true data generation process, of the epistemic uncertainty caused by a limited training data set, and of the calibration level of the target model. We compare three different settings, in which the attacker receives decreasingly informative feedback from the target model: confidence vector (CV) disclosure, in which the output probability vector is released; true label confidence (TLC) disclosure, in which only the probability assigned to the true label is made available by the model; and decision set (DS) disclosure, in which an adaptive prediction set is produced as in conformal prediction. We derive bounds on the advantage of an MIA adversary with the aim of offering insights into the impact of uncertainty and calibration on the effectiveness of MIAs. Simulation results demonstrate that the derived analytical bounds predict well the effectiveness of MIAs.</description>

      <title>SCAN-BEST: Sub-6GHz-Aided Near-field Beam Selection with Formal Reliability Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems adopt larger antenna arrays, near-field propagation becomes increasingly prominent, especially for users close to the transmitter. Traditional far-field beam training methods become inadequate, while near-field training faces the challenge of large codebooks due to the need to resolve both angular and distance domains. To reduce in-band training overhead, prior work has proposed to leverage the spatial-temporal congruence between sub-6 GHz (sub-6G) and mmWave channels to predict the best mmWave beam within a near-field codebook from sub-6G channel estimates. To cope with the uncertainty caused by sub-6G/mmWave differences, we introduce a novel Sub-6G Channel Aided Near-field BEam SelecTion (SCAN-BEST) framework that wraps around any beam predictor to produce candidate beam subset with formal suboptimality guarantees. The proposed SCAN-BEST builds on conformal risk control (CRC), and is calibrated offline using limited calibration data. Its performance guarantees apply even in the presence of statistical shifts between calibration and deployment. Numerical results validate the theoretical properties and efficiency of SCAN-BEST.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers for Classical Wireless Communications and Sensing: Their Models and Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The significant progress of quantum sensing technologies offer numerous radical solutions for measuring a multitude of physical quantities at an unprecedented precision. Among them, Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) emerge as an eminent solution for detecting the electric field of radio frequency (RF) signals, exhibiting great potential in assisting classical wireless communications and sensing. So far, most experimental studies have aimed for the proof of physical concepts to reveal its promise, while the practical signal model of RAQR-aided wireless communications and sensing remained under-explored. Furthermore, the performance of RAQR-based wireless receivers and their advantages over classical RF receivers have not been fully characterized. To fill these gaps, we introduce the RAQR to the wireless community by presenting an end-to-end reception scheme. We then develop a corresponding equivalent baseband signal model relying on a realistic reception flow. Our scheme and model provide explicit design guidance to RAQR-aided wireless systems. We next study the performance of RAQR-aided wireless systems based on our model, and compare them to classical RF receivers. The results show that the RAQR is capable of achieving a substantial received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of over $27$ decibel (dB) and $40$ dB in the photon shot limit regime and the standard quantum limit regime, respectively.</description>

      <title>LLM-Text Watermarking based on Lagrange Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of LLMs (Large Language Models) has established them as a foundational technology for many AI and ML-powered human computer interactions. A critical challenge in this context is the attribution of LLM-generated text -- either to the specific language model that produced it or to the individual user who embedded their identity via a so-called multi-bit watermark. This capability is essential for combating misinformation, fake news, misinterpretation, and plagiarism. One of the key techniques for addressing this challenge is digital watermarking.
  This work presents a watermarking scheme for LLM-generated text based on Lagrange interpolation, enabling the recovery of a multi-bit author identity even when the text has been heavily redacted by an adversary. The core idea is to embed a continuous sequence of points $(x, f(x))$ that lie on a single straight line. The $x$-coordinates are computed pseudorandomly using a cryptographic hash function $H$ applied to the concatenation of the previous token's identity and a secret key $s_k$. Crucially, the $x$-coordinates do not need to be embedded into the text -- only the corresponding $f(x)$ values are embedded. During extraction, the algorithm recovers the original points along with many spurious ones, forming an instance of the Maximum Collinear Points (MCP) problem, which can be solved efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is highly effective, allowing the recovery of the author identity even when as few as three genuine points remain after adversarial manipulation.</description>
