      <title>On supercurves of genus 1 with an underlying odd spin structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the standard family of supercurves of genus 1 with an underlying odd spin structures. We give a simple algebraic description of this family and of the compactified family of stable supercurves with one Neveu-Schwarz puncture. We also describe the Gauss-Manin connection on the first de Rham cohomology of this family and compute the superperiods of global differentials.</description>

      <title>Equivariant automorphisms of the Cox construction and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we give a complete description of the group of holomorphic automorphisms of the Cox construction of a simplicial fan equivariant with respect to a large enough connected complex Lie subgroup of the large torus acting on the Cox construction. We then apply this description to find the groups of holomorphic automorphisms of rational moment-angle manifolds, including Calabi--Eckmann manifolds and Hopf manifolds. We also calculate the groups of equivariant automorphisms of complete simplicial toric varieties. This paper is the first in a series of two papers dedicated to studying the automorphism groups of toric stacks with applications to complex geometry.</description>

      <title>Approximating rational points on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective algebraic variety over a number field $k$ and $P$ in $X(k)$. In 2007, the second author conjectured that, in a precise sense, if rational points on $X$ are dense enough, then the best rational approximations to $P$ must lie on a curve. We present a strategy for deducing a slightly weaker conjecture from Vojta's conjecture, and execute this strategy for the full conjecture for split surfaces.</description>

      <title>Boundedness of weak Fano threefolds with fixed Gorenstein index in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a partial affirmative answer to the BAB conjecture for $3$-folds in characteristic $p&gt;5$. Specifically, we prove that a set $\mathcal{D}$ of weak Fano $3$-folds over an uncountable algebraically closed field is bounded, if each element $X \in \mathcal{D}$ satisfies certain conditions regarding the Gorenstein index, a complement and Kodaira type vanishing. In the course of the proof, we also study a uniform lower bound for Seshadri constants of nef and big invertible sheaves on projective $3$-folds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an inseparable version of Kummer surfaces. It is defined as a supersingular K3 surface in characteristic 2 with 16 smooth rational curves forming a certain configuration and satisfying a suitable divisibility condition. The main result is that such a surface admits an inseparable double covering by a non-normal surface $A$ that is similar to abelian surfaces in two aspects: its numerical invariants are the same as abelian surfaces, and its smooth locus admits an abelian group structure.</description>

      <title>On Conormal Lie Algebras of Feigin-Odesskii Poisson Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main result of the paper is a description of conormal Lie algebras of Feigin-Odesskii Poisson structures. In order to obtain it we introduce a new variant of a definition of a Feigin-Odesskii Poisson structure: we define it using a differential on the second page of a certain spectral sequence. In the general case this spectral sequence computes morphisms and higher Ext's between filtered objects in an abelian category. Moreover, we use our definition to give another proof of the description of symplectic leaves of Feigin-Odesskii Poisson structures.</description>

      <title>On the logarithmic slice filtration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider slice filtrations in logarithmic motivic homotopy theory. Our main results establish conjectured compatibilities with the Beilinson, BMS, and HKR filtrations on (topological, log) Hochschild homology and related invariants. In the case of perfect fields admitting resolution of singularities, the motivic trace map is compatible with the slice and BMS filtrations, yielding a natural morphism from the motivic Atiyah-Hirzerbruch spectral sequence to the BMS spectral sequence. Finally, we consider the Kummer \'etale hypersheafification of logarithmic $K$-theory and show that its very effective slices compute Lichtenbaum \'etale motivic cohomology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an alternative proof of Suslin's equi-dimensionalization moving lemma, using a different geometric construction. The new construction provides better control of the degrees of the polynomials used to define endomorphisms of schemes along which algebraic cycles are pulled back.
  When applied to algebraic cycles with modulus, the new degree bound improves an earlier result of Miyazaki and the present author so that we do not need to take the limit over the thickenings of the given divisor anymore.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the positivity of an Ulrich vector bundle defined with respect to a globally generated ample line bundle. First we prove a generalization of a Lopez theorem on the first Chern class and the bigness of an Ulrich bundle. Then, under some additional assumptions on the polarization, we give a description of its augmented base locus, which consequently leads to a characterization of the V-bigness and of the ampleness of an Ulrich bundle in this setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate some aspects of the geometry of two classical generalisations of the Hilbert schemes of points. Precisely, we show that parity conjecture for $\text{Quot}_r^d\mathbb{A}^3$ already fails for $d=8$ and $r=2$ and that lots of the elementary components of the nested Hilbert schemes of points on smooth quasi-projective varieties of dimension at least 4 are generically non-reduced. Finally, we give an infinite family of elementary components of the classical Hilbert schemes of points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish that if a submanifold $M$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is definable in some o-minimal structure then any definable submanifold $N\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ which is $\mathscr{C}^\infty$ diffeomorphic to $M$, with a diffeomorphism $h:N\to M$ that is sufficiently close to the identity, must be $\mathscr{C}^\infty$ definably diffeomorphic to $M$. The definable diffeomorphism between $N$ and $M$ is then provided by a tubular neighborhood of $M$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify Drinfeld's formal group on the prismatization of $\mathrm{Spf}\,\mathbb{Z}_p$ with a formal group arising from homotopy theory, given locally by the Quillen formal group of a decompleted variant of topological periodic cyclic homology. We also prove that this formal group extends to the syntomization of $\mathrm{Spf}\,\mathbb{Z}_p$, and that it admits a certain algebraization conjectured by Drinfeld.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a factorial affine domain over a field $k$. In this paper we consider Danielewski and Double Danielewski type rings over $R$. We observe that these two families produce non-cancellative families of rings over $R$. When $k$ is a field of characteristic zero, we give characterisation for an affine variety to be isomorphic to a variety of Double Danielewski type. We further extend some characterization results of Danielewski type hypersurface rings containing fields of arbitrary characteristics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that, for any closed semialgebraic subset $W$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and for any positive integer $p$, there exists a Nash function $f:\mathbb{R}^n\setminus W\longrightarrow (0, \infty)$ which is equivalent to the distance function from $W$ and at the same time it is $\Lambda_p$-regular in the sense that $|D^\alpha f(x)|\leq C d(x, W)^{1- |\alpha|}$, for each $x\in \mathbb{R}^n\setminus W$ and each $\alpha\in \mathbb{N}^n$ such that $1\leq |\alpha|\leq p$, where $C$ is a positive constant. In particular, $f$ is Lipschitz. Some applications of this result are given.</description>

      <title>Generic models for genus 2 curves with real multiplication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explicit models of families of genus 2 curves with multiplication by $\sqrt D$ are known for $D= 2, 3, 5$. We obtain generic models for genus 2 curves over $\mathbb Q$ with real multiplication in 12 new cases, including all fundamental discriminants $D &lt; 40$. A key step in our proof is to develop an algorithm for minimisation of conic bundles fibred over $\mathbb{P}^2$. We apply this algorithm to simplify the equations for the Mestre conic associated to the generic point on the Hilbert modular surface of fundamental discriminant $D &lt; 100$ computed by Elkies--Kumar.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.01128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To prove that a modular variety is of general type, there are three types of obstructions: reflective, cusp and elliptic obstructions. In this paper, we give a quantitative estimate of the reflective obstructions for the unitary case. This shows in particular that the reflective obstructions are small enough in higher dimension, say greater than $138$. Our result reduces the study of the Kodaira dimension of unitary modular varieties to the construction of a cusp form of small weight in a quantitative manner. As a byproduct, we formulate and partially prove the finiteness of Hermitian lattices admitting reflective modular forms, which is a unitary analog of the conjecture by Gritsenko-Nikulin in the orthogonal case. Our estimate of the reflective obstructions uses Prasad's volume formula.</description>

Abstract: We show that every family of isolated hypersurface singularity with constant Milnor number has constant multiplicity. To achieve this, we endow the A'Campo model of "radius zero" monodromy with a symplectic structure. This new approach allows to generalize a spectral sequence of McLean converging to fixed point Floer homology of iterates of the monodromy to a more general setting which is well suited to study $\mu$-constant families.</description>

      <title>On the Maximum Gonality of a Curve over a Finite Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gonality of a smooth geometrically connected curve over a field $k$ is the smallest degree of a nonconstant $k$-morphism from the curve to the projective line. In general, the gonality of a curve of genus $g \ge 2$ is at most $2g - 2$. Over finite fields, a result of F.K. Schmidt from the 1930s can be used to prove that the gonality is at most $g+1$. Via a mixture of geometry and computation, we improve this bound: for a curve of genus $g \ge 5$ over a finite field, the gonality is at most $g$. For genus $g = 3$ and $g = 4$, the same result holds with exactly $217$ exceptions: There are two curves of genus $4$ and gonality $5$, and $215$ curves of genus $3$ and gonality $4$. The genus-$4$ examples were found in other papers, and we reproduce their equations here; in supplementary material, we provide equations for the genus-$3$ examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of elliptic fibrations on Fourier-Mukai partners of K3 surfaces, which we call derived elliptic structures. We fully classify derived elliptic structures in terms of Hodge-theoretic data, similar to the Derived Torelli Theorem that describes Fourier-Mukai partners. In Picard rank two, derived elliptic structures are fully determined by the Lagrangian subgroups of the discriminant group. As a consequence, we prove that for a large class of Picard rank 2 elliptic K3 surfaces all Fourier-Mukai partners are Jacobians, and we partially extend this result to non-closed fields. We also show that there exist elliptic K3 surfaces with Fourier-Mukai partners which are not Jacobians of the original K3 surface. This gives a negative answer to a question raised by Hassett and Tschinkel.</description>

Abstract: If a toric foliation on a projective Q-factorial toric variety has an extremal ray whose length is longer than the rank of the foliation, then the associated extremal contraction is a projective space bundle and the foliation is the relative tangent sheaf of the extremal contraction.</description>

      <title>Cluster deep loci and mirror symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Affine cluster varieties are covered up to codimension 2 by open algebraic tori. We put forth a general conjecture (based on earlier conversation between Vivek Shende and the last author) characterizing their deep locus, i.e. the complement of all cluster charts, as the locus of points with non-trivial stabilizer under the action of cluster automorphisms. We use the diagrammatics of Demazure weaves to verify the conjecture for skew-symmetric cluster varieties of finite cluster type with arbitrary choice of frozens and for the top open positroid strata of Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}(2,n)$ and $\mathrm{Gr}(3,n)$. We illustrate how this already has applications in symplectic topology and mirror symmetry, by proving that the Fukaya category of Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}(2,2n+1)$ is split-generated by finitely many Lagrangian tori, and homological mirror symmetry holds with a Landau--Ginzburg model proposed by Rietsch. Finally, we study the geometry of the deep locus, and find that it can be singular and have several irreducible components of different dimensions, but they all are again cluster varieties in our examples in really full rank cases.</description>

      <title>The Honest Embedding Dimension of a Numerical Semigroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attached to a singular analytic curve germ in $d$-space is a numerical semigroup: a subset $S$ of the non-negative integers which is closed under addition and whose complement isfinite. Conversely, associated to any numerical semigroup $S$ is a canonical mononial curve in $e$-space where $e$ is the number of minimal generators of the semigroup. It may happen that $d &lt; e = e(S)$ where $S$ is the semigroup of the curve in $d$-space. Define the minimal (or `honest') embedding of a numerical semigroup to be the smallest $d$ such that $S$ is realized by a curve in $d$-space. Problem: characterize the numerical semigroups having minimal embedding dimension $d$. The answer is known for the case $d=2$ of planar curves and reviewed in an Appendix to this paper. The case $d =3$ of the problem is open. Our main result is a characterization of the multiplicity $4$ numerical semigroups whose minimal embedding dimension is $3$. See figure 1. The motivation for this work came from thinking about Legendrian curve singularities.</description>

      <title>Newton Polyhedrons and Hodge Numbers of Non-degenerate Laurent Polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Claude Sabbah has defined the Fourier transform $G$ of the Gauss-Manin system for a non-degenerate and convenient Laurent polynomial and has shown that there exists a polarized mixed Hodge structure on the vanishing cycle of $G$. In this article, we consider certain non-degenerate and convenient Laurent polynomials $f_{P,\mathbf{a}}$, whose Newton polyhedron at infinity is a simplicial polytope $P$. First, we consider the stacky fan $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_P$ given by $P$ and show that for each quotient stacky fan of $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_P$, there is a natural polarized mixed Hodge structure on the ring of conewise polynomial functions on it. Then, we describe the polarized mixed Hodge structure on the vanishing cycle associated to $f_{P,\mathbf{a}}$ using these rings of conewise polynomial functions. In particular, we compute the Hodge diamond of the vanishing cycle. As a further consequence, we can solve the Birkhoff problem of such a Laurent polynomial by using elementary methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2008.13106v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define reflective modular forms on complex balls and use a method of Gritsenko and Hulek to show that some ball quotients of dimensions 3, 4 and 5 are uniruled. We give examples of Hermitian lattices over the rings of integers of imaginary quadratic fields $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-1})$ and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-2})$ for which the associated ball quotients are uniruled. Our examples include the moduli space of 8 points on $\mathbb{P}^1$. Moreover, we find that some of their Satake-Baily-Borel compactifications are rationally chain connected modulo certain cusps.</description>

      <title>Isoperiodic families of Poncelet polygons inscribed in a circle and circumscribed about conics from a confocal pencil</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.01215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Poncelet polygons inscribed in a circle and circumscribed about conics from a confocal family naturally arise in the analysis of the numerical range and Blaschke products. We examine the behaviour of such polygons when the inscribed conic varies through a confocal pencil and discover cases when each conic from the confocal family is inscribed in an $n$-polygon, which is inscribed in the circle, with the same $n$. Complete geometric characterization of such cases for $n\in\{4,6\}$ is given and proved that this cannot happen for other values of $n$. We establish a relationship of such families of Poncelet quadrangles and hexagons to solutions of a Painlev\'e VI equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.15582v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study local-global principles for two notions of semi-integral points, termed Campana points and Darmon points. In particular, we develop a semi-integral version of the Brauer-Manin obstruction interpolating between Manin's classical version for rational points and the integral version developed by Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and Xu. We determine the status of local-global principles, and obstructions to them, in two families of orbifolds naturally associated to quadric hypersurfaces. Further, we establish a quantitative result measuring the failure of the semi-integral Brauer-Manin obstruction to account for its integral counterpart for affine quadrics.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic degrees of dynamical systems over fields of characteristic zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we generalize the arithmetic degree and its related theory to dynamical systems defined over an arbitrary field $\mathbf{k}$ of characteristic $0$. We first consider a dynamical system $(X,f)$ over a finitely generated field $K$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, we introduce the arithmetic degrees $\alpha(f,\cdot)$ for $\overline{K}$-points by using Moriwaki heights. We study the arithmetic dynamical degree of $(X,f)$ and establish the relative degree formula. The relative degree formula gives a proof of the fundamental inequality, that is, the upper arithmetic degree $\overline{\alpha}(f,x)$ is less than or equal to the first dynamical degree $\lambda_1(f)$ in this setting. By taking spread-outs, we extend the definition of arithmetic degrees to dynamical systems over the field $\mathbf k$. We demonstrate that our definition is independent of the choice of the spread-out. Moreover, in this setting, we prove certain special cases of the Kawaguchi-Silverman conjecture. A main novelty of this paper is that, we give a characterization of arithmetic degrees of "transcendental points" in the case $\mathbf{k}=\mathbb{C}$, from which we deduce that $\alpha(f,x)=\lambda_1(f)$ for very general $x\in X(\mathbb{C})$ when $f$ is an endomorphism.</description>

      <title>Two Formulas for the Number of Lines on Complex Projective Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13206v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two formulas for the classical number $C_n$ of lines on a generic hypersurface of degree $2n-3$ in $\mathbb{CP}^n$ are obtained which differ from the formulas by Dominici, Harris, Libgober, and van der Waerden-Zagier. We review the splitting principle computation by Harris obtaining a similar general closed-form formula in terms of the Catalan numbers and elementary symmetric polynomials. This in turn yields $C_n$ as a linear difference recursion relation of unbounded order. Thus, for the sequence of certain linear combinations of $C_n$, a simple generating function is found. Then, a result from random algebraic geometry by Basu, Lerario, Lundberg, and Peterson, that expresses these classical enumerative invariants as proportional to the Bombieri norm of particular polynomial determinants, yields another combinatorial expansion in terms of certain set compositions and block labeling counting. As an example, we compute this combinatorial interpretation for the cases of 27 lines on a cubic surface and 2875 lines on a quintic threefold. As an application, we reobtain the parity and asymptotic upper bound of the sequence. In an appendix, we generalize the splitting principle calculation to obtain a formula for the number of lines on a generic complete intersection.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic concavity of bimatroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A bimatroid is a matroid-like generalization of the collection of regular minors of a matrix. In this article, we use the theory of Lorentzian polynomials to study the logarithmic concavity of natural sequences associated to bimatroids. Bimatroids can be used to characterize morphisms of matroids and this observation (originally due to Kung) allows us to prove a weak version of logarithmic concavity of the number of bases of a morphism of matroids. This is weaker than the original result by Eur and Huh; it nevertheless provides us with a new perspective on Mason's log-concavity conjecture for independent sets of matroids. We finally show that for realizable bimatroids, the regular minor polynomial is a volume polynomial. Applied to morphisms of matroids, this shows that the weak basis generating polynomial of a morphism is a volume polynomial; this confirms a conjecture of Eur--Huh for morphisms of nullity $\leq 1$ and gives an algebro-geometric explanation for Mason's log-concavity conjecture in the realizable case.</description>
