      <title>pyEQUIB Python Package, an addendum to proEQUIB: IDL Library for Plasma Diagnostics and Abundance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emission lines from ionized nebulae allow us to determine their physical and chemical properties, along with the interstellar extinction. "pyEQUIB" is a pure Python open-source package including several application programming interface (API) functions that can be employed for plasma diagnostics, abundance analysis of collisionally excited lines (CEL) and recombination lines (RL) in nebular astrophysics, and extinction analysis of Balmer lines. This package implements the IDL library "proEQUIB" in Python and couples it with the "AtomNeb" Python package. This package relies on the Python packages NumPy and SciPy. The API functions of this package can be used for studies of ionized nebulae by astronomers who are familiar with the high-level, general-purpose programming language Python.</description>

      <title>popclass: a python package for classifying microlensing events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: popclass is a python package that provides a flexible, probabilistic framework for classifying the lens of a gravitational microlensing event. popclass allows a user to match characteristics of a microlensing signal to a simulation of the Galaxy to calculate lens type probabilities for an event. Constraints on any microlensing signal characteristics and any Galactic model can be used. popclass comes with an interface to common inference libraries for microlensing signal constraints, pre-loaded Galactic models, plotting functionality, and classification uncertainty quantification methods.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Multi-wavelength Imaging of the LMC SN1987A with SRG/eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The EDR and eRASS1 data have already revealed a remarkable number of undiscovered X-ray sources. Using Bayesian inference and generative modeling techniques for X-ray imaging, we aim to increase the sensitivity and scientific value of these observations by denoising, deconvolving, and decomposing the X-ray sky. Leveraging information field theory, we can exploit the spatial and spectral correlation structures of the different physical components of the sky with non-parametric priors to enhance the image reconstruction. By incorporating instrumental effects into the forward model, we develop a comprehensive Bayesian imaging algorithm for eROSITA pointing observations. Finally, we apply the developed algorithm to EDR data of the LMC SN1987A, fusing data sets from observations made by five different telescope modules. The final result is a denoised, deconvolved, and decomposed view of the LMC, which enables the analysis of its fine-scale structures, the creation of point source catalogues of this region, and enhanced calibration for future work.</description>

      <title>Inverted EEMD: a robust method to identify narrow absorption features form spectral data and cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting information from complex data is a challenge shared by multiple frontiers of modern astrophysical research. Among those, analyzing spectra cubes, where the emission is mapped in the position-position-velocity space is a difficult task given the vast amount of information contained within. The cubes often contain a superposition of emissions and absorptions, where extracting absorption signatures is often necessary. One example is the extraction of narrow absorption structures in HI 21 cm emission spectra. These HI self-absorption (HISA) clouds trace the cold HI gas in interstellar space. We introduce an automatic and robust method called the \emph{inverted EEMD} method to extract narrow features from spectral cubes. Our method is based on the EEMD method, an established method to decompose 1d signals. The method is robust and parameter-free, making it useful in analyzing spectral cubes containing localized absorption signals of different types. The inverted-EEMD method is suitable for the analysis of spectral cubes where it can produce a cube containing the absorption signal and one containing the unabsorbed signal, where cold clouds can be identified as coherent regions in the absorption map. A Python implementation of the method is available at \url{https://github.com/zhenzhen-research/inverted_eemd_map}.</description>

      <title>GRB Redshift Estimation using Machine Learning and the Associated Web-App</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), observed at redshifts as high as 9.4, could serve as valuable probes for investigating the distant Universe. However, this necessitates an increase in the number of GRBs with determined redshifts, as currently, only 12% of GRBs have known redshifts due to observational biases. Aims. We aim to address the shortage of GRBs with measured redshifts, enabling us to fully realize their potential as valuable cosmological probes Methods. Following Dainotti et al. (2024c), we have taken a second step to overcome this issue by adding 30 more GRBs to our ensemble supervised machine learning training sample, an increase of 20%, which will help us obtain better redshift estimates. In addition, we have built a freely accessible and user-friendly web app that infers the redshift of long GRBs (LGRBs) with plateau emission using our machine learning model. The web app is the first of its kind for such a study and will allow the community to obtain redshift estimates by entering the GRB parameters in the app. Results. Through our machine learning model, we have successfully estimated redshifts for 276 LGRBs using X-ray afterglow parameters detected by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and increased the sample of LGRBs with known redshifts by 110%. We also perform Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate the future applicability of this research. Conclusions. The results presented in this research will enable the community to increase the sample of GRBs with known redshift estimates. This can help address many outstanding issues, such as GRB formation rate, luminosity function, and the true nature of low-luminosity GRBs, and enable the application of GRBs as standard candles</description>

      <title>On Finding Black Holes in Photometric Microlensing Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are expected to be millions of isolated black holes in the Galaxy resulting from the death of massive stars. Measuring the abundance and properties of this remnant population would shed light on the end stages of stellar evolution and the evolution paths of black hole systems. Detecting isolated black holes is currently only possible via gravitational microlensing which has so far yielded one definitive detection. The difficulty in finding microlensing black holes lies in having to choose a small subset of events based on characteristics of their lightcurves to allocate expensive and scarce follow-up resources to confirm the identity of the lens. Current methods either rely on simple cuts in parameter space without using the full distribution information or are only effective on a small subsets of events. In this paper we present a new lens classification method. The classifier takes in posterior constraints on lightcurve parameters and combines them with a Galactic simulation to estimate the lens class probability. This method is flexible and can be used with any set of microlensing lightcurve parameters making it applicable to large samples of events. We make this classification framework available via the popclass python package. We apply the classifier to $\sim10,000$ microlensing events from the OGLE survey and find $23$ high-probability black hole candidates. Our classifier also suggests that the only known isolated black hole is an observational outlier according to current Galactic models and allocation of astrometric follow-up on this event was a high-risk strategy.</description>

      <title>An automated method to detect and characterise semi-resolved star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for automatically detecting and characterising semi-resolved star clusters: clusters where the observational point-spread function (PSF) is smaller than the cluster's radius, but larger than the separations between individual stars. We apply our method to a 1.77 deg$^2$ field located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using the VISTA survey of the Magellanic Clouds (VMC), which surveyed the LMC in the $YJK_\text{s}$ bands. Our approach first models the position-dependent PSF to detect and remove point sources from deep $K_\text{s}$ images; this leaves behind extended objects such as star clusters and background galaxies. We then analyse the isophotes of these extended objects to characterise their properties, perform integrated photometry, and finally remove any spurious objects this procedure identifies. We demonstrate our approach in practice on a deep VMC $K_\text{s}$ tile that contains the most active star-forming regions in the LMC: 30 Doradus, N158, N159, and N160. We select this tile because it is the most challenging for automated techniques due both to crowding and nebular emission. We detect 682 candidate star clusters, with an estimated contamination rate of 13% from background galaxies and chance blends of physically unrelated stars. We compare our candidates to publicly available James Webb Space Telescope data and find that at least 80% of our detections appear to be star clusters.</description>

      <title>Characterization of non-Gaussian stochastic signals with heavier-tailed likelihoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future Gravitational Wave observatories will give us the opportunity to search for stochastic signals of astrophysical, or even cosmological origins. However, parameter estimation and search will be challenging, mostly due to the overlap of multiple signal components, as well as the potentially partially unknown properties of the instrumental noise. In this work, we propose a robust statistical framework based on heavier-tailed likelihoods for the characterization of stochastic gravitational-wave signals. In particular, we use the symmetric hyperbolic likelihood, which allows us to probe the signal spectral properties and simultaneously test for any departures from Gaussianity. We demonstrate this methodology with synthetic data from the future LISA mission, where we estimate the potential non-Gaussianities induced by the unresolved Ultra Compact Galactic Binaries.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Capabilities of Deep Learning for Processing and Interpreting One-Shot Multi-offset GPR Data: A Numerical Case Study for Lunar and Martian Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is a mature geophysical method that has gained increasing popularity in planetary science over the past decade. GPR has been utilised both for Lunar and Martian missions providing pivotal information regarding the near surface geology of Terrestrial planets. Within that context, numerous processing pipelines have been suggested to address the unique challenges present in planetary setups. These processing pipelines often require manual tuning resulting to ambiguous outputs open to non-unique interpretations. These pitfalls combined with the large number of planetary GPR data (kilometers in magnitude), highlight the necessity for automatic, objective and advanced processing and interpretation schemes. The current paper investigates the potential of deep learning for interpreting and processing GPR data. The one-shot multi-offset configuration is investigated via a coherent numerical case study, showcasing the potential of deep learning for A) reconstructing the dielectric distribution of the the near surface of Terrestrial planets, and B) filling missing or bad-quality traces. Special care was taken for the numerical data to be both realistic and challenging. Moreover, the generated synthetic data are properly labelled and made publicly available for training future data-driven pipelines and contributing towards developing pre-trained foundation models for GPR.</description>

      <title>Sputter Yields of the Lunar Surface: Experimental Validation and Numerical Modelling of Solar Wind Sputtering of Apollo 16 Soils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sputtering by solar wind ions is a key process driving the ejection of high-energy particles into the exospheres of airless bodies like asteroids, Mercury and the Moon. In view of upcoming missions which will deliver new in-situ data on these exospheres like the Artemis program at the Moon and BepiColombo at Mercury, a deeper understanding of sputtering effects is crucial. In this work, we combine sensitive quartz crystal microbalance measurements and numerical simulations to quantify sputter yields of Apollo soil 68501 under solar wind relevant conditions. We find that none of the commonly used simulation codes can reliably predict laboratory sputter yields without experimental benchmarks. All of the employed packages significantly overestimate the sputter yields of flat samples by at least a factor of 2 for the case of hydrogen. When accounting for surface roughness and regolith-like porosity, sputter yields are decreased even further to 7.3E-3 atoms\ion and 7.6E-2 atoms\ion for H and He at solar wind energies of 1 keV\amu, respectively. The reduced yields of porous regolith structures are largely independent of the ion incidence angle, making them applicable across a wide range of lunar latitudes. This study highlights the need for experimental validation of sputtering models to ensure accurate predictions for space weathering and lunar exosphere composition.</description>

      <title>Kinematical signatures: Distinguishing between warps and radial flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Increasing evidence shows that warped disks are common, challenging the methods used to model their velocity fields. Molecular line emission of these disks is characterized by a twisted pattern, similar to the signal from radial flows, complicating the study of warped disk kinematics. Previous attempts to model these features have encountered difficulties in distinguishing between the underlying kinematics of different disks. This study aims to advance gas kinematics modeling capabilities by extending the Extracting Disk Dynamics ($\texttt{eddy}$) package to include warped geometries and radial flows. We assess the performance of $\texttt{eddy}$ in recovering input parameters for scenarios involving warps, radial flows, and combinations of the two. Additionally, we provide a basis to break the visual degeneracy between warped disks and radial flow, establishing a criterion to distinguish them. We extended the $\texttt{eddy}$ package to handle warped geometries by including a parametric prescription of a warped disk and a ray-casting algorithm to account for the surface self-obscuration arising from the 3D to 2D projection. The effectiveness of the tool was tested using the radiative transfer code $\texttt{RADMC3D}$, generating synthetic models for disks with radial flows, warped disks, and warped disks with radial flows. We demonstrate the efficacy of our tool in accurately recovering the geometrical parameters of systems, particularly in data with sufficient angular resolution. Importantly, we observe minimal impact from thermal noise levels typical in Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations. Furthermore, our findings reveal that fitting an incorrect model type produces characteristic residual signatures, which serve as kinematic criteria for disk classification.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Galaxy Clustering Predictions from Small-Volume Hydrodynamical Simulations via Control Variates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations of galaxy formation are an invaluable tool for understanding galaxy formation and its impact on cosmological parameter inference from large-scale structure. However, their high computational cost is a significant obstacle for running simulations that probe cosmological volumes comparable to those analyzed by contemporary large-scale structure experiments. In this work, we explore the possibility of obtaining high-precision galaxy clustering predictions from small-volume hydrodynamical simulations such as MilleniumTNG and FLAMINGO via control variates. In this approach, the hydrodynamical full-physics simulation is paired with a matched low-resolution gravity-only simulation. By learning the galaxy-halo connection from the hydrodynamical simulation and applying it to the gravity-only counterpart, one obtains a galaxy population that closely mimics the one in the more expensive simulation. One can then construct an estimator of galaxy clustering that combines the clustering amplitudes in the small-volume hydrodynamical and gravity-only simulations with clustering amplitudes in a large-volume gravity-only simulation. Depending on the galaxy sample, clustering statistic, and scale, this galaxy clustering estimator can have an effective volume of up to around $100$ times the volume of the original hydrodynamical simulation in the non-linear regime. With this approach, we can construct galaxy clustering predictions from existing simulations that are precise enough for mock analyses of next-generation large-scale structure surveys such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <title>Super-Jeans fragmentation in massive star-forming regions revealed by triangulation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the fragmentation of the gas cloud and the formation of massive stars remains one of the most challenging questions of modern astrophysical research. Either the gas fragmentation in a Jeans-like fashion, after which the fragments grow through accretion, or the fragmentation length is larger than the Jeans length from the start. Despite significant observational efforts, a consensus has not been reached. The key is to infer the initial density distribution upon which gravitational fragmentation occurs. Since cores are the products of the fragmentation process, the distances between adjacent cores serve as a scale indicator. Based on this observation, we propose a Delaunay triangulation-based approach to infer the density structure before the fragmentation and establish the link between density distribution and gas fragmentation length. We find that at low density, the fragmenting is Jeans-like, and at high densities, the core separations are larger than the prediction of the Jeans fragmentation. This super-Jeans fragmentation, which often occurs in groups, is responsible for the clustered formation of massive stars.</description>

Abstract: Current and future large scale structure surveys aim to constrain the neutrino mass and the equation of state of dark energy. We aim to construct accurate and interpretable symbolic approximations to the linear and nonlinear matter power spectra as a function of cosmological parameters in extended $\Lambda$CDM models which contain massive neutrinos and non-constant equations of state for dark energy. This constitutes an extension of the syren-halofit emulators to incorporate these two effects, which we call syren-new (SYmbolic-Regression-ENhanced power spectrum emulator with NEutrinos and $W_0-w_a$). We also obtain a simple approximation to the derived parameter $\sigma_8$ as a function of the cosmological parameters for these models. Our results for the linear power spectrum are designed to emulate CLASS, whereas for the nonlinear case we aim to match the results of EuclidEmulator2. We compare our results to existing emulators and $N$-body simulations. Our analytic emulators for $\sigma_8$, the linear and nonlinear power spectra achieve root mean squared errors of 0.1%, 0.3% and 1.3%, respectively, across a wide range of cosmological parameters, redshifts and wavenumbers. We verify that emulator-related discrepancies are subdominant compared to observational errors and other modelling uncertainties when computing shear power spectra for LSST-like surveys. Our expressions have similar accuracy to existing (numerical) emulators, but are at least an order of magnitude faster, both on a CPU and GPU. Our work greatly improves the accuracy, speed and range of applicability of current symbolic approximations to the linear and nonlinear matter power spectra. We provide publicly available code for all symbolic approximations found.</description>

      <title>SAGUARO: Time-domain Infrastructure for the Fourth Gravitational-wave Observing Run and Beyond</title>

Abstract: We present upgraded infrastructure for Searches after Gravitational Waves Using ARizona Observatories (SAGUARO) during LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA's fourth gravitational-wave (GW) observing run (O4). These upgrades implement many of the lessons we learned after a comprehensive analysis of potential electromagnetic counterparts to the GWs discovered during the previous observing run. We have developed a new web-based target and observation manager (TOM) that allows us to coordinate sky surveys, vet potential counterparts, and trigger follow-up observations from one centralized portal. The TOM includes software that aggregates all publicly available information on the light curves and possible host galaxies of targets, allowing us to rule out potential contaminants like active galactic nuclei, variable stars, solar-system objects, and preexisting supernovae, as well as to assess the viability of any plausible counterparts. We have also upgraded our image-subtraction pipeline by assembling deeper reference images and training a new neural network-based real-bogus classifier. These infrastructure upgrades will aid coordination by enabling the prompt reporting of observations, discoveries, and analysis to the GW follow-up community, and put SAGUARO in an advantageous position to discover kilonovae in the remainder of O4 and beyond. Many elements of our open-source software stack have broad utility beyond multimessenger astronomy, and will be particularly relevant in the "big data" era of transient discoveries by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.</description>
