      <title>Strong superconducting pairing strength and pseudogap features in a putative multiphase heavy-fermion superconductor CeRh2As2 by soft point-contact spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CeRh2As2 is a newly discovered candidate of multiphase heavy-fermion superconductor (Tc=0.3 K) with intriguing physical properties. Here, we employ soft point-contact spectroscopy to investigate its energy gap behaviors in both the normal and superconducting states. The differential conductance below Tc reveals an estimated superconducting energy gap of 2{\Delta}SC=0.24 meV and thus an extremely strong superconducting pairing strength 2{\Delta}SC/kBTc=8.8, which is comparable to those of cuprates and iron-based high-Tc superconductors as well as infinite-layer nickelates. Above Tc, a well-defined pseudogap feature is manifested as a V-shaped dip in the differential conductance spanning an energy scale of 2{\Delta}g=0.95-3.0 meV. The pseudogap feature persists to the highest characteristic temperature of Tg=8-9 K and is gradually suppressed by magnetic field of Bg=9.0T regardless of its direction relative to the crystallographic axes. The observation of pseudogap features prior to the superconducting phase transition enriches the phase diagram of CeRh2As2 and provides a novel platform to study the interplay of unconventional superconductivity and pseudogap phenomena.</description>

      <title>High-temperature field-free superconducting diode effect in high-Tc cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is defined by the difference in the magnitude of critical currents applied in opposite directions. It has been observed in various superconducting systems and attracted high research interests. However, the operating temperature of the SDE is typically low and/or the sample structure is rather complex. For the potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, efficient superconducting diodes working in zero magnetic field with high operating temperatures and a simple configuration are highly desired. Here, we report the observation of a SDE under zero magnetic field with operating temperatures up to 72 K and efficiency as high as 22% at 53 K in high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} (BSCCO) flake devices. The rectification effect persists beyond two hundred sweeping cycles, confirming the stability of the superconducting diode. Our results offer promising developments for potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, and provide insights into the mechanism of field-free SDE and symmetry breakings in high-Tc superconductors.</description>

      <title>Large upper critical fields and strong coupling superconductivity in the medium-entropy alloy (Ti1/3Hf1/3Ta1/3)1-xNbx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of high-entropy superconductors in 2014, superconductivity has remained a focal point of interest in medium- and high-entropy alloys (MEAs-HEAs). Here, we report a series of (Ti0.33Hf0.33Ta0.33)1-xNbx MEA superconductors crystallized in the BCC structure, whose superconductivity was characterized by resistivity, magnetization, and specific heat measurements. The study found that the (Ti0.33Hf0.33Ta0.33)1-xNbx MEAs exhibit bulk superconductivity. With the doping of Nb, the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) increases from 5.31 K to 9.11 K, and the normalized Cel jumps at Tc, and the logarithmically averaged characteristic phonon frequency exhibit dome-shaped curves. Results from specific heat measurements indicate that the superconductivity is of a strongly coupled s-wave type observed. Furthermore, at low Nb content, the upper critical field of the samples is larger than the Pauli paramagnetic limit. The strongly coupling behavior and large upper critical field in s-wave type (Ti0.33Hf0.33Ta0.33)1-xNbx MEA superconductors are unusual, as they typically occur in other unconventional superconductors. Thus, (Ti0.33Hf0.33Ta0.33)1-xNbx may have significant potential in the research and understanding of physical mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Topology meets time-reversal symmetry breaking in FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$ superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) in magnetic topological insulators induces a Dirac gap in the topological surface state (TSS), leading to exotic phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect. Yet, the interplay between TRSB and topology in superconductors remains underexplored due to limited suitable materials. Here we employ zero-field muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) as a sensitive probe of TRSB to map out the electronic phase diagrams of iron-chalcogenide superconductors FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$. For the Te composition $x=0.64$ with the highest superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}=14.5$ K, which is known to host a TSS and Majorana zero modes within vortices, we detect spontaneous magnetic fields below $T_{\rm c}$ distinct from a magnetic order. This signifies a TRSB superconducting state in the bulk, revealing the convergence of unconventional TRSB superconductivity with topologically nontrivial electronic structures in FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$. Given the relatively high $T_{\rm c}$ and the tunability of the Fermi level through chemical substitution, iron-chalcogenide superconductors offer an intriguing platform for investigating the synergy between topological superconductivity and TRSB.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Magneto-transport and Anisotropic Multigap Superconductivity in Architecturally Misfit Layered System (PbS)$_{1.13}$TaS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Misfit-layered compounds, naturally occurring bulk heterostructures, present a compelling alternative to artificially engineered ones, offering a unique platform for exploring correlated phases and quantum phenomena. This study investigates the magnetotransport and superconducting properties of the misfit compound (PbS)$_{1.13}$TaS$_2$, comprising alternating PbS and 1$H$-TaS$_2$ layers. It exhibits distinctive transport properties, including a prominent planar Hall effect and a four-fold oscillatory Butterfly-shaped anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR). Moreover, it shows multigap two-dimensional superconductivity with an exceptionally high in-plane upper critical field, exceeding the Pauli limit. The coexistence of unconventional superconductivity and anomalous transport - two distinct quantum phenomena, within the same material, suggests that misfit compounds provide an ideal platform for realizing quantum effects in the two-dimensional limit of bulk crystals. This opens the door to the development of simpler and more efficient quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Propagation velocity measurements of substrate phonon bursts using MKIDs for superconducting circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy bursts in superconducting quantum circuits from various radiation sources have recently become a practical concern due to induced errors and their propagation in the chip. The speed and distance of these disturbances have practical implications. We used a linear array of multiplexed MKIDs on a single silicon chip to measure the propagation velocity of a localized high-energy burst, introduced by driving a Normal metal- Insulator-Superconductor (NIS) junction. We observed a reduction in the apparent propagation velocity with NIS power, which is due to the combined effect of reduced phonon flux with distance and the existence of a minimum detectable QP density in the MKIDs. A simple theoretical model is fitted to extract the longitudinal phonon velocity in the substrate and the conversion efficiency of phonons to QPs in the superconductor.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Phonon-Phonon Interactions and Weakened Electron-Phonon Coupling in Charge-Density-Wave Topological Semimetal EuAl4 with a Possible Intermediate Electronic State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of charge density wave (CDW) is a long-term open issue. Furthermore, the evolution of phonon-phonon interactions (PPI) across CDW transitions has rarely been investigated. Besides, whether electron-phonon coupling (EPC) would be weakened or enhanced after CDW transitions is still under debate. Additionally, CDW provides a fertile ground for uncovering intriguing intermediate electronic states. Here, we report a Raman spectroscopy study of the PPI and EPC in topological semimetal EuAl4 exhibiting a CDW phase below temperature Tc ~ 145 K. The free-charge-carrier-density (nc) and temperature dependences of the Fano asymmetric factors (1/|q|) of the two phonon modes A1g and B1g indicates that below Tc, the EPC becomes weakened probably due to the reduction of the nc. Interestingly, in the temperature range from 50 to 145 K, the steep growth of the 1/|q| leading to the significant deviation from the linear dependence on the nc, together with the shoulder-like features in the temperature evolutions of the 1/|q| and the nc around 50 K, implies the possible existence of an intermediate electronic state with the EPC distinctly larger than the CDW ground state in EuAl4. Furthermore, below Tc, the faster decrease in the full width at half maxima of the B1g phonon mode representing the collective vibrations of the CDW-modulated Al1 atoms suggests that a remarkable growth of the PPI for the B1g phonon mode after the CDW phase transition, which is in contrast to the weakening of the EPC and thus may mainly arise from the strengthening of lattice anharmonicity in EuAl4. Our results not only highlight the significance of the enhanced PPI and the weakened EPC in completely understanding the formation of the CDW phase but also initiate the exploration of novel intermediate electronic states in EuAl4.</description>

      <title>Quasi-one-dimensional Supersolids in Luther-Emery Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The supersolid is a long-sought phase in condensed matter physics, characterized by the coexistence of density wave and superfluid orders. This phase is counterintuitive, as different symmetry-breaking orders typically compete with one another. A deeper understanding of how such a state forms in condensed matter systems remains an open question, especially in quasi-one-dimensional correlated systems. In this work, we investigate the emergence of supersolids in Luttinger-Emery liquids using a variational method. As the system consists of coupled Luttinger-Emery liquid chains, we refer to this phase as a quasi-one-dimensional supersolid. Notably, we demonstrate that the quasi-one-dimensional supersolid phase is energetically favorable in chains with finite size or short-range order. Furthermore, we investigate the collective dynamics of these coexisting charge density waves and superconducting states, identifying a quasi-Goldstone mode. Our theory provides valuable insights into both the ground state and the dynamic properties of supersolids in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>High Temperature Superconductivity in the Cuprates: Phenomena from a Theorist's Point of View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I present a selection of experimental results on metallic cuprates, both above the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ (often called the strange metal state) and in the superconducting state. It highlights this still poorly understood part of the physical world. After an introduction, I talk briefly about the pseudogap regime and about the unusual linear resistivity phenomenon. Several empirical correlations between observed quantities are mentioned, e.g. $T_c$ and superfluid density (Uemura), $T_c$ and next nearest neighbour hopping, slope of the linear resistivity and $T_c$. In the belief that a comprehensive explanation may need an understanding of the extremely strongly correlated metal, a few initial steps in this direction are outlined.</description>

      <title>Effect of Impurity on Inhomogeneous Vacuum and Interacting Vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the inhomogeneous abelian Higgs model with a magnetic impurity. The vacuum configuration of the symmetry-broken phase is not simply the constant Higgs vacuum but is a nontrivial function of spatial coordinates, satisfying the Euler-Lagrange equations. The vacuum of zero winding number has zero magnetic flux but its non-zero magnetic field depends on spatial coordinates. The corresponding vacuum energy is negative for weak coupling $(\lambda &lt; 1)$, zero for critical BPS coupling $(\lambda = 1)$, and positive for strong coupling $(\lambda &gt; 1)$ by an over-, exact-, and under-cancellation of the huge positive impurity energy. This distinct vacuum energies are consistent with classification of the type I and I$\!$I superconductivity in dirty conventional superconductors. Non-BPS vortex configurations are also obtained in the presence of inhomogeneity. Their rest energies favor energetically vortex-impurity composite in conventional type I$\!$I superconductivity, consistent with imperfect diamagnetism. The delta function limit of Gaussian type impurity suggests the formation of vortex-lattice composite which elucidates flux-pinning in the context of inhomogeneous field theory.</description>

Abstract: We uncover a new superconducting state with partial spin polarization induced by a magnetic field. This state, which we call "magnonic superconductor", lacks a conventional pairing order parameter, but is characterized instead by a composite order parameter that represents the binding of electron pairs and magnons. We rigorously demonstrate the existence of magnonic superconductivity with high transition temperature in one- and two-dimensional Hubbard models with repulsive interaction. We further show that magnonic Cooper pairs can attract to form higher-charge bound states, which can give rise to charge-$6e$ superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15834v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an approach to use linearly polarized light to imprint superconducting vortices. Within the framework of the generalized time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations we demonstrate the induction of the coherent vortex pairs that are moving in phase with electormagnetic wave oscillations. The overall vorticity of the superconductor remain zero throughout the cycle. Our results uncover rich multiscale dynamics of SC vorticity and suggest new optical applications for various types of structured light. In departure from classical laser printing, the laser printing proposed here can be viewed as quantum print where we induce quantum excitations in the SC liquid.</description>

      <title>Structured light and induced vorticity in superconductors II: Quantum Print with Laguerre-Gaussian beam</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Challenge to control the quantum states of matter via light have been at the forefront of modern research on driven quantum matter. We explore the imprinting effects of structured light on superconductors, demonstrating how the quantum numbers of light-specifically spin angular momentum, orbital angular momentum, and radial order-can be transferred to the superconducting order parameter and control vortex dynamics. Using Laguerre-Gaussian beams, we show that by tuning the quantum numbers and the amplitude of the electric field, it is possible to manipulate a variety of vortex behaviors, including breathing vortex pairs, braiding vortex pairs, vortex droplets, supervortices, and swirling 2D vortex rings. More complex structure of vortex-clusters, such as vortex-flake structures, and standing wave motions, also emerge under specific quantum numbers. These results demonstrate the ability to control SC vortex motion and phase structures through structured light, offering potential applications in quantum fluids and optical control of superconducting states. Our findings present a diagram that links light's quantum numbers to the resulting SC vortex behaviors, highlighting the capacity of light to transfer its symmetry onto superconducting condensates. We point that this approach represents the extension of the printing to quantum printing by light in a coherent state of electrons.</description>

      <title>Large tunable Josephson diode effect in a side-contacted topological-insulator-nanowire junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Josephson diode passes current with zero resistance in one direction but is resistive in the other direction. While such an effect has been observed in several platforms, a large and tunable Josephson diode effect has been rare. Here we report that a simple device consisting of a topological-insulator (TI) nanowire side-contacted by superconductors to form a lateral Josephson junction presents a large diode effect with the efficiency $\eta$ reaching 0.3 when a parallel magnetic field $B_{||}$ is applied. Interestingly, the sign and the magnitude of $\eta$ is found to be tunable not only by $B_{||}$ but also by the back-gate voltage. This novel diode effect can be understood by modeling the system as a nano-SQUID, in which the top and bottom surfaces of the TI nanowire each form a line junction and $B_{||}$ creates a magnetic flux to thread the SQUID loop. This model further shows that the observed diode effect is accompanied by the emergence of topological superconductivity in TI-nanowire-based Josephson junction.</description>

      <title>Direct Comparison of Magnetic Penetration Depth in Kagome Superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = Cs, K, Rb)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report measurements of the local temperature-dependent penetration depth, $\lambda(T)$, in the Kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = Cs, K, Rb) using scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscopy. Our results suggest that the superconducting order in all three compounds is fully gapped, in contrast to reports of nodal superconductivity in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. Analysis of the temperature-dependent superfluid density, $\rho_s(T)$, shows deviations from the behavior expected for a single isotropic gap, but the data are well described by models incorporating either a single anisotropic gap or two isotropic gaps. Notably, the temperature dependences of $\lambda(T)$ and $\rho_s(T)$ in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ are qualitatively more similar to each other than to CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, consistent with the superconducting phase reflecting features of the normal-state band structure. Our findings provide a direct comparison of the superconducting properties across the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ family.</description>

      <title>Hydride superconductivity: here to stay, or to lead astray and soon go away?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent Comment (arXiv:2411.10522, Nat Rev Phys 7, 2 (2025)), fifteen prominent leaders in the field of condensed matter physics declare that hydride superconductivity is real and urge funding agencies to continue to support the field. I question the validity and constructiveness of their argument.</description>

      <title>Topological superconductivity in a spin-orbit coupled Kondo lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the effect of spin-orbit coupling on a two-dimensional Kondo Lattice model, in which conduction electrons are antiferromagnetically coupled to a Yao-Lee spin liquid. When a Rashba spin-orbit interaction and a nearest-neighbor Kondo interaction is introduced, the low-energy Majorana bands become gapped and develop Chern numbers, protecting unidirectionally propagating Majorana edge modes. Our model describes a chiral topological superconductor with fractionalized charge-$e$ order parameter and spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry, which may be of interest for certain heavy fermion superconductors, such as UTe$_2$.</description>
