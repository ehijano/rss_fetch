      <title>RMS asymmetry: a robust metric of galaxy shapes in images with varied depth and resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural disturbances, such as galaxy mergers or instabilities, are key candidates for driving galaxy evolution, so it is important to detect and quantify galaxies hosting these disturbances spanning a range of masses, environments, and cosmic times. Traditionally, this is done by quantifying the asymmetry of a galaxy as part of the concentration-asymmetry-smoothness system, $A_{\rm{CAS}}$, and selecting galaxies above a certain threshold as merger candidates. However, in this work, we show that $A_{\rm{CAS}}$, is extremely dependent on imaging properties -- both resolution and depth -- and thus defining a single $A_{\rm{CAS}}$ threshold is impossible. We analyze an alternative root-mean-squared asymmetry, $A_{\rm{RMS}}$, and show that it is independent of noise down to the average SNR per pixel of 1. However, both metrics depend on the resolution. We argue that asymmetry is, by design, always a scale-dependent measurement, and it is essential to define an asymmetry at a given physical resolution, where the limit should be defined by the size of the smallest features one wishes to detect. We measure asymmetry of a set of $z\approx0.1$ galaxies observed with HST, HSC, and SDSS, and show that after matching the resolution of all images to 200 pc, we are able to obtain consistent $A_{\rm{RMS, 200pc}}$ measurements with all three instruments despite the vast differences in the original resolution or depth. We recommend that future studies use $A_{\rm{RMS, x pc}}$ measurement when evaluating asymmetry, where $x$ is defined by the physical size of the features of interest, and is kept consistent across the dataset, especially when the redshift or image properties of galaxies in the dataset vary.</description>

      <title>Overmassive black holes at cosmic noon: linking the local and the high-redshift Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report for the first time a sample of 12 supermassive black holes (SMBHs) hosted by low-mass galaxies at cosmic noon, i.e., in a redshift range consistent with the peak of star formation history: $z \sim 1-3$. These black holes are two orders of magnitude too massive for the stellar content of their hosts when compared with the local relation for active galaxies. These overmassive systems at cosmic noon share similar properties with the high-$z$ sources found ubiquitously in recent \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} (\textit{JWST}) surveys (same range of black hole-to-stellar mass ratio, bolometric luminosity, and Eddington ratio). We argue that black hole feedback processes, for which there is possible evidence in five of the sources, and the differing environments in galactic nuclei at these respective epochs play a key role in these overmassive systems. These findings contribute to our understanding of the growth and co-evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies across cosmic time, offering a link between the early Universe ($z &gt; 4$) observed by \textit{JWST} and observations of the present-day Universe ($z \lesssim 1$).</description>

      <title>Reconstructing rotation curves with artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic rotation curves have been served as indispensable tools for determining the distribution of mass within galaxies. Despite several advances in precision observations, some discrepancies still persist between the inferred matter distribution from luminosity and observed rotation velocities, often attributed to the presence of dark matter. Traditional parametric models, while insightful, struggle with the complexity of galaxies with prominent bulges or non-circular motions, but in contrast, non-parametric methods offer a promising alternative, adapting to the intricate nature of rotation curves without any prior assumptions. In this work, we employ artificial neural networks to reconstruct rotation curves of 17 spiral galaxies from high-quality data, demonstrating the efficacy of the non-parametric approaches in characterizing galactic dynamics. Our findings underscore the importance of employing diverse methodological approaches to comprehensively understand galactic dynamics in modern astrophysics research. Moreover, the non-parametric reconstruction approach with neural networks presents a promising avenue for further investigations, capable of generating interpolations based on the intrinsic patterns of the data.</description>

      <title>On Variation of Light Curves and Broad Emission Lines for Periodic QSOs from co-rotating Supermassive binary black holes in elliptical orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Periodic QSOs are considered as candidates of supermassive binary black hole (BBH) systems in galactic centers. Further confirmation of these candidates may require different lines of observational evidences. Aims. Assuming the Doopler boosting scenario, in this paper we investigate the (coherent) variations of both broad emission lines (BELs) and continuum light curves for active BBH systems surrounding by a circumbinary broad line region (cBLR) and focus on their dependence on the eccentric orbital configuration. Methods. We calculate the variation of continuum light and the Doppler enhanced/weakened photoionization of each BLR cloud according to the motion of BBHs in elliptical orbits, and finally obtain the coherent variation of the continuum and BELs. Results. We find that both the amplitude and variation pattern of the continuum light curves and the evolution of the BEL profiles sensitively depend on the eccentric orbital configuration of BBH systems. If only the secondary BH is active, both the variation amplitudes of continuum light curves and BELs increase with increasing BBH inclination angles and orbital eccentricities, but decrease with increasing BBH mass ratio. If both BHs are active, the asymmetry in the ionization of BLR clouds at different areas caused by the Doppler boosting effect of the secondary BH is weakened due to that of the primary BH at the opposite direction, which leads to systematically smaller variation amplitudes of both continuum light curves and BELs than the cases with only secondary BH activated. Conclusions. The coherent variations of the BEL profiles with the continuum light for those periodic QSOs provide an important way to confirm the existence of BBHs in their center. Future joint analysis of the light curves and multi-epoch observed BEL profiles for periodic QSOs may lead to the identification of a number of BBH systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Star Cluster Formation: Mergers in Gas Rich Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform high resolution simulations of forming star clusters as they merge inside giant molecular clouds (GMCs) using hydrodynamics coupled to N-body dynamics to simultaneously model both the gas and stars. We zoom in to previously run GMC simulations and resolve clusters into their stellar and gas components while including the surrounding GMC environment. We find that GMC gas is important in facilitating the growth of clusters in their embedded phase by promoting cluster mergers. Mergers induce asymmetric expansion of the stellar component of the clusters in our simulations. As well, mergers induce angular momentum in the clusters' stellar and gas components. We find that mergers can lead to an increase in the amount of dense gas present in clusters if a background gas distribution is present. We predict that this can lead to new star formation that can change the overall distribution of cluster stars in velocity space. Our results suggest that subcluster mergers in the presence of background gas can imprint dynamical signatures that can be used to constrain cluster formation histories.</description>

      <title>Helium Reionization from Empirical Quasar Luminosity Functions before and after JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, models of the quasar luminosity function (QLF) rooted on large observational compilations have been produced that, unlike their predecessors, feature a smooth evolution with time. This bypasses the need to assume an ionizing emissivity evolution when simulating helium reionization with observations-based QLF, thus yielding more robust constraints. We combine one such QLF with a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation and 3D multi-frequency radiative transfer. The simulated reionization history is consistently delayed in comparison to most other models in the literature. The predicted intergalactic medium temperature is larger than the observed one at $z \lesssim 3$. Through forward modeling of the He II Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, we show that our model produces an extended helium reionization and successfully matches the bulk of the observed effective optical depth distribution, although it over-ionizes the Universe at $z\lesssim2.8$ as the effect of small-scale Lyman Limit Systems not being resolved. We thoroughly characterize transmission regions and dark gaps in He II Lyman-$\alpha$ forest sightlines. We quantify their sensitivity to the helium reionization, opening a new avenue for further observational studies of this epoch. Finally, we explore the implications for helium reionization of the large number of active galactic nuclei revealed at $z\gtrsim5$ by JWST. We find that such modifications do not affect any observable at $z\leq4$, except in our most extreme model, indicating that the observed abundance of high-$z$ AGNs does not bear consequences for helium reionization.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Tidal Treasures: Automated Classification of Faint Tidal Features in DECaLS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal features are a key observable prediction of the hierarchical model of galaxy formation and contain a wealth of information about the properties and history of a galaxy. Modern wide-field surveys such as LSST and Euclid will revolutionise the study of tidal features. However, the volume of data will far surpass the capacity to inspect each galaxy to identify the feature visually, thereby motivating an urgent need to develop automated detection methods. This paper presents a visual classification of $\sim$2,000 galaxies from the DECaLS survey into different tidal feature categories: arms, streams, shells, and diffuse. Using these labels, we trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to reproduce the assigned visual classifications. Overall our network performed well and retrieved a median $81.1^{+5.8}_{-6.5}$, $65.7^{+5.0}_{-8.4}$, $91.3^{+6.0}_{-5.9}$, and $82.3^{+1.4}_{-7.9}$ per cent of the actual instances of arm, stream, shell, and diffuse features respectively for just 20 per cent contamination. We verified that the network was classifying the images correctly by using a Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping analysis to highlight important regions on the images for a given classification. This is the first demonstration of using CNNs to classify tidal features into sub-categories, and it will pave the way for the identification of different categories of tidal features in the vast samples of galaxies that forthcoming wide-field surveys will deliver.</description>

      <title>Repeating partial disruptions and two-body relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-body relaxation may drive stars onto near-radial orbits around a massive black hole, resulting in a tidal disruption event (TDE). In some circumstances, stars are unlikely to undergo a single terminal disruption, but rather to have a sequence of many grazing encounters with the black hole. It has long been unclear what is the physical outcome of this sequence: each of these encounters can only liberate a small amount of stellar mass, but may significantly alter the orbit of the star. We study the phenomenon of repeating partial tidal disruptions (pTDEs) by building a semi-analytical model that accounts for mass loss and tidal excitations. In the empty loss cone regime, where two-body relaxation is weak, we estimate the number of consecutive partial disruption that a star can undergo, on average, before being significantly affected by two-body encounters. We find that in this empty loss cone regime, a star will be destroyed in a sequence of weak pTDEs, possibly explaining the tension between the low observed TDE rate and its higher theoretical estimates.</description>

      <title>A robust test of general relativity at the galactic scales by combining strong lensing systems and gravitational wave standard sirens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The measurement of the parametrized post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma_{\rm{PPN}}$ is a robust test of general relativity (GR). In some modified theories of gravity, $\gamma_{\rm{PPN}}$ may evolve with the redshift and deviate from one at high redshifts. This means that precise constraints on $\gamma_{\rm{PPN}}$ acquired in the solar system experiments could not be sufficient to test such theories and it is necessary to constrain $\gamma_{\rm{PPN}}$with high precision at high redshifts. However, in many approaches aimed at extragalactic tests of GR, the results might be biased due to entanglement of various factors, such as cosmic curvature, cosmic opacity, and the Hubble constant. Strong lensing systems naturally provide a laboratory to test $\gamma_{\rm{PPN}}$ at galactic scales and high redshifts, but there is degeneracy between measured strength of gravity and cosmic distances in the lensing system. Gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron star mergers (standard sirens) provide a direct way to break this degeneracy by providing self-calibrated measurements of the luminosity distance. {We investigate the possibility of estimating $\gamma_{\rm{PPN}}$ by combining well measured strongly lensed systems with GW signals from coalescing neutron stars. Such combination provides a cosmological-model independent, relatively pure and unbiased method for the inference of $\gamma_{\rm{PPN}}$ parameter, avoiding the influence of the above factors and the mass-sheet degeneracy in the lens.} Based on the simulated future 55 lensed quasar systems we demonstrated that the precision of $\gamma_{\rm{PPN}}$ parameter obtained by our method could be of order of $\sim 10^{-2}$. One may reasonably expect that our approach will play an increasingly important role in precise testing the validity of general relativity at galactic scales and high redshifts.</description>

      <title>Constraining a disformal Schwarzschild black hole in DHOST theories with the orbit of the S2 star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the observed data of the S2 orbit around the black hole Sgr A$^*$ and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, we make a constraint on parameters of a disformal Schwarzschild black hole in quadratic degenerate higher-order scalartensor (DHOST) theories. This black hole belongs to a class of non-stealth solutions and owns an extra disformal parameter described the deviation from general relativity. Our results show that the best fit value of the disformal parameter is positive. However, in the range of $1\sigma$, we also find that general relativity remains to be consistent with the observation of the S2 orbit.</description>

      <title>Weak lensing combined with the kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect: A study of baryonic feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting precise cosmology from weak lensing surveys requires modelling the non-linear matter power spectrum, which is suppressed at small scales due to baryonic feedback processes. However, hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulations make widely varying predictions for the amplitude and extent of this effect. We use measurements of Dark Energy Survey Year 3 weak lensing (WL) and Atacama Cosmology Telescope DR5 kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) to jointly constrain cosmological and astrophysical baryonic feedback parameters using a flexible analytical model, `baryonification'. First, using WL only, we compare the $S_8$ constraints using baryonification to a simulation-calibrated halo model, a simulation-based emulator model and the approach of discarding WL measurements on small angular scales. We find that model flexibility can shift the value of $S_8$ and degrade the uncertainty. The kSZ provides additional constraints on the astrophysical parameters and shifts $S_8$ to $S_8=0.823^{+0.019}_{-0.020}$, a higher value than attained using the WL-only analysis. We measure the suppression of the non-linear matter power spectrum using WL + kSZ and constrain a mean feedback scenario that is more extreme than the predictions from most hydrodynamical simulations. We constrain the baryon fractions and the gas mass fractions and find them to be generally lower than inferred from X-ray observations and simulation predictions. We conclude that the WL + kSZ measurements provide a new and complementary benchmark for building a coherent picture of the impact of gas around galaxies across observations.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Clues: DESI, Dark Energy, and the Cosmological Constant Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several attempts to solve the cosmological constant problem, which concerns the value of the cosmological constant being extremely smaller than the Standard Model mass scales, have introduced a scalar field with a very flat potential that can be approximated as linear around any given position. The scalar field scans the cosmological constant in such a way that the current small value is explained. Recently, Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) reported the results of the first year. Combining the data with CMB, Pantheon, Union3, and/or DES-SN5YR, there is a preference or anomaly, indicating that the dark energy in the current Universe slightly deviates from that in the $\Lambda$CDM model and varies over time. In this paper, I show that the simple linear potential of a scalar field that may explain the small cosmological constant can explain the DESI anomaly. In particular, the model proposed by the present author in 2108.04246, which relaxes the cosmological constant by the condition that inflation ends, predicts a time-dependence of the dark energy close to the one favored by the data.</description>

      <title>Detection of Rydberg lines from the atmosphere of Betelgeuse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emission lines from Rydberg transitions are detected for the first time from a region close to the surface of Betelgeuse. The H30${\alpha}$ line is observed at 231.905 GHz, with a FWHM ~42 km/s and extended wings. A second line at 232.025 GHz (FWHM ~21 km/s), is modeled as a combination of Rydberg transitions of abundant low First Ionization Potential metals. Both H30${\alpha}$ and the Rydberg combined line X30${\alpha}$ are fitted by Voigt profiles, and collisional broadening with electrons may be partly responsible for the Lorentzian contribution, indicating electron densities of a few 10$^8$cm$^{-3}$. X30${\alpha}$ is located in a relatively smooth ring at a projected radius of 0.9x the optical photospheric radius R$_*$, whereas H30${\alpha}$ is more clumpy, reaching a peak at ~1.4R$_*$. We use a semi-empirical thermodynamic atmospheric model of Betelgeuse to compute the 232 GHz (1.29mm) continuum and line profiles making simple assumptions. Photoionized abundant metals dominate the electron density and the predicted surface of continuum optical depth unity at 232 GHz occurs at ~1.3R$_*$, in good agreement with observations. Assuming a Saha-Boltzmann distribution for the level populations of Mg, Si, and Fe, the model predicts that the X30${\alpha}$ emission arises in a region of radially-increasing temperature and turbulence. Inclusion of ionized C and non-LTE effects could modify the integrated fluxes and location of emission. These simulations confirm the identity of the Rydberg transition lines observed towards Betelgeuse, and reveal that such diagnostics can improve future atmospheric models.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter Simulations Using PopSyCLE</title>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs), theorized to have originated in the early universe, are speculated to be a viable form of dark matter. If they exist, they should be detectable through photometric and astrometric signals resulting from gravitational microlensing of stars in the Milky Way. Population Synthesis for Compact-object Lensing Events, or PopSyCLE, is a simulation code that enables users to simulate microlensing surveys, and is the first of its kind to include both photometric and astrometric microlensing effects, which are important for potential PBH detection and characterization. To estimate the number of observable PBH microlensing events we modify PopSyCLE to include a dark matter halo consisting of PBHs. We detail our PBH population model, and demonstrate our PopSyCLE + PBH results through simulations of the OGLE-IV and Roman microlensing surveys. We provide a proof-of-concept analysis for adding PBHs into PopSyCLE, and thus include many simplifying assumptions, such as $f_{\text{DM}}$, the fraction of dark matter composed of PBHs, and $\bar{m}_{\text{PBH}}$, mean PBH mass. Assuming $\bar{m}_{\text{PBH}}=30$ $M_{\odot}$, we find $\sim$ 3.6$f_{\text{DM}}$ times as many PBH microlensing events than stellar evolved black hole events, a PBH average peak Einstein crossing time of $\sim$ 91.5 days, estimate on order of $10^2f_{\text{DM}}$ PBH events within the 8 year OGLE-IV results, and estimate Roman to detect $\sim$ 1,000$f_{\text{DM}}$ PBH microlensing events throughout its planned microlensing survey.</description>

      <title>Eccentric Binaries in Retrograde Disks</title>

Abstract: Modern numerical hydrodynamics tools have recently enabled detailed examinations of binaries accreting from prograde circumbinary disks. These have re-framed the current understanding of binary-disk interactions and disk driven orbital evolution. We present the first full-domain grid-based hydrodynamics simulations of equal-mass, eccentric binaries accreting from retrograde circumbinary disks. We study binary eccentricities that span $e=0.0$ to $e = 0.8$ continuously, and explore the influence of retrograde accretion on the binary orbital response, disk morphology, and observational properties. We find that, at all eccentricities, retrograde accretion shrinks the binary semi-major axis and pumps its eccentricity leading to the previously identified possibility of highly eccentric mergers. Contrary to past studies and models, we observe gravitational forces to dominate the binary's orbital evolution as opposed to the physical accretion of mass and momentum. Retrograde accretion variability also differs strongly from prograde solutions. Preeminently, binaries with $e &gt; 0.55$ reveal a unique two-period, double-peaked accretion signature that has not previously been identified. We additionally find evidence for the emergence of retrograde Lindblad resonances at large eccentricities in accordance with predictions from linear theory. Our results suggest that some astrophysical binaries for which retrograde accretion is possible will experience factors-of-a-few times faster orbital decay than in prograde disks and will have their eccentricities pumped beyond the limits found from prograde solutions. Such effects could lead to rapid inward migration for some young stellar binaries, the detection of highly-eccentric LISA mergers, and the tentatively observed turnover at the low-frequency end of the gravitational wave background.</description>

      <title>Stellar Escape from Globular Clusters. II. Clusters May Eat Their Own Tails</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply for the first time the Monte Carlo star cluster modeling method to study tidal tail and stellar stream formation from globular clusters, assuming a circular orbit in a smooth Galactic potential. Approximating energetically unbound bodies (potential escapers; PEs) as collisionless enables this fast but spherically symmetric method to capture asymmetric tidal phenomena with unprecedented detail. Beyond reproducing known stream features, including epicyclic overdensities, we show how 'returning tidal tails' may form after the stream fully circumnavigates the Galaxy back to the cluster, enhancing the stream's velocity dispersion. While a realistically clumpy, time-dependent Galactic potential may disrupt such tails, they warrant scrutiny as potentially excellent constraints on the Galactic potential's history and substructure. Re-examining the escape timescale $\Delta t$ of PEs, we find new behavior related to chaotic scattering in the three-body problem; the $\Delta t$ distribution features sharp plateaus corresponding to distinct locally smooth patches of the chaotic saddle separating the phase space basins of escape. We study for the first time $\Delta t$ in an evolving cluster, finding that $\Delta t\sim(E_{\rm J}^{-0.1},E_{\rm J}^{-0.4})$ for PEs with (low, high) Jacobi energy $E_{\rm J}$, flatter than for a static cluster ($E_{\rm J}^{-2}$). Accounting for cluster mass loss and internal evolution -- and (roughly) for ongoing relaxation among PEs -- lowers the median $\Delta t$ from ${\sim}10\,$Gyr to ${\lesssim}100\,$Myr. We finally outline future improvements to escape physics in the Monte Carlo method intended to enable both the first large-parameter-space studies of tidal tail/stellar stream formation from full globular cluster simulations and detailed comparisons to stream observations.</description>

      <title>Beyond radial profiles: Using log-normal distributions to model the multiphase circumgalactic medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations and simulations reveal that the circumgalactic medium (CGM) surrounding galaxies is multiphase, with the gas temperatures spanning a wide range at most radii, $\sim 10^4\ {\rm K}$ to the virial temperature ($\sim 10^6$ K for Milky Way). Traditional CGM models using simple density profiles are inadequate at reproducing observations that indicate a broad temperature range. Alternatively, a model based on probability distribution functions (PDFs) with parameters motivated by simulations can better match multi-wavelength observations. In this work, we use log-normal distributions, commonly seen in the simulations of the multiphase interstellar and circumgalactic media, to model the multiphase CGM. We generalize the isothermal background model by Faerman et al. 2017 to include more general CGM profiles. We extend the existing probabilistic models from 1D-PDFs in temperature to 2D-PDFs in density-temperature phase space and constrain its parameters using a Milky Way-like {\tt Illustris TNG50-1} halo. We generate various synthetic observables such as column densities of different ions, UV/X-ray spectra, and dispersion and emission measures. X-ray and radio (Fast Radio Burst) observations mainly constrain the hot gas properties. However, interpreting cold/warm phase diagnostics is not straightforward since these phases are patchy, with inherent variability in intercepting these clouds along arbitrary lines of sight. We provide a tabulated comparison of model predictions with observations and plan to expand this into a comprehensive compilation of models and data. Our modeling provides a simple analytic framework that is useful for describing important aspects of the multiphase CGM.</description>

      <title>Radial acceleration relation of galaxies with joint kinematic and weak-lensing data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15248v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We combine kinematic and gravitational lensing data to construct the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) of galaxies over a large dynamic range. We improve on previous weak-lensing studies in two ways. First, we compute stellar masses using the same stellar population model as for the kinematic data. Second, we introduce a new method for converting excess surface density profiles to radial accelerations. This method is based on a new deprojection formula which is exact, computationally efficient, and gives smaller systematic uncertainties than previous methods. We find that the RAR inferred from weak-lensing data smoothly continues that inferred from kinematic data by about $2.5\,\mathrm{dex}$ in acceleration. Contrary to previous studies, we find that early- and late-type galaxies lie on the same joint RAR when a sufficiently strict isolation criterion is adopted and their stellar and gas masses are estimated consistently with the kinematic RAR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the Magellanic Corona, the warm gaseous halo around the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The Corona is a key ingredient in the formation of the Magellanic Stream (Lucchini et al. 2020, 2021) and has recently been observed in high-ion absorption around the LMC. In this work we present a suite of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations to constrain its total mass and temperature prior to the infall of the Magellanic Clouds to our Galaxy. We find that the LMC is able to host a stable Corona before and during its approach to the MW through to the present day. With a Magellanic Corona of $&gt;2\times10^9$ M$_\odot$ at $3\times10^5$ K, our simulations can reproduce the observed total mass of the neutral and ionized components of the Trailing Stream, size of the LMC disk, ionization fractions along the Stream, morphology of the neutral gas, and on-sky extent of the ionized gas. The Corona plays an integral role in the survival, morphology, and composition of the Magellanic Clouds and the Trailing Stream.</description>

      <title>JADES: A large population of obscured, narrow line AGN at high redshift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the identification of 42 narrow-line active galactic nuclei (type-2 AGN) candidates in the two deepest observations of the JADES spectroscopic survey with JWST/NIRSpec. The spectral coverage and the depth of our observations allow us to select narrow-line AGNs based on both rest-frame optical and UV emission lines up to z=10. Due to the metallicity decrease of galaxies, at $z&gt;3$ the standard optical diagnostic diagrams (N2-BPT or S2-VO87) become unable to distinguish many AGN from other sources of photoionisation. Therefore, we also use high ionisation lines, such as HeII$\lambda$4686, HeII$\lambda$1640, NeIV$\lambda$2422, NeV$\lambda$3420, and NV$\lambda$1240, also in combination with other UV transitions, to trace the presence of AGN. Out of a parent sample of 209 galaxies, we identify 42 type-2 AGN (although 10 of them are tentative), giving a fraction of galaxies in JADES hosting type-2 AGN of about $20\pm3$\%, which does not evolve significantly in the redshift range between 2 and 10. The selected type-2 AGN have estimated bolometric luminosities of $10^{41.3-44.9}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and host-galaxy stellar masses of $10^{7.2-9.3}$ M$_{\odot}$. The star formation rates of the selected AGN host galaxies are consistent with those of the star-forming main sequence. The AGN host galaxies at z=4-6 contribute $\sim$8-30 \% to the UV luminosity function, slightly increasing with UV luminosity.</description>

      <title>Classifying Intermediate Redshift Galaxies in SDSS: Alternative Diagnostic Diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17381v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We select a sample of 1,437 active galactic nuclei (AGN) from the catalog of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxy properties from the Portsmouth group by detection of the high-ionization [Ne V] 3426 \r{A} emission line. We compare the fluxes of [Ne III] 3869 \r{A}, [O III] 5007 \r{A}, [O II] 3726, 3728 \r{A}, and [O I] 6300 \r{A} to that of [Ne V]. All four lines show a strong linear correlation with [Ne V], although lines from ions with lower ionization potentials have a lower correlation coefficient. We investigate the use of two forbidden-line ratio (FLR) diagnostic diagrams that do not rely on H$\alpha$ in order to classify high redshift galaxies. These use the [Ne III]/[O II] line ratio plotted against [O III]/[O I] and [O III]/[O II] respectively. We use photo-ionization modeling to characterize the behavior of the narrow-line region in AGN and star-forming regions and test the validity of our diagnostic diagrams. We also use a luminosity cutoff of log L[OIII] [erg/s] = 42, which lowers the contamination of the AGN region by star-forming galaxies down to 10% but does not remove Green Pea and Purple Grape galaxies from the AGN region. We also investigate the OHNO diagram which uses [Ne III]/[O II] plotted against [O III]/H$\beta$. Using our new diagnostic diagrams, we are able to reliably classify AGN up to a redshift of z $\leq$ 1.06, and add more than 822 new AGN to the [Ne V]-selected AGN sample.</description>

      <title>Radio Emission from High-Redshift Active Galactic Nuclei in the JADES and CEERS Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent calculations indicate that radio emission from quasars at $z \sim$ 6 - 7 could be detected at much earlier stages of evolution, at $z \sim$ 14 - 15, by the Next-Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) and the Square Kilometer Array (SKA). However, the {\em James Webb Space Telescope} has now discovered less luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at $z &gt;$ 4 and a few massive black holes (BHs) at $z &gt;$ 10, which may be the progenitors of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) but at different stages of growth. Radio detections of these new AGNs would provide complementary measures of their properties and those of their host galaxies. Here we estimate radio flux densities for 19 new AGNs found by the JADES, CEERS and UNCOVER surveys. We find that ngVLA should be able to detect most of these sources in targeted surveys with integration times of 10 - 100 hr (and in just 1 hr for a few of them) but most would require at least 100 hr of SKA time in spite of its greater sensitivities at low frequencies. In some cases, radio emission from the BH can be distinguished from that of H II regions and supernovae in their host galaxies, which could be used to estimate their star formation rates. Such detections would be yet another example of the useful synergies between near infrared and radio telescopes in SMBH science in the coming decade.</description>

      <title>First Light and Reionization Epoch Simulations (FLARES) -- XV: The physical properties of super-massive black holes and their impact on galaxies in the early universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the co-evolution of super-massive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies remains a key challenge of extragalactic astrophysics, particularly the earliest stages at high-redshift. However, studying SMBHs at high-redshift with cosmological simulations, is challenging due to the large volumes and high-resolution required. Through its innovative simulation strategy, the First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom simulations allows us to simulate a much wider range of environments which contain SMBHs with masses extending to $M_{\bullet}&gt;10^{9}\ M_{\odot}$ at $z=5$. In this paper, we use FLARES to study the physical properties of SMBHs and their hosts in the early Universe ($5\le\, z \le10$). FLARES predicts a sharply declining density with increasing redshift, decreasing by a factor of 100 over the range $z=5\to 10$. Comparison between our predicted bolometric luminosity function and pre-\emph{JWST} observations yield a good match. However, recent \emph{JWST} observations appear to suggest a larger contribution of SMBHs than previously observed, or predicted by FLARES. Finally, by using a re-simulation with AGN feedback disabled, we explore the impact of AGN feedback on their host galaxies. This reveals that AGN feedback results in a reduction of star formation activity, even at $z&gt;5$, but only in the most massive galaxies. A deeper analysis reveals that AGN are also the cause of suppressed star formation in passive galaxies but that the presence of an AGN doesn't necessarily result in the suppression of star formation.</description>

      <title>First detection in space of the high-energy isomer of cyanomethanimine: H2CNCN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first detection in the interstellar medium of $N$-cyanomethanimine (H$_2$CNCN), the stable dimer of HCN of highest energy, and the most complex organic molecule identified in space containing the prebiotically relevant NCN backbone. We have identified a plethora of $a$-type rotational transitions with 3 $\leq J_\text{up} \leq$ 11 and $K_\text{a} \leq$ 2 that belong to this species towards the Galactic Center G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud, the only interstellar source showing the three cyanomethanimine isomers (including the $Z$- and $E$- isomers of $C$-cyanomethanimine, HNCHCN). We have derived a total column density for H$_2$CNCN of (2.9$\, \pm \,$0.1)$\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, which translates into a total molecular abundance with respect to H$_2$ of (2.1$\, \pm \,$0.3)$\times$10$^{-11}$. We have also revisited the previous detection of $E$- and $Z$-HNCHCN, and found a total $C/N$-cyanomethanimine abundance ratio of 31.8$\, \pm \,$1.8 and a $Z/E$-HNCHCN ratio of 4.5$\, \pm \,$0.2. While the latter can be explained on the basis of thermodynamic equilibrium, chemical kinetics are more likely responsible for the observed $C/N$-cyanomethanimine abundance ratio, where the gas-phase reaction between methanimine (CH$_2$NH) and the cyanogen radical (CN) arises as the primary formation route.</description>

      <title>The persistence of high altitude non-equilibrium diffuse ionized gas in simulations of star forming galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Widespread, high altitude, diffuse ionized gas with scale heights of around a kiloparsec is observed in the Milky Way and other star forming galaxies. Numerical radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a supernova-driven turbulent interstellar medium show that gas can be driven to high altitudes above the galactic midplane, but the degree of ionization is often less than inferred from observations. For computational expediency, ionizing radiation from massive stars is often included as a post-processing step assuming ionization equilibrium. We extend our simulations of a Milky Way-like interstellar medium to include the combined effect of supernovae and photoionization feedback from midplane OB stars and a population of hot evolved low mass stars. The diffuse ionized gas has densities below 0.1 ${\rm cm^{-3}}$, so recombination timescales can exceed millions of years. Our simulations now follow the time-dependent ionization and recombination of low density gas. The long recombination timescales result in diffuse ionized gas that persists at large altitudes long after the deaths of massive stars that produce the vast majority of the ionized gas. The diffuse ionized gas does not exhibit the large variability inherent in simulations that adopt ionization equilibrium. The vertical distribution of neutral and ionized gas is close to what is observed in the Milky Way. The volume filling factor of ionized gas increases with altitude resulting in the scale height of free electrons being larger than that inferred from H$\alpha$ emission, thus reconciling the observations of ionized gas made in H$\alpha$ and from pulsar dispersion measurements.</description>

      <title>Efficient formation of a massive quiescent galaxy at redshift 4.9</title>

Abstract: Within the established framework of structure formation, galaxies start as systems of low stellar mass and gradually grow into far more massive galaxies. The existence of massive galaxies in the first billion years of the Universe, suggested by recent observations, appears to challenge this model, as such galaxies would require highly efficient conversion of baryons into stars. An even greater challenge in this epoch is the existence of massive galaxies that have already ceased forming stars. However, robust detections of early massive quiescent galaxies have been challenging due to the coarse wavelength sampling of photometric surveys. Here we report the spectroscopic confirmation with the James Webb Space Telescope of the quiescent galaxy RUBIES-EGS-QG-1 at redshift $z=4.896$, 1.2 billion years after the Big Bang. Deep stellar absorption features in the spectrum reveal that the galaxy's stellar mass of $10^{10.9}\,M_\odot$, corroborated by the mass implied by its gas kinematics, formed in a short $340\,$Myr burst of star formation, after which star formation activity dropped rapidly and persistently. According to current galaxy formation models, systems with such rapid stellar mass growth and early quenching are too rare to plausibly occur in the small area probed spectroscopically with JWST. Instead, the discovery of RUBIES-EGS-QG-1 implies that early massive quiescent galaxies can be quenched earlier or exhaust gas available for star formation more efficiently than currently assumed.</description>

      <title>Disk induced binary precession: Implications for dynamics and multi-messenger observations of black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many studies have recently documented the orbital response of eccentric binaries accreting from thin circumbinary disks, characterizing the change in binary semi-major axis and eccentricity. We extend these calculations to include the precession of the binary's longitude of periapse induced by the circumbinary disk, and we characterize this precession continuously with binary eccentricity $e_b$ for equal mass components. This disk-induced apsidal precession is prograde with a weak dependence on binary eccentricity when $e_b \lesssim 0.4$ and decreases approximately linearly for $e_b \gtrsim 0.4$; yet at all $e_b$ binary precession is faster than the rates of change to the semi-major axis and eccentricity by an order of magnitude. We estimate that such precession effects are likely most important for sub-parsec separated binaries with masses $\lesssim 10^7 M_\odot$, like LISA precursors. We find that accreting, equal-mass LISA binaries with $M &lt; 10^6 M_\odot$ (and the most massive $M \sim 10^7 M_\odot$ binaries out to $z \sim 3$) may acquire a detectable phase offset due to the disk-induced precession. Moreover, disk-induced precession can compete with General Relativistic precession in vacuum, making it important for observer-dependent electromagnetic searches for accreting massive binaries -- like Doppler boost and binary self-lensing models -- after potentially only a few orbital periods.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Dependence of Microlensing Planet Frequency on The Host Star Mass and Galactocentric Distance by using a Galactic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We measure the dependence of planet frequency on host star mass, $M_{\rm L}$, and distance from the Galactic center, $R_{\rm L}$, using a sample of planets discovered by gravitational microlensing. We compare the two-dimensional distribution of the lens-source proper motion, $\mu_{\rm rel}$, and the Einstein radius crossing time, $t_{\rm E}$, measured for 22 planetary events from Suzuki et al. (2016) with the distribution expected from Galactic model. Assuming that the planet-hosting probability of a star is proportional to $M_{\rm L}^m R_{\rm L}^r$, we calculate the likelihood distribution of $(m,r)$. We estimate that $r = 0.10^{+0.51}_{-0.37}$ and $m = 0.50^{+0.90}_{-0.70}$ under the assumption that the planet-hosting probability is independent of the mass ratio. We also divide the planet sample into subsamples based on their mass ratio, $q$, and estimate that $m=-0.08^{+0.95}_{-0.65}$ for $q &lt; 10^{-3}$ and $1.25^{+1.07}_{-1.14}$ for $q &gt; 10^{-3}$. Although uncertainties are still large, this result implies a possibility that in orbits beyond the snowline, massive planets are more likely to exist around more massive stars whereas low-mass planets exist regardless of their host star mass.</description>

      <title>Kaleidoscope of irradiated disks: MUSE observations of proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster. I. Sample presentation and ionization front sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), protoplanetary disks exhibit ionized gas clouds in the form of a striking teardrop shape as massive stars irradiate the disk material. We present the first spatially and spectrally resolved observations of 12 proplyds, using Integral Field Spectroscopy observations performed with the MUSE instrument in Narrow Field Mode (NFM) on the VLT. We present the morphology of the proplyds in seven emission lines and measure the radius of the ionization front (I-front) of the targets in four tracers, covering transitions of different ionization states for the same element. We also derive stellar masses for the targets. The measurements follow a consistent trend of increasing I-front radius for a decreasing strength of the far-UV radiation as expected from photoevaporation models. By analyzing the ratios of the I-front radii as measured in the emission lines of Ha, [OI] 6300, [OII] 7330, and [OIII] 5007, we observe the ionization stratification, that is, the most ionized part of the flow being the furthest from the disk (and closest to the UV source). The ratios of I-front radii scale in the same way for all proplyds in our sample regardless of the incident radiation. We show that the stratification can help constrain the densities near the I-front by using a 1D photoionization model. We derive the upper limits of photoevaporative mass-loss rates by assuming ionization equilibrium, and estimate values decreasing towards lower impinging radiation. We do not find a correlation between Mloss and stellar mass. The highest mass-loss rate is for the proplyd 244-440. These values of Mloss, combined with estimates of the disk mass with ALMA, confirm previous estimates of the short lifetime of these proplyds. This work demonstrates the potential of this dataset and offers a new set of observables to be used to test current and future models of external photoevaporation.</description>
