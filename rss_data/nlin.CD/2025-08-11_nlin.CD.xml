      <title>Control of dynamical localization in atom-optics kicked rotor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.02820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atom-optics kicked rotor represents an experimentally realizable version of the paradigmatic quantum kicked rotor system. After a short initial diffusive phase the cloud settles down to a stationary state due to the onset of dynamical localization. In this work we realise an enhancement of localization by modification of the kick sequence. We experimentally implement the modification to this system in which the sign of the kick sequence is flipped by allowing for a free evolution of the wavepackets for half the Talbot time after every $M$ kicks. Depending on the value of $M$, this modified system displays a combination of enhanced diffusion followed by asymptotic localization. This is explained as resulting from two competing processes -- localization induced by standard kicked rotor type kicks, and diffusion induced by half Talbot time evolution. The evolving states display a localized but non-exponential wave function profiles. This provides another route to quantum control in kicked rotor class of systems. The numerical simulations agree well with the experimental results.</description>

      <title>NMR investigations of Dynamical Tunneling in Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12350v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the usual quantum tunneling, a low-energy quantum particle penetrates across a physical barrier of higher potential energy, by traversing a classically forbidden region, and finally escapes into another region. In an analogous scenario, a classical particle inside a closed regular region in the phase space is dynamically bound from escaping to other regions of the phase space. Here, the physical potential barrier is replaced by dynamical barriers which separate different regions of the phase space. However, in the quantum regime, the system can overcome such dynamical barriers and escape through them, giving rise to dynamical tunneling. In chaotic Hamiltonian systems, dynamical tunneling refers to quantum tunneling between states whose classical limit correspond to symmetry-related regular regions separated by a chaotic zone between which any classical transport is prohibited. Here, an experimental realization of dynamical tunneling in spin systems is reported using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) architecture. In particular, dynamical tunneling in quantum kicked tops of spin-1 and spin-3/2 systems using two- and three-qubit NMR registers is investigated. By extracting time-dependent expectation values of the angular momentum operator components, size-dependent tunneling behaviour for various initial states is systematically investigated. Further, by monitoring the adverse effects of dephasing noise on the tunneling oscillations, we assert the importance of quantum coherence in enabling dynamical tunneling.</description>

      <title>Chaos and localized phases in a two-body linear kicked rotor system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08899v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the periodic kicks, a linear kicked rotor (LKR) is an integrable and exactly solvable model in which the kinetic energy term is linear in momentum. It was recently shown that spatially interacting LKRs are also integrable, and results in dynamical localization in the corresponding quantum regime. Similar localized phases exist in other non-integrable models such as the coupled relativistic kicked rotors. This work, using a two-body LKR, demonstrates two main results; firstly, it is shown that chaos can be induced in the integrable linear kicked rotor through interactions between the momenta of rotors. An analytical estimate of its Lyapunov exponent is obtained. Secondly, the quantum dynamics of this chaotic model, upon variation of kicking and interaction strengths, is shown to exhibit a variety of phases -- classically induced localization, dynamical localization, subdiffusive and diffusive phases. We point out the signatures of these phases from the perspective of entanglement production in this system. By defining an effective Hilbert space dimension, the entanglement growth rate can be understood using appropriate random matrix averages.</description>

      <title>Periodicity of dynamical signatures of chaos in quantum kicked top</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03795v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A host of dynamical measures of quantum correlations -- out-of-time ordered correlators (OTOC), Loschmidt echo, generalized entanglement and observational entropy -- are useful to infer the underlying classical chaotic dynamics in quantum regime. In this work, these measures are employed to analyse quantum kicked top with kick strength $k$. It is shown that, despite the differences in their definitions, these measures are periodic with $k$, and the periodicity depends on the number of spins represented by the kicked top. The periodic behaviour arises from the structure of the kicked top Floquet operator and spans the regime in which the corresponding classical dynamics is predominantly chaotic. We also point to the reflection symmetry in Loschmidt echo and a special case of time periodicity in OTOC. This result can guide experiments towards the right choice of kick strengths to avoid repetitive dynamics.</description>

      <title>Amplitude Amplification and Estimation using a Floquet system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13211v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum kicked rotor (QKR) is a fundamental model of time-dependent quantum chaos and the physics of Anderson localization. It is one of the most well-studied Floquet systems. In this work, it is shown that QKR can be used to implement a quantum algorithm to perform unstructured search; namely Amplitude Amplification, a generalization of Grover's search algorithm. Further, the QKR is employed for amplitude estimation when the amplitude of the marked states is unknown. It is also shown that the characteristic property of dynamical localization of the QKR can be exploited to enhance the performance of the amplitude amplification algorithm by reducing its average runtime. The sensitivity of the success probability of unstructured search to detuning from resonance and the effects of noisy kick strengths are analyzed and the robustness of the QKR based algorithm is demonstrated. The experimental feasibility of every component of the algorithm is discussed.</description>

      <title>Dichotomy in the effect of chaos on ergotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16587v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The maximum unitarily extractable work from a quantum system -- ergotropy -- is the basic principle behind quantum batteries, a rapidly emerging field. This work studies ergotropy in two quantum chaotic systems, the quantum kicked top and the kicked Ising spin chain, to illustrate the effects of chaotic dynamics. In an ancilla-assisted scenario, chaos enhances ergotropy when the state is known, a consequence of large entanglement production in the chaotic regime. When the state is unknown, we need to at least partially characterize the state using coarse-grained measurements for useful extraction of work. In this case, chaos impedes ergotropy by suppressing information gained from coarse-grained measurements, while entanglement with an ancilla still facilitates ergotropy. In this scenario, we study the interplay between chaos and entanglement and find a sweet spot in the chaos parameter for optimal work. Our results point to the potential of quantum chaos-assisted batteries for better work extraction.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov stability analysis of the chaotic flow past two square cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of the flow past two side-by-side square cylinders (at Reynolds number 200 and gap ratio 1) using tools from dynamical systems theory. The flow is highly irregular due to the complex interaction between the flapping jet emanating from the gap and the vortices shed in the wake. We first perform Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD) to understand the flow characteristics. We then conduct Lyapunov stability analysis by linearizing the Navier-Stokes equations around the irregular base flow and find that it has two positive Lyapunov exponents. The Covariant Lyapunov Vectors (CLVs) are also computed. Contours of the time-averaged CLVs reveal that the footprint of the leading CLV is in the near-wake, whereas the other CLVs peak further downstream, indicating distinct regions of instability. SPOD of the two unstable CLVs is then employed to extract the dominant coherent structures and oscillation frequencies in the tangent space. For the leading CLV, the two dominant frequencies match closely with the prevalent frequencies in the drag coefficient spectrum, and correspond to instabilities due to vortex shedding and jet-flapping. The second unstable CLV captures the subharmonic instability of the shedding frequency. Global linear stability analysis (GLSA) of the time-averaged flow identifies a neutral eigenmode that resembles the leading SPOD mode of the first CLV, with a very similar structure and frequency. However, while GLSA predicts neutrality, Lyapunov analysis reveals that this direction is unstable, exposing the inherent limitations of the GLSA when applied to chaotic flows.</description>

      <title>Topological edge states and amplitude-dependent delocalization in quasiperiodic elliptically geared lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a class of mechanical lattices based on elliptical gears with quasiperiodic modulation and geometric nonlinearity, capable of exhibiting topologically protected modes and amplitude-driven transitions. Starting from a one-dimensional chain of modulated elliptical gears, we demonstrate the emergence of localized edge states arising from quasiperiodic variation in the gears' moments of inertia, analogous to the topological edge modes of the Aubry-Andre-Harper model. Under increasing excitation amplitude, the system undergoes a nonlinear transition, where edge localization breaks down and energy delocalizes into the bulk. By coupling multiple such chains with varying modulation phase, we construct a two-dimensional lattice in which the phase acts as a synthetic dimension. This structure supports topological wave propagation along the synthetic dimension. Nonlinearity again induces a breakdown of topological states, leading to complex, amplitude-dependent wave propagation. We further propose a numerical continuation approach to analyzing the periodic orbits and their linear stability, effectively discovering the boundary of the basin of bounded motion and detecting the occurrence of delocalization under certain excitation amplitudes. Our results reveal that elliptical geared systems offer a passive, amplitude-dependent platform for exploring topological phenomena and synthetic dimensionality in mechanical metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Chaos in Nonequilibrium Two-Temperature $(T_x, T_y)$ Nos\'e-Hoover Cell Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10863v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit a two-temperature Nos\'e-Hoover wanderer particle embedded in a two-dimensional periodic 2x2 cell with four smooth repulsive corners at $(x,y) = (\pm 1, \pm 1)$ to explore chaos with anisotropic thermostatting. The model employs separate thermostats in the x and y directions, enabling controlled deviations from equilibrium. By integrating the full six-dimensional equations of motion and computing the complete Lyapunov spectrum, we confirm chaos and quantify phase-space contraction with high numerical precision. The total contraction rate, interpreted as entropy production, increases nonlinearly with the thermostat anisotropy, deviating from the quadratic dependence expected from linear-response theory, $\Lambda\propto -\delta^{2}$. We compare two fits for $\Lambda$ as a function of $\delta = 0.5 -T_y$: 1) a power law, $\Lambda\propto -\delta^{2.44}$, 2) a quadratic-plus-quartic expansion. While the former captures low-driving behavior slightly better, the latter more accurately describes the strongly driven regime and remains consistent with the equilibrium limit. An empirical linear relation between dissipation and phase-space dimensionality loss is also identified, $\Lambda\propto (D_{KY}-6) / 3$, where $D_{KY}$ is the approximate Kaplan-Yorke dimension. Our results demonstrate that nonlinear dissipation scaling emerges naturally even in minimal driven systems. Momentum statistics show significant non-Gaussian behavior under strong driving. Despite its dissipative nature, the model remains strictly time-reversible, offering a pedagogically rich example of microscopic reversibility coexisting with macroscopic entropy production.</description>
