      <title>The Bose-Hubbard polaron from weak to strong coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the zero-temperature properties of a mobile impurity immersed in a bath of bosonic particles confined to a square lattice. We analyze the regimes of attractive and repulsive coupling between the impurity and the bath particles for different strengths of boson-boson interactions in the bath, using exact large-scale quantum Monte-Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble. For weak coupling, the polaron mass ratio is found to decrease around the Mott insulator (MI) to superfluid (SF) transition of the bath, as predicted by recent theory, confirming the possible use of the impurity as a probe for the transition. For strong coupling in the MI regime, instead, the impurity is found to modify the bath density by binding to an extra bath particle or a hole, depending on the sign of the polaron-bath interactions. While the binding prevent the aforementioned use of the polaron mass ratio as an MI-SF transition probe, we show that it can be used instead as a probe of the binding itself. Our exact numerical results provide a benchmark for comparing lattice Bose polaron theories and are relevant for experiments with cold atoms trapped in optical lattices, where the presence of a confining harmonic potential can be modeled by a slowly varying local chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Two-photon-assisted collisions in ultracold gases of polar molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical formalism to treat the ultracold dynamics of a pair of colliding polar molecules submitted to two laser fields. We express the dressed Hamiltonian including the dipole-dipole interaction of the colliding molecular pair, both in their ground and electronic excited states, as well as their interaction with the two laser fields. We apply adiabatic elimination of the electronic excited state to reduce the size of the dressed-state basis in which the dressed Hamiltoninan is expressed. In an application, we investigate the feasibility of two-photon collisional shielding between two \NaK molecules, which could be favored by the Raman resonance condition suppressing unwanted spontaneous emission and photon scattering. We demonstrate the influence of the laser Rabi frequencies on the dynamics through the computation of elastic, inelastic, and reactive collision rates.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of Fermi's Golden Rule in 1d systems at non-zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In interacting quantum systems, the single-particle Green's function is expected to decay in time due to the interaction induced decoherence of quasiparticles. In the limit of weak interaction strengths ($\Delta$), a naive application of Fermi's Golden Rule (FGR) predicts an $\mathcal{O}(\Delta^{2})$ quasiparticle decay rate. However, for 1d fermions on the lattice at $T&gt;0$, this calculation gives a divergent result and the scaling of the quasiparticle lifetime with interaction strength remains an open question. In this work we propose a solution to this question: combining numerical simulations using the recently introduced dissipation-assisted operator evolution (DAOE) method, with non-perturbative diagrammatic re-summations, we predict a logarithmic enhancement of the quasiparticle decay rate $\tau^{-1} \sim \Delta^{2} \log \Delta^{-2}$. We argue that this effect is present in a wide variety of well-known weakly interacting quantum fermionic and bosonic systems, and even in some classical systems, provided the non-interacting limit has quasiparticles with a generic dispersion.</description>

      <title>Localized states and skin effect around non-Hermitian impurities in tight-binding models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the generalized Bloch theorem formalism of Alase {\it et al.} [{\it Phys. Rev. Lett.} {\bf 117} 076804 (2016)] to analyze simple one-dimensional tight-binding lattice systems connected by Hermitian bonds (all with the same hopping parameter $t$), but containing one bond impurity which can be either Hermitian or non-Hermitian. We calculate the band structure, the bulk-boundary correspondence indicator ($D_L(\epsilon)$) and analyze the eigenvalues of the lattice translation operator ($z$), for each eigenstate. From the $z$ values the generalized Brillouin zone can be reconstructed. If the impurity is Hermitian (and $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric), we find a parameter regime in which two localized edge states separate from the tight-binding band. We then simulate a non-Hermitian impurity by keeping hopping in one direction of the bond impurity the same as the rest of the tight-binding system, and varying only its reciprocal. Again, we find a region with localized edge states, but in this case the energy eigenvalues are purely imaginary. We also find that in this case the two zero energy eigenvectors coalesce, hence this system is an exceptional line. We then perform an interpolative scan between the above two scenarios and find that there is an intermediate region exhibiting a non-Hermitian skin effect. In this region a macroscopic fraction of states acquire complex energy eigenvalues and exhibit localization towards the impurity. Our numerical results are supported by a detailed analysis of the solutions of the boundary/impurity equation.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous emission as a bridge from Lindbladian to nonreciprocal reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an out-of-equilibrium quantum system in which a state connecting two reservoirs is also coupled by stimulated and spontaneous emission of photons to an antitrapped state, thus implementing particle loss. After revisiting the spontaneous emission process, we show that the proper effective description of such a system requires one to go beyond the usual Lindbladian formalism and includes a nonreciprocal (``non-Hermitian'') coupling to the reservoir modeling the untrapped state. The presence of both, the reservoirs and the nonreciprocal coupling, have observable consequences that we compute, for example, by looking at the quantum Zeno effect in the loss current. We discuss the connection of our findings to possible experiments in cold atomic gases.</description>

      <title>Beyond Conventional Pairing: Bosonic Quartic Superfluidity, Exotic XY Magnetism, and Phase Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01125v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report two unprecedented bosonic quartic superfluid (BQSF) phases in binary boson mixtures with synthetic pair-hopping (SPH) interaction realizable through Floquet engineering, transcending the conventional bosonic superfluidity paradigm via high-order correlations. Through extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate: (i) The paired super-counter-fluid (PSCF) phase that exhibits bosonic 'four-particle' correlations, directly mirroring fermionic 4e superconductivity; (ii) The symbiotic super-counter-fluid which is an anomalous quantum phase featuring intrinsically intertwined, non-zero PSCF and super-counter-fluid orders. Both phases further reveal unreported pseudo-spin-ordered XY ferromagnetic states with filling-dependent magnetization textures. Adjacent to BQSF phases, we uncover both a previously unreported quantum quadruple critical point induced by interexchange asymmetry and SPH-driven state-dependent criticality-the latter exhibiting distinct behavior from conventional two-component bosonic systems. We propose momentum-resolved noise correlation spectroscopy-building on established quantum gas microscopy techniques-as a direct probe for the characteristic signatures of these BQSF states. Our results establish a new paradigm in quantum matter, opening unprecedented avenues to explore (i) quartic quantum coherence, (ii) emergent collective phenomena, and (iii) extended XY magnetism-resolving a longstanding classification challenge while discove</description>

      <title>Spatially-periodic states in a strongly dipolar $^{164}$Dy-$^{162}$Dy mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the formation of a novel eigenstate in a strongly dipolar binary $^{164}$Dy-$^{162}$Dy mixture, where the inter- and intraspecies dipolar lengths are larger than the corresponding scattering lengths. When this mixture is confined by a quasi-two-dimensional harmonic trap, the total density exhibits the formation of droplets on a spatially-symmetric triangular or square lattice, where each droplet is formed of a single species of atoms; two types of atoms never exist on the same lattice site. The density of any of the species shows a partially-filled incomplete lattice, only the total density exhibits a completely full lattice structure. In this theoretical investigation we employ the numerical solution of an improved mean-field model including a Lee-Huang-Yang-type interaction in the intraspecies components alone, meant to stop a collapse of the atoms at high atom density.</description>

      <title>Topological quantum thermometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An optimal local quantum thermometer is a quantum many-body system that saturates the fundamental lower bound for the thermal state temperature estimation accuracy [L. Correa, et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 220405 (2015)]. Such a thermometer has a particular energy level structure with a single ground state and highly degenerated excited states manifold, with an energy gap proportional to the estimated temperature. In this work, we show that the optimal local quantum thermometer can be realized in an experimentally feasible system of spinless fermions confined in a one-dimensional optical lattice described by the Rice-Mele model. We characterize the system's sensitivity to temperature changes in terms of quantum Fisher information and the classical Fisher information obtained from experimentally available site occupation measurements.</description>

      <title>Observation of anomalous information scrambling in a Rydberg atom array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum information scrambling, which describes the propagation and effective loss of localinformation, is crucial for understanding the dynamics of quantum many-body systems. We report the observation of anomalous information scrambling in an atomic tweezer array with dominant van der Waals interaction. We characterize information spreading by an out-of-time-order correlator and observe persistent oscillations inside a suppressed linear light cone for the initial Neel state. Such an anomalous dynamic, which differs from both generic thermal and many-body localized scenarios, originates from weak ergodicity breaking in quantum many-body scarred systems.</description>

      <title>Quantifying two-mode entanglement of bosonic Gaussian states from their full counting statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement properties of two-mode bosonic Gaussian states based on their multi-mode counting statistics. We exploit the idea that measuring high-order correlations of particle numbers can reveal entanglement without making any assumptions about the coherence of the fields. We show that the two- and four-body number correlations are sufficient to fully characterize the entanglement of two-mode bosonic Gaussian states for which each mode exhibits a thermal distribution. In addition, we derive an entanglement witness based on two-body correlations alone. Our findings are of great importance because it becomes possible to reveal entanglement in a series of recent experiments.</description>
