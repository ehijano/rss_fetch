      <title>Comparing the $\mathrm{v}$-number and $h$-polynomials of edge ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we compare the $\mathrm{v}$-numbers and the degree of the $h$-polynomials associated with edge ideals of connected graphs. We prove that the $\mathrm{v}$-number can be arbitrarily larger or smaller than the degree of the $h$-polynomial for the edge ideal of a connected graph. We also establish that for any pair of positive integers $(v,d)$ with $v \leq d$, there exists a connected graph $H(v,d)$ with the $\mathrm{v}$-number equal to $v$ and the degree of $h$-polynomial equal to $d$. Additionally, we show that the sum of the $\mathrm{v}$-number and the degree of the $h$-polynomial is bounded above by $n$, the number of vertices of $G$, and we classify all graphs for which this sum is exactly $n$. Finally, we show that all thirteen possible inequalities among the three invariants, the $\mathrm{v}$-number, the degree of the $h$-polynomial, and the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, can occur in the case of edge ideals of connected graphs. Many of these examples rely on a minimal example of a graph whose $\mathrm{v}$-number is more than the degree of its $h$-polynomial. Using a computer search, we show that there are exactly two such graphs on 11 vertices and 25 edges, and no smaller example on fewer vertices, or 11 vertices and less than 25 edges.</description>

      <title>On jet closures of singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The jet closure and jet support closure were first introduced by de Fernex, Ein and Ishii to solve the local isomorphism problem. In this paper, we introduce two local algebras associated to jet closure and jet support closure respectively. We show that these two algebras are invariants of the singularities. We compute and investigate these invariants for some interesting cases, such as the cases of monomial ideals and homogeneous ideals. We also introduce a new filtration and jet index to jet closures. The jet index describes which jet scheme recover the information of base scheme. Moreover, we obtain some properties of the jet index.
  Keywords:jet closure, jet support closure and filtration.</description>

      <title>A Formalization of Divided Powers in Lean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an ideal $I$ in a commutative ring $A$, a divided power structure on $I$ is a collection of maps $\{\gamma_n \colon I \to A\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$, subject to axioms that imply that it behaves like the family $\{x \mapsto \frac{x^n}{n!}\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$, but which can be defined even when division by factorials is not possible in $A$. Divided power structures have important applications in diverse areas of mathematics, including algebraic topology, number theory and algebraic geometry.
  In this article we describe a formalization in Lean 4 of the basic theory of divided power structures, including divided power morphisms and sub-divided power ideals, and we provide several fundamental constructions, in particular quotients and sums. This constitutes the first formalization of this theory in any theorem prover.
  As a prerequisite of general interest, we expand the formalized theory of multivariate power series rings, endowing them with a topology and defining evaluation and substitution of power series.</description>

      <title>Maximal Cohen-Macaulay DG-Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative noetherian local differential graded (DG) ring. In this paper we propose a definition of a maximal Cohen-Macaulay DG-complex over $R$ that naturally generalizes a maximal Cohen-Macaulay complex over a noetherian local ring, as studied by Iyengar, Ma, Schwede, and Walker. Our proposed definition extends the work of Shaul on Cohen-Macaulay DG-rings and DG-modules, as any maximal Cohen-Macaulay DG-module is a maximal Cohen-Macaulay DG-complex. After proving necessary lemmas in derived commutative algebra, we establish the existence of a maximal Cohen-Macaulay DG-complex for every DG-ring with constant amplitude that admits a dualizing DG-module. We then use the existence of these DG-complexes to establish a derived Improved New Intersection Theorem for all DG-rings with constant amplitude.</description>

      <title>On the axioms for a unique factorization domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the growing evolution of the theory of non-unique factorization in integral domains and monoids, the study of several variations to the classical unique factorization domain (or UFD) property have become popular in the literature. Using one of these variations, the length-factorial property, it can be shown that part of the standard classical axioms used in the definition of a UFD is essentially superfluous.</description>

      <title>Invariants that are covering spaces and their Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a previous paper by the author a universal ring of invariants for algebraic structures of a given type was constructed. This ring is a polynomial algebra that is generated by certain trace diagrams. It was shown that this ring admits the structure of a rational positive self adjoint Hopf algebra (abbreviated rational PSH-algebra), and was conjectured that it always admits a lattice that is a PSH-algebra, a structure that was introduced by Zelevinsky. In this paper we answer this conjecture, showing that the universal ring of invariants splits as the tensor product of rational PSH-algebras that are either polynomial algebras in a single variable, or admit a lattice that is a PSH-algebra. We do so by considering diagrams as topological spaces, and using tools from the theory of covering spaces. As an application we derive a formula that connects Kronecker coefficients with finite index subgroups of free groups and representations of their Weyl groups, and a formula for the number of conjugacy classes of finite index subgroup in a finitely generated group that admits a surjective homomorphism onto the group of integers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11845v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These notes aim to develop a tool for constructing polynomial differential $p$-forms vanishing on prescribed loci through syzygies of homogeneous ideals. Examples are provided through implementing this method in Macaulay2, particularly examples of instanton bundles of charges $4$ and $5$ on $\mathbb{P}^3$ that arise in this construction.</description>

      <title>Positivity preservers over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00222v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We resolve an algebraic version of Schoenberg's celebrated theorem [Duke Math.J., 1942] characterizing entrywise matrix transforms that preserve positive definiteness. Compared to the classical real and complex settings, we consider matrices with entries in a finite field and obtain a complete characterization of such preservers for matrices of a fixed dimension. When the dimension of the matrices is at least $3$, we prove that, surprisingly, the positivity preservers are precisely the positive multiples of the field's automorphisms. We also obtain characterizations of preservers for matrices of dimension $2$ over a finite field with $q$ elements, unless $q \equiv 1 \pmod 4$ and $q$ is not a square. Our proofs build on several novel connections between positivity preservers and field automorphisms via the works of Weil, Carlitz, and Muzychuk-Kov\'acs, and via the structure of cliques in Paley graphs.</description>

      <title>Exploring the unleaved tree of numerical semigroups up to a given genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm to explore or count the numerical semigroups of a given genus which uses the unleaved version of the tree of numerical semigroups. In the unleaved tree there are no leaves rather than the ones at depth equal to the genus in consideration. For exloring the unleaved tree we present a new encoding system of a numerical semigroup given by the gcd of its left elements and its shrinking, that is, the semigroup generated by its left elements divided by their gcd. We show a method to determine the right generators and strong generators of a semigroup by means of the gcd and the shrinking encoding, as well as a method to encode a semigroup from the encoding of its parent or of its predecessor sibling. With the new algorithm we obtained $n_{76}=29028294421710227$ and $n_{77}=47008818196495180$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the discriminant of a polynomial, which we call the tolerant. The tolerant differs by a square from the duplicant, which was discovered in recent work on $\mathbb{P}^1$-loop spaces in motivic homotopy theory. We show that the tolerant is rational by deriving a formula in terms of discriminants. We also show that the tolerant satisfies many of the same properties as the discriminant. A notable difference between the two is that the discriminant is inversion invariant for all polynomials, whereas the tolerant is only inversion invariant on a proper multiplicative subset of polynomials.</description>
