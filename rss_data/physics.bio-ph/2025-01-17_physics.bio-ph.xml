      <title>On the First-Passage Time Fluctuation Theorem in Complex Biomolecular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fluctuation theorem is examined for the first-passage time of a biomolecular machine in a nonequilibrium steady-state. For such machines in which the driven, observable process is coupled to a hidden process in a kinetically cooperative fashion, the entropy produced along first-passage trajectories is no longer uniform, resulting in a breakdown of this relation. Here, we consider the canonical model for this type of system, a kinetic scheme for conformation-modulated single-enzyme catalysis, as we (i) determine the circumstances under which this fluctuation theorem can be restored; (ii) assess what its violation reveals about the hidden dynamics; and (iii) characterize the general form of the deviation from this relation. Kinetic evaluations are performed using a novel, efficient pathway analysis technique, allowing us to attain some surprising and fairly straightforward results from relatively complex calculations. We find that in the absence of hidden current, a fluctuation theorem can be written for the first-passage time of the observable process, and we demonstrate that this is a general feature applicable to a wide variety of complex networks. The validity of this relation can be experimentally tested, with its violation serving as a signature of hidden detailed balance breaking. In addition, we obtain a remarkably compact exact expression for the integrated correction to this first-passage time fluctuation theorem, which indicates that the kinetic branching ratio, defined as the ratio of the forward observable process probability to the backward one, is bounded by the entropy production associated with the first-passage work (i.e., the work applied along a first-passage trajectory). These results provide detailed insight into the rich connections between dynamic measurements and the underlying nonequilibrium thermodynamics in complex biomolecular networks.</description>

      <title>The sleeping bacterium: shedding light on the resuscitation mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The revival mechanism in dormant bacteria is a puzzling and open issue. We propose a model of information diffusion on a regular grid where agents represent bacteria and their mutual interactions implement quorum sensing. Agents may have different metabolic characteristics corresponding to multiple phenotypes. The intra/inter phenotype cooperation is analyzed under different metabolic and productivity conditions. We study the interactions between rapidly reproducing active bacteria and non-reproducing quiescent bacteria. We highlight the conditions under which the quiescent bacteria may revive. The occurrence of revival is generally related to a change in environmental conditions. Our results support this picture showing that revival can be mediated by the presence of different catalyst bacteria that produce the necessary resources .</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Microscale Drying of Plant-Based Foods: A Systematic Review of Computational Models and Experimental Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review examines the current state of research on microscale cellular changes during the drying of plant-based food materials (PBFM), with particular emphasis on computational modelling approaches. The review addresses the critical need for advanced computational methods in microscale investigations. We systematically analyse experimental studies in PBFM drying, highlighting their contributions and limitations in capturing cellular-level phenomena, including challenges in data acquisition and measurement accuracy under varying drying conditions. The evolution of computational models for microstructural investigations is thoroughly examined, from traditional numerical methods to contemporary state-of-the-art approaches, with specific focus on their ability to handle the complex, nonlinear properties of plant cellular materials. Special attention is given to the emergence of data-driven models and their limitations in predicting microscale cellular behaviour during PBFM drying, particularly addressing challenges in dataset acquisition and model generalization. The review provides an in-depth analysis of Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) frameworks, examining their theoretical foundations, current applications in related fields, and unique advantages in combining physical principles with neural network architectures. Through this comprehensive assessment, we identify critical gaps in existing methodologies, evaluate the trade-offs between different modelling approaches, and provide insights into future research directions for improving our understanding of cellular-level transformations during PBFM drying processes. The review concludes with recommendations for integrating experimental and computational approaches to advance the field of food preservation technology.</description>

      <title>Generative diffusion model with inverse renormalization group flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models represent a class of generative models that produce data by denoising a sample corrupted by white noise. Despite the success of diffusion models in computer vision, audio synthesis, and point cloud generation, so far they overlook inherent multiscale structures in data and have a slow generation process due to many iteration steps. In physics, the renormalization group offers a fundamental framework for linking different scales and giving an accurate coarse-grained model. Here we introduce a renormalization group-based diffusion model that leverages multiscale nature of data distributions for realizing a high-quality data generation. In the spirit of renormalization group procedures, we define a flow equation that progressively erases data information from fine-scale details to coarse-grained structures. Through reversing the renormalization group flows, our model is able to generate high-quality samples in a coarse-to-fine manner. We validate the versatility of the model through applications to protein structure prediction and image generation. Our model consistently outperforms conventional diffusion models across standard evaluation metrics, enhancing sample quality and/or accelerating sampling speed by an order of magnitude. The proposed method alleviates the need for data-dependent tuning of hyperparameters in the generative diffusion models, showing promise for systematically increasing sample efficiency based on the concept of the renormalization group.</description>

      <title>Bacterial proliferation pattern formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacteria can form a great variety of spatially heterogeneous cell density patterns, ranging from simple concentric rings to dynamical spiral waves appearing in growing colonies. These pattern formation phenomena are important as they reflect how cellular processes such as metabolism operate in heterogeneous chemical environments. In the laboratory, they can be studied in simplified set-ups, where spatial gradients of oxygen and nutrients are externally imposed, and cells are immobilized in a gel matrix. An intriguing example, observed in such set-ups over 80 years ago, is the sequential formation of narrow bands of high cell density, taking place even for a clonal population. However, key aspects of the dynamics of band formation remained obscure. Using time-lapse imaging of replicate transparent columns in simplified growth media, we first quantify the precision of the positioning and timing of band formation. We also show that the appearance and position of different bands can be modulated independently. This "modularity" is suggested by the observation that different bands differ in their gene expression, and it is reproduced by a theoretical model based on the existence of internal metabolic states and the induction of a pH gradient. Finally, we can also modify the observed pattern formation by introducing genetic modifications that impair selected metabolic pathways. In our opinion, the possibility of precise measurements and controls, together with the simplicity and richness of the "proliferation pattern formation" phenomenon, can make it a model system to study the response of cellular processes to heterogeneous environments.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Models for Tension-Dependent DNA Looping Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The influence of tension on DNA looping has been studied both experimentally and theoretically in the past. However, different theoretical models have yielded different predictions, leaving uncertainty about their validity. We briefly review the predictions of those models and propose a novel model that demonstrates exceptional agreement with simulations for long semiflexible chains. Additionally, we elucidate the relationship between our result and that of the previously proposed two-state model, highlighting the distinct interpretative approach that underpins our framework. Our findings offer predictive insights that pave the way for future experimental validation.</description>

      <title>Active contacts create controllable friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sliding friction between two dry surfaces is reasonably described by the speed-independent Amonton-Coulomb friction force law. However, there are many situations where the frictional contact points between two surfaces are "active" and may not all be moving at the same relative speed. In this work we study the sliding friction properties of a system with multiple active contacts each with independent and controllable speed. We demonstrate that multiple active contacts can produce controllable speed-dependent sliding friction forces, despite each individual contact exhibiting a speed-independent friction. We study in experiment a rotating carousel with ten speed-controlled wheels in frictional contact with the ground. We first vary the contact speeds and demonstrate that the equilibrium system speed is the median of the active contact speeds. Next we directly measure the ground reaction forces and observe how the contact speeds can control the force-speed curve of the system. In the final experiments we demonstrate how control of the force-speed curve can create sliding friction with a controllable effective viscosity and controllable sliding friction coefficient. Surprisingly, we are able to demonstrate that frictional contacts can create near frictionless sliding with appropriate force-speed control. By revealing how active contacts can shape the force-speed behavior of dry sliding friction systems we can better understand animal and robot locomotion, and furthermore open up opportunities for new engineered surfaces to control sliding friction.</description>

      <title>Markov-type state models to describe non-Markovian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When clustering molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories into a few metastable conformational states, the Markov state models (MSMs) assumption of timescale separation between fast intrastate fluctuations and rarely occurring interstate transitions is often not valid. Hence, the naive estimation of the macrostate transition matrix via simply counting transitions between the states leads to significantly too short implied timescales and thus to too fast population decays. In this work, we discuss advanced approaches to estimate the transition matrix. Assuming that Markovianity is at least given at the microstate level, we consider the Laplace-transform based method by Hummer and Szabo, as well as a direct microstate-to-macrostate projection, which by design yields correct macrostate population dynamics. Alternatively, we study the recently proposed quasi-MSM ansatz of Huang and coworkers to solve a generalized master equations, as well as a hybrid method that employs MD at short times and MSM at long times. Adopting a one-dimensional toy model and an all-atom folding trajectory of HP35, we discuss the virtues and shortcomings of the various approaches.</description>
