      <title>Constraining on the non-standard cosmological models combining the observations of high-redshift quasars and BAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we studied four types of cosmological models with different mechanisms driving the accelerated expansion of the universe, include Braneworld models, Chaplygin Gas models, Emergent Dark Energy models, and cosmological torsion models. Considering that the dynamics of these models at low redshifts are very similar and difficult to distinguish, we used the latest and largest UV and X-ray measurements of quasars (QSOs) observations covering the range of redshift $0.009&lt;z&lt;7.5$. However, the high intrinsic dispersion of this sample and the degeneracy between cosmological model parameters, we added 2D-BAO and 3D-BAO datasets to help us constrain the parameters of these cosmological models. Our results suggest that standard cold dark matter scenario may not be the best cosmological model preferred by the high-redshift observations. The Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG) and cosmological constant plus torsion (named Case II) models perform best by Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), but the $\Lambda$CDM is the best cosmological model preferred by Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Our work also supports that the Phenomenologically Emergent Dark Energy and cosmological torsion models may alleviate the Hubble tension, the reported value of the Hubble constant obtained from QSO+BAO datasets combination lies between Planck 2018 observations and local measurements from the SH0ES collaboration, while other cosmological models all support that the Hubble constant tends to be closer to recent Planck 2018 results, but these model are penalized by information criterion.</description>

      <title>Probing the optical depth with galaxy number counts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the prospects for measuring the cosmological distribution and abundance of ionized electrons in the intergalactic medium using galaxy surveys. Optical light from distant galaxies is subject to Thomson screening by intervening electrons which distorts the observed galaxy number density, similar to the effect of weak gravitational lensing magnification. We construct an estimator for the optical-depth fluctuations from the statistical anisotropies of galaxy number counts induced by the spatially-varying optical-depth field. We find near-future galaxy surveys can detect this signal at signal-to-noise above $\sim10$ depending on galaxy survey specifications. We highlight various science cases for the measurement of optical-depth fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Challenges to Inflation in the Post-Planck Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-based missions studying the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have progressively refined the parameter space in conventional models of inflation shortly ($\sim 10^{-37}$ seconds) after the big bang. While most inflationary scenarios proposed thus far in the context of GR have since been ruled out, the basic idea of inflation may still be tenable, albeit with several unresolved conundrums, such as conflicting initial conditions and inconsistencies with the measured CMB power spectrum. In the new slow-roll inflationary picture, inflation arising in plateau-like potentials requires an initiation beyond the Planck time. This delay may be consistent with the cutoff, $k_{\rm min}$, measured recently in the primordial power spectrum. However, the actual value of $k_{\rm min}$ would imply an initiation time too far beyond the big bang for inflation to solve the horizon problem. In this paper, we also describe several other undesirable consequences of this delay, including an absence of well motivated initial conditions and a significant difficulty providing a viable mechanism for properly quantizing the primordial fluctuations. Nevertheless, many of these inconsistencies may still be avoided if one introduces non-conventional modifications to inflation, such as a brief departure from slow-roll dynamics, possibly due to a dramatic change in the inflationary potential, inflation driven by multiple fields, or a non-minimal coupling to gravity. In addition, some of these difficulties could be mitigated via the use of alternative cosmologies based, e.g., on loop quantum gravity, which replaces the initial big-bang singularity with finite conditions at a bounce-like beginning.</description>

      <title>High-redshift, small-scale tests of ultralight axion dark matter using Hubble and Webb galaxy UV luminosities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the abundance of UV-bright galaxies in the presence of ultralight axion dark matter (DM), finding that axions suppress their formation but with a non-trivial dependence on redshift and luminosity. We thus set the first limits on axion DM using a combination of Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) and UV luminosity function (UVLF) data. We exclude a single axion as all the DM for m_{ax} &lt; 10^{-21.6} eV and limit axions with -26 &lt; log(m_{ax}/eV) &lt; -23 to be less than 22% of the DM (both limits at 95% credibility). These limits use UVLF measurements from 24,000 sources from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) that probe small-scale structure at redshifts 4 &lt; z &lt; 10 inaccessible to other cosmological observables. We marginalize over a parametric model that connects halo mass and UV luminosity that has been shown to fit the results of hydrodynamical simulations. Our results bridge a window in axion mass and DM fraction previously unconstrained by cosmological data, between large-scale CMB and galaxy clustering and the small-scale Lyman-alpha forest. These high-z measurements provide a powerful consistency check of low-z tests of axion DM, which include the recent hint for a sub-dominant ULA DM fraction in Lyman-alpha forest data. We also consider a sample of 25 spectroscopically-confirmed high-z (z &gt; 10) galaxies from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We find that these data are consistent with the HST UVLF assuming LambdaCDM and our flexible parametric model of UV luminosity. Combining HST and JWST UVLF data does not improve our constraints beyond HST alone, but future JWST measurements have the potential to improve these results significantly. We also find an excess of low-mass halos (&lt; 10^9 M_\odot) at z &lt; 3, which could be probed by sub-galactic structure probes (e.g., stellar streams, satellite galaxies and strong lensing).</description>

      <title>How robust are the parameter constraints extending the $\Lambda$CDM model?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present model-marginalized limits on the six standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters ($\Omega_{\rm c} h^2$, $\Omega_{\rm b} h^2$, $\theta_{\rm MC}$, $\tau_{\rm reio}$, $n_s$ and $A_s$), as well as on selected derived quantities ($H_0$, $\Omega_{\rm m}$, $\sigma_8$, $S_8$ and $r_{\rm drag}$), obtained by considering three independent Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments: the Planck satellite, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, and South Pole Telescope. We also consider low redshift observations in the form of Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from the SDSS-IV eBOSS survey and Supernovae (SN) distance moduli measurements from the Pantheon-Plus catalog. The marginalized errors are stable against the different fiducial cosmologies explored in this study. The largest impact on the parameter accuracy is produced by varying the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom ($N_{\rm eff}$) or the lensing amplitude ($A_{\rm lens}$). Nevertheless the marginalized errors on some derived parameters such as $H_0$ or $\Omega_{\rm m}$ can be up to two orders of magnitude larger than in the canonical $\Lambda$CDM scenario when considering only CMB data. In these cases, low redshift measurements are crucial for restoring the stability of the marginalized cosmological errors computed here. Overall, our results underscore remarkable stability in the mean values and precision of the main cosmological parameters, making irrelevant the choice of different possible cosmological scenarios once both high and low redshift probes are fully accounted for. The very same results should be understood as a tool to test exotic cosmological scenarios, as the marginalized values should be used in numerical analyses due to their robustness and slightly larger errors, providing a more realistic and conservative approach.</description>

      <title>Hubble Expansion Signature on Simulated Halo Density Profiles: A Path to Observing the Turnaround Radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density profiles are important tools in galaxy cluster research, offering insights into clusters dynamical states and their relationship with the broader Universe. While these profiles provide valuable information about the matter content of the Universe, their utility in understanding its dark energy component has remained limited due a lack of tools allowing us to study the transition from cluster portions that are relaxed and infalling, to those that are merging with the Hubble flow. In this work we investigate signatures of this transition in stacked density profiles of simulated cluster-sized halos at different redshifts. To highlight the Hubble flow around clusters we use their turnaround radius to normalize stacked simulated density profiles and calculate their logarithmic slope. Then, we complement our analysis by modeling the outer portions of these profiles assuming Gaussian early Universe statistics and spherical collapse without shell-crossing. We find the logarithmic slope of median cluster density profiles beyond the turnaround radius - where the Hubble flow dominates - to be Universal and well described by our model. Importantly, we find the slope of the profiles to diverge from the SCM prediction from within the turnaround radius where the actual profiles exhibit caustics which give rise to the splashback feature. We suggest utilizing this divergence from the spherical collapse model as a method to identify the turnaround radius in stacked cluster density profiles, offering a new perspective on understanding cluster dynamics and their cosmological implications.</description>

      <title>Turbulence revealed by wavelet transform: power spectrum and intermittency for the velocity field of the cosmic baryonic fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use continuous wavelet transform techniques to construct the global and environment-dependent wavelet statistics, such as energy spectrum and kurtosis, to study the fluctuation and intermittency of the turbulent motion in the cosmic fluid velocity field with the IllustrisTNG simulation data. We find that the peak scales of the energy spectrum and the spectral ratio define two characteristic scales, which can be regarded as the integral scale and the dissipation scale of turbulence, respectively, so that the energy spectrum can be divided into the energy-containing range, the inertial range and the dissipation range of turbulence. The wavelet kurtosis is an increasing function of the wavenumber $k$, first grows rapidly then slowly with $k$, indicating that the cosmic fluid becomes increasingly intermittent with $k$. In the energy-containing range, the energy spectrum increases significantly from $z = 2$ to $1$, but remains almost unchanged from $z = 1$ to $0$. We find that both the environment-dependent spectrum and kurtosis are similar to the global ones, and the magnitude of the spectrum is smallest in the lowest-density and largest in the highest-density environment, suggesting that the cosmic fluid is more turbulent in a high-density than in a low-density environment. In the inertial range, the exponent of the energy spectrum is steeper than not only the Kolmogorov but also the Burgers exponent, suggesting that there may be more complex mechanisms for energy transfer than Kolmogorov and Burgers turbulence.</description>

      <title>Non-linear power spectrum and forecasts for Generalized Cubic Covariant Galileon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To fully exploit the data from next generation surveys, we need an accurate modelling of the matter power spectrum up to non-linear scales. Therefore in this work we present the halo model reaction framework for the Generalized Cubic Covariant Galileon (GCCG) model, a modified gravity model within the Horndeski class of theories which extends the cubic covariant Galileon (G3) by including power laws of the derivatives of the scalar field in the K-essence and cubic terms. We modify the publicly available software ReACT for the GCCG in order to obtain an accurate prediction of the non-linear power spectrum. In the limit of the G3 model we compare the modified ReACT code to $N$-body simulations and we find agreement within 5\% for a wide range of scales and redshifts. We then study the relevant effects of the modifications introduced by the GCCG on the non-linear matter power spectrum. Finally, we provide forecasts from spectroscopic and photometric primary probes by next generation surveys using a Fisher matrix method. We show that future data will be able to constrain at 1$\sigma$ the two additional parameters of the model at the percent level and that considering non-linear corrections to the matter power spectrum beyond the linear regime is crucial to obtain this result.</description>

      <title>Impact of lensing of gravitational waves on the observed distribution of neutron star masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of masses of neutron stars, particularly the maximum mass value, is considered a probe of their formation, evolution and internal physics (i.e., equation of state). This mass distribution could in principle be inferred from the detection of gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers. Using mock catalogues of $10^5$ dark sirens events, expected to be detected by Einstein Telescope over an operational period of $\sim1\, \rm year$ , we show how the biased luminosity distance measurement induced by gravitational lensing affects the inferred redshift and mass of the merger. This results in higher observed masses than expected. Up to $2\%$ of the events are predicted to fall above the maximum allowed neutron star mass depending on the intrinsic mass distribution and signal-to-noise ratio threshold adopted. The underlying true mass distribution and maximum mass could still be approximately recovered in the case of bright standard sirens.</description>

      <title>Stage-IV Cosmic Shear with Modified Gravity and Model-independent Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We forecast constraints on minimal model-independent parametrisations of several Modified Gravity theories using mock Stage-IV cosmic shear data. We include nonlinear effects and screening, which ensures recovery of General Relativity on small scales. We introduce a power spectrum emulator to accelerate our analysis and evaluate the robustness of the growth index parametrisation with respect to two cosmologies: $\Lambda$CDM and the normal branch of the DGP model. We forecast the uncertainties on the growth index $\gamma$ to be of the order $\sim 10\%$. We find that our halo-model based screening approach demonstrates excellent performance, meeting the precision requirements of Stage-IV surveys. However, neglecting the screening transition results in biased predictions for cosmological parameters. We find that the screening transition shows significant degeneracy with baryonic feedback, requiring a much better understanding of baryonic physics for its detection. Massive neutrinos effects are less prominent and challenging to detect solely with cosmic shear data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation and growth of black holes can strongly influence the distribution of dark matter around them. I discuss here the different types of dark matter overdensities around black holes, including dark matter cusps, spikes, mounds, crests, and gravitational atoms. I then review recent results on the evolution of a black holes binary in presence of dark matter, focusing on the energy transfer between binary and dark matter induced by dynamical friction. Finally, I present the prospects for studying dark matter with gravitational wave observations, and argue that future interferometers might be able to detect and characterise dark matter overdensities around black holes.</description>

      <title>Unlocking New Physics with Joint Power Spectrum and Voxel Intensity Distribution Forecasts in Line-Intensity Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power spectrum and voxel intensity distribution (VID) are two summary statistics that can be applied to condense the information encoded in line-intensity maps. The information contained in both summary statistics is highly complementary, and their combination allows for a major increase in precision of parameter estimation from line-intensity mapping (LIM) surveys. Until recently, combination of these statistics required simulation-based estimations of their covariance. In this work we leverage an analytical model of covariance between these observables to run a joint Fisher forecast focusing on the CO(1-0) rotational line targeted by the COMAP survey and a wider, shallower hypothetical iteration. We consider a generalized phenomenological non-CDM model, models with axion dark matter, and local primordial non-Gaussianity, to highlight where a combined analysis of the power spectrum and VID can be most useful. Our results demonstrate improvements in sensitivity to beyond-$\Lambda$CDM physics over analyses using either the power spectrum or VID on their own, by factors ranging from 2 to 50, showcasing the potential of joint analyses in unlocking new insights into fundamental physics with LIM surveys.</description>

      <title>The Lunar Gravitational-wave Antenna: Mission Studies and Science Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lunar Gravitational-wave Antenna (LGWA) is a proposed array of next-generation inertial sensors to monitor the response of the Moon to gravitational waves (GWs). Given the size of the Moon and the expected noise produced by the lunar seismic background, the LGWA would be able to observe GWs from about 1 mHz to 1 Hz. This would make the LGWA the missing link between space-borne detectors like LISA with peak sensitivities around a few millihertz and proposed future terrestrial detectors like Einstein Telescope or Cosmic Explorer. In this article, we provide a first comprehensive analysis of the LGWA science case including its multi-messenger aspects and lunar science with LGWA data. We also describe the scientific analyses of the Moon required to plan the LGWA mission.</description>

      <title>Strong lensing of gravitational waves with modified propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the impact of corrections to the propagation on the waveforms of gravitationally lensed gravitational waves under the geometrical optics approximation, focusing on both uniform cosmological modifications and local modifications localized around lensing objects. By adopting a model-independent phenomenological approach, we systematically investigate the effects of these modifications in strong lensing scenarios, where detection of multiple images is expected. Our analysis reveals that cosmological modifications can yield corrections to the time delay that remain to be minor compared with the effects that accumulate over the whole propagation process, which are present also in the unlensed waveform. By contrast, local modifications around lensing objects can alter the image position and also the magnification factor, which is potentially polarization-selective and frequency-dependent. In some case we can have image disappearance as well as signal amplification. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such modifications can cause degradation of waveform match with the templates based on general relativity. This study highlights the importance of considering waveform modifications to search for the signature of modified propagation or the existence of extra polarization modes, and proposes potential observational targets.</description>

      <title>New AGN diagnostic diagrams based on the [OIII]$\lambda 4363$ auroral line</title>

Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revolutionizing our understanding of black holes formation and growth in the early Universe. However, JWST has also revealed that some of the classical diagnostics, such as the BPT diagrams and X-ray emission, often fail to identify narrow line TypeII active galactic nuclei (AGN) at high redshift. Here we present three new rest-frame optical diagnostic diagrams leveraging the [OIII]$\lambda4363$ auroral line, which has been detected in several JWST spectra. Specifically, we show that high values of the [OIII]$\lambda4363/$H$\gamma$ ratio provide a sufficient (but not necessary) condition to identify the presence of an AGN, both based on empirical calibrations (using local and high-redshift sources) and a broad range of photoionization models. These diagnostics are able to separate much of the AGN population from Star Forming Galaxies (SFGs). This is because the average energy of AGN's ionizing photons is higher than that of young stars in SFGs, hence AGN can more efficiently heat the gas, therefore boosting the [OIII]$\lambda4363$ line. We also found independent indications of AGN activity in some high-redshift sources that were not previously identified as AGN with the traditional diagnostics diagrams, but that are placed in the AGN region of the diagnostics presented in this work. We note that, conversely, low values of [OIII]$\lambda4363/$H$\gamma$ can be associated either with SFGs or AGN excitation. We note that the fact that strong auroral lines are often associated with AGN does not imply that they cannot be used for direct metallicity measurements (provided that proper ionization corrections are applied), but it does affect the calibration of strong line metallicity diagnostics.</description>

      <title>JWST Photometry of Globular Clusters in Abell 2744. II: luminosity and color distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep JWST imaging of the giant galaxy cluster Abell 2744, at redshift $z=0.308$, is used to explore the features of its rich population of globular clusters (GCs), building on our initial survey of the system (Harris &amp; Reina-Campos 2023). We use the photometry of more than $10,000$ GCs over a three-magnitude range to construct the GC luminosity function (GCLF) and color distribution (CDF). These results now specifically account for photometric incompleteness as a function of location relative to the five giant galaxies that dominate the gravitational potential of A2744. The total GC population in A2744 is estimated at $N_{\rm GC} \geq 1.1 \times 10^5$, consistent with its high total mass. We also directly compare the observed distributions with theoretical predictions for GC populations drawn from the recent EMP-Pathfinder simulations (Reina-Campos et al. 2022), viewed at the same 3.5 Gyr lookback time as the cluster. The simulations match the observations well, with the only notable disagreement being that the simulations predict larger numbers of GCs at high metallicity formed after $z\simeq2$ than are seen in the data.</description>

      <title>Imprints of the Local Bubble and Dust Complexity on Polarized Dust Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using 3D dust maps and Planck polarized dust emission data, we investigate the influence of the 3D geometry of the nearby interstellar medium (ISM) on the statistics of the dust polarization on large ($80'$) scales. We test the idea that the magnetic field in the nearby dust is preferentially tangential to the Local Bubble wall, but we do not find an imprint of the Local Bubble geometry on the dust polarization fraction. We also test the hypothesis that the complexity of the 3D dust distribution drives some of the measured variation of the dust polarization fraction. We compare sightlines with similar total column densities and find evidence that, on average, the dust polarization fraction decreases when the dust column is substantially distributed among multiple components at different distances. Conversely, the polarization fraction is higher for sightlines where the dust is more concentrated in 3D space. This finding is statistically significant for the dust within 1.25 kpc, but the effect disappears if we only consider dust within 270 pc. The extended 3D dust distribution, rather than solely the dust associated with the Local Bubble, plays a role in determining the observed dust polarization fraction on these scales. This conclusion is consistent with a simple analytical prediction and remains robust under various modifications to the analysis. These results illuminate the relationship between the 3D geometry of the ISM and tracers of the interstellar magnetic field. We also discuss implications for our understanding of the polarized dust foreground to the cosmic microwave background.</description>

      <title>Exploring Supermassive Compact Dark Matter with the Millilensing Effect of Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing effect is one of most significant observational probes to investigate compact dark matter/objects over a wide mass range. In this work, we first propose to derive the population information and the abundance of supermassive compact dark matter in the mass range $\sim10^5-10^7~M_{\odot}$ from 6 millilensed gamma-ray burst (GRB) candidates in 3000 Fermi GRB events using the hierarchical Bayesian inference method. We obtain that, for the mass range $\sim10^5-10^7~M_{\odot}$, the abundance of supermassive compact dark matter is $f_{\rm CO}=10^{-1.60}$ in the log-normal mass distribution scenario. This result is in obvious tension with some other observational constraints, e.g. ultra-faint dwarfs and dynamical friction. However, it also was argued that there is only one system in these 6 candidates has been identified as lensed GRB event with fairly high confidence. In this case, the tension would be significantly alleviated. Therefore, it would be an interesting clue for both the millilensed GRB identification and the formation mechanism of supermassive compact dark matter.</description>

      <title>Local clustering of relic neutrinos: Comparison of kinetic field theory and the Vlasov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational clustering in our cosmic vicinity is expected to lead to an enhancement of the local density of relic neutrinos. We derive expressions for the neutrino density, using a perturbative approach to kinetic field theory and perturbative solutions of the Vlasov equation up to second order. Our work reveals that both formalisms give exactly the same results and can thus be considered equivalent. Numerical evaluation of the local relic neutrino density at first and second order provides some fundamental insights into the frequently applied approach of linear response to neutrino clustering (also known as the Gilbert equation). Against the naive expectation, including the second-order contribution does not lead to an improvement of the prediction for the local relic neutrino density but to a dramatic overestimation. This is because perturbation theory breaks down in a momentum-dependent fashion and in particular for densities well below unity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the thin accretion disk behaviors surrounding black holes embedded in cold dark matter halos and scalar field dark matter halos. We first calculate the event horizons and derive the equations of motion and effective potential in black hole geometries with different dark matter halos. We then compute the specific energy, specific angular momentum, and angular velocity of particles moving along circular orbits. We also derive the effective potentials to find the locations of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and compare them to the Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes without the dark matter haloes. We also use the observed ISCO of the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center of the Milky Way, Sagittarius A*, to constrain the dark matter halos and discuss the astrophysical Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) generation from systems.</description>

      <title>Extreme-value modelling of the brightest galaxies at $z\gtrsim9$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data from the James Webb Space Telescope have revealed an intriguing population of bright galaxies at high redshifts. In this work, we use extreme-value statistics to calculate the distribution (in UV magnitude) of the brightest galaxies in the redshift range $9 \lesssim z \lesssim 16$. We combine the Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) approach with modelling of the galaxy luminosity function. We obtain predictions of the brightest galaxies for a suite of luminosity functions, including the Schechter and double power law functions, as well as a model parametrised by the stellar formation efficiency $f_*$. We find that the \textit{JWST} data is broadly consistent with $f_*$ of $5\%-10\%$, and that the brightest galaxy at $z\sim16$ will have $M_{\rm UV}\approx -23.5^{0.8}_{0.4}$. If $f_*$ is dependent on halo mass, we predict $M_{\rm UV}\approx -22.5^{0.5}_{1.5}$ for such an object. We show that extreme-value statistics not only predicts the magnitude of the brightest galaxies at high redshifts, but may also be able to distinguish between models of star formation in high-redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>Probing the two-body decaying dark matter scenario with weak lensing and the cosmic microwave background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03222v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decaying dark matter (DDM) scenarios have recently regained attention due to their potential ability to resolve the well-known clustering (or $S_8$) tension between weak lensing (WL) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements. In this paper, we investigate a well-established model where the original dark matter particle decays into a massless particle and a massive daughter particle. The latter obtains a velocity kick during the decay process that results in the suppression of the matter power spectrum at scales that are observable with WL shear observations. We perform the first fully non-linear WL analysis of this two-body decaying dark matter ($\Lambda$DDM) scenario, including intrinsic alignment and baryonic feedback processes. We used the cosmic shear band power spectra from \textit{KiDS-1000} data and combined it with temperature and polarisation data from \texttt{Planck} in order to constrain the $\Lambda$DDM model. We report new limits on the decay rate and mass splitting parameters that are significantly stronger than previous results, especially in the case of low-mass splittings. Regarding the $S_8$ tension, we found a reduction from about 3 to 2 $\sigma$, depending on which statistical measure is applied. We therefore conclude that the two-body $\Lambda$DDM model is able to reduce the $S_8$ tension without convincingly solving it.</description>

      <title>Precise Cosmological Constraints from BOSS Galaxy Clustering with a Simulation-Based Emulator of the Wavelet Scattering Transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a reanalysis of the BOSS CMASS DR12 galaxy dataset using a simulation-based emulator for the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) coefficients. Moving beyond our previous works, which laid the foundation for the first galaxy clustering application of this estimator, we construct a neural net-based emulator for the cosmological dependence of the WST coefficients and the 2-point correlation function multipoles, trained from the state-of-the-art suite of \textsc{AbacusSummit} simulations combined with a flexible Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) galaxy model. In order to confirm the accuracy of our pipeline, we subject it to a series of thorough internal and external mock parameter recovery tests, before applying it to reanalyze the CMASS observations in the redshift range $0.46&lt;z&lt;0.57$. We find that a joint WST + 2-point correlation function likelihood analysis allows us to obtain marginalized 1$\sigma$ errors on the $\Lambda$CDM parameters that are tighter by a factor of $2.5-6$, compared to the 2-point correlation function, and by a factor of $1.4-2.5$ compared to the WST-only results. This corresponds to a competitive $0.9\%$, $2.3\%$ and $1\%$ level of determination for parameters $\omega_c$, $\sigma_8$ $\&amp;$ $n_s$, respectively, and also to a $0.7\%$ $\&amp;$ $2.5 \%$ constraint on derived parameters h and $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$, in agreement with the \textit{Planck} 2018 results. Our results reaffirm the constraining power of the WST and highlight the exciting prospect of employing higher-order statistics in order to fully exploit the power of upcoming Stage-IV spectroscopic observations.</description>

      <title>Core and Halo Properties in Multi-Field Wave Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we compute multi-field core and halo properties in wave Dark Matter models. We focus on the case where Dark Matter consists of two light (real) scalars, interacting gravitationally. As in the single-field Ultra Light Dark Matter (ULDM) case, the scalar field behaves as a coherent BEC with a definite ground state (at fixed total mass), often referred to in the literature as a gravitational soliton. We establish an efficient algorithm to find the ground and excited states of such two-field systems. We then use simulations to investigate the gravitational collapse and virialization, starting from different initial conditions, into solitons and surrounding halo. As in the single-field case, a virialized halo forms with a gravitational soliton (ground state) at the center. We find some evidence for an empirical relation between the soliton mass and energy and those of the host halo. We use this to then find a numerical relation between the properties of the two. Finally, we use this to address the issue of alleviating some of the tensions that single-field ULDM has with observational data, in particular, the issue of how a galaxy's core and radius are related. We find that if galaxies of different masses have similar percentages of the two species, then the core-radius scaling tension is not addressed. However, more general possibilities occur if the relative abundance of species in each halo correlates with the total mass of the galaxy. If this is the case, the model predicts several other phenomenological signatures.</description>

Abstract: Synthetic data sets are used in cosmology to test analysis procedures, to verify that systematic errors are well understood and to demonstrate that measurements are unbiased. In this work we describe the methods used to generate synthetic datasets of Lyman-$\alpha$ quasar spectra aimed for studies with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). In particular, we focus on demonstrating that our simulations reproduces important features of real samples, making them suitable to test the analysis methods to be used in DESI and to place limits on systematic effects on measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). We present a set of mocks that reproduce the statistical properties of the DESI early data set with good agreement. Additionally, we use full survey synthetic data to forecast the BAO scale constraining power with DESI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06796v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The DESI year one observations can help probe new physics on cosmological scales. In light of the latest DESI BAO measurements, we constrain five popular cosmological scenarios including inflation, modified gravity, annihilating dark matter and interacting dark energy. Using a data combination of BICEP/Keck array, cosmic microwave background and DESI, we obtain the $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r_{0.05}= 0.0176^{+0.0070}_{-0.0130}$ and $r_{0.05}=0.018^{+0.020}_{-0.017}$ indicating a beyond $2\sigma$ evidence of primordial gravitational waves. Using the combination of cosmic microwave background and DESI, we find a $2.4\sigma$ evidence for gravitational theories beyond the general relativity, shrink the dark matter annihilation cross-section by $12\%$ relative to cosmic microwave background, obtain a $1.3\sigma$ hint of the positive interaction between dark matter and dark energy implying that energy may be transferred from dark matter to dark energy in the dark sector of the universe, and give a clue of massive sterile neutrinos via the $2\sigma$ constraint on the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{eff}=3.16^{+0.26}_{-0.11}$ and the effective mass $m^{eff}_{\nu, sterile}&lt;0.52$ eV. Future DESI observations could go a step further to explore the nature of inflation, dark matter, dark energy and neutrinos, and test the validity of general relativity on cosmological scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the contemporary era of high-precision spectroscopic surveys, led by projects like DESI, there is an increasing demand for optimizing the extraction of cosmological information from clustering data. This work conducts a thorough comparison of various methodologies for modeling the full shape of the two-point statistics in configuration space. We investigate the performance of both direct fits (Full-Modeling) and the parameter compression approaches (ShapeFit and Standard). We utilize the ABACUS-SUMMIT simulations, tailored to exceed DESI's precision requirements. Particularly, we fit the two-point statistics of three distinct tracers (LRG, ELG, and QSO), by employing a Gaussian Streaming Model in tandem with Convolution Lagrangian Perturbation Theory and Effective Field Theory. We explore methodological setup variations, including the range of scales, the set of galaxy bias parameters, the inclusion of the hexadecapole, as well as model extensions encompassing varying $n_s$ and allowing for $w_0w_a$CDM dark energy model. Throughout these varied explorations, while precision levels fluctuate and certain configurations exhibit tighter parameter constraints, our pipeline consistently recovers the parameter values of the mocks within $1\sigma$ in all cases for a 1-year DESI volume. Additionally, we compare the performance of configuration space analysis with its Fourier space counterpart using three models: PyBird, FOLPS and velocileptors, presented in companion papers. We find good agreement with the results from all these models.</description>

Abstract: In preparation for the next generation of galaxy redshift surveys, and in particular the year-one data release from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we investigate the consistency of a variety of effective field theory models that describe the galaxy-galaxy power spectra in redshift space into the quasi-linear regime using 1-loop perturbation theory. These models are employed in the pipelines \texttt{velocileptors}, \texttt{PyBird}, and \texttt{Folps$\nu$}. While these models have been validated independently, a detailed comparison with consistent choices has not been attempted. After briefly discussing the theoretical differences between the models we describe how to provide a more apples-to-apples comparison between them. We present the results of fitting mock spectra from the \texttt{AbacusSummit} suite of N-body simulations provided in three redshift bins to mimic the types of dark time tracers targeted by the DESI survey. We show that the theories behave similarly and give consistent constraints in both the forward-modeling and ShapeFit compressed fitting approaches. We additionally generate (noiseless) synthetic data from each pipeline to be fit by the others, varying the scale cuts in order to show that the models agree within the range of scales for which we expect 1-loop perturbation theory to be applicable. This work lays the foundation of Full-Shape analysis with DESI Y1 galaxy samples where in the tests we performed, we found no systematic error associated with the modeling of the galaxy redshift space power spectrum for this volume.</description>

      <title>An analysis of parameter compression and full-modeling techniques with Velocileptors for DESI 2024 and beyond</title>

Abstract: In anticipation of forthcoming data releases of current and future spectroscopic surveys, we present the validation tests and analysis of systematic effects within \texttt{velocileptors} modeling pipeline when fitting mock data from the \texttt{AbacusSummit} N-body simulations. We compare the constraints obtained from parameter compression methods to the direct fitting (Full-Modeling) approaches of modeling the galaxy power spectra, and show that the ShapeFit extension to the traditional template method is consistent with the Full-Modeling method within the standard $\Lambda$CDM parameter space. We show the dependence on scale cuts when fitting the different redshift bins using the ShapeFit and Full-Modeling methods. We test the ability to jointly fit data from multiple redshift bins as well as joint analysis of the pre-reconstruction power spectrum with the post-reconstruction BAO correlation function signal. We further demonstrate the behavior of the model when opening up the parameter space beyond $\Lambda$CDM and also when combining likelihoods with external datasets, namely the Planck CMB priors. Finally, we describe different parametrization options for the galaxy bias, counterterm, and stochastic parameters, and employ the halo model in order to physically motivate suitable priors that are necessary to ensure the stability of the perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Testing common approximations to predict the 21cm signal at the Epoch of Reionization and Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the 21cm signal from the epoch of reionization and cosmic dawn is a complex and challenging task. Various simplifying assumptions have been applied over the last decades to make the modeling more affordable. In this paper, we investigate the validity of several such assumptions, using a simulation suite consisting of three different astrophysical source models that agree with the current constraints on the reionization history and the UV luminosity function. We first show that the common assumption of a saturated spin temperature may lead to significant errors in the 21cm clustering signal over the full reionization period. The same is true for the assumption of a neutral universe during the cosmic dawn which may lead to significant deviation from the correct signal during the heating and the Lyman-$\alpha$ coupling period. Another popular simplifying assumption consists of predicting the global differential brightness temperature ($dT_b$) based on the average quantities of the reionization fraction, gas temperature, and Lyman-$\alpha$ coupling. We show that such an approach leads to a 10 percent deeper absorption signal compared to the results obtained by averaging the final $dT_b$-map. Finally, we investigate the simplifying method of breaking the 21cm clustering signal into different auto and cross components that are then solved assuming linearity. We show that even though the individual fields have a variance well below unity, they often cannot be treated perturbatively as the perturbations are strongly non-Gaussian. As a consequence, predictions based on the perturbative solution of individual auto and cross power spectra may lead to strongly biased results, even if higher-order terms are taken into account.</description>

      <title>Rescuing Gravitational-Reheating in Chaotic Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show, within the single-field inflationary paradigm, that a linear non-minimal interaction $\xi\,M_P\,\phi\,R$ between the inflaton field $\phi$ and the Ricci scalar $R$ can result in successful inflation that concludes with an efficient heating of the Universe via perturbative decays of the inflaton, aided entirely by gravity. Considering the inflaton field to oscillate in a quadratic potential, we find that $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1}) \lesssim \xi \lesssim \mathcal{O}(10^2)$ is required to satisfy the observational bounds from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Interestingly, the upper bound on the non-minimal coupling guarantees a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \gtrsim 10^{-4}$, within the range of current and future planned experiments. We also discuss implications of dark matter production, along with the potential generation of the matter-antimatter asymmetry resulting from inflaton decay, through the same gravity portal.</description>

      <title>AGN Selection and Demographics: A New Age with JWST/MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the co-evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host systems requires a comprehensive census of active galactic nuclei (AGN) behavior across a wide range of redshift, luminosity, obscuration level and galaxy properties. We report significant progress with JWST towards this goal from the Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES). Based on comprehensive SED analysis of 3273 MIRI-detected sources, we identify 217 AGN candidates over a survey area of $\sim$34 arcmin$^2$, including a primary sample of 111 AGNs in normal massive galaxies ($M_{*}&gt;10^{9.5}~M_\odot$) at $z\sim$0--4, an extended sample of 86 AGN {\it candidates} in low-mass galaxies ($M_{*}&lt;10^{9.5}~M_\odot$) and a high-$z$ sample of 20 AGN {\it candidates} at $z\sim$4--8.4. Notably, about 80\% of our MIRI-selected AGN candidates are new discoveries despite the extensive pre-JWST AGN searches. Even among the massive galaxies where the previous AGN search is believed to be thorough, 34\% of the MIRI AGN identifications are new, highlighting the impact of obscuration on previous selections. By combining our results with the efforts at other wavelengths, we build the most complete AGN sample to date and examine the relative performance of different selection techniques. We find the obscured AGN fraction increases from $L_{\rm AGN, bol}\sim10^{10}~L_\odot$ to $10^{11}~L_\odot$ and then drops towards higher luminosity. Additionally, the obscured AGN fraction gradually increases from $z\sim0$ to $z\sim4$ with most high-$z$ AGNs obscured. We discuss how AGN obscuration, intrinsic SED variations, galaxy contamination, survey depth and selection techniques complicate the construction of a complete AGN sample.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Purity Lost: Perturbative and Resummed Late-Time Inflationary Decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the rate with which unobserved fields decohere other fields to which they couple, both in flat space and in de Sitter space, for scalar fields prepared in their standard adiabatic vacuum. The process is very efficient in de Sitter space once the modes in question pass outside the Hubble scale, displaying the tell-tale phenomenon of secular growth that indicates the breakdown of perturbative methods on a time scale parameterically long compared with the Hubble time. We show how to match the perturbative evolution valid at early times onto a late-time Lindblad evolution whose domain of validity extends to much later times, thereby allowing a reliable resummation of the perturbative result beyond the perturbative regime. Super-Hubble modes turn out to be dominantly decohered by unobserved modes that are themselves also super-Hubble. When applied to curvature perturbations during inflation this observation closes a potential loophole in recent calculations of the late-time purity of the observable primordial fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Searching for cold gas traced by MgII quasar absorbers in massive X-ray-selected galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Almost 50% of galaxies in the local Universe are in clusters or groups coexisting with both hot and cold gas components. In the present study, we observationally probed the cold-gas content of X-ray-selected massive galaxy clusters with spectroscopic redshift measured from the SDSS/SPIDERS survey. This paper focuses on the most massive structures: galaxy clusters with a mean mass of M$_{500c}$ = 2.7$\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$. We used a large number of background quasar optical spectra from SDSS DR16 to probe the diffuse T$=$10$^4$K gas in their intracluster medium. We first analysed a sample of spectra with known MgII absorbers, and then blindly stacked about 16,000 archival spectra at the redshifts of the foreground galaxy clusters. We tentatively ($3.7 \sigma$ significance) detect MgII in the clusters with an equivalent width EW(MgII $\lambda$2796) of 0.056$\pm$0.015 \r{A}, corresponding to a column density of log [N(MgII)/cm$^{-2}$]=12.12$\pm0.1$. We tested our methodology by generating 22,000 mock SDSS spectra with MgII absorbers from TNG50 cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations, combining photo-ionisation modelling and ray tracing. We also performed bootstrapping stacking at different cluster redshifts and stacked quasar spectra with no intervening clusters in the line of sight to measure the significance of our detection. These results are in line with the findings of recent, similar observational studies but challenge predictions from TNG simulations. Together, our findings indicate that large amounts of cold gas may be found in the most massive structures of the Universe.</description>
