      <title>Orbit structures on real double flag varieties for symmetric pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ G $ be a connected reductive algebraic group over $ \mathbb{R} $, and $ H $ its symmetric subgroup. For parabolic subgroups $ P_{G} \subset G $ and $ P_{H} \subset H $, the product of flag varieties $ \mathfrak{X} = H/P_H \times G/P_G $ is called a double flag variety, on which $ H $ acts diagonally.
  Now let $G$ be either $\mathrm{U}(n,n)$ or $\mathrm{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb{R})$. We classify the $H$-orbits on $ \mathfrak{X} $ in both cases and show that they admit exactly the same parametrization. Concretely, each orbit corresponds to a signed partial involution, which can be encoded by simple combinatorial graphs. The orbit structure reduces to several families of smaller flag varieties, and we find an intimate relation of the orbit decomposition to Matsuki duality and Matsuki-Oshima's notion of clans.
  We also compute the Galois cohomology of each orbit, which exhibits another classification of the orbits by explicit matrix representatives.</description>

      <title>More ghost modules I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ghost modules were introduced in [I3] without definitions or proofs. We also introduced stability diagrams or "relative pictures" for torsion classes and torsion-free classes for representations of Dynkin quivers. Modules which were not in the chosen class reappeared as "ghosts", in fact one missing module produced two ghosts. In this short paper, we give a precise definition of ghost modules. We give several examples and prove basis properties of ghosts and pictures for torsion and torsion-free classes. We also introduce a third kind of ghost which we call "extension ghosts". In the next paper we will explain how these new ghosts can be used to visualize the computation of the higher Reidemeister torsion carried out in [IK].</description>

      <title>An explicit decomposition of higher Deligne-Lsuztig representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper, the second named author obtains a decomposition of an elliptic higher Deligne-Lusztig representation into irreducible summands, which are built in the same way as Yu types using a geometric analog $\kappa'$ of the Weil-Heisenberg representation $\kappa$. In this note, we show that $\kappa'$ and $\kappa$ differs by a character $\chi$. Moreover, under a mild condition on the cardinality $q$ of the residue field (for instance $q &gt; 3$), we show that $\chi$ equals the quadratic character constructed by Fintzen-Kaletha-Spice, which gives an explicit irreducible decomposition result on elliptic higher Deligne-Lusztig representations. As an application, we deduce (under the mild condition on $q$) that each unramified Yu type appears in the cohomology of higher Deligne-Lusztig varieties, and each unramified Kaletha's regular supercuspidal representation is the compact induction of a specified higher Deligne-Lusztig representation up to a sign.</description>

      <title>Intersections of blocks of cyclotomic Hecke algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trinh and Xue have proposed a startling conjecture on intersections of blocks of cyclotomic Hecke algebras occurring in modular representation theory of finite reductive groups. We prove this conjecture for all exceptional type groups apart from $E_8$. We also propose several generalisations, to Suzuki and Ree groups, to non-rational Coxeter groups and even more generally to spetsial complex reflection groups, and confirm these in various cases.</description>

      <title>Coxeter matrices and homological quadratic forms of $\boldsymbol{n}$-hereditary algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Coxeter matrices and the homological quadratic forms of $n$-hereditary algebras within the framework of higher dimensional Auslander--Reiten theory. Let $\Lambda$ be a finite dimensional $n$-hereditary algebra with the Coxeter matrix $\Phi$ and the homological quadratic form $\chi$. We prove that if $\Lambda$ is $n$-representation finite, then there exists a positive integer $d$ such that $\Phi^d=1$. In the case $n$ is an odd number, we show that if there exists a positive integer $d$ such that $\Phi^d=1$, then $\Lambda$ is $n$-representation finite. Let $\mathcal{C}^0$ be the subcategory of $\modd\Lambda$ which is a higher analogue of the module category in the context of higher dimensional Auslander--Reiten theory. We introduce a Grothendieck group $\mathrm{K}_0(\mathcal{C}^0)$ associated with $\mathcal{C}^0$ and show that it is isomorphic to the Grothendieck group of $\Lambda$. We further prove that if the restriction of $\chi$ to $\mathrm{K}_0(\mcc^0)$ is positive definite, then $\Lambda$ is $n$-representation finite for odd $n$. To prove these results, we first show that indecomposable $n$-preprojective and $n$-preinjective modules are uniquely determined up to isomorphism by their dimension vectors for odd $n$. We also provide examples of $n$-representation finite algebras that the restriction of $\chi$ to $\mathrm{K}_0(\mcc^0)$ is not positive definite.</description>

      <title>An explicit local geometric Langlands for supercuspidal representations: the toral case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a conjecture on local geometric Langlands for supercuspidal representations using Yu's data and Feigin-Frenkel isomorphism. We refine our conjecture for a large family of regular supercuspidal representations defined by Kaletha, and then confirm the conjecture for toral supercuspidal representations of Adler whose Langlands parameters turn out to be exactly all the irreducible isoclinic connections. As an application, we establish the conjectural correspondence between global Airy connections for reductive groups and the family of Hecke eigensheaves constructed by Jakob-Kamgarpour-Yi.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{X}$ be a Geigle-Lenzing projective plane of type $(2,2,2,p)$ and $\mathsf{coh} \mathbb{X}$ the category of coherent sheaves on $\mathbb{X}$. This paper is devoted to study ACM tilting bundles over $\mathbb{X}$, that is, tilting objects in the derived category $\mathsf{D}^{\rm b}(\mathsf{coh} \, \mathbb{X})$ that are also ACM bundles. We show that a tilting bundle consisting of line bundles is the $2$-canonical tilting bundle up to degree shift. We also provide a program to construct ACM tilting bundles, which give a rich source of (almost) $2$-representation infinite algebras. As an application, we give a classification result of ACM tilting bundles.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of the symplectic Grassmannian and $\mathrm{Mat}_{n,m}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{G}$ be a reductive group and $\mathbf{X}$ a spherical $\mathbf{G}$-variety over a local non-archimedean field $\mathbb{F}$. We denote by $S(\mathbf{X}(\mathbb{F}))$ the Schwartz-functions on $\mathbf{X}(\mathbb{F})$. In this paper we offer a new approach on how to obtain bounds on
  \[\dim_{\mathbb{C}}\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbf{G}(\mathbb{F})}(S(\mathbf{X}(\mathbb{F})),\pi)\]
  for an irreducible smooth representation $\pi$ of $\mathbf{G}(\mathbb{F})$. Our strategy builds on the theory of $\rho$-derivatives and the Local Structure Theorem for spherical varieties. Currently, we focus on the case of the symplectic Grassmannian and the space of matrices. In particular, we obtain a new proof of Howe duality in type II as well as an explicit description of the local Miyawaki-liftings in the Hilbert-Siegel case. Finally, we manage to extend previous results of the author regarding the conservation relation in the theta correspondence to metaplectic covers of symplectic groups.</description>

      <title>Brick-splitting Torsion Pairs and Trim Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of brick-splitting torsion pairs as a modern analogue and generalization of the classical notion of splitting torsion pairs. A torsion pair is called brick-splitting if any given brick is either torsion or torsion-free with respect to that torsion pair. After giving some properties of these pairs, we fully characterize them in terms of some lattice-theoretical properties, including left modularity. This leads to the notion of brick-directed algebras, which are those for which there does not exist any cycle of non-zero non-isomorphisms between bricks. This class of algebras is a novel generalization of representation-directed algebras. We show that brick-directed algebras have many interesting properties and give several characterizations of them. In particular, we prove that a brick-finite algebra is brick-directed if and only if the lattice of torsion classes is a trim lattice. We also give a characterization of brick-directed algebras in terms of their wall-and-chamber structure, as well as of a certain Newton polytope associated to them. Moreover, we introduce an explicit construction of an abundance of brick-directed algebras, both of the tame and wild representation types.</description>

      <title>The Rigidity of Constraint: A Spencer-Hodge Theoretic Approach to the Hodge Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new theoretical perspective for studying the Hodge conjecture through an analytical framework based on constraint geometry. Our theory begins with a key observation: in compatible pair Spencer theory, a "differential degeneration" mechanism simplifies Spencer differential operators to classical exterior differential under specific algebraic conditions, bridging constraint geometry and de Rham cohomology. This bridge alone is insufficient to filter rare Hodge classes with algebraicity. We introduce the core concept -- "Spencer hyper-constraint conditions," a constraint system from Lie algebraic internal symmetry integrating: differential degeneration, Cartan subalgebra constraints, and mirror stability. This constraint principle filters geometric objects with excellent properties from degenerate classes, constructively defined as "Spencer-Hodge classes." To reveal their geometric significance, we "complex geometrize" the framework, integrating with Variation of Hodge Structures theory to construct Spencer-VHS theory. We establish connections between Spencer hyper-constraint conditions and flatness of corresponding sections under Spencer-Gauss-Manin connections. With the "Spencer-calibration equivalence principle" and "dimension matching strong hypothesis," flatness directly corresponds to algebraicity, providing sufficient conditions for verifying the Hodge conjecture. This forms "Spencer-Hodge verification criteria," transforming the proof problem into investigating whether three structured conditions hold: geometric realization of Spencer theory, satisfaction of algebraic-dimensional control, and establishment of the Spencer-calibration equivalence principle. This framework provides new perspectives for understanding this fundamental problem.</description>

      <title>Standard posets and integral weight bases for symmetric powers of minuscule representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends our earlier work where we constructed ``minuscule'' representations of Kac--Moody algebras from colored posets in a way that maintains key properties of the well-known minuscule representations of simple Lie algebras. In this paper we work only with finite posets. We define standard posets here as ones that can be used to construct weight bases of $m^\text{th}$ symmetric powers ($m \ge 1$) of these minuscule Kac--Moody representations over the integers in a certain fashion. Our main result is to show that our ``$\Gamma$-colored $d$-complete'' and ``$\Gamma$-colored minuscule'' posets are standard. When the algebra at hand is a simply laced simple Lie algebra and the representation minuscule in the classic sense (i.e. isomorphic to irreducible $V(\lambda)$ for minuscule highest weight $\lambda$), our result produces a concrete combinatorially described weight basis for the irreducible representation $V(m\lambda)$ that is indexed in a natural fashion by $m$-multichains in the weight lattice for $V(\lambda)$. C.S. Seshadri first showed such an indexing of a basis is possible. Our work here is entirely combinatorial and does not use results or techniques from algebraic geometry. Constructions in this paper are independent of Lie type and actions of Kac--Moody algebra elements on basis vectors are effectively specified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02956v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the electrical Lie algebras originally introduced by Lam and Pylyavskyy in several ways. To each Kac-Moody Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ we associate two types (vertex type and edge type) of the generalized electrical algebras. The electrical Lie algebras of vertex type are always subalgebras of $\mathfrak{g}$ and are flat deformations of the nilpotent Lie subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}$. In many cases including $sl_n$, $so_n$, and $sp_{2n}$ we find new (edge) models for our generalized electrical Lie algebras of vertex type. Finding an edge model in general is an interesting an open problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare two generalisations of the notion of hook lengths for partitions. We apply this in the context of the modular representation theory of Ariki-Koike algebras. We show that the Schur element of a simple module is divisible by the Schur element of the associated (generalised) core. In the case of Hecke algebras of type $A$, we obtain an even stronger result: the Schur element of a simple module is equal to the product of the Schur element of its core and the Schur element of its quotient.</description>

Abstract: We prove a generalization of the Jacobian criterion of Fargues-Scholze for spaces of sections of a smooth quasi-projective variety over the Fargues-Fontaine curve. Namely, we show how to use their criterion to deduce an analogue for spaces of sections of a smooth Artin stack over the (schematic) Fargues-Fontaine curve obtained by taking the stack quotient of a smooth quasi-projective variety by the action of a linear algebraic group. As an application, we show various moduli stacks appearing in the Fargues-Scholze geometric Langlands program are cohomologically smooth Artin $v$-stacks and compute their $\ell$-dimensions.</description>

Abstract: Let $W$ be a simply laced Weyl group of finite type and rank $n$. If $W$ has type $E_7$, $E_8$, or $D_n$ for $n$ even, then the root system of $W$ has subsystems of type $nA_1$. This gives rise to an irreducible Macdonald representation of $W$ spanned by $n$-roots, which are products of $n$ orthogonal roots in the symmetric algebra of the reflection representation. We prove that in these cases, the set of all maximal sets of orthogonal positive roots has the structure of a quasiparabolic set in the sense of Rains--Vazirani. The quasiparabolic structure can be described in terms of certain quadruples of orthogonal positive roots which we call crossings, nestings, and alignments. This leads to nonnesting and noncrossing bases for the Macdonald representation, as well as some highly structured partially ordered sets. We use the $8$-roots in type $E_8$ to give a concise description of a graph that is known to be non-isomorphic but quantum isomorphic to the orthogonality graph of the $E_8$ root system.</description>

      <title>Fused Specht Polynomials and $c=1$ Degenerate Conformal Blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09798v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of polynomials that we call fused Specht polynomials and use them to characterize irreducible representations of the fused Hecke algebra with parameter $q=-1$ in the space of polynomials. We apply the fused Specht polynomials to construct a basis for a space of holomorphic (chiral) conformal blocks with central charge $c=1$ which are degenerate at each point. In conformal field theory, this corresponds to all primary fields having conformal weight in the Kac table. The associated correlation functions are expected to give rise to conformally invariant boundary conditions for the Gaussian free field, which has also been verified in special cases.</description>

      <title>Semi-Orthogonal Decompositions for Rank Two Imprimitive Reflection Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For every imprimitive complex reflection group of rank 2, we construct a semi-orthogonal decomposition of the derived category of the associated global quotient stack which categorifies the usual decomposition of the orbifold cohomology indexed by conjugacy classes. This confirms a conjecture of Polishchuk and Van den Bergh in these cases. This conjecture was recently also proved by Ishii and Nimura for arbitrary complex reflection groups of rank 2 and real reflection groups of rank 3, but our approach is very different.</description>
