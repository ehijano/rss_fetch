      <title>An Exponential Averaging Process with Strong Convergence Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Averaging, or smoothing, is a fundamental approach to obtain stable, de-noised estimates from noisy observations. In certain scenarios, observations made along trajectories of random dynamical systems are of particular interest. One popular smoothing technique for such a scenario is exponential moving averaging (EMA), which assigns observations a weight that decreases exponentially in their age, thus giving younger observations a larger weight. However, EMA fails to enjoy strong stochastic convergence properties, which stems from the fact that the weight assigned to the youngest observation is constant over time, preventing the noise in the averaged quantity from decreasing to zero. In this work, we consider an adaptation to EMA, which we call $p$-EMA, where the weights assigned to the last observations decrease to zero at a subharmonic rate. We provide stochastic convergence guarantees for this kind of averaging under mild assumptions on the autocorrelations of the underlying random dynamical system. We further discuss the implications of our results for a recently introduced adaptive step size control for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), which uses $p$-EMA for averaging noisy observations.</description>

      <title>Minimax learning rates for estimating binary classifiers under margin conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study classification problems using binary estimators where the decision boundary is described by horizon functions and where the data distribution satisfies a geometric margin condition. We establish upper and lower bounds for the minimax learning rate over broad function classes with bounded Kolmogorov entropy in Lebesgue norms. A key novelty of our work is the derivation of lower bounds on the worst-case learning rates under a geometric margin condition -- a setting that is almost universally satisfied in practice but remains theoretically challenging. Moreover, our results deal with the noiseless setting, where lower bounds are particularly hard to establish. We apply our general results to classification problems with decision boundaries belonging to several function classes: for Barron-regular functions, and for H\"older-continuous functions with strong margins, we identify optimal rates close to the fast learning rates of $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1})$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ samples. Also for merely convex decision boundaries, in a strong margin case optimal rates near $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})$ can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Supervised Models Can Generalize Also When Trained on Random Label</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of unsupervised learning raises the question of whether also supervised models can be trained without using the information in the output $y$. In this paper, we demonstrate that this is indeed possible. The key step is to formulate the model as a smoother, i.e. on the form $\hat{f}=Sy$, and to construct the smoother matrix $S$ independently of $y$, e.g. by training on random labels. We present a simple model selection criterion based on the distribution of the out-of-sample predictions and show that, in contrast to cross-validation, this criterion can be used also without access to $y$. We demonstrate on real and synthetic data that $y$-free trained versions of linear and kernel ridge regression, smoothing splines, and neural networks perform similarly to their standard, $y$-based, versions and, most importantly, significantly better than random guessing.</description>

      <title>Inexact Column Generation for Bayesian Network Structure Learning via Difference-of-Submodular Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a score-based Integer Programming (IP) approach for solving the Bayesian Network Structure Learning (BNSL) problem. State-of-the-art BNSL IP formulations suffer from the exponentially large number of variables and constraints. A standard approach in IP to address such challenges is to employ row and column generation techniques, which dynamically generate rows and columns, while the complex pricing problem remains a computational bottleneck for BNSL. For the general class of $\ell_0$-penalized likelihood scores, we show how the pricing problem can be reformulated as a difference of submodular optimization problem, and how the Difference of Convex Algorithm (DCA) can be applied as an inexact method to efficiently solve the pricing problems. Empirically, we show that, for continuous Gaussian data, our row and column generation approach yields solutions with higher quality than state-of-the-art score-based approaches, especially when the graph density increases, and achieves comparable performance against benchmark constraint-based and hybrid approaches, even when the graph size increases.</description>

      <title>Nash: Neural Adaptive Shrinkage for Structured High-Dimensional Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse linear regression is a fundamental tool in data analysis. However, traditional approaches often fall short when covariates exhibit structure or arise from heterogeneous sources. In biomedical applications, covariates may stem from distinct modalities or be structured according to an underlying graph. We introduce Neural Adaptive Shrinkage (Nash), a unified framework that integrates covariate-specific side information into sparse regression via neural networks. Nash adaptively modulates penalties on a per-covariate basis, learning to tailor regularization without cross-validation. We develop a variational inference algorithm for efficient training and establish connections to empirical Bayes regression. Experiments on real data demonstrate that Nash can improve accuracy and adaptability over existing methods.</description>

      <title>On Next-Token Prediction in LLMs: How End Goals Determine the Consistency of Decoding Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic next-token prediction trained using cross-entropy loss is the basis of most large language models. Given a sequence of previous values, next-token prediction assigns a probability to each possible next value in the vocabulary. There are many ways to use next-token prediction to output token sequences. This paper examines a few of these algorithms (greedy, lookahead, random sampling, and temperature-scaled random sampling) and studies their consistency with respect to various goals encoded as loss functions. Although consistency of surrogate losses with respect to a target loss function is a well researched topic, we are the first to study it in the context of LLMs (to the best of our knowledge). We find that, so long as next-token prediction converges to its true probability distribution, random sampling is consistent with outputting sequences that mimic sampling from the true probability distribution. For the other goals, such as minimizing the 0-1 loss on the entire sequence, we show no polynomial-time algorithm is optimal for all probability distributions and all decoding algorithms studied are only optimal for a subset of probability distributions. When analyzing these results, we see that there is a dichotomy created between the goals of information retrieval and creative generation for the decoding algorithms. This shows that choosing the correct decoding algorithm based on the desired goal is extremely important and many of the ones used are lacking theoretical grounding in numerous scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Fourier Space Perspective on Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models are state-of-the-art generative models on data modalities such as images, audio, proteins and materials. These modalities share the property of exponentially decaying variance and magnitude in the Fourier domain. Under the standard Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) forward process of additive white noise, this property results in high-frequency components being corrupted faster and earlier in terms of their Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) than low-frequency ones. The reverse process then generates low-frequency information before high-frequency details. In this work, we study the inductive bias of the forward process of diffusion models in Fourier space. We theoretically analyse and empirically demonstrate that the faster noising of high-frequency components in DDPM results in violations of the normality assumption in the reverse process. Our experiments show that this leads to degraded generation quality of high-frequency components. We then study an alternate forward process in Fourier space which corrupts all frequencies at the same rate, removing the typical frequency hierarchy during generation, and demonstrate marked performance improvements on datasets where high frequencies are primary, while performing on par with DDPM on standard imaging benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Linear Embedding for Nonstationary High-Dimensional Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) in high-dimensional spaces remains fundamentally limited by the curse of dimensionality and the rigidity of global low-dimensional assumptions. While Random EMbedding Bayesian Optimization (REMBO) mitigates this via linear projections into low-dimensional subspaces, it typically assumes a single global embedding and a stationary objective. In this work, we introduce Self-Adaptive embedding REMBO (SA-REMBO), a novel framework that generalizes REMBO to support multiple random Gaussian embeddings, each capturing a different local subspace structure of the high-dimensional objective. An index variable governs the embedding choice and is jointly modeled with the latent optimization variable via a product kernel in a Gaussian Process surrogate. This enables the optimizer to adaptively select embeddings conditioned on location, effectively capturing locally varying effective dimensionality, nonstationarity, and heteroscedasticity in the objective landscape. We theoretically analyze the expressiveness and stability of the index-conditioned product kernel and empirically demonstrate the advantage of our method across synthetic and real-world high-dimensional benchmarks, where traditional REMBO and other low-rank BO methods fail. Our results establish SA-REMBO as a powerful and flexible extension for scalable BO in complex, structured design spaces.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rates of Constrained Expected Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constrained Bayesian optimization (CBO) methods have seen significant success in black-box optimization with constraints, and one of the most commonly used CBO methods is the constrained expected improvement (CEI) algorithm. CEI is a natural extension of the expected improvement (EI) when constraints are incorporated. However, the theoretical convergence rate of CEI has not been established. In this work, we study the convergence rate of CEI by analyzing its simple regret upper bound. First, we show that when the objective function $f$ and constraint function $c$ are assumed to each lie in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), CEI achieves the convergence rates of $\mathcal{O} \left(t^{-\frac{1}{2}}\log^{\frac{d+1}{2}}(t) \right) \ \text{and }\ \mathcal{O}\left(t^{\frac{-\nu}{2\nu+d}} \log^{\frac{\nu}{2\nu+d}}(t)\right)$ for the commonly used squared exponential and Mat\'{e}rn kernels, respectively. Second, we show that when $f$ and $c$ are assumed to be sampled from Gaussian processes (GPs), CEI achieves the same convergence rates with a high probability. Numerical experiments are performed to validate the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>STRIDE: Sparse Techniques for Regression in Deep Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) have gained popularity as flexible machine learning models for regression and function approximation with an in-built method for uncertainty quantification. However, GPs suffer when the amount of training data is large or when the underlying function contains multi-scale features that are difficult to represent by a stationary kernel. To address the former, training of GPs with large-scale data is often performed through inducing point approximations (also known as sparse GP regression (GPR)), where the size of the covariance matrices in GPR is reduced considerably through a greedy search on the data set. To aid the latter, deep GPs have gained traction as hierarchical models that resolve multi-scale features by combining multiple GPs. Posterior inference in deep GPs requires a sampling or, more usual, a variational approximation. Variational approximations lead to large-scale stochastic, non-convex optimisation problems and the resulting approximation tends to represent uncertainty incorrectly. In this work, we combine variational learning with MCMC to develop a particle-based expectation-maximisation method to simultaneously find inducing points within the large-scale data (variationally) and accurately train the GPs (sampling-based). The result is a highly efficient and accurate methodology for deep GP training on large-scale data. We test our method on standard benchmark problems.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically-Optimal Gaussian Bandits with Side Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of Gaussian bandits with general side information, as first introduced by Wu, Szepesvari, and Gyorgy. In this setting, the play of an arm reveals information about other arms, according to an arbitrary a priori known side information matrix: each element of this matrix encodes the fidelity of the information that the ``row'' arm reveals about the ``column'' arm. In the case of Gaussian noise, this model subsumes standard bandits, full-feedback, and graph-structured feedback as special cases. In this work, we first construct an LP-based asymptotic instance-dependent lower bound on the regret. The LP optimizes the cost (regret) required to reliably estimate the suboptimality gap of each arm. This LP lower bound motivates our main contribution: the first known asymptotically optimal algorithm for this general setting.</description>

      <title>On DeepSeekMoE: Statistical Benefits of Shared Experts and Normalized Sigmoid Gating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixture of experts (MoE) methods are a key component in most large language model architectures, including the recent series of DeepSeek models. Compared to other MoE implementations, DeepSeekMoE stands out because of two unique features: the deployment of a shared expert strategy and of the normalized sigmoid gating mechanism. Despite the prominent role of DeepSeekMoE in the success of the DeepSeek series of models, there have been only a few attempts to justify theoretically the value of the shared expert strategy, while its normalized sigmoid gating has remained unexplored. To bridge this gap, we undertake a comprehensive theoretical study of these two features of DeepSeekMoE from a statistical perspective. We perform a convergence analysis of the expert estimation task to highlight the gains in sample efficiency for both the shared expert strategy and the normalized sigmoid gating, offering useful insights into the design of expert and gating structures. To verify empirically our theoretical findings, we carry out several experiments on both synthetic data and real-world datasets for (vision) language modeling tasks. Finally, we conduct an extensive empirical analysis of the router behaviors, ranging from router saturation, router change rate, to expert utilization.</description>

      <title>Hashing for Structure-based Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on the problem of identifying samples in a set that do not conform to structured patterns represented by low-dimensional manifolds. An effective way to solve this problem is to embed data in a high dimensional space, called Preference Space, where anomalies can be identified as the most isolated points. In this work, we employ Locality Sensitive Hashing to avoid explicit computation of distances in high dimensions and thus improve Anomaly Detection efficiency. Specifically, we present an isolation-based anomaly detection technique designed to work in the Preference Space which achieves state-of-the-art performance at a lower computational cost. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/ineveLoppiliF/Hashing-for-Structure-based-Anomaly-Detection.</description>

      <title>Preference Isolation Forest for Structure-based Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of detecting anomalies as samples that do not conform to structured patterns represented by low-dimensional manifolds. To this end, we conceive a general anomaly detection framework called Preference Isolation Forest (PIF), that combines the benefits of adaptive isolation-based methods with the flexibility of preference embedding. The key intuition is to embed the data into a high-dimensional preference space by fitting low-dimensional manifolds, and to identify anomalies as isolated points. We propose three isolation approaches to identify anomalies: $i$) Voronoi-iForest, the most general solution, $ii$) RuzHash-iForest, that avoids explicit computation of distances via Local Sensitive Hashing, and $iii$) Sliding-PIF, that leverages a locality prior to improve efficiency and effectiveness.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the approximation and generalization abilities of score-based neural network generative models (SGMs) in estimating an unknown distribution $P_0$ from $n$ i.i.d. observations in $d$ dimensions. Assuming merely that $P_0$ is $\alpha$-sub-Gaussian, we prove that for any time step $t \in [t_0, n^{O(1)}]$, where $t_0 \geq O(\alpha^2n^{-2/d}\log n)$, there exists a deep ReLU neural network with width $\leq O(\log^3n)$ and depth $\leq O(n^{3/d}\log_2n)$ that can approximate the scores with $\tilde{O}(n^{-1})$ mean square error and achieve a nearly optimal rate of $\tilde{O}(n^{-1}t_0^{-d/2})$ for score estimation, as measured by the score matching loss. Our framework is universal and can be used to establish convergence rates for SGMs under milder assumptions than previous work. For example, assuming further that the target density function $p_0$ lies in Sobolev or Besov classes, with an appropriately early stopping strategy, we demonstrate that neural network-based SGMs can attain nearly minimax convergence rates up to logarithmic factors. Our analysis removes several crucial assumptions, such as Lipschitz continuity of the score function or a strictly positive lower bound on the target density.</description>

      <title>Global Convergence of Adaptive Sensing for Principal Eigenvector Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of efficient principal component analysis (PCA) in high-dimensional spaces by analyzing a compressively sampled variant of Oja's algorithm with adaptive sensing. Traditional PCA methods incur substantial computational costs that scale poorly with data dimensionality, whereas subspace tracking algorithms like Oja's offer more efficient alternatives but typically require full-dimensional observations. We analyze a variant where, at each iteration, only two compressed measurements are taken: one in the direction of the current estimate and one in a random orthogonal direction. We prove that this adaptive sensing approach achieves global convergence in the presence of noise when tracking the leading eigenvector of a datastream with eigengap $\Delta=\lambda_1-\lambda_2$. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the algorithm experiences two phases: (1) a warmup phase requiring $O(\lambda_1\lambda_2d^2/\Delta^2)$ iterations to achieve a constant-level alignment with the true eigenvector, followed by (2) a local convergence phase where the sine alignment error decays at a rate of $O(\lambda_1\lambda_2d^2/\Delta^2 t)$ for iterations $t$. The guarantee aligns with existing minimax lower bounds with an added factor of $d$ due to the compressive sampling. This work provides the first convergence guarantees in adaptive sensing for subspace tracking with noise. Our proof technique is also considerably simpler than those in prior works. The results have important implications for applications where acquiring full-dimensional samples is challenging or costly.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Informed Convolutional Long Short Term Memory Statistical Model for Fluid Thermodynamics Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid thermodynamics underpins atmospheric dynamics, climate science, industrial applications, and energy systems. However, direct numerical simulations (DNS) of such systems are computationally prohibitive. To address this, we present a novel physics-informed spatio-temporal surrogate model for Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC), a canonical example of convective fluid flow. Our approach combines convolutional neural networks for spatial feature extraction with an innovative recurrent architecture inspired by large language models, comprising a context builder and a sequence generator to capture temporal dynamics. Inference is penalized with respect to the governing partial differential equations to ensure physical interpretability. Given the sensitivity of turbulent convection to initial conditions, we quantify uncertainty using a conformal prediction framework. This model replicates key features of RBC dynamics while significantly reducing computational cost, offering a scalable alternative to DNS for long-term simulations.</description>

      <title>NeuralSurv: Deep Survival Analysis with Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce NeuralSurv, the first deep survival model to incorporate Bayesian uncertainty quantification. Our non-parametric, architecture-agnostic framework flexibly captures time-varying covariate-risk relationships in continuous time via a novel two-stage data-augmentation scheme, for which we establish theoretical guarantees. For efficient posterior inference, we introduce a mean-field variational algorithm with coordinate-ascent updates that scale linearly in model size. By locally linearizing the Bayesian neural network, we obtain full conjugacy and derive all coordinate updates in closed form. In experiments, NeuralSurv delivers superior calibration compared to state-of-the-art deep survival models, while matching or exceeding their discriminative performance across both synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets. Our results demonstrate the value of Bayesian principles in data-scarce regimes by enhancing model calibration and providing robust, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates for the survival function.</description>

      <title>A Fast Kernel-based Conditional Independence test with Application to Causal Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kernel-based conditional independence (KCI) testing is a powerful nonparametric method commonly employed in causal discovery tasks. Despite its flexibility and statistical reliability, cubic computational complexity limits its application to large datasets. To address this computational bottleneck, we propose \textit{FastKCI}, a scalable and parallelizable kernel-based conditional independence test that utilizes a mixture-of-experts approach inspired by embarrassingly parallel inference techniques for Gaussian processes. By partitioning the dataset based on a Gaussian mixture model over the conditioning variables, FastKCI conducts local KCI tests in parallel, aggregating the results using an importance-weighted sampling scheme. Experiments on synthetic datasets and benchmarks on real-world production data validate that FastKCI maintains the statistical power of the original KCI test while achieving substantial computational speedups. FastKCI thus represents a practical and efficient solution for conditional independence testing in causal inference on large-scale data.</description>

      <title>Lasso and Partially-Rotated Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the sparse linear regression model $\mathbf{y} = X \beta +\mathbf{w}$, where $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ is the design, $\beta \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ is a $k$-sparse secret, and $\mathbf{w} \sim N(0, I_n)$ is the noise. Given input $X$ and $\mathbf{y}$, the goal is to estimate $\beta$. In this setting, the Lasso estimate achieves prediction error $O(k \log d / \gamma n)$, where $\gamma$ is the restricted eigenvalue (RE) constant of $X$ with respect to $\mathrm{support}(\beta)$. In this paper, we introduce a new $\textit{semirandom}$ family of designs -- which we call $\textit{partially-rotated}$ designs -- for which the RE constant with respect to the secret is bounded away from zero even when a subset of the design columns are arbitrarily correlated among themselves.
  As an example of such a design, suppose we start with some arbitrary $X$, and then apply a random rotation to the columns of $X$ indexed by $\mathrm{support}(\beta)$. Let $\lambda_{\min}$ be the smallest eigenvalue of $\frac{1}{n} X_{\mathrm{support}(\beta)}^\top X_{\mathrm{support}(\beta)}$, where $X_{\mathrm{support}(\beta)}$ is the restriction of $X$ to the columns indexed by $\mathrm{support}(\beta)$. In this setting, our results imply that Lasso achieves prediction error $O(k \log d / \lambda_{\min} n)$ with high probability. This prediction error bound is independent of the arbitrary columns of $X$ not indexed by $\mathrm{support}(\beta)$, and is as good as if all of these columns were perfectly well-conditioned.
  Technically, our proof reduces to showing that matrices with a certain deterministic property -- which we call $\textit{restricted normalized orthogonality}$ (RNO) -- lead to RE constants that are independent of a subset of the matrix columns. This property is similar but incomparable with the restricted orthogonality condition of [CT05].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning is a distributed learning framework where clients collaboratively train a global model without sharing their raw data. FedAvg is a popular algorithm for federated learning, but it often suffers from slow convergence due to the heterogeneity of local datasets and anisotropy in the parameter space. In this work, we formalize the central server optimization procedure through the lens of mirror descent and propose a novel framework, called FedDuA, which adaptively selects the global learning rate based on both inter-client and coordinate-wise heterogeneity in the local updates. We prove that our proposed doubly adaptive step-size rule is minimax optimal and provide a convergence analysis for convex objectives. Although the proposed method does not require additional communication or computational cost on clients, extensive numerical experiments show that our proposed framework outperforms baselines in various settings and is robust to the choice of hyperparameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present JaxSGMC, an application-agnostic library for stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) in JAX. SG-MCMC schemes are uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods that scale to large datasets and high-dimensional models, enabling trustworthy neural network predictions via Bayesian deep learning. JaxSGMC implements several state-of-the-art SG-MCMC samplers to promote UQ in deep learning by reducing the barriers of entry for switching from stochastic optimization to SG-MCMC sampling. Additionally, JaxSGMC allows users to build custom samplers from standard SG-MCMC building blocks. Due to this modular structure, we anticipate that JaxSGMC will accelerate research into novel SG-MCMC schemes and facilitate their application across a broad range of domains.</description>

      <title>Minimizing False-Positive Attributions in Explanations of Non-Linear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppressor variables can influence model predictions without being dependent on the target outcome and they pose a significant challenge for Explainable AI (XAI) methods. These variables may cause false-positive feature attributions, undermining the utility of explanations. Although effective remedies exist for linear models, their extension to non-linear models and to instance-based explanations has remained limited. We introduce PatternLocal, a novel XAI technique that addresses this gap. PatternLocal begins with a locally linear surrogate, e.g. LIME, KernelSHAP, or gradient-based methods, and transforms the resulting discriminative model weights into a generative representation, thereby suppressing the influence of suppressor variables while preserving local fidelity. In extensive hyperparameter optimization on the XAI-TRIS benchmark, PatternLocal consistently outperformed other XAI methods and reduced false-positive attributions when explaining non-linear tasks, thereby enabling more reliable and actionable insights.</description>

Abstract: We propose Bayesian Hierarchical Invariant Prediction (BHIP) reframing Invariant Causal Prediction (ICP) through the lens of Hierarchical Bayes. We leverage the hierarchical structure to explicitly test invariance of causal mechanisms under heterogeneous data, resulting in improved computational scalability for a larger number of predictors compared to ICP. Moreover, given its Bayesian nature BHIP enables the use of prior information. In this paper, we test two sparsity inducing priors: horseshoe and spike-and-slab, both of which allow us a more reliable identification of causal features. We test BHIP in synthetic and real-world data showing its potential as an alternative inference method to ICP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To understand sensory coding, we must ask not only how much information neurons encode, but also what that information is about. This requires decomposing mutual information into contributions from individual stimuli and stimulus features fundamentally ill-posed problem with infinitely many possible solutions. We address this by introducing three core axioms, additivity, positivity, and locality that any meaningful stimulus-wise decomposition should satisfy. We then derive a decomposition that meets all three criteria and remains tractable for high-dimensional stimuli. Our decomposition can be efficiently estimated using diffusion models, allowing for scaling up to complex, structured and naturalistic stimuli. Applied to a model of visual neurons, our method quantifies how specific stimuli and features contribute to encoded information. Our approach provides a scalable, interpretable tool for probing representations in both biological and artificial neural systems.</description>

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have emerged as promising foundation models for prediction from tabular data sets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on small to moderate data sizes without tuning. While PFNs are motivated by Bayesian ideas, they do not provide any uncertainty quantification for predictive means, quantiles, or similar quantities. We propose a principled and efficient sampling procedure to construct Bayesian posteriors for such estimates based on Martingale posteriors, and prove its convergence. Several simulated and real-world data examples showcase the uncertainty quantification of our method in inference applications.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we take a fresh look at stochastic approximation (SA) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). We derive new sufficient conditions for the convergence of SA. In particular, the "noise" or measurement error need not have a finite second moment, and under suitable conditions, not even a finite mean. By adapting this method of proof, we also derive sufficient conditions for the convergence of zero-order SGD, wherein the stochastic gradient is computed using only two function evaluations, and no gradient computations. The sufficient conditions derived here are the weakest to date, thus leading to a considerable expansion of the applicability of SA and SGD theory.</description>

      <title>Controlling the Flow: Stability and Convergence for Stochastic Gradient Descent with Decaying Regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present article studies the minimization of convex, L-smooth functions defined on a separable real Hilbert space. We analyze regularized stochastic gradient descent (reg-SGD), a variant of stochastic gradient descent that uses a Tikhonov regularization with time-dependent, vanishing regularization parameter. We prove strong convergence of reg-SGD to the minimum-norm solution of the original problem without additional boundedness assumptions. Moreover, we quantify the rate of convergence and optimize the interplay between step-sizes and regularization decay. Our analysis reveals how vanishing Tikhonov regularization controls the flow of SGD and yields stable learning dynamics, offering new insights into the design of iterative algorithms for convex problems, including those that arise in ill-posed inverse problems. We validate our theoretical findings through numerical experiments on image reconstruction and ODE-based inverse problems.</description>

      <title>A Generative Framework for Causal Estimation via Importance-Weighted Diffusion Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating individualized treatment effects from observational data is a central challenge in causal inference, largely due to covariate imbalance and confounding bias from non-randomized treatment assignment. While inverse probability weighting (IPW) is a well-established solution to this problem, its integration into modern deep learning frameworks remains limited. In this work, we propose Importance-Weighted Diffusion Distillation (IWDD), a novel generative framework that combines the pretraining of diffusion models with importance-weighted score distillation to enable accurate and fast causal estimation-including potential outcome prediction and treatment effect estimation. We demonstrate how IPW can be naturally incorporated into the distillation of pretrained diffusion models, and further introduce a randomization-based adjustment that eliminates the need to compute IPW explicitly-thereby simplifying computation and, more importantly, provably reducing the variance of gradient estimates. Empirical results show that IWDD achieves state-of-the-art out-of-sample prediction performance, with the highest win rates compared to other baselines, significantly improving causal estimation and supporting the development of individualized treatment strategies. We will release our PyTorch code for reproducibility and future research.</description>

      <title>Welfare Analysis in Dynamic Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:1908.09173v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces metrics for welfare analysis in dynamic models. We develop estimation and inference for these parameters even in the presence of a high-dimensional state space. Examples of welfare metrics include average welfare, average marginal welfare effects, and welfare decompositions into direct and indirect effects similar to Oaxaca (1973) and Blinder (1973). We derive dual and doubly robust representations of welfare metrics that facilitate debiased inference. For average welfare, the value function does not have to be estimated. In general, debiasing can be applied to any estimator of the value function, including neural nets, random forests, Lasso, boosting, and other high-dimensional methods. In particular, we derive Lasso and Neural Network estimators of the value function and associated dynamic dual representation and establish associated mean square convergence rates for these functions. Debiasing is automatic in the sense that it only requires knowledge of the welfare metric of interest, not the form of bias correction. The proposed methods are applied to estimate a dynamic behavioral model of teacher absenteeism in \cite{DHR} and associated average teacher welfare.</description>

      <title>Auditing Fairness by Betting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17570v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide practical, efficient, and nonparametric methods for auditing the fairness of deployed classification and regression models. Whereas previous work relies on a fixed-sample size, our methods are sequential and allow for the continuous monitoring of incoming data, making them highly amenable to tracking the fairness of real-world systems. We also allow the data to be collected by a probabilistic policy as opposed to sampled uniformly from the population. This enables auditing to be conducted on data gathered for another purpose. Moreover, this policy may change over time and different policies may be used on different subpopulations. Finally, our methods can handle distribution shift resulting from either changes to the model or changes in the underlying population. Our approach is based on recent progress in anytime-valid inference and game-theoretic statistics-the "testing by betting" framework in particular. These connections ensure that our methods are interpretable, fast, and easy to implement. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on three benchmark fairness datasets.</description>

      <title>Changing the Kernel During Training Leads to Double Descent in Kernel Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate changing the bandwidth of a translational-invariant kernel during training when solving kernel regression with gradient descent. We present a theoretical bound on the out-of-sample generalization error that advocates for decreasing the bandwidth (and thus increasing the model complexity) during training. We further use the bound to show that kernel regression exhibits a double descent behavior when the model complexity is expressed as the minimum allowed bandwidth during training. Decreasing the bandwidth all the way to zero results in benign overfitting, and also circumvents the need for model selection. We demonstrate the double descent behavior on real and synthetic data and also demonstrate that kernel regression with a decreasing bandwidth outperforms that of a constant bandwidth, selected by cross-validation or marginal likelihood maximization. We finally apply our findings to neural networks, demonstrating that by modifying the neural tangent kernel (NTK) during training, making the NTK behave as if its bandwidth were decreasing to zero, we can make the network overfit more benignly, and converge in fewer iterations.</description>

      <title>On the Nonconvexity of Push-Forward Constraints and Its Consequences in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The push-forward operation enables one to redistribute a probability measure through a deterministic map. It plays a key role in statistics and optimization: many learning problems (notably from optimal transport, generative modeling, and algorithmic fairness) include constraints or penalties framed as push-forward conditions on the model. However, the literature lacks general theoretical insights on the (non)convexity of such constraints and its consequences on the associated learning problems. This paper aims at filling this gap. In the first part, we provide a range of sufficient and necessary conditions for the (non)convexity of two sets of functions: the maps transporting one probability measure to another and the maps inducing equal output distributions across distinct probability measures. This highlights that for most probability measures, these push-forward constraints are not convex. In the second part, we show how this result implies critical limitations on the design of convex optimization problems for learning generative models or groupwise fair predictors. This work will hopefully help researchers and practitioners have a better understanding of the critical impact of push-forward conditions onto convexity.</description>

      <title>Positional Encoder Graph Quantile Neural Networks for Geographic Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positional Encoder Graph Neural Networks (PE-GNNs) are among the most effective models for learning from continuous spatial data. However, their predictive distributions are often poorly calibrated, limiting their utility in applications that require reliable uncertainty quantification. We propose the Positional Encoder Graph Quantile Neural Network (PE-GQNN), a novel framework that combines PE-GNNs with Quantile Neural Networks, partially monotonic neural blocks, and post-hoc recalibration techniques. The PE-GQNN enables flexible and robust conditional density estimation with minimal assumptions about the target distribution, and it extends naturally to tasks beyond spatial data. Empirical results on benchmark datasets show that the PE-GQNN outperforms existing methods in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification, without incurring additional computational cost. We also provide theoretical insights and identify important special cases arising from our formulation, including the PE-GNN.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Statistical Tests for LLM-Generated Text Detection using Finite Sample Concentration Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02406v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Verifying the provenance of content is crucial to the function of many organizations, e.g., educational institutions, social media platforms, firms, etc. This problem is becoming increasingly challenging as text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) becomes almost indistinguishable from human-generated content. In addition, many institutions utilize in-house LLMs and want to ensure that external, non-sanctioned LLMs do not produce content within the institution. In this paper, we answer the following question: Given a piece of text, can we identify whether it was produced by a particular LLM or not? We model LLM-generated text as a sequential stochastic process with complete dependence on history. We then design zero-shot statistical tests to (i) distinguish between text generated by two different known sets of LLMs $A$ (non-sanctioned) and $B$ (in-house), and (ii) identify whether text was generated by a known LLM or generated by any unknown model, e.g., a human or some other language generation process. We prove that the type I and type II errors of our test decrease exponentially with the length of the text. For that, we show that if $B$ generates the text, then except with an exponentially small probability in string length, the log-perplexity of the string under $A$ converges to the average cross-entropy of $B$ and $A$. We then present experiments using LLMs with white-box access to support our theoretical results and empirically examine the robustness of our results to black-box settings and adversarial attacks. In the black-box setting, our method achieves an average TPR of 82.5\% at a fixed FPR of 5\%. Under adversarial perturbations, our minimum TPR is 48.6\% at the same FPR threshold. Both results outperform all non-commercial baselines. See https://github.com/TaraRadvand74/llm-text-detection for code, data, and an online demo of the project.</description>

      <title>Robust Amortized Bayesian Inference with Self-Consistency Losses on Unlabeled Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13483v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amortized Bayesian inference (ABI) with neural networks can solve probabilistic inverse problems orders of magnitude faster than classical methods. However, ABI is not yet sufficiently robust for widespread and safe application. When performing inference on observations outside the scope of the simulated training data, posterior approximations are likely to become highly biased, which cannot be corrected by additional simulations due to the bad pre-asymptotic behavior of current neural posterior estimators. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised approach that enables training not only on labeled simulated data generated from the model, but also on \textit{unlabeled} data originating from any source, including real data. To achieve this, we leverage Bayesian self-consistency properties that can be transformed into strictly proper losses that do not require knowledge of ground-truth parameters. We test our approach on several real-world case studies, including applications to high-dimensional time-series and image data. Our results show that semi-supervised learning with unlabeled data drastically improves the robustness of ABI in the out-of-simulation regime. Notably, inference remains accurate even when evaluated on observations far away from the labeled and unlabeled data seen during training.</description>

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have recently gained significant attention due to their ability to process complex discrete structures for language modeling. However, fine-tuning these models with policy gradient methods, as is commonly done in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), remains a challenging task. We propose an efficient, broadly applicable, and theoretically justified policy gradient algorithm, called Score Entropy Policy Optimization (SEPO), for fine-tuning discrete diffusion models over non-differentiable rewards. Our numerical experiments across several discrete generative tasks demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/ozekri/SEPO.</description>

      <title>Gradient-based Sample Selection for Faster Bayesian Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is an effective technique for black-box optimization. However, its applicability is typically limited to moderate-budget problems due to the cubic complexity in computing the Gaussian process (GP) surrogate model. In large-budget scenarios, directly employing the standard GP model faces significant challenges in computational time and resource requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, gradient-based sample selection Bayesian Optimization (GSSBO), to enhance the computational efficiency of BO. The GP model is constructed on a selected set of samples instead of the whole dataset. These samples are selected by leveraging gradient information to maintain diversity and representation. We provide a theoretical analysis of the gradient-based sample selection strategy and obtain explicit sublinear regret bounds for our proposed framework. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the computational cost of GP fitting in BO while maintaining optimization performance comparable to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Constrained Online Decision-Making: A Unified Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contextual online decision-making problems with constraints appear in various real-world applications, such as personalized recommendation with resource limits and dynamic pricing with fairness constraints. In this paper, we investigate a general formulation of sequential decision-making with stage-wise feasibility constraints, where at each round, the learner must select an action based on observed context while ensuring a problem-specific feasibility criterion. We propose a unified algorithmic framework that captures many existing constrained learning problems, including constrained bandits, stream active learning, online hypothesis testing, and model calibration. Central to our approach is the concept of upper counterfactual confidence bound, which enables the design of practically efficient online algorithms using any offline conditional density estimation oracle. Technically, to handle feasibility constraints, we introduce a generalized notion of the eluder dimension, extending it from the classical setting based on square loss to a broader class of metric-like probability divergences, which could capture the complexity of various density function classes and characterize the loss incurred due to feasibility constraint uncertainty. Our result offers a principled foundation for constrained sequential decision-making in both theory and practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.08993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The need to collect data via expensive measurements of black-box functions is prevalent across science, engineering and medicine. As an example, hyperparameter tuning of a large AI model is critical to its predictive performance but is generally time-consuming and unwieldy. Bayesian optimization (BO) is a collection of methods that aim to address this issue by means of Bayesian statistical inference. In this work, we put forward a BO scheme named BDC, which integrates BO with a statistical measure of association of two random variables called Distance Correlation. BDC balances exploration and exploitation automatically, and requires no manual hyperparameter tuning. We evaluate BDC on a range of benchmark tests and observe that it performs on per with popular BO methods such as the expected improvement and max-value entropy search. We also apply BDC to optimization of sequential integral observations of an unknown terrain and confirm its utility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.18233v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the inference procedure for eigenvectors of Tyler (1981), which assumes symmetrizable matrices to generic invariant and singular subspaces of non-diagonalisable matrices to test whether $\nu \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times r}$ is an element of an invariant subspace of $M \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}$. Our results include a Wald test for full-vector hypotheses and a $t$-test for coefficient-wise hypotheses. We employ perturbation expansions of invariant subspaces from Sun (1991) and singular subspaces from Liu et al. (2007). Based on the former, we extend the popular Davis-Kahan bound to estimations of its higher-order polynomials and study how the bound simplifies for eigenspaces but attains complexity for generic invariant subspaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We rigorously study the relation between the training dynamics via stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and the spectra of empirical Hessian and gradient matrices. We prove that in two canonical classification tasks for multi-class high-dimensional mixtures and either 1 or 2-layer neural networks, both the SGD trajectory and emergent outlier eigenspaces of the Hessian and gradient matrices align with a common low-dimensional subspace. Moreover, in multi-layer settings this alignment occurs per layer, with the final layer's outlier eigenspace evolving over the course of training, and exhibiting rank deficiency when the SGD converges to sub-optimal classifiers. This establishes some of the rich predictions that have arisen from extensive numerical studies in the last decade about the spectra of Hessian and information matrices over the course of training in overparametrized networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18304v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a versatile framework for statistical learning in non-stationary environments. In each time period, our approach applies a stability principle to select a look-back window that maximizes the utilization of historical data while keeping the cumulative bias within an acceptable range relative to the stochastic error. Our theory showcases the adaptivity of this approach to unknown non-stationarity. We prove regret bounds that are minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors when the population losses are strongly convex, or Lipschitz only. At the heart of our analysis lie two novel components: a measure of similarity between functions and a segmentation technique for dividing the non-stationary data sequence into quasi-stationary pieces. We evaluate the practical performance of our approach through real-data experiments on electricity demand prediction and hospital nurse staffing.</description>

      <title>Metric Embeddings Beyond Bi-Lipschitz Distortion via Sherali-Adams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metric embeddings are a widely used method in algorithm design, where generally a ``complex'' metric is embedded into a simpler, lower-dimensional one. Historically, the theoretical computer science community has focused on bi-Lipschitz embeddings, which guarantee that every pairwise distance is approximately preserved. In contrast, alternative embedding objectives that are commonly used in practice avoid bi-Lipschitz distortion; yet these approaches have received comparatively less study in theory. In this paper, we focus on Multi-dimensional Scaling (MDS), where we are given a set of non-negative dissimilarities $\{d_{i,j}\}_{i,j\in [n]}$ over $n$ points, and the goal is to find an embedding $\{x_1,\dots,x_n\} \subset R^k$ that minimizes $$\textrm{OPT}=\min_{x}\mathbb{E}_{i,j\in [n]}\left(1-\frac{\|x_i - x_j\|}{d_{i,j}}\right)^2.$$
  Despite its popularity, our theoretical understanding of MDS is extremely limited. Recently, Demaine et. al. (arXiv:2109.11505) gave the first approximation algorithm with provable guarantees for this objective, which achieves an embedding in constant dimensional Euclidean space with cost $\textrm{OPT} +\epsilon$ in $n^2\cdot 2^{\textrm{poly}(\Delta/\epsilon)}$ time, where $\Delta$ is the aspect ratio of the input dissimilarities. For metrics that admit low-cost embeddings, $\Delta$ scales polynomially in $n$. In this work, we give the first approximation algorithm for MDS with quasi-polynomial dependency on $\Delta$: for constant dimensional Euclidean space, we achieve a solution with cost $O(\log \Delta)\cdot \textrm{OPT}^{\Omega(1)}+\epsilon$ in time $n^{O(1)} \cdot 2^{\text{poly}((\log(\Delta)/\epsilon))}$. Our algorithms are based on a novel geometry-aware analysis of a conditional rounding of the Sherali-Adams LP Hierarchy, allowing us to avoid exponential dependency on the aspect ratio, which would typically result from this rounding.</description>

      <title>Discriminating image representations with principal distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image representations (artificial or biological) are often compared in terms of their global geometric structure; however, representations with similar global structure can have strikingly different local geometries. Here, we propose a framework for comparing a set of image representations in terms of their local geometries. We quantify the local geometry of a representation using the Fisher information matrix, a standard statistical tool for characterizing the sensitivity to local stimulus distortions, and use this as a substrate for a metric on the local geometry in the vicinity of a base image. This metric may then be used to optimally differentiate a set of models, by finding a pair of "principal distortions" that maximize the variance of the models under this metric. As an example, we use this framework to compare a set of simple models of the early visual system, identifying a novel set of image distortions that allow immediate comparison of the models by visual inspection. In a second example, we apply our method to a set of deep neural network models and reveal differences in the local geometry that arise due to architecture and training types. These examples demonstrate how our framework can be used to probe for informative differences in local sensitivities between complex models, and suggest how it could be used to compare model representations with human perception.</description>

      <title>Sparsing Law: Towards Large Language Models with Greater Activation Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02335v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Activation sparsity denotes the existence of substantial weakly-contributed elements within activation outputs that can be eliminated, benefiting many important applications concerned with large language models (LLMs). Although promoting greater activation sparsity within LLMs deserves deep studies, existing works lack comprehensive and quantitative research on the correlation between activation sparsity and potentially influential factors. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on the quantitative scaling properties and influential factors of the activation sparsity within decoder-only Transformer-based LLMs. Specifically, we propose PPL-$p\%$ sparsity, a precise and performance-aware activation sparsity metric that is applicable to any activation function. Through extensive experiments, we find several important phenomena. Firstly, different activation functions exhibit comparable performance but opposite training-time sparsity trends. The activation ratio (i.e., $1-\mathrm{sparsity\ ratio}$) evolves as a convergent increasing power-law and decreasing logspace power-law with the amount of training data for SiLU-activated and ReLU-activated LLMs, respectively. These demonstrate that ReLU is more efficient as the activation function than SiLU and can leverage more training data to improve activation sparsity. Secondly, the activation ratio linearly increases with the width-depth ratio below a certain bottleneck point, indicating the potential advantage of a deeper architecture at a fixed parameter scale. Finally, at similar width-depth ratios, we surprisingly find that the limit value of activation sparsity varies weakly with the parameter scale, i.e., the activation patterns within LLMs are insensitive to the parameter scale. These empirical laws towards LLMs with greater activation sparsity have important implications for making LLMs more efficient and interpretable.</description>

      <title>Strategic Classification with Randomised Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of strategic classification, where a learner must build a model to classify agents based on features that have been strategically modified. Previous work in this area has concentrated on the case when the learner is restricted to deterministic classifiers. In contrast, we perform a theoretical analysis of an extension to this setting that allows the learner to produce a randomised classifier. We show that, under certain conditions, the optimal randomised classifier can achieve better accuracy than the optimal deterministic classifier, but under no conditions can it be worse. When a finite set of training data is available, we show that the excess risk of Strategic Empirical Risk Minimisation over the class of randomised classifiers is bounded in a similar manner as the deterministic case. In both the deterministic and randomised cases, the risk of the classifier produced by the learner converges to that of the corresponding optimal classifier as the volume of available training data grows. Moreover, this convergence happens at the same rate as in the i.i.d. case. Our findings are compared with previous theoretical work analysing the problem of strategic classification. We conclude that randomisation has the potential to alleviate some issues that could be faced in practice without introducing any substantial downsides.</description>

      <title>Model Selection for Off-policy Evaluation: New Algorithms and Experimental Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Holdout validation and hyperparameter tuning from data is a long-standing problem in offline reinforcement learning (RL). A standard framework is to use off-policy evaluation (OPE) methods to evaluate and select the policies, but OPE either incurs exponential variance (e.g., importance sampling) or has hyperparameters on their own (e.g., FQE and model-based). In this work we focus on hyperparameter tuning for OPE itself, which is even more under-investigated. Concretely, we select among candidate value functions ("model-free") or dynamics ("model-based") to best assess the performance of a target policy. We develop: (1) new model-free and model-based selectors with theoretical guarantees, and (2) a new experimental protocol for empirically evaluating them. Compared to the model-free protocol in prior works, our new protocol allows for more stable generation and better control of candidate value functions in an optimization-free manner, and evaluation of model-free and model-based methods alike. We exemplify the protocol on Gym-Hopper, and find that our new model-free selector, LSTD-Tournament, demonstrates promising empirical performance.</description>

      <title>Local geometry of high-dimensional mixture models: Effective spectral theory and dynamical transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the local geometry of empirical risks in high dimensions via the spectral theory of their Hessian and information matrices. We focus on settings where the data, $(Y_\ell)_{\ell =1}^n\in \mathbb R^d$, are i.i.d. draws of a $k$-component Gaussian mixture model, and the loss depends on the projection of the data into a fixed number of vectors, namely $\mathbf{x}^\top Y$, where $\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^{d\times C}$ are the parameters, and $C$ need not equal $k$. This setting captures a broad class of problems such as classification by one and two-layer networks and regression on multi-index models. We prove exact formulas for the limits of the empirical spectral distribution and outlier eigenvalues and eigenvectors of such matrices in the proportional asymptotics limit, where the number of samples and dimension $n,d\to\infty$ and $n/d=\phi \in (0,\infty)$. These limits depend on the parameters $\mathbf{x}$ only through the summary statistic of the $(C+k)\times (C+k)$ Gram matrix of the parameters and class means, $\mathbf{G} = (\mathbf{x},\mathbf{\mu})^\top(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{\mu})$. It is known that under general conditions, when $\mathbf{x}$ is trained by stochastic gradient descent, the evolution of these same summary statistics along training converges to the solution of an autonomous system of ODEs, called the effective dynamics. This enables us to connect the spectral theory to the training dynamics. We demonstrate our general results by analyzing the effective spectrum along the effective dynamics in the case of multi-class logistic regression. In this setting, the empirical Hessian and information matrices have substantially different spectra, each with their own static and even dynamical spectral transitions.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding Gradient Flow Dynamics of Homogeneous Neural Networks Beyond the Origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent works exploring the training dynamics of homogeneous neural network weights under gradient flow with small initialization have established that in the early stages of training, the weights remain small and near the origin, but converge in direction. Building on this, the current paper studies the gradient flow dynamics of homogeneous neural networks with locally Lipschitz gradients, after they escape the origin. Insights gained from this analysis are used to characterize the first saddle point encountered by gradient flow after escaping the origin. Also, it is shown that for homogeneous feed-forward neural networks, under certain conditions, the sparsity structure emerging among the weights before the escape is preserved after escaping the origin and until reaching the next saddle point.</description>

      <title>Supervised contrastive learning from weakly-labeled audio segments for musical version matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16936v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting musical versions (different renditions of the same piece) is a challenging task with important applications. Because of the ground truth nature, existing approaches match musical versions at the track level (e.g., whole song). However, most applications require to match them at the segment level (e.g., 20s chunks). In addition, existing approaches resort to classification and triplet losses, disregarding more recent losses that could bring meaningful improvements. In this paper, we propose a method to learn from weakly annotated segments, together with a contrastive loss variant that outperforms well-studied alternatives. The former is based on pairwise segment distance reductions, while the latter modifies an existing loss following decoupling, hyper-parameter, and geometric considerations. With these two elements, we do not only achieve state-of-the-art results in the standard track-level evaluation, but we also obtain a breakthrough performance in a segment-level evaluation. We believe that, due to the generality of the challenges addressed here, the proposed methods may find utility in domains beyond audio or musical version matching.</description>

      <title>TwinTURBO: Semi-Supervised Fine-Tuning of Foundation Models via Mutual Information Decompositions for Downstream Task and Latent Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a semi-supervised fine-tuning framework for foundation models that utilises mutual information decomposition to address the challenges of training for a limited amount of labelled data. Our approach derives two distinct lower bounds: i) for the downstream task space, such as classification, optimised using conditional and marginal cross-entropy alongside Kullback-Leibler divergence, and ii) for the latent space representation, regularised and aligned using a contrastive-like decomposition. This fine-tuning strategy retains the pre-trained structure of the foundation model, modifying only a specialised projector module comprising a small transformer and a token aggregation technique. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate significant improvements in classification tasks under extremely low-labelled conditions by effectively leveraging unlabelled data.</description>

      <title>A Computational Theory for Efficient Mini Agent Evaluation with Causal Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21138v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to reduce the cost of experimental evaluation for agents, we introduce a computational theory of evaluation for mini agents: build evaluation model to accelerate the evaluation procedures. We prove upper bounds of generalized error and generalized causal effect error of given evaluation models for infinite agents. We also prove efficiency, and consistency to estimated causal effect from deployed agents to evaluation metric by prediction. To learn evaluation models, we propose a meta-learner to handle heterogeneous agents space problem. Comparing with existed evaluation approaches, our (conditional) evaluation model reduced 24.1\% to 99.0\% evaluation errors across 12 scenes, including individual medicine, scientific simulation, social experiment, business activity, and quantum trade. The evaluation time is reduced 3 to 7 order of magnitude per subject comparing with experiments or simulations.</description>

      <title>Ensuring Safety in an Uncertain Environment: Constrained MDPs via Stochastic Thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) with constraints against stochastic thresholds, aiming at the safety of reinforcement learning in unknown and uncertain environments. We leverage a Growing-Window estimator sampling from interactions with the uncertain and dynamic environment to estimate the thresholds, based on which we design Stochastic Pessimistic-Optimistic Thresholding (SPOT), a novel model-based primal-dual algorithm for multiple constraints against stochastic thresholds. SPOT enables reinforcement learning under both pessimistic and optimistic threshold settings. We prove that our algorithm achieves sublinear regret and constraint violation; i.e., a reward regret of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ while allowing an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ constraint violation over $T$ episodes. The theoretical guarantees show that our algorithm achieves performance comparable to that of an approach relying on fixed and clear thresholds. To the best of our knowledge, SPOT is the first reinforcement learning algorithm that realises theoretical guaranteed performance in an uncertain environment where even thresholds are unknown.</description>

      <title>Quantization Error Propagation: Revisiting Layer-Wise Post-Training Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Layer-wise PTQ is a promising technique for compressing large language models (LLMs), due to its simplicity and effectiveness without requiring retraining. However, recent progress in this area is saturating, underscoring the need to revisit its core limitations and explore further improvements. We address this challenge by identifying a key limitation of existing layer-wise PTQ methods: the growth of quantization errors across layers significantly degrades performance, particularly in low-bit regimes. To address this fundamental issue, we propose Quantization Error Propagation (QEP), a general, lightweight, and scalable framework that enhances layer-wise PTQ by explicitly propagating quantization errors and compensating for accumulated errors. QEP also offers a tunable propagation mechanism that prevents overfitting and controls computational overhead, enabling the framework to adapt to various architectures and resource budgets. Extensive experiments on several LLMs demonstrate that QEP-enhanced layer-wise PTQ achieves substantially higher accuracy than existing methods. Notably, the gains are most pronounced in the extremely low-bit quantization regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is crucial in machine learning, yet most (axiomatic) studies of uncertainty measures focus on classification, leaving a gap in regression settings with limited formal justification and evaluations. In this work, we introduce a set of axioms to rigorously assess measures of aleatoric, epistemic, and total uncertainty in supervised regression. By utilizing a predictive exponential family, we can generalize commonly used approaches for uncertainty representation and corresponding uncertainty measures. More specifically, we analyze the widely used entropy- and variance-based measures regarding limitations and challenges. Our findings provide a principled foundation for uncertainty quantification in regression, offering theoretical insights and practical guidelines for reliable uncertainty assessment.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Guided Sampling of Flat Modes in Discrete Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling from flat modes in discrete spaces is a crucial yet underexplored problem. Flat modes represent robust solutions and have broad applications in combinatorial optimization and discrete generative modeling. However, existing sampling algorithms often overlook the mode volume and struggle to capture flat modes effectively. To address this limitation, we propose \emph{Entropic Discrete Langevin Proposal} (EDLP), which incorporates local entropy into the sampling process through a continuous auxiliary variable under a joint distribution. The local entropy term guides the discrete sampler toward flat modes with a small overhead. We provide non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for EDLP in locally log-concave discrete distributions. Empirically, our method consistently outperforms traditional approaches across tasks that require sampling from flat basins, including Bernoulli distribution, restricted Boltzmann machines, combinatorial optimization, and binary neural networks.</description>

      <title>Density Ratio-based Causal Discovery from Bivariate Continuous-Discrete Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a causal discovery method for mixed bivariate data consisting of one continuous and one discrete variable. Existing constraint-based approaches are ineffective in the bivariate setting, as they rely on conditional independence tests that are not suited to bivariate data. Score-based methods either impose strong distributional assumptions or face challenges in fairly comparing causal directions between variables of different types, due to differences in their information content. We introduce a novel approach that determines causal direction by analyzing the monotonicity of the conditional density ratio of the continuous variable, conditioned on different values of the discrete variable. Our theoretical analysis shows that the conditional density ratio exhibits monotonicity when the continuous variable causes the discrete variable, but not in the reverse direction. This property provides a principled basis for comparing causal directions between variables of different types, free from strong distributional assumptions and bias arising from differences in their information content. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing superior accuracy compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Whitened Score Diffusion: A Structured Prior for Imaging Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional score-based diffusion models (DMs) may struggle with anisotropic Gaussian diffusion processes due to the required inversion of covariance matrices in the denoising score matching training objective \cite{vincent_connection_2011}. We propose Whitened Score (WS) diffusion models, a novel SDE-based framework that learns the Whitened Score function instead of the standard score. This approach circumvents covariance inversion, extending score-based DMs by enabling stable training of DMs on arbitrary Gaussian forward noising processes. WS DMs establish equivalence with FM for arbitrary Gaussian noise, allow for tailored spectral inductive biases, and provide strong Bayesian priors for imaging inverse problems with structured noise. We experiment with a variety of computational imaging tasks using the CIFAR and CelebA ($64\times64$) datasets and demonstrate that WS diffusion priors trained on anisotropic Gaussian noising processes consistently outperform conventional diffusion priors based on isotropic Gaussian noise.</description>
