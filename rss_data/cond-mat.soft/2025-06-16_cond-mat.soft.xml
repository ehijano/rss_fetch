      <title>Universal Scaling Laws for Deep Indentation Beyond the Hertzian Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep indentation of soft materials is ubiquitous across scales in nature and engineering, yet accurate predictions of contact behaviors under extreme deformations ($\delta/R &gt; 1$) remain elusive due to geometric and material nonlinearities. Here, we investigate the indentation of rigid spheres into soft elastic substrates, resolving the highly nonlinear regime where the sphere becomes fully submerged. A universal geometric mapping approach reveals Hertz-type pressure distributions in the deformed configuration, validated by FEA. Closed-form solutions for contact force and radius agree with simulations up to $\delta/R = 2.5$. Experiments spanning soft polymers (Ecoflex, PDMS), food substrates (tofu), and biological tissues (octopus) validate the derived scaling law for hyperelastic materials. Our results establish a universal framework for extreme mechanical interactions, with applications in soft robotics, bioengineered systems, and tissue mechanics.</description>

      <title>Vane rheology of a fiber-reinforced granular material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The addition of a small quantity of flexible fibers in a granular material is an efficient technique to increase the yield stress of the material. While the influence of fiber addition on the mechanical strength of granular media has been studied, much less is known about the flow properties of grain-fiber mixtures. In this article, we explore the effect of flexible fibers on the flow behavior of grain-fiber mixtures above the yield stress. We use a vane geometry to study the rheology of a dry granular material mixed with flexible fibers with different volume fractions and properties. The vane is immersed in the material, and the granular pressure increases with the depth of immersion. When the vane begins rotating, we observe a transient regime, which depends on the number of blades and is associated with the mobilization of material between the blades. Following this transient phase, a stationary regime is reached. By measuring and modeling the stationary flow that develops around the vane, we deduce the effective friction coefficient of the material from the torque measured on the vane. Following this approach, we investigate the effect of the fiber volume fraction and the aspect ratio on the effective friction coefficient of the grain-fiber mixture. Our results show that the effective friction coefficient increases linearly with fiber volume fraction and exponentially with fiber aspect ratio. These findings provide new fundamental insights into the flow properties of grain-fiber mixtures.</description>

      <title>Inverse Thermodynamics: Designing Interactions for Targeted Phase Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The traditional goal of inverse self-assembly is to design interactions that drive particles toward a desired target structure. However, achieving successful self-assembly also requires tuning the thermodynamic conditions under which the structure is stable. In this work, we extend the inverse design paradigm to explicitly address this challenge by developing a framework for inverse thermodynamics, i.e. the design of interaction potentials that realize specific thermodynamic behavior. As a step in this direction, using patchy particle mixtures as a model system, we demonstrate how precise control over both bonding topology and bond energetics enables the programming of targeted phase behavior. In particular, we establish design principles for azeotropic demixing and show how to create mixtures that exhibit azeotropy at any prescribed composition. Our predictions are validated through Gibbs-ensemble simulations [A.Z. Panagiotopoulos,Molecular Physics 61, 813-826 (1987)]. These results highlight the necessity of coupling structural design with thermodynamic engineering, and provide a blueprint for controlling complex phase behavior in multi-component systems.</description>

      <title>Bridging a gap: A heavy elastica between point supports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the deformation and slip-through of a heavy elastic beam suspended above two point supports and subject to an increasing body force -- an idealized model of a fibre trapped in the pores of a filter as flow strength increases, for example. Using both asymptotic and numerical techniques, we investigate the behaviour of the beam under increasing body force and the maximum force that can be supported before it must slip between the supports. We quantify this maximum body force as a function of the separation between the two supports. Surprisingly, we show the existence of a critical separation below which the beam can withstand an arbitrarily large body force, even in the absence of friction. This is understood as the limit of a catenary between the supports that is connected to (and supported by the tension in) a vertically hanging portion outside the supports. We explore how frictional forces impact the deformation and load-bearing capacity of the beam and show that our results are consistent with laboratory experiments.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of chiral nematics in a channel and sudden contraction geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of chirality, viscous effects, and confinement geometry on the flow dynamics and defect structures of cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) using numerical simulations. As chiral strength increases, $\pi$-twist defects form at low chirality and progressively organize into hexagonal domains resembling blue phase--like (BP-like) structures at higher chirality. At sufficiently high chirality and aspect ratios, skyrmion-like configurations emerge, indicating the formation of dynamic analogs of equilibrium phases under flow. Sudden contraction geometries reveal how aspect ratio and elastic interactions promote flow disturbances and defect development. Analyses of velocity and scalar order parameter ($S$) distributions demonstrate strong coupling between molecular alignment and hydrodynamic fields, with localized vortices forming around $\tau^-$ defects in regions of low $S$ and velocity. Temporal evaluations of velocity fluctuations uncover chaotic flow regimes at low Ericksen numbers, characterized by irregular defect motion and skewed probability density functions. These findings offer new insights into CLC structure formation and flow behavior, with potential applications in defect engineering, microfluidics, soft robotics, and photonic materials.</description>

      <title>Quick starch guide: A perspective on shear thickening in dense non-Brownian suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we provide a brief perspective on recent developments in the study of shear thickening in dense suspensions. We give a rapid overview of the state of the art and discuss current models aiming to describe this particular rheology. Although most of the experiments and simulation studies are conducted in "ideal" flows, where the sample is confined without an open boundary condition, we have decided to highlight more realistic flow conditions. We further provide an overview on how to relate the recently proposed constitutive models to these more practical flow conditions like pipe flow or flow down an incline.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Constrained Noise Yields Superdiffusive Dynamics in Axonal Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a coarse-grained stochastic model for axonal extension on periodic arrays of parallel micropatterns that integrates three key biophysical mechanisms: (i) the molecular clutch that couples actin retrograde flow to substrate adhesions, (ii) an active biopolymer-based mechanism generating traction-force fluctuations, and (iii) the mechanical interaction of the growth cone with the micropatterned substrate. Using the Shannon-Jaynes maximum entropy principle with constraints derived from experimental observations, we derive a unique probability distribution for the colored acceleration noise that enters the Langevin equation. The resulting stationary process exhibits power-law temporal correlations with negative exponent, which accounts for the observed superdiffusive dynamics of axons. For biologically relevant parameters the model predicts this exponent to be -1/2, in close quantitative agreement with measurements of cortical neurons cultured on patterned substrates.</description>

      <title>Compressed self-avoiding walks in two and three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the phase transition induced by compressing a self-avoiding walk in a slab where the walk is attached to both walls of the slab in two and three dimensions, and the resulting phase once the polymer is compressed. The process of moving between a stretched situation where the walls pull apart to a compressed scenario is a phase transition with some similarities to that induced by pulling and pushing the end of the polymer. However, there are key differences in that the compressed state is expected to behave like a lower dimensional system, which is not the case when the force pushes only on the endpoint of the polymer. We use scaling arguments to predict the exponents both of those associated with the phase transition and those in the compressed state and find good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Transport-Generated Signals Uncover Geometric Features of Evolving Branched Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Branched structures that evolve over time critically determine the function of various natural and engineered systems, including growing vasculature, neural arborization, pulmonary networks such as lungs, river basins, power distribution networks, and synthetic flow media. Inferring the underlying geometric properties of such systems and monitoring their structural and morphological evolution is therefore essential. However, this remains a major challenge due to limited access and the transient nature of the internal states. Here, we present a general framework for recovering the geometric features of evolving branched structures by analyzing the signals generated by tracer particles during transport. As tracers traverse the structure, they emit detectable pulses upon reaching a fixed observation point. We show that the statistical properties of this signal intensity -- which reflect underlying first-passage dynamics -- encode key structural features such as network extent, localized trapping frequency, and bias of motion (e.g., due to branch tapering). Crucially, this method enables inference from externally observable quantities, requiring no knowledge of individual particle trajectories or internal measurements. Our approach provides a scalable, non-invasive strategy for probing dynamic complex geometries across a wide range of systems.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity minimum with thickness in ultrathin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermal properties of solids under nanoscale confinement are currently not understood at the atomic level. Recent numerical studies have highlighted the presence of a minimum in the thermal conductivity as a function of thickness for ultrathin films at a thickness about 1-2 nm, which cannot be described by existing theories. We develop a theoretical description of thin films which predicts a new physical law for heat transfer at the nanoscale. In particular, due to the strong redistribution of phonon momentum states in reciprocal space (with a transition from a spherical Debye surface to a different homotopy group $\mathbb{Z}$ at strong confinement), the low-energy phonon density of states no longer follows Debye's law but rather a cubic law with frequency, which then crosses over to Debye's law at a crossover frequency proportional to the average speed of sound of the material and inversely proportional to the film thickness. Concomitantly, this implies that the phonon population becomes dominated by low-energy phonons as confinement increases, which then leads to a higher thermal conductivity under extreme confinement. The theory is able to reproduce the thermal conductivity minimum in recent molecular simulations data for ultrathin silicon and provides useful guidelines as to tune the minimum position based on the mechanical properties of the material.</description>

      <title>Entropy production in active Rouse polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active polymers are the archetype of nonequilibrium viscoelastic systems that constantly consume energy to produce motion. The activity of many biopolymers is essential to many life processes. The entropy production rate quantifies their nonequilibrium nature through the breaking of the time reversal symmetry. In this work we build an analytical model of active polymers as active Rouse polymers where the beads are active Ornstein Uhlenbeck particles and calculate their entropy production. The interactions between the beads are decoupled through the normal mode analysis and the entropy production can be solved analytically. We obtain the contribution of each Rouse mode in the entropy production and the dependence of the entropy production on the polymer properties like length. We find that the entropy production is zero for a passive Rouse polymer in the presence of thermal bath as well as for an active Rouse polymer in the absence of thermal bath. For an active chain in the presence of a thermal bath the entropy production is nonzero. In this case we find that the local temporal entropy production dominates the nonlocal entropy production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies liquid-model systems with almost identical constant-potential-energy hypersurfaces. We simulated continuous interpolations between such systems, specifically between the Lennard-Jones (LJ), Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA), exponent 12 inverse-power-law (IPL), and Yukawa (YK) pair-potential systems. Structure and dynamics were monitored via the radial distribution function and the time-dependent mean-square displacement, respectively. In terms of the interpolation parameter lambda, we argue that two systems have very similar constant-potential-energy hypersurfaces if the potential energies of configurations rarely cross when plotted as functions of lambda. Such absence of "level crossing" applies to a very good approximation for the LJ to WCA transformation, and it also applies to a quite good approximation for the LJ to IPL and the YK to YK transformations (the latter varies the screening length). In all cases, structure and dynamics are shown to be almost invariant as functions of lambda. The density is kept constant when lambda is varied. Temperature must generally be adjusted with lambda, which is done by an iterative "reduced-force-matching" method with no free parameters. We also apply the interpolation strategy to two versions of the Kob-Andersen (KA) binary LJ system and show that a recently introduced shifted-force-cutoff version of this system has constant-potential-energy hypersurfaces, which are almost identical to those of the original KA system. This result rationalizes the previously established fact that the two KA versions have virtually identical physics.</description>

      <title>Stochastic elastohydrodynamics of contact and coarsening during membrane adhesion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contact between fluctuating, fluid-lubricated soft surfaces is prevalent in engineering and biological systems, a process starting with adhesive contact, which can give rise to complex coarsening dynamics. One representation of such a system, which is relevant to biological membrane adhesion, is a fluctuating elastic interface covered by adhesive molecules that bind and unbind to a solid substrate across a narrow gap filled with a viscous fluid. This flow is described by the stochastic elastohydrodynamics thin-film equation, which combines the effects of viscous nanometric thin film flow, elastic membrane properties, adhesive springs, and thermal fluctuations. The average time it takes the fluctuating elastic membrane to adhere is predicted by the rare event theory, increasing exponentially with the square of the initial gap height. Numerical simulations reveal a phase separation of membrane domains driven by the binding and unbinding of adhesive molecules. The coarsening process displays close similarities to classical Ostwald ripening; however, the inclusion of hydrodynamics affects power-law growth. In particular, we identify a new bending-dominated coarsening regime, which is slower than the well-known tension-dominated case.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time multifarious systems -- Part I: equilibrium multifarious self-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multifarious assembly models consider multiple structures assembled from a shared set of components, reflecting the efficient usage of components in biological self-assembly. These models are subject to a high-dimensional parameter space, with only a finite region of parameter space giving reliable self-assembly. Here we use a continuous-time Gillespie simulation method to study multifarious self-assembly and find that the region of parameter space in which reliable self-assembly can be achieved is smaller than what was obtained previously using a discrete-time Monte Carlo simulation method. We explain this discrepancy through a detailed analysis of the stability of assembled structures against chimera formation. We find that our continuous-time simulations of multifarious self-assembly can expose this instability in large systems even at moderate simulation times. In contrast, discrete-time simulations are slow to show this instability, particularly for large system sizes. For the remaining state space we find good agreement between the predictions of continuous- and discrete-time simulations. We present physical arguments that can help us predict the state boundaries in the parameter space, and gain a deeper understanding of multifarious self-assembly.</description>

Abstract: In the context of self-assembly, where complex structures can be assembled from smaller units, it is desirable to devise strategies towards disassembly and reassembly processes that reuse the constituent parts. A non-reciprocal multifarious self-organization strategy has been recently introduced, and shown to have the capacity to exhibit this complex property. In this work, we study the model using continuous-time Gillespie simulations, and compare the results against discrete-time Monte Carlo simulations investigated previously. Furthermore, using the continuous-time simulations we explore important features in our system, namely, the nucleation time and interface growth velocity, which comprise the timescale of shape-shifting. We develop analytical calculations for the associated timescales and compare the results to those measured in simulations, allowing us to pin down the key mechanisms behind the observed timescales at different parameter values.</description>
