      <title>Zero Flux Localization: Magic Revealed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat bands correspond to the spatial localization of a quantum particle moving in a field with discrete or continuous translational invariance. The canonical example is the flat Landau levels in a homogeneous magnetic field. Several significant problems -- including flat bands in moir\'e structures -- are related to the problem of a particle moving in an inhomogeneous magnetic field with zero total flux. We demonstrate that while perfectly flat bands in such cases are impossible, the introduction of a "non-Abelian component" -- a spin field with zero total curvature -- can lead to perfect localization. Several exactly solvable models are constructed: (i) a half-space up/down field with a sharp 1D boundary; (ii) an alternating up/down field periodic in one direction on a cylinder; and (iii) a doubly periodic alternating field on a torus. The exact solution on the torus is expressed in terms of elliptic functions. It is shown that flat bands are only possible for certain magic values of the field corresponding to a quantized flux through an individual tile. These exact solutions clarify the simple structure underlying flat bands in moir\'e materials and provide a springboard for constructing a novel class of fractional quantum Hall states.</description>

      <title>Effect of noise on quantum circuit realization of non-Hermitian time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum dynamics lie in an intermediate regime between unitary Hamiltonian dynamics and trace-preserving non-unitary open quantum system dynamics. Given differences in the noise tolerance of unitary and non-unitary dynamics, it is interesting to consider implementing non-Hermitian dynamics on a noisy quantum computer. In this paper, we do so for a non-Hermitian Ising Floquet model whose many-body dynamics gives rise to persistent temporal oscillations, a form of time crystallinity. In the simplest two qubit case that we consider, there is an infinitely long-lived periodic steady state at certain fine-tuned points. These oscillations remain reasonably long-lived over a range of parameters in the ideal non-Hermitean dynamics and for the levels of noise and imperfection expected of modern day quantum devices. Using a generalized Floquet analysis, we show that infinitely long-lived oscillations are generically lost for arbitrarily weak values of common types of noise and compute corresponding damping rate. We perform simulations using IBM's Qiskit platform to confirm our findings; however, experiments on a real device (ibmq-lima) do not show remnants of these oscillations.</description>

      <title>Measuring the ultrafast screening of $U$ in photo-excited charge-transfer insulators with time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent seminal experiments have utilized time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to investigate the ultrafast photo-induced renormalization of the electron interaction (''Hubbard $U$'') in Mott and charge transfer insulators. In this paper, we analyze the change of interactions due to dynamical screening as it is encoded in the XAS signal, using the non-equilibrium GW+EDMFT formalism. Our study shows that XAS is well-suited for measuring this change, but two aspects should be kept in mind if the screening processes are not substantially faster than the valence electron dynamics: (i) Screening in a photo-excited system can affect both the position and the lineshape of the absorption lines. (ii) In general, the effect cannot be captured by the modification of a single interaction parameter. Specifically, an estimate for $\Delta U$ extracted from the shift of the XAS lines does not necessarily describe the related shift of the the upper Hubbard band. We clarify these aspects using a minimal cluster model and the three-band Emery model for a charge transfer insulator.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Phase Diagram of ErB$_4$ as Explored by Neutron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tetragonal $4f$-electron intermetallic ErB$_4$ is characterized by strong Ising anisotropy along the tetragonal $c$ axis. The magnetic moments on the erbium sites can be mapped onto a Shastry-Sutherland (SSL) lattice resulting in geometrical frustration. At zero magnetic field ErB$_4$ exhibits collinear columnar antiferromagnetic (CAFM) order below $T_\text{N} = 15.4$ K. In the presence of a magnetic field parallel to the $c$ axis, ErB$_4$ exhibits a plateau at $1/2$ of the saturation magnetization $M_\text{S}$, which arises at a spin flip transition at $H_1$ $=$ 1.9 T. Fractional magnetization plateaus and other exotic spin phases are a well-established characteristic feature of frustrated spin systems. Monte Carlo simulations propose that ErB$_4$ is an ideal candidate to feature a spin supersolid phase in close vicinity of $H_1$ between the CAFM and $M/M_\text{S}=1/2$ plateau (HP) phase. Here we combine single-crystal neutron diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering to study the magnetic phase diagram and the crystal electric field (CEF) ground state of ErB$_4$. Our measurements as a function of magnetic field find no signature of the spin supersolid phase but allow us to determine the magnetic structure of the HP phase to be of the uuud type consistent with an Ising material. The magnetic moment $\mu_{\mathrm{CEF}}$ $=$ 8.96 $\mu_B$ expected from the CEF configuration determined by our inelastic neutron scattering measurements is also consistent with the ordered moment observed in neutron diffraction showing that the moments are fully ordered and close to the Er$^{3+}$ free ion moment (9.6 $\mu_B$).</description>

      <title>Insulator to Metal Transition under High Pressure in FeNb$_3$Se$_{10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-magnetic FeNb$_3$Se$_{10}$ has been demonstrated to be an insulator at ambient pressure through both theoretical calculations and experimental measurements and it does not host topological surface states. Here we show that on the application of pressure, FeNb$_3$Se$_{10}$ transitions to a metallic state at around 3.0 GPa. With a further increase in pressure, its resistivity becomes independent of both temperature and pressure. Its crystal structure is maintained to at least 4.4 GPa.</description>

      <title>Imaginary-time Mpemba effect in quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various exotic phenomena emerge in non-equilibrium quantum many-body systems. The Mpemba effect, denoting the situation where a hot system freezes faster than the colder one, is a counterintuitive non-equilibrium phenomenon that has attracted enduring interest for more than half a century. In this Letter, we report a novel phenomenon of the Mpemba effect in the imaginary-time relaxation dynamics in quantum many-body systems, dubbed as imaginary-time Mpemba effect (ITME). Through numerically exact quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) simulation, we unambiguously demonstrate that in different classes of interacting quantum models, the initial states with higher energy are relaxed faster than lower-energy initial states in the process of imaginary-time relaxation. The emergence of ITME is intimately associated with the low-energy excitations in quantum many-body systems. More crucially, since imaginary-time dynamics is broadly applied in numerical simulation on the quantum many-body ground states, the discovery of ITME potentially provides a new pathway to expedite the quantum many-body computation, particularly for QMC involving the sign problem.</description>

      <title>Duality via Sequential Quantum Circuit in the Topological Holography Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two quantum theories which look different but are secretly describing the same low-energy physics are said to be dual to each other. When realized in the Topological Holography formalism, duality corresponds to changing the gapped boundary condition on the top boundary of a topological field theory, which determines the symmetry of the system, while not affecting the bottom boundary where all the dynamics take place. In this paper, we show that duality in the Topological Holography formalism can be realized with a Sequential Quantum Circuit applied to the top boundary. As a consequence, the Hamiltonians before and after the duality mapping have exactly the same spectrum in the corresponding symmetry sectors, and the entanglement in the corresponding low-energy eigenstates differs by at most an area law term.</description>

      <title>Suppression of the Mott insulating phase in the particle-hole asymmetric Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the phase diagram of the Mott metal-insulator transition (MIT), focusing on the effects of particle-hole asymmetry (PHA) in the single-band Hubbard model. Our dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) study reveals that the introduction of PHA in the model significantly influences the critical temperature ($T_c$) and interaction strength ($U_c$), as well as the size of the co-existence region of metallic and insulating phases at low temperatures. Specifically, as the system is moved away from particle-hole symmetry, $T_c$ decreases and $U_c$ increases, indicating a suppression of the insulating phase and the strengthening of the metallic behavior. Additionally, the first-order transition line between metallic and insulating phases is better defined in the model with PHA, leading to a reduced co-existence region at $T&lt;T_c$. Moreover, we propose that the MIT can be characterized by the charge density, which serves as a viable alternative to zero-frequency spectral density typically used in DMFT calculations. Our findings provide new insights into the role of particle-hole asymmetry in the qualitative and quantitative characterization of the MIT even in a very simple system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find that the double-threshold voltage-current characteristics in the insulating regime in the ultra-clean two-valley two-dimensional electron system in SiGe/Si/SiGe quantum wells are promoted by perpendicular magnetic fields, persisting to an order of magnitude lower voltages and considerably higher electron densities compared to the zero-field case. This observation indicates the perpendicular-magnetic-field stabilization of the quantum electron solid.</description>

      <title>Ternary nickel hydrides: a new platform for unconventional superconductivity and quantum magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose ternary nickel hydrides MNiH2 (M = Li, Na) as new materials that mimic cuprate physics but have important differences and interesting properties. Ni-H bands are wider than in oxides due to shorter bond lengths and covalency is larger than in Ni oxides which leads to a large scale of magnetic interactions. The charge transfer energy is smaller than in LaNiO2 which in cuprates translates to a larger Tc. We notice the formation of the electride band close to the Fermi surface which appears due to H vacancy along the c lattice vector. The considerable difference with cuprates arises from dz2 orbitals hybridization with interstitial orbitals allowing charge transfer to an apical vacancy state and self-doping the cuprate like Ni dx2-y2 H s antibonding bands which suggests that stoichiometric NaNiH2 may already be metallic and superconducting.</description>

      <title>Simulating real-time molecular electron dynamics efficiently using the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compared to ground state electronic structure optimizations, accurate simulations of molecular real-time electron dynamics are usually much more difficult to perform. To simulate electron dynamics, the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TDDMRG) has been shown to offer an attractive compromise between accuracy and cost. However, many simulation parameters significantly affect the quality and efficiency of a TDDMRG simulation. So far, it is unclear whether common wisdom from ground state DMRG carries over to the TDDMRG, and a guideline on how to choose these parameters is missing. Here, in order to establish such a guideline, we investigate the convergence behavior of the main TDDMRG simulation parameters, such as time integrator, the choice of orbitals, and the choice of MPS representation for complex-valued non-singlet states. In addition, we propose a method to select orbitals that are tailored to optimize the dynamics. Lastly, we showcase the TDDMRG by applying it to charge migration ionization dynamics in furfural, where we reveal a rapid conversion from an ionized state with a $\sigma$ character to one with a $\pi$ character within less than a femtosecond.</description>

      <title>Mathematical foundations of phonons in incommensurate materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In some models, periodic configurations can be shown to be stable under, both, global $\ell^2$ or local perturbations. This is not the case for aperiodic media. The specific class of aperiodic media we are interested, in arise from taking two 2D periodic crystals and stacking them parallel at a relative twist. In periodic media, phonons are generalized eigenvectors for a stability operator acting on $\ell^2$, coming from a mechanical energy. The goal of our analysis is to provide phonons in the given class of aperiodic media with meaning. As rigorously established for the 1D Frenkel-Kontorova model and previously applied by one of the authors, we assume that we can parametrize minimizing lattice deformations w.r.t. local perturbations via continuous stacking-periodic functions, for which we previously derived a continuous energy density functional. Such (continuous) energy densities are analytically and computationally much better accessible compared to discrete energy functionals. In order to pass to an $\ell^2$-based energy functional, we also study the offset energy w.r.t. given lattice deformations, under $\ell^1$-perturbations. Our findings show that, in the case of an undeformed bilayer heterostructure, while the energy density can be shown to be stable under the assumption of stability of individual layers, the offset energy fails to be stable in the case of twisted bilayer graphene. We then establish conditions for stability and instability of the offset energy w.r.t. the relaxed lattice. Finally, we show that, in the case of incommensurate bilayer homostructures, i.e., two equal layers, if we choose minimizing deformations according to the global energy density above, the offset energy is stable in the limit of zero twist angle. Consequently, in this case, one can then define phonons as generalized eigenvectors w.r.t. the stability operator associated with the offset energy.</description>

      <title>Exciton crystal melting and destruction by disorder in bilayer quantum hall system with total filling factor one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bilayer quantum hall system with total filling factor 1 was studied in the regime of heavy layer imbalance in a recent transport experiment (Ref. 1), with intriguing new findings. We demonstrate in this paper that 1) the exciton Wigner crystal in this regime can melt into a superfluid phase, giving rise to re-entrant superfluid behavior; 2) in the presence of disorder, electron and hole Wigner crystals in the two layers go through a locking/decoupling transition as layer separation increases, resulting in a sudden change in the counter flow conductance. Comparison will be made with the findings of Ref. 1.</description>

      <title>Absence of itinerant ferromagnetism in a cobalt-based oxypnictide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a layered transition-metal-ordered oxypnictide Sr$_{2}$CrCoAsO$_{3}$. The new material was synthesized by solid-state reactions under vacuum. It has an intergrowth structure with a perovskite-like Sr$_3$Cr$_2$O$_6$ unit and ThCr$_2$Si$_2$-type SrCo$_2$As$_2$ block stacking coherently along the crystallographic $c$ axis. The measurements of electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat indicate metallic conductivity from the CoAs layers and short-range antiferromagnetic ordering in the CrO$_{2}$ planes. No itinerant-electron ferromagnetism expected in CoAs layers is observed. This result, combined with the first-principles calculations and the previous reports of other CoAs-layer-based materials, suggests that the Co$-$Co bondlength plays a crucial role in the emergence of itinerant ferromagnetism.</description>

      <title>Simulating continuous-space systems with quantum-classical wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most non-relativistic interacting quantum many-body systems, such as atomic and molecular ensembles or materials, are naturally described in terms of continuous-space Hamiltonians. The simulation of their ground-state properties on digital quantum computers is challenging because current algorithms require discretization, which usually amounts to choosing a finite basis set, inevitably introducing errors. In this work, we propose an alternative, discretization-free approach that combines classical and quantum resources in a global variational ansatz, optimized using the framework of variational Monte Carlo. We introduce both purely quantum as well as hybrid quantum-classical ansatze and benchmark them on three paradigmatic continuous-space systems that are either very challenging or beyond the reach of current quantum approaches: the one-dimensional quantum rotor model, a system of Helium-3 particles in one and two dimensions, and the two-dimensional homogeneous electron gas. We embed relevant constraints such as the antisymmetry of fermionic wave functions directly into the ansatz. Many-body correlations are introduced via backflow transformations represented by parameterized quantum circuits. We demonstrate that the accuracy of the simulation can be systematically improved by increasing the number of circuit parameters and study the effects of shot noise. Furthermore, we show that the hybrid ansatz improves the ground-state energies obtained using the purely classical wave function.</description>

      <title>Structure, magnetic properties, and cycloidal spin ordering in Nd-doped BiFeO$_3$ synthesized by sol-gel method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, the structural and magnetic properties of Nd-doped BiFeO$_3$ materials with the formula Bi$_{1-x}$Nd$_x$FeO$_3$ $(x = 0 - 0.2)$ were investigated. Samples were prepared using the sol-gel method and annealed at 823 K for 4 hours. Microstructural studies indicated that nanomaterials with an average grain size of less than 100 nm were produced, with the smallest grain size observed for the solid solution with $x = 0.15$. Rietveld analysis of diffraction patterns revealed a composition-driven transformation from the rhombohedral $(R3c)$ lattice to the orthorhombic $(Pbam)$ structure. The above finding is correlated to M\"ossbauer spectroscopy data, which demonstrated the gradual destruction of the spin cycloid due to the structural transformation to the $Pbam$ structure. The spectra were analyzed using a complex hyperfine magnetic field distribution model reflecting cycloidal spin ordering. Scanning differential calorimetry revealed that for the investigated materials the magnetic ordering temperatures are close to 640 K, independently from the Nd concentration. Magnetic measurements showed the emergence of weak ferromagnetic properties with increasing Nd ions concentration, consistently with M\"ossbauer spectroscopy data.</description>

      <title>Intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene, which has been discovered experimentally in Han $et$ $al$ arXiv:2408.15233. We construct a minimal model for the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity, assuming a simplified anisotropic interaction that depends only on the angle between the incoming and outgoing momenta. Despite the absence of Fermi surface nesting, we show that the superconductivity appears near the Van Hove singularity with the maximal $T_c$ near a bifurcation point of the peaks in the density of states. We identify the topological $p+ip$, topological $h+ih$, and the non-topological nodal $f$-wave pairings as the possible states, which are all pair density wave orders due to the intravalley nature. Furthermore, these pair density wave orders require a finite attractive threshold for superconductivity, resulting in narrow superconducting regions, consistent with experimental findings. We discuss the possible pairing mechanisms and point out that the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism is a plausible explanation for the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in the rhombohedral tetralayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Characteristic THz-emissions induced by optically excited collective orbital modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the generation of collective orbital modes, their evolution, and the characteristic nonlinear optical response induced by them in a photoinduced orbital-ordered correlated oxide using real-time simulations based on an interacting multiband tight-binding (TB) model. The d-d optical transitions under femtoseconds light-pulse in an orbital-ordered state excite collective orbital modes, also known as "orbitons". Consistently incorporating electronic interactions and the interplay between charge, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom in the TB-model provides a clearer understanding of how these factors influence the generation and evolution of collective orbital modes. The dynamics of Jahn-Teller vibrational modes in the photoinduced state modify the intersite orbital interaction, which further amplifies these orbital modes. In the presence of weak ferroelectricity, the excitation of collective orbital modes induces a strong THz oscillatory photocurrent, which is long-lived. This suggests an alternative way to experimentally detect low-energy collective modes through THz-emission studies in the photoinduced state. Our study also elucidates that quasiparticle dynamics in improper ferroelectric oxides can be exploited to achieve highly interesting and non-trivial optoelectronic properties.</description>

      <title>Ward identity preserving approach for investigation of phonon spectrum with self-energy and vertex corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an approach for investigating the many body effects on phonon spectrum in an electron-phonon coupled system by taking into account the electron self-energy and vertex corrections which respect the Ward identity representing the conservation of electronic charge. Our approach provides a systematic diagrammatic expansion of the phonon self-energy $\Pi(\mathbf{q},\omega)$ in powers of the electron-phonon scattering strength $(g^2)$.
  In this approach the many body corrections to phonon spectrum vanish identically in the regime of long-wavelength excitations ($\mathbf{q} \rightarrow 0$) due to an exact cancellation between the contributions arising from electron self-energy and vertex corrections. Our results demonstrate that the contributions of electron self-energy and vertex corrections are not only comparable but they also tend to cancel each oher so that the phonon spectrum remains nearly unaffected due to many body effects in the regime of long-wavelength excitations ($\mathbf{q} \rightarrow 0$)</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mott system with a low-energy excitation may well constitute the underlying system for high temperature superconductivity (HTSC) of under-doped cuprates. This manuscript explores the above through the Hubbard-1 approximation (the Green function method), especially in terms of its self-energy while evaluating the calculation of self-energy using effective mass ratio. Results show it appears the pseudo-gap of HTSC is due to the self-energy effect on the quasi-particle excitation of the Mott's J.</description>

      <title>Single- and two-particle observables in the Emery model: a dynamical mean-field perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate dynamical mean-field calculations of the three-band Emery model at the one- and two-particle level for material-realistic parameters of high-$T_c$ superconductors. Our study shows that even within dynamical mean-field theory, which accounts solely for temporal fluctuations, the intrinsic multi-orbital nature of the Emery model introduces effective non-local correlations. These correlations lead to a non-Curie-like temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility, consistent with nuclear magnetic resonance experiments in the pseudogap regime. By analyzing the temperature dependence of the static dynamical mean-field theory spin susceptibility, we find indications of emerging oxygen-copper singlet fluctuations, explicitly captured by the model. Despite correctly describing the hallmark of the pseudogap at the two-particle level, such as the drop in the Knight shift of nuclear magnetic resonance, dynamical mean-field theory fails to capture the spectral properties of the pseudogap.</description>

      <title>Gauge symmetry of excited states in projected entangled-pair state simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While gauge symmetry is a well-established requirement for representing topological orders in projected entangled-pair state (PEPS), its impact on the properties of low-lying excited states remains relatively unexplored. Here we perform PEPS simulations of low-energy dynamics in the Kitaev honeycomb model, which supports fractionalized gauge flux (vison) excitations. We identify gauge symmetry emerging upon optimizing an unbiased PEPS ground state. Using the PEPS adapted local mode approximation, we further classify the low-lying excited states by discerning different vison sectors. Our simulations of spin and spin-dimer dynamical correlations establish close connections with experimental observations. Notably, the selection rule imposed by the locally conserved visons results in nearly flat dispersions in momentum space for excited states belonging to the 2-vison or 4-vison sectors.</description>

      <title>Strange-metal behavior without fine-tuning in PrV2Al20</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strange-metal behavior observed in the praseodymium-based heavy-fermion material PrV2Al20 has been tentatively interpreted in the framework of proximity to a quantum critical point (QCP) associated with quadrupolar ordering. Here, we demonstrate that an alternative, natural explanation exists without invoking a QCP, in terms of the unconventional nature of the quadrupolar Kondo effect taking place in non-Kramers ions. Using a combination of ab initio density-functional theory calculations and analytical arguments, we construct a periodic Anderson model with realistic parameters to describe PrV2Al20. We solve the model using dynamical mean-field theory preserving the model symmetries and demonstrate the non-Fermi liquid strange-metal behavior stemming from the two-channel nature of the quadrupolar Kondo effect. Our calculations provide an explanation for the puzzling temperature dependence in the magnetic susceptibility, and provide a basis for analyzing future photoemission experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the interplay between intrinsic topological order and superconductivity in a two-component Haldane bilayer, where the two layers are coupled by an attractive force. We obtain the phase diagram of the model with exact diagonalization in finite size, and develop arguments to assess the stability of the observed phases in the thermodynamic limit. Our main result is that a finite critical attraction strength is needed to pair fermions forming a fractional topological order. This behavior can be harnessed to create clean interfaces between a fractional topological insulator and a superconductor by gating, wherein non-Abelian parafermionic modes are trapped. We discuss realization of such interfaces in the bulk of double bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides by inhomogenous electrostatic gating, which should mitigate the spurious effects of disorder and crystalline defects present on physical edges.</description>

      <title>Compactness of quantics tensor train representations of local imaginary-time propagators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Space-time dependence of imaginary-time propagators, vital for \textit{ab initio} and many-body calculations based on quantum field theories, has been revealed to be compressible using Quantum Tensor Trains (QTTs) [Phys. Rev. X {\bf 13}, 021015 (2023)]. However, the impact of system parameters, like temperature, on data size remains underexplored. This paper provides a comprehensive numerical analysis of the compactness of local imaginary-time propagators in QTT for one-time/-frequency objects and two-time/-frequency objects, considering truncation in terms of the Frobenius and maximum norms. To study worst-case scenarios, we employ random pole models, where the number of poles grows logarithmically with the inverse temperature and coefficients are random. The Green's functions generated by these models are expected to be more difficult to compress than those from physical systems. The numerical analysis reveals that these propagators are highly compressible in QTT, outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches such as intermediate representation and discrete Lehmann representation. For one-time/-frequency objects and two-time/-frequency objects, the bond dimensions saturate at low temperatures, especially for truncation in terms of the Frobenius norm. We provide counting-number arguments for the saturation of bond dimensions for the one-time/-frequency objects, while the origin of this saturation for two-time/-frequency objects remains to be clarified. This paper's findings highlight the critical need for further research on the selection of truncation methods, tolerance levels, and the choice between imaginary-time and imaginary-frequency representations in practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit novel phenomena without Hermitian counterparts, such as exceptional points and the non-Hermitian skin effect. These non-Hermitian topological phenomena are observable in single-particle excitations of correlated systems in equilibrium, which are described by Green's functions. In this paper, we demonstrate the appearance of the hinge non-Hermitian skin effect in the effective Hamiltonian that describes the single-particle properties of an $f$-electron system. Skin effects result in a strong sensitivity to boundary conditions, and a large number of eigenstates localize at one boundary when open boundary conditions are applied. Our system exhibits such sensitivity and hosts skin modes localized around hinges. This hinge skin effect is induced by a non-Hermitian topology of the surface Brillouin zone. The hinge skin modes are observed for one-dimensional subsystems located between one pair of exceptional points in the surface Brillouin zone. This paper highlights that correlated materials are an exciting platform for analyzing non-Hermitian phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Fermi liquids, particularly the universal strange metal, are ubiquitously observed in strongly correlated materials, that includes the high-$T_c$ cuprates, ruthenate oxides and twisted bilayer graphenes. The unprecedent tunablity of these two-dimensional (2D) systems provides access towards the Lifshitz transition where the Fermi surface exhibits van Hove singularity (VHS) saddle points. Despite extensive investigation on the ordering instabilities, the critical phenomenon induced by the VHS are rarely explored. Here, we investigate the NFL behaviors at Lifshitz transition in the 2D magnetic heterostructure interface, where the Fermi surface undergoes a convex-to-concave topological transition. We uncover an exotic NFL phase at the VHS that dominates over other Fermi surface points in the low-energy limit. At finite energies, it crossovers to the well-known marginal Fermi liquid (MFL). In the finite-temperature regimes, we demonstrate that the universal strange metal transport emerges both in the MFL phase, and unexpectedly, in the exotic NFL phase which is induced by solely by the spatially uniform Yukawa interaction. This non-vanishing optical conductivity is largely attributed to the Galilean invariance breaking at VHS. Furthermore, we propose that the non-magnetic ARPES can directly probe the exotic NFL features at heterostructure interface. Our findings explore the interplay of VHS in lower dimension, disorder and strong interactions, which paves a novel path to study the high-$T_c$ superconductivity, 2D magnetism and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of order-fractionalization in the CPT model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the half-filled CPT model, an analytically tractable Kondo lattice model with Yao-Lee spin-spin interactions on a 3D hyperoctagon lattice, proposed by Coleman, Panigrahi, and Tsvelik. Previous studies have established that the CPT model exhibits odd-frequency triplet superconductivity and order fractionalization. Through asymptotic analyses in the small $J$ and large $J$ Kondo coupling limits, we identify a quantum critical point at $J_c$, marking a transition from a superconductor to a Kondo insulator. By estimating the vison gap energy to account for thermal gauge fluctuations, we determine the energy scales governing the thermal breakdown of order fractionalization. Moreover, at large $J$ the Kondo insulator undergoes orbital decoupling, leading to the formation of a decoupled Kitaev orbital liquid. These findings and analogies with the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauged $XY$ model lead us to propose a tentative phase diagram for the CPT model at half-filling.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, we investigate the ground-state phase diagram and correlation effects using determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations in a simplified bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model at half filling. Our results reveal the emergence of a nonmagnetic weakly insulating phase at weak on-site Hubbard interactions, transitioning to an antiferromagnetic Mott insulating phase as the interaction strength exceeds a critical value $U/t_1^x\approx 4.15$. This phase transition is consistent with the 3D O(3) Heisenberg universality class. Additionally, we analyze dynamical properties such as the single-particle spectral function and dynamic spin structure factor. The pronounced inter-layer correlation of $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals results in a downward trend and an extended flatness in the $\gamma$ band, mirroring the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy findings under ambient pressure. Our numerical results provide important clues for understanding the strong correlation effects in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of monolayer, multilayer, and bulk CrTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate magnetic properties of CrTe$_2$ within the density functional theory (DFT) approach in ferromagnetic phase and combination of DFT and dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT) approach in paramagnetic phase. We show that few layer CrTe$_2$ possesses well formed local magnetic moments. In the single layer CrTe$_2$ we find antiferromagnetic exchange with 120\degree antiferromagnetic structure most preferable. In the bilayer and trilayer systems electronic correlations in DFT+DMFT approach yield ferromagnetic exchange interaction within each layer, but the interaction between the layers is antiferromagnetic, such that alternation of the direction of magnetization of the layers is expected. In bulk CrTe$_2$ we find the tendency to ferromagnetic order at low temperature, but with increase of temperature antiferromagnetic correlations between the layers dominate. Determination of the critical number of layers at which the interlayer antiferromagnetic order changes to the ferromagnetic one, requires consideration of the non-local Coulomb interactions.</description>

      <title>Large-$N$ SU(4) Schwinger boson theory for coupled-dimer antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a systematic large-$N$ expansion based on the Schwinger boson representation of SU(4) coherent states of dimers for the paradigmatic spin-$1/2$ bilayer square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet. This system exhibits a quantum phase transition between a quantum paramagnetic state and a N\'eel order state, driven by the coupling constant $g = J'/J$, which is defined as the ratio between the inter-dimer $J'$ and intra-dimer $J$ exchange interactions. We demonstrate that this approach accurately describes static and dynamic properties on both sides of the quantum phase transition. The critical coupling constant $g_c \approx 0.42$ and the dynamic spin structure factor reproduce quantum Monte Carlo results with high precision. Notably, the $1/N$ corrections reveal the longitudinal mode of the magnetically ordered phase along with the overdamping caused by its decay into the two-magnon continuum. The present large-$N$ $SU(N)$ Schwinger boson theory can be extended to more general cases of quantum paramagnets that undergo a quantum phase transition into magnetically ordered states.</description>

      <title>Hofstadter spectrum of Chern bands in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the topological bands in twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides in an external magnetic field. We first focus on a paradigmatic model of WSe$_2$, which can be described in an adiabatic approximation as particles moving in a periodic potential and an emergent periodic magnetic field with nonzero average. We understand the magnetic-field dependent spectra of WSe$_2$ based on the point net zero flux, at which the external field cancels the average emergent field. At this point, the band structure interpolates between the tightly-bound and nearly-free (weak periodic potential) paradigms as the twist angle increases. For small twist angles, the energy levels in a magnetic field mirror the Hofstadter butterfly of the Haldane model. For larger twist angles, the isolated Chern band at zero flux evolves from nearly-free bands at the point of net zero flux. We also apply our framework to a realistic model of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$, which has recently been suggested to feature higher Landau level analogs. We show that at negative unit flux per unit cell, the bands exhibit remarkable similarity to a backfolded parabolic dispersion, even though the adiabatic approximation is inapplicable. This backfolded parabolic dispersion naturally explains the similarity of the Chern bands at zero applied flux to the two lowest Landau levels, offering a simple picture supporting the emergence of non-Abelian states in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$. We propose the study of magnetic field dependent band structures as a versatile method to investigate the nature of topological bands and identify Landau level analogs.</description>

      <title>Coherence length in a dilute flat-band superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To explore the influence of quantum-geometric effects on the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length in a dilute flat-band superconductor, we adopt a BCS-BEC crossover approach to the multiband pyrochlore-Hubbard model near the critical temperature for superconductivity. Our self-consistent formulation for this three-dimensional lattice benchmarks very well against the so-called zero-temperature coherence length, demonstrating the monotonic decay of the coherence length to zero as the interaction strength increases. Additionally, we show that the effective mass of the many-body bound states (i.e., Cooper pairs) is nearly identical to that of the lowest-lying two-body bound states in the dilute flat-band limit.</description>

      <title>Finite-size topological phases from semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological semimetals are some of the topological phases of matter most intensely-studied experimentally. The Weyl semimetal phase, in particular, has garned tremendous, sustained interest given fascinating signatures such as the Fermi arc surface states and the chiral anomaly, as well as the minimal requirements to protect this three-dimensional topological phase. Here, we show that thin films of Weyl semimetals (which we call quasi-(3-1)-dimensional, or q(3-1)d) generically realize finite-size topological phases distinct from 3d and 2d topological phases of established classification schemes: response signatures of the 3d bulk topology co-exist with topologically-protected, quasi-(3-2)d Fermi arc states or chiral boundary modes due to a second, previously-unidentified bulk-boundary correspondence. We show these finite-size topological semimetal phases are realized by Hamiltonians capturing the Fermiology of few-layer Van der Waals material MoTe2 in experiment. Given the broad experimental interest in few-layer Van der Waals materials and topological semimetals, our work paves the way for extensive future theoretical and experimental characterization of finite-size topological phases.</description>
