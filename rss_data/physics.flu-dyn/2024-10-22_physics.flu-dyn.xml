      <title>Noise-expansion cascade: an origin of randomness of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14941v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence has remained the greatest challenge in fluid mechanics. Especially, randomness is one of the most important characteristics of turbulence, but its origin is still an open question until now. In this paper, by means of several ingeniously designed ``clean'' numerical experiments based on Navier-Stokes equations for the two-dimensional turbulent Kolmogorov flow, we reveal such a new phenomenon, namely ``noise-expansion cascade'', that all micro-level noises/disturbances at different orders of magnitude in initial condition of Navier-Stokes equations enlarge consistently, say, one by one like an inverse cascade, to macro-level, and besides each of them might greatly change macro-level characteristic of turbulence. The ``noise-expansion cascade'' closely connects randomness of micro-level noise/disturbance and macro-level disorder of turbulence and thus reveals the origin of randomness of turbulence. In addition, it clearly indicates that unavoidable thermal fluctuation must be considered for turbulence, even if it is several orders of magnitude smaller than other external environmental disturbances.</description>

      <title>Nonlocality of the slip length operator for scalar and momentum transport in turbulent flows over superhydrophobic surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superhydrophobic surfaces (SHS) are textured hydrophobic surfaces which have the ability to trap air pockets when immersed in water. This can result in significant drag reduction, due to substantially lower viscosity of air resulting in substantial effective slip velocity at the interface. Past studies of both laminar and turbulent flows model this slip velocity in terms of a homogenized Navier slip boundary condition with a slip length relating the wall slip velocity to the wall-normal velocity gradient. In this work, we seek to understand the effects of superhydrophobic surfaces in the context of mean scalar and momentum mixing. We use the macroscopic forcing method (Mani and Park, 2021) to compute the generalized eddy viscosity and slip length operators of a turbulent channel over SHS, implemented as both a pattern-resolved boundary condition and homogenized slip length boundary condition, for several pattern sizes and geometries. We present key differences in the mixing behavior of both boundary conditions through quantification of their near-wall eddy viscosity. Analysis of transport in turbulent flow over pattern-resolved surfaces reveals substantial nonlocality in teh measured homogenized slip length for both scalar and momentum mixing when the Reynolds and Peclet numbers based on pattern size are finite. We present several metrics to quantify this nonlocality and observe possible trends relating to Reynolds number, texture size, and pattern geometry. The importance of nonlocality in the slip length operator and in the eddy diffusivity operator is demonstrated by examining impact on Reynolds-averaged solutions for the mean scalar and velocity fields.</description>

      <title>Enstrophy variations in the collapsing process of point vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate enstrophy variations by collapse of point vortices in an inviscid flow and, in particular, focus on the enstrophy dissipation that is a significant property characterizing 2D turbulent flows. Point vortex is an ideal vortex whose vorticity is concentrated on a point and the dynamics of point vortices on an inviscid flow is described by the point-vortex system. The point-vortex system has self-similar collapsing solutions, which are expected to cause the anomalous enstrophy dissipation, but this collapsing process of point vortices cannot be described by the 2D Euler equations. In this study, we consider point-vortex solutions of the 2D filtered Euler equations, which are a regularized model of the 2D Euler equations, and the filtered-point-vortex system describing the dynamics of them. The preceding studies have proven that there exist solutions to the three filtered-point-vortex system such that they converge to self-similar collapsing orbits of the point-vortex system and dissipate the enstrophy at the event of collapse in the zero limit of a filter scale. In this study, we numerically show that the enstrophy dissipation by the collapse of point vortices could occur for the four and five vortex problems.</description>

      <title>Modelling surface waves on shear current with quadratic depth-dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The currents in the ocean have a serious impact on ocean dynamics, since they affect the transport of mass and thus the distribution of salinity, nutrients and pollutants. In many physically important situations the current depends quadratic-ally on the depth. We consider a single layer of fluid and study the propagation of the surface waves in the presence of depth-dependent current with quadratic profile. We select the scale of parameters and quantities, which are typical for the Boussinesq propagation regime (long wave and small amplitude limit) and we also derive the well known KdV model for the surface waves interacting with current.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking in two-dimensional turbulence induced by out-of-equilibrium fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the self-organization of two-dimensional turbulence in a fluid with local interactions. Using simulations and theoretical arguments, we show that the out-of-equilibrium flux to small scales, corresponding to the direct cascade, imposes a constraint on the large-scale emergent flow. As a result, instead of the unique state found in other two-dimensional models, a rich phase diagram of large-scale configurations emerges. We explain what sets the boundaries between the different phases, and show that in the infinite box limit when the range of the direct cascade is kept finite, the large-scale flow exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Synergy of turbulence and thermo-diffusive effects on the intermittent boundary-layer flashback of swirling flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulated the intermittent boundary-layer flashback (BLF) of hydrogen-enriched swirling flames using large-eddy simulation (LES) with the flame-surface-density (FSD) method. Three cases of intermittent BLF, characterized by periodic flame entry and exit of the mixing tube, are presented. The intermittent BLF characteristics varied with the hydrogen volume fraction. Small flame bulges entered and exited the mixing tube in low hydrogen-enrichment cases. The duration of intermittent BLF events and BLF depth increased as the hydrogen content increased. Meanwhile, a large flame tongue penetrating deeply upstream characterised the highest hydrogen-enrichment case.The mean BLF peak depths and standard deviations obtained through simulations aligned well with experimental data for low and moderate hydrogen-enrichment cases. However, LES-FSD underestimated the average BLF peak depth for the highest hydrogen-enrichment case.Analysis of the flow-flame interaction revealed two mechanisms underlying the intermittent BLF phenomena. The flame bulges' oscillation near the outlet is caused by the reverse flow induced by the recirculation zone. At the same time, the deep intermittent BLF occurrs due to the boundary layer separation induced by the large turbulent burning velocity, resulting from the synergy of turbulence and thermo-diffusive effects.</description>

      <title>An analytical model of tornado generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new analytical model for the generation of axisymmetric tornado-type vortices has been developed. A solution to the nonlinear equation for the stream function in an unstable stratified atmosphere is obtained and analyzed within the framework of ideal hydrodynamics. The solution is sought by smooth connecting continuous solutions for the internal region ("eye"), the central region ("wall" with maximum velocities) and the external region of the tornado. Expressions describing radial dependences for the radial and vertical velocity components include combinations of Bessel functions. The vortex is spatially localized by radius and height. Convective instability of a stratified atmosphere leads to an increase in the radial and vertical components of velocities according to the hyperbolic sine law. A downward flow is observed near the tornado axis. The maximum speed of the upward flow is achieved at a certain radial distance at a certain height. Below this height, radial flows converge towards the central part of the tornado, and above this height there is an outflow from the "wall" to the axis and to the periphery. The radial structure of the azimuthal velocity is determined by the structure of the initial disturbance and can change with height. Maximum rotation is achieved in the tornado "wall" at a certain height. The increase in azimuthal velocity can occur according to a superexponential law. Possible structures of movements, scenarios for the development of a tornado and its dynamics are discussed.</description>

      <title>The Typicality of Regimes Associated with Northern Hemisphere Heatwaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the hemispheric to continental scale regimes that lead to summertime heatwaves in the Northern Hemisphere. By using a powerful data mining methodology - archetype analysis - we identify characteristic spatial patterns consisting of a blocking high pressure systems embedded within a meandering upper atmosphere circulation that is longitudinally modulated by coherent Rossby Wave Packets. Periods when these atmospheric regimes are strongly expressed correspond to large increases in the likelihood of extreme surface temperature. Most strikingly, these regimes are shown to be typical of surface extremes and frequently reoccur. Three well publicised heatwaves are studied in detail - the June-July 2003 western European heatwave, the August 2010 "Russian" heatwave, and the June 2021 "Heatdome" event across western North America, and are shown to be driven by blocking high pressure systems linked to stalled Rossby Wave Packets. We discuss the implications of our work for long-range prediction or early warning, climate model assessment and post-event diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Tuning the shear and extensional rheology of semi-flexible polyelectrolyte solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-flexible polyelectrolytes are a group of biopolymers with a wide range of applications from drag reducing agents in turbulent flows to thickening agents in food and cosmetics. In this study, we investigate the rheology of aqueous solutions of xanthan gum as a canonical semi-flexible polyelectrolyte in steady shear and transient extensional flows via torsional rheometry and dripping-onto-substrate (DoS), respectively. The high molecular weight of the xanthan gum and the numerous charged groups on the side branches attached to the backbone allow the shear and extensional rheology of the xanthan gum solutions to be tuned over a wide range by changing the ionic strength of the solvent. In steady shear flow, increasing the xanthan gum concentration increases both the zero shear viscosity and the extent of shear-thinning of the solution. Conversely, increasing the ionic strength of the solvent by addition of sodium chloride (NaCl) decreases both the zero shear viscosity and the level of shear-thinning. In transient extensional flow, increasing the xanthan gum concentration changes the dynamics of the capillary thinning from an inelastic power-law (IP) response to an elastocapillary (EC) balance, from which an extensional relaxation time can be measured based on the rate of filament thinning. Increasing the NaCl concentration decreases the extensional relaxation time and the transient extensional viscosity of the viscoelastic solution. Based on the dynamics of capillary thinning observed in the DoS experiments, we provide a relationship for the smallest extensional relaxation time that can be measured using DoS. We suggest that the change in the dynamics of capillary thinning from an IP response to an EC response can be used as an easy and robust experimental method for identifying the rheologically effective overlap concentration of a semi-flexible polyelectrolyte solution, i.e., the critical concentration at which polymer molecules start to interact with each other to produce a viscoelastic strain-stiffening response (often perceived as "stringiness") in transient extensional flows such as those involved in dripping, dispensing and filling operations.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Flight Conditions where Box-Wing Outperforms Mono-Wing Configurations for Small UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.02872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the aerodynamic efficiency and flight dynamics of mono-wing and box-wing configurations across various parameters, including aspect ratio, velocity, and lift requirements. We find that although mono-wing configurations exhibit superior aerodynamic efficiency in certain regimes, box-wing designs perform better in circumstances like high velocities and increased lift demands. Box-wing configurations also prove advantageous when induced drag is higher than friction drag due to their ability to suppress the tip vortices. Furthermore, while analyzing the flight dynamics, low aspect ratio box-wing configurations show improved gust tolerance and stability in longitudinal and lateral dynamics. However, no substantial difference in flight dynamics is observed between box-wing and mono-wing designs for high aspect ratio configurations. The findings underscore the importance of selecting the appropriate wing configuration based on specific performance requirements and operational conditions.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Vorticity Effects on Extinction Behavior of Laminar Flamelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03695v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent rotational flamelet model is developed and tested with an improved framework of detailed chemistry and transport. The rotational flamelet model incorporates the effects of shear strain and vorticity on local flame behavior and is three-dimensional by nature. A similarity solution reduces the three-dimensional governing equations to ODEs involving a transformation to a non-Newtonian reference frame. A 9-species chemical kinetics model is used for H2-O2 combustion with non-reacting N2. Multiple flamelet cases including non-premixed, premixed, and partially-premixed flames are performed. Across all cases, vorticity extends flammability limits by up to 30% in terms of the ambient extinction strain rate and modifies both local flame structure and mixture composition. For non-premixed flames, where the location of minimum density coincides with the location of peak temperature, the centrifugal force induced by vorticity reduces the mass flow rate through the flame, effectively lowering the local strain rate. This increases residence time, thus extending flammability limits and reducing burning rates. This analysis is done also for premixed and partially-premixed flames. If minimum density lies between the flame zone and the fuel inlet boundary, centrifugal forces do not significantly modify flame behavior. Stable and unstable branches of S-curves for non-premixed and partially-premixed flames and stable branches for premixed flames show extended flammability limits due to vorticity. The capabilities of the rotational flamelet model reveal that vital physics are currently missing from two-dimensional, irrotational, constant-density, flamelet models. Improvements of detailed chemical kinetics, transport formulation, and thermo-physical properties bring the new flamelet model to par in these areas with existing models, while adding new features in terms of physical emulation.</description>

      <title>Hydroelectric energy conversion of waste flows through hydroelectronic drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydraulic energy is a key component of the global energy mix, yet there exists no practical way of harvesting it at small scales, from flows at low Reynolds number. This has triggered the search for alternative hydroelectric conversion methodologies, leading to unconventional proposals based on droplet triboelectricity, water evaporation, osmotic energy or flow-induced ionic Coulomb drag. Yet, these approaches systematically rely on ions as intermediate charge carriers, limiting the achievable power density. Here, we predict that the kinetic energy of small-scale "waste" flows can be directly and efficiently converted into electricity thanks to the hydro-electronic drag effect, by which an ion-free liquid induces an electronic current in the solid wall along which it flows. This effect originates in the fluctuation-induced coupling between fluid motion and electron transport. We develop a non-equilibrium thermodynamic formalism to assess the efficiency of such hydroelectric energy conversion, dubbed hydronic energy. We find that hydronic energy conversion is analogous to thermoelectricity, with the efficiency being controlled by a dimensionless figure of merit. However, in contrast to its thermoelectric analogue, this figure of merit combines independently tunable parameters of the solid and the liquid, and can thus significantly exceed unity. Our findings suggest new strategies for blue energy harvesting without electrochemistry, and for waste flow mitigation in membrane-based filtration processes.</description>

      <title>Turbulent cascade arrests and the formation of intermediate-scale condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy cascades lie at the heart of the dynamics of turbulent flows. In a recent study of turbulence in fluids with odd-viscosity [de Wit \textit{et al.}, Nature \textbf{627}, 515 (2024)], the two-dimensionalization of the flow at small scales leads to the arrest of the energy cascade and selection of an intermediate scale, between the forcing and the viscous scales. To investigate the generality of this phenomenon, we study a shell model that is carefully constructed to have three-dimensional turbulent dynamics at small wavenumbers and two-dimensional turbulent dynamics at large wavenumbers. The large scale separation that we can achieve in our shell model allows us to examine clearly the interplay between these dynamics, which leads to an arrest of the energy cascade at a transitional wavenumber and an associated accumulation of energy at the same scale. Such pile-up of energy around the transitional wavenumber is reminiscent of the formation of condensates in two-dimensional turbulence, \textit{but, in contrast, it occurs at intermediate wavenumbers instead of the smallest wavenumber</description>

      <title>Developed and quasi-developed macro-scale heat transfer in micro- and mini-channels with arrays of offset strip fins subject to a uniform heat flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we examine to what degree the heat transfer can be described as developed on a macro-scale level in typical micro- and mini-channels with offset strip fin arrays subject to a uniform heat flux, considering flow entrance and side-wall effects. Full-scale numerical heat transfer simulations are conducted to determine the extent of the developed macro-scale heat transfer region within the arrays. We find that the onset point of developed heat transfer increases linearly with the P\'eclet number and channel width. However, the thermal development lengths remain limited relative to the overall channel length. Therefore, the local macro-scale heat transfer coefficient can be modeled by developed Nusselt number correlations with discrepancies below 25% in both the developed and developing heat transfer regions. We observe that quasi-developed heat transfer prevails over nearly the entire entrance region of the channel and significantly contributes to the main heat transfer characteristics, particularly the eigenvalues and amplitudes of the dominant temperature modes. Additionally, we analyze the impact of channel side walls on the temperature field's periodicity and the macro-scale temperature profile, which we characterize through an effective heat transfer coefficient. Our comprehensive numerical data covers various fin height-to-length ratios up to 1, fin pitch-to-length ratios up to 0.5, and channel aspect ratios ranging from 1/5 to 1/17, encompassing Reynolds numbers from 28 to 1224. Two sets of Prandtl number and thermal conductivity ratio are investigated, corresponding to the combinations of copper/air, and copper/water.</description>

      <title>Direction Symmetry of Wave Field Modulation by Tidal Current</title>

Abstract: Theoretical studies on the modulation of unidimensional regular waves over a flat bottom due to a current typically assign an asymmetry between the effects of opposing/following streams on the evolution of major sea variables, such as significant wave height. The significant wave height is expected to monotonically increase with opposing streams and to decrease with following streams. To some extent, observations on data sets containing a few thousand of waves or over a continuous series of about a day confirm this prediction. Here, based on a multi-year dataset, we show that in very broad-banded seas with high directional spread, the asymptotic behavior of sea variables is highly non-trivial and does not follow the theoretical predictions, especially at high values of the ratio between tidal stream and group speed.</description>

      <title>Freezing dynamics of wetting droplet under a uniform electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrofreezing is a powerful technique that employs the electric field to control and enhance the freezing process. In this work, a phase-field-based lattice Boltzmann (LB) method is developed to study the electrofreezing process of sessile droplet on a cooled substrate. The accuracy of the present LB method is first validated through performing some simulations of the three-phase Stefan problem, the droplet freezing on a cold wall, and the droplet deformation under a uniform electric field. Then it is used to investigate the effect of an electric field on the freezing of a wetting droplet on a cold substrate, and the numerical results show that the electric field has a significant influence on the freezing time of the droplet mainly through changing the morphology of the droplet. In particular, under the effect of the electric field, the freezing time is increased for the droplet with a prolate pattern, while the freezing time of the droplet with an oblate pattern is decreased. These numerical results bring some new insights on the electrofreezing and provide a valuable guidance for the precise regulation of droplet freezing.</description>

      <title>Dissecting inertial clustering and sling dynamics in high-Reynolds number particle-laden turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to deepen the understanding of inertial clustering and the role of sling events in high-Reynolds number ($Re$) particle-laden turbulence. To this end, we perform one-way coupled particle tracking in flow fields obtained from direct numerical simulations (DNS) of forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence. Additionally, we examine the impact of filtering utilized in large eddy simulations (LES) by applying a sharp spectral filter to the DNS fields. Our analysis reveals that while instantaneous clustering through the centrifuge mechanism explains clustering at early times, the path history effect--the sampling of fluid flow along particle trajectories--becomes important later on. The filtered fields expose small-scale fractal clustering that cannot be predicted by the instantaneous flow field. We show that there exists a filter-effective Stokes number that governs the degree of fractal clustering and preferential sampling, revealing scale-similarity in the spatial distributions and fractal dimensions. Sling events are prevalent throughout our simulations and impose prominent patterns on the particle fields. In pursuit of investigating the sling dynamics, we compute the relative velocity, ensemble-averaged over proximal neighboring particles, to identify particles undergoing caustics. As postulated in recent theories, we find that in fully resolved, high-$Rea turbulence, sling events occur in thin sheets of high strain, situated between turbulent vortices. This behavior is driven by rare, extreme events of compressive straining, manifested by fluctuations of the flow velocity gradients that propagate back and forth the positive branch of the Vieillefosse line.</description>

      <title>Local-in-time analytic solutions for an inviscid model of superfluidity in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the existence of solutions for the inviscid version of the Hall-Vinen-Bekharevich-Khalatnikov equations in 3D, a macro-scale model of superfluidity. This system couples the incompressible Euler equations for the normal fluid and superfluid using a nonlinear mutual friction term that acts only at points of non-zero superfluid vorticity. In the first rigorous study of the inviscid HVBK system, we construct a unique local-in-time solution that is analytic in time and space.</description>
