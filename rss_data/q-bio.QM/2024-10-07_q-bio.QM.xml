      <title>Towards Precision Feeding Using Behavioral Monitoring in Marine Cages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aquaculture is expected to account for two-thirds of global fish consumption by 2030, highlighting the need for sustainable and efficient practices. Feeding is crucial to aquaculture success, influenced by factors like fish size, environment, and health. This study addresses a gap in feeding control for sea cages by developing a real-time monitoring system, using AI models and computer vision to analyze feeding behavior with European sea bass as pilot species. Key metrics like fish speed and a new feeding behavior index (FBI) were used to assess responses to different feeding scenarios. The results revealed distinct behavior patterns based on feeding quantity, with imbalances in activity when fish are overfed or underfed. The results can be used for predicting the level of satiation of the fish and controlling feeding duration.</description>

      <title>Deep Signature: Characterization of Large-Scale Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding protein dynamics are essential for deciphering protein functional mechanisms and developing molecular therapies. However, the complex high-dimensional dynamics and interatomic interactions of biological processes pose significant challenge for existing computational techniques. In this paper, we approach this problem for the first time by introducing Deep Signature, a novel computationally tractable framework that characterizes complex dynamics and interatomic interactions based on their evolving trajectories. Specifically, our approach incorporates soft spectral clustering that locally aggregates cooperative dynamics to reduce the size of the system, as well as signature transform that collects iterated integrals to provide a global characterization of the non-smooth interactive dynamics. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that Deep Signature exhibits several desirable properties, including invariance to translation, near invariance to rotation, equivariance to permutation of atomic coordinates, and invariance under time reparameterization. Furthermore, experimental results on three benchmarks of biological processes verify that our approach can achieve superior performance compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Fully Automated CTC Detection, Segmentation and Classification for Multi-Channel IF Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid biopsies (eg., blood draws) offer a less invasive and non-localized alternative to tissue biopsies for monitoring the progression of metastatic breast cancer (mBCa). Immunofluoresence (IF) microscopy is a tool to image and analyze millions of blood cells in a patient sample. By detecting and genetically sequencing circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the blood, personalized treatment plans are achievable for various cancer subtypes. However, CTCs are rare (about 1 in 2M), making manual CTC detection very difficult. In addition, clinicians rely on quantitative cellular biomarkers to manually classify CTCs. This requires prior tasks of cell detection, segmentation and feature extraction. To assist clinicians, we have developed a fully automated machine learning-based production-level pipeline to efficiently detect, segment and classify CTCs in multi-channel IF images. We achieve over 99% sensitivity and 97% specificity on 9,533 cells from 15 mBCa patients. Our pipeline has been successfully deployed on real mBCa patients, reducing a patient average of 14M detected cells to only 335 CTC candidates for manual review.</description>

      <title>On the emergence of criticality for inhalation-driven particle deposition in the anatomical upper airway</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inhalation directs air through a defined pathway, initiating from nostrils, moving through the main nasal cavity, past the pharynx and trachea, and culminating in the lungs. Inhaled particles, of a range of sizes, are ferried by this incoming air but are filtered and trapped by upper airway structures to protect the delicate lower respiratory system. From an energetics perspective, the airflow physics along this convoluted tract is characterized by turbulence. The system approaches a critical stationary state over the time scales during which particles enter the airway and deposit. This stasis can be conjectured to correspond with the emergence of criticality in the complex flow domain. For such systemic criticality (i.e., sensitivity to perturbations), inhaled particle deposition impacted by the surrounding flow processes can act as signature avalanche-like events. Based on the principles of organized criticality, we have explored the emergence of power law trends in particle deposition levels at the nasopharynx, a key initial infection site for airborne pathogens. These trends are derived from numerical data from five anatomic airway geometries for 15-85 L/min inhalation rates, modeled using high-fidelity Large Eddy Simulations.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Generate Diverse Molecules? Towards Alignment with Structural Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in generating molecular structures as drug candidates, which offers significant potential to accelerate drug discovery. However, the current LLMs overlook a critical requirement for drug discovery: proposing a diverse set of molecules. This diversity is essential for improving the chances of finding a viable drug, as it provides alternative molecules that may succeed where others fail in wet-lab or clinical validations. Despite such a need for diversity, the LLMs often output structurally similar molecules from a given prompt. While decoding schemes like beam search may enhance textual diversity, this often does not align with molecular structural diversity. In response, we propose a new method for fine-tuning molecular generative LLMs to autoregressively generate a set of structurally diverse molecules, where each molecule is generated by conditioning on the previously generated molecules. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) supervised fine-tuning to adapt LLMs to autoregressively generate molecules in a sequence and (2) reinforcement learning to maximize structural diversity within the generated molecules. Our experiments show that (1) our fine-tuning approach enables the LLMs to better discover diverse molecules compared to existing decoding schemes and (2) our fine-tuned model outperforms other representative LLMs in generating diverse molecules, including the ones fine-tuned on chemical domains.</description>

      <title>Predicting perturbation targets with causal differential networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rationally identifying variables responsible for changes to a biological system can enable myriad applications in disease understanding and cell engineering. From a causality perspective, we are given two datasets generated by the same causal model, one observational (control) and one interventional (perturbed). The goal is to isolate the subset of measured variables (e.g. genes) that were the targets of the intervention, i.e. those whose conditional independencies have changed. Knowing the causal graph would limit the search space, allowing us to efficiently pinpoint these variables. However, current algorithms that infer causal graphs in the presence of unknown intervention targets scale poorly to the hundreds or thousands of variables in biological data, as they must jointly search the combinatorial spaces of graphs and consistent intervention targets. In this work, we propose a causality-inspired approach for predicting perturbation targets that decouples the two search steps. First, we use an amortized causal discovery model to separately infer causal graphs from the observational and interventional datasets. Then, we learn to map these paired graphs to the sets of variables that were intervened upon, in a supervised learning framework. This approach consistently outperforms baselines for perturbation modeling on seven single-cell transcriptomics datasets, each with thousands of measured variables. We also demonstrate significant improvements over six causal discovery algorithms in predicting intervention targets across a variety of tractable, synthetic datasets.</description>

      <title>Seizure freedom after surgical resection of diffusion-weighted MRI abnormalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Importance: Many individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy continue to have seizures after resective surgery. Accurate identification of focal brain abnormalities is essential for successful neurosurgical intervention. Current clinical approaches to identify structural abnormalities for surgical targeting in epilepsy do not use diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI), despite evidence that dMRI abnormalities are present in epilepsy and may relate to the epileptogenic zone. Objective: To investigate whether surgical resection of diffusion abnormalities relates to post-operative seizure freedom. Design: This retrospective case-control study was conducted between 2009 and 2022. Data were acquired at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UK. Study participants included 200 individuals with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, who underwent resective surgery, and 97 healthy controls used as a normative baseline. Main Outcomes: Spatial overlap between diffusion abnormality clusters and surgical resection masks, and relation to post-surgical outcome. Results: Surgical resections overlapping with the largest abnormal cluster significantly correlated with sustained seizure freedom at 12 months (83% vs 55%; p&lt;0.0001) and over five years (p&lt;0.0001). Notably, resecting only a small proportion of the largest cluster was associated with better seizure outcomes than cases with no resection of this cluster (p=0.008). Furthermore, sparing the largest cluster but resecting other large clusters still improved seizure freedom rates compared to no overlap (p=0.03). Conclusions: Our results suggest that abnormal clusters, identified using dMRI, are integral to the epileptogenic network, and even a partial removal of such an abnormal cluster is sufficient to achieve seizure freedom. The study highlights the potential of incorporating dMRI into pre-surgical planning to improve outcomes in focal epilepsy.</description>

      <title>Elastic shape analysis for unsupervised clustering of left atrial appendage geometries in atrial fibrillation patients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Morphological variations in the left atrial appendage (LAA) are associated with different levels of ischemic stroke risk for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Studying LAA morphology can elucidate mechanisms behind this association and lead to the development of advanced stroke risk stratification tools. However, current categorical descriptions of LAA morphologies are qualitative and inconsistent across studies, which impedes advancements in our understanding of stroke pathogenesis in AF. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a quantitative pipeline that combines elastic shape analysis with unsupervised learning for the categorization of LAA morphology in AF patients. As part of our pipeline, we compute pairwise elastic distances between LAA meshes from a cohort of 20 AF patients, and leverage these distances to cluster our shape data. We demonstrate that our method clusters LAA morphologies based on distinctive shape features, overcoming the innate inconsistencies of current LAA categorization systems, and paving the way for improved stroke risk metrics using objective LAA shape groups.</description>

      <title>FusionDTI: Fine-grained Binding Discovery with Token-level Fusion for Drug-Target Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting drug-target interaction (DTI) is critical in the drug discovery process. Despite remarkable advances in recent DTI models through the integration of representations from diverse drug and target encoders, such models often struggle to capture the fine-grained interactions between drugs and protein, i.e. the binding of specific drug atoms (or substructures) and key amino acids of proteins, which is crucial for understanding the binding mechanisms and optimising drug design. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel model, called FusionDTI, which uses a token-level Fusion module to effectively learn fine-grained information for Drug-Target Interaction. In particular, our FusionDTI model uses the SELFIES representation of drugs to mitigate sequence fragment invalidation and incorporates the structure-aware (SA) vocabulary of target proteins to address the limitation of amino acid sequences in structural information, additionally leveraging pre-trained language models extensively trained on large-scale biomedical datasets as encoders to capture the complex information of drugs and targets. Experiments on three well-known benchmark datasets show that our proposed FusionDTI model achieves the best performance in DTI prediction compared with seven existing state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, our case study indicates that FusionDTI could highlight the potential binding sites, enhancing the explainability of the DTI prediction.</description>

      <title>Accounting for the geometry of the lung in respiratory viral infections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasingly, experimentalists and modellers alike have come to recognise the important role of spatial structure in infection dynamics. Almost invariably, spatial computational models of viral infections -- as with in vitro experimental systems -- represent the tissue as wide and flat, which is assumed to be representative of entire affected tissue within the host. However, this assumption fails to take into account the distinctive geometry of the lung in the context of respiratory viral infections. The lung is characterised by a tubular, branching structure, and moreover is spatially heterogeneous: deeper regions of the lung are composed of far narrower airways and are associated with more severe infection. Here, we extend a typical multicellular model of viral dynamics to account for two essential features of the geometry of the lung: the tubular structure of airways, and the branching process between airway generations. We show that, with this more realistic tissue geometry, the dynamics of infection are substantially changed compared to standard computational and experimental approaches, and that the resulting model is equipped to tackle important biological phenomena that do not arise in a flat host tissue, including viral lineage dynamics in the lung, and heterogeneity in immune responses to infection in different regions of the respiratory tree. Our findings suggest aspects of viral dynamics which current in vitro systems may be insufficient to describe, and points to several features of respiratory infections which can be experimentally assessed.</description>

      <title>BMRetriever: Tuning Large Language Models as Better Biomedical Text Retrievers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing effective biomedical retrieval models is important for excelling at knowledge-intensive biomedical tasks but still challenging due to the deficiency of sufficient publicly annotated biomedical data and computational resources. We present BMRetriever, a series of dense retrievers for enhancing biomedical retrieval via unsupervised pre-training on large biomedical corpora, followed by instruction fine-tuning on a combination of labeled datasets and synthetic pairs. Experiments on 5 biomedical tasks across 11 datasets verify BMRetriever's efficacy on various biomedical applications. BMRetriever also exhibits strong parameter efficiency, with the 410M variant outperforming baselines up to 11.7 times larger, and the 2B variant matching the performance of models with over 5B parameters. The training data and model checkpoints are released at \url{https://huggingface.co/BMRetriever} to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and application to new domains.</description>
