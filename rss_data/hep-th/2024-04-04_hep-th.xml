      <title>The Frozen Phase of Heterotic F-theory Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the duality between the Spin$(32)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ heterotic string without vector structure and F-theory with frozen singularities. We give a complete description in theories with $6$d $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ supersymmetry and identify the duals of Spin$(32)/\mathbb{Z}_2$-instantons on ADE singularities without vector structure in the frozen phase of F-theory using an ansatz introduced by Bhardwaj, Morrison, Tachikawa, and Tomasiello. As a consequence, we obtain a strongly coupled description of orbifold phases of type I string theory without vector structure, substantially expanding the list of known examples of $6$d F-theory compactifications with frozen singularities. Supergravity theories can be fused from these instanton theories, in a way that commutes with switching off vector structure, which we use to propose new consistency checks via neutral hypermultiplet counting. Finally, we describe various Higgsings of this duality, and comment on constraints on higher form symmetries.</description>

      <title>Superrotations at Spacelike Infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a consistent set of boundary conditions for gravity in asymptotically flat spacetime at spacelike infinity, which yields an enhancement of the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group with smooth superrotations and new subleading symmetries. These boundary conditions are obtained by allowing fluctuations of the boundary structure which are responsible for divergences in the symplectic form, and a renormalisation procedure is required to obtain finite canonical generators. The latter are then made integrable by incorporating boundary terms into the symplectic structure, which naturally derive from a linearised spin-two boundary field on a curved background with positive cosmological constant. Finally, we show that the canonical generators form a non-linear algebra under the Poisson bracket and verify the consistency of this structure with the Jacobi identity.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Resolution in non-Lorentzian Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from the computation of Symmetry Resolved Entanglement Entropy (SREE) for boosted intervals in a two dimensional Conformal Field Theory, we compute the same in various non-Lorentzian limits, viz, Galilean and Carrollian Conformal Field Theory in same number of dimensions. We approach the problem both from a limiting perspective and by using intrinsic symmetries of respective non-Lorentzian conformal algebras. In particular, we calculate the leading order terms, logarithmic terms, and the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ terms and explicitly show exact compliance with $\textit{equipartition of entanglement}$, even in the non-Lorentzian system. Keeping in mind the holographic origin of SREE for the Carrollian limit, we further compute SREE for BMS$_{3}$-Kac-Moody, which couples a $U(1)\times U(1)$ theory with bulk gravity.</description>

      <title>Coupling of Branes and Twisted Self-Duality in the Maxwell-Chern-Simons Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study three approaches to electric-magnetic duality in the 4-dimensional Maxwell theory coupled to a dyonic point charge and in the 5-dimensional Maxwell-Chern-Simons (MCS) theory coupled to an electric point charge and a magnetic string charge. The three approaches have been developed by Dirac, Bunster and Henneaux, and Pasti, Sorokin and Tonin (PST). In Dirac's formulation, the electric magnetic duality is realized only on the level of the equations of motion. The other two formulations introduce a dual (magnetic) gauge potential to induce manifest twisted self-duality in the action. In particular, we study the relations connecting the three approaches. The main results of this paper are the Bunster-Henneaux and PST formulations of the MCS theory with sources. We compare our result to the PST formulation of 11-dimensional supergravity coupled to the M2- and M5-brane by Bandos, Berkovits, and Sorokin.</description>

      <title>Replica Wormholes and Quantum Hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss recent applications of Euclidean path integrals to the black hole information problem. In calculations with replica wormholes as the next-to-leading order correction to the Gibbons-Hawking saddlepoint, the radiation density matrix approaches a pure state at late times, following the Page curve. We compare unitary evaporation of black holes (in real time), mediated by calculable quantum hair effects, with the replica wormhole results. Both replica wormhole and quantum hair approaches imply that radiation states are macroscopic superpositions of spacetime backgrounds, invalidating firewall and monogamy of entanglement constructions. Importantly, identification of modes inside the horizon with radiation modes (i.e., large scale nonlocality across the horizon) is not required to provide a physical picture of unitary evaporation. Radiation modes can encode the interior information while still remaining independent degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic formulation of vacuum energy density in flat spacetime and potential implications for the cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a thermodynamical definition of the vacuum energy density $\rho_{\rm vac}$, defined as $\langle 0| T_{\mu\nu} |0\rangle = - \rho_{\rm vac} \, g_{\mu\nu}$, in quantum field theory in flat Minkowski space in $D$ spacetime dimensions, which can be computed in the limit of high temperature, namely in the limit $\beta = 1/T \to 0$. It takes the form $\rho_{\rm vac} = {\rm const} \cdot m^D$ where $m$ is a fundamental mass scale and ${\rm "const"}$ is a computable constant which can be positive or negative. Due to modular invariance $\rho_{\rm vac}$ can also be computed in a different non-thermodynamic channel where one spatial dimension is compactifed on a circle of circumference $\beta$ and we confirm this modularity for free massive theories for both bosons and fermions for $D=2,3,4$. We list various properties of $\rho_{\rm vac}$ that are generally required, for instance $\rho_{\rm vac}=0$ for conformal field theories, and others, such as the constraint that $\rho_{\rm vac}$ has opposite signs for free bosons verses fermions of the same mass, which is related to constraints from supersymmetry. Using the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz we compute $\rho_{\rm vac}$ exactly for 2 classes of integrable QFT's in $2D$ and interpreting some previously known results. We apply our definition of $\rho_{\rm vac}$ to Lattice QCD data with two light quarks (up and down) and one additional massive flavor (the strange quark), and find it is negative, $\rho_{\rm vac} \approx - ( 200 \, {\rm MeV} )^4$. Finally we make some remarks on the Cosmological Constant Problem since $\rho_{\rm vac}$ is central to any discussion of it.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy in type II$_1$ von Neumann algebra: examples in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An intriguing feature of type II$_1$ von Neumann algebra is that the entropy of the mixed states is negative. Although the type classification of von Neumann algebra and its consequence in holography have been extensively explored recently, there has not been an explicit calculation of entropy in some physically interesting models with type II$_1$ algebra. In this paper, we study the entanglement entropy $S_n$ of the fixed length state $\{|n\rangle\}$ in Double-Scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, which has been recently shown to exhibit type II$_1$ von Neumann algebra. These states furnish an orthogonal basis for 0-particle chord Hilbert space. We systematically study $S_n$ and its R\'enyi generalizations $S_n^{(m)}$ in various limit of DSSYK model, ranging $q\in[0,1]$. We obtain exotic analytical expressions for the scaling behavior of $S_n^{(m)}$ at large $n$ for random matrix theory limit ($q=0$) and SYK$_2$ limit ($q=1$), for the former we observe highly non-flat entanglement spectrum. We then dive into triple scaling limits where the fixed chord number states become the geodesic wormholes with definite length connecting left/right AdS$_2$ boundary in Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. In semi-classical regime, we match the boundary calculation of entanglement entropy with the dilaton value at the center of geodesic, as a nontrivial check of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula.</description>

      <title>Revisiting thermodynamic topology of Hawking-Page and Davies type phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a common vector field to study the thermodynamic topology of the Davies type and Hawking-Page phase transitions. Existing literature has shown that studying these two types of phase transitions typically requires defining two separate vector fields . In our approach, we adopt Duan's $\phi$-mapping topological current theory to define a novel vector field, denoted as $\phi$, whose critical points exactly correspond to the Davies point and the Hawking-Page phase transition point. More importantly, we can differentiate between these two points by their topological charge. While, the topological charge for the critical point corresponding to the Davies-type phase transition is found to be $-1$, the same for the Hawking-Page phase transition point, it is $+1$. Although our analysis is applicable to all black hole systems where both types of phase transitions are found, we illustrate it using three simple systems as examples: the Schwarzschild AdS black hole, the Reissner-Nordstr\"om AdS black hole in the grand canonical ensemble, and finally the Kerr AdS black holes in the grand canonical ensemble. It is wellknown that these black holes exhibit both Davies and Hawking-Page phase transitions. With our proposed vector $\phi$, the critical points obtained for these three systems exactly match the Davies-type and Hawking-Page phase transition points, and the associated topological charges are found to be $-1$ for the Davies point and $+1$ for the Hawking-Page phase transition point.</description>

      <title>Holographic Carrollian Conformal Scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide holographic realisations in Minkowski spacetime of a free conformal Carrollian scalar field living at null infinity. To this end, we first show that the electric and magnetic limits of a relativistic conformal scalar are equivalent and we study the representation of the Carroll, Poincar\'e and BMS algebras that is realised on the resulting solution space. We then realise it as a quotient of the solution space of a free massless scalar in Minkowski spacetime with unusual falloff, in full analogy with the interpretation of Dirac's singleton as a shortened scalar in Anti de Sitter spacetime.</description>

      <title>Vacuum instability in QED with an asymmetric x-step. New example of exactly solvable case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new exactly solvable case in strong-field QED with one-dimensional step potential (x-step). The corresponding x-step is given by an analytic asymmetric with respect to the axis x reflection function. The step can be considered as a certain analytic "deformation" of the symmetric Sauter field. Moreover, it can be treated as a new regularization of the Klein step field. We study the vacuum instability caused by this x-step in the framework of a nonperturbative approach to strong-field QED. Exact solutions of the Dirac equation used in the corresponding nonperturbative calculations, are represented in the form of stationary plane waves with special left and right asymptotics and identified as components of initial and final wave packets of particles. We show that in spite of the fact that the symmetry with respect to positive and negative bands of energies is broken, distribution of created pairs and other physical quantities can be expressed via elementary functions. We consider the processes of transmission and reflection in the ranges of the stable vacuum and study physical quantities specifying the vacuum instability. We find the differential mean numbers of electron-positron pairs created from the vacuum, the components of current density and energy-momentum tensor of the created electrons and positrons leaving the area of the strong field under consideration. Besides, we study the particular case of the particle creation due to a weakly inhomogeneous electric field and obtain explicitly the total number, the current density and energy-momentum tensor of created particles. Unlike the symmetric case of the Sauter field the asymmetric form of the field under consideration causes the energy density and longitudinal pressure of created electrons to be not equal to the energy density and longitudinal pressure of created positrons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present thesis, we study various models of 2D dilaton gravity known as JT gravity coupled with non-trivial gauge interactions (for instance $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills, quartic interactions between $U(1)$ gauge fields and Modmax interactions etc.). In particular, we investigate the effects of the non-trivial gauge couplings on the thermal properties of black holes and wormholes in two dimensions and compute various physical observables like entropy, free energy, etc. Further, we examine the possibilities of the Hawking-Page transition and wormhole to black hole phase transition in two dimensions. In addition, we also study the transformation properties of boundary stress-energy tensor under the diffeomorphism and $U(1)$ gauge transformation and hence compute the central charge associated with the 1D boundary theory.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of Scalar and Fermion Interacting Field Theory for Arbitrary Loop: Heat-Kernel Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We outline a proposal, based on the Heat-Kernel method, to compute 1PI effective action up to any loop order for quantum field theory with scalar and fermion fields. We algebraically extract the divergences associated with the composite operators without explicitly performing any momentum loop integral. We perform this analysis explicitly for one and two-loop cases and pave the way for three-loop as well. Using our prescription we compute the two-loop counter terms for a theory containing higher mass dimensional effective operators that are polynomial in fields for two different cases: (i) real singlet scalar, and (ii) complex fermion-scalar interacting theories. We also discuss how the minimal Heat-Kernel fails to deal with the effective operators involving derivatives. We explicitly compute the one-loop counter terms for such a case within an $O(n)$ symmetric scalar theory employing a non-minimal Heat-Kernel. Our method computes the counter terms of the composite operators directly and is also useful for extracting infrared divergence in massless limits.</description>

      <title>Entanglement structures from modified IR geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a new proposal connecting the geometry at various radial scales in asymptotic AdS spacetime with entanglement structure at corresponding real-space length scales of the boundary theory. With this proposal, the bulk IR geometry encodes the long-scale entanglement structure of the dual quantum system. We consider two distinct types of IR geometries, namely the spherical case and the hyperbolic case, which are intimately related to the physics of differential entropy and brane-world holography separately. We explore the corresponding change in the dual long-scale entanglement structures, utilizing the tools of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, conditional mutual information, and partial entanglement entropy. The results indicate that modifying the IR geometry leads to a redistribution of entanglement at scales longer than a critical length determined by the location of the IR region, with the two modified IR geometries corresponding to two opposite ways of redistribution. Furthermore, we establish the maximum amount of entanglement that can be modified, which is proportional to the area of the IR region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature constraints are highly desirable in the experimental setup when seeking the synthesis of new carbon structures. Fluctuations of the Dirac field result in temperature-dependent corrections to the Helfrich-Canham formulation, which governs the classical elasticity of the membrane in equilibrium state. Here, we examine the emergent shapes allowed by the effective model up to quadratic order in Ricci curvature and discuss the constraints required to observe them. We determine the mechanical stability conditions and provide a phase diagram characterized by the appearance of a critical temperature $T_c$ that distinguishes between carbon nanotube and fullerene phases. The observation of minimal and developable surfaces is anticipated, respectively, at the high- and low-temperature regimes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our study of the doubled Hilbert space formalism of double-scaled SYK model initiated in [arXiv:2401.07403]. We show that the 1-particle Hilbert space introduced by Lin and Stanford in [arXiv:2307.15725] is related to the doubled Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_0\otimes \mathcal{H}_0$ of the 0-particle Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_0$ by some linear isomorphism $\mathcal{C}$. It turns out that the entangler and disentangler appeared in our previous study are given by the dual (or adjoint) of $\mathcal{C}^{-1}$ and $\mathcal{C}$.</description>

Abstract: In the present paper, using the split Casimir generators we have found the decomposition of the antisymmetric part of $\mathfrak{ad}^{\otimes 5}$. This decomposition contains the representations that appeared in the decomposition of $\mathfrak{ad}^{\otimes 4}$ and only one new representation $X_5$. The dimension of this representation has been proposed in [A.J.Macfarlane, H.Pfeiffer, J.Phys.A: Math. Gen. 36 (2003) 2305]. Our decomposition is valid for all Lie algebras.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study radiation from charged particles in circular motion around a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in an asymptotically uniform magnetic field. In curved space, the radiation reaction force is described by the DeWitt-Brehme equation, which includes a complicated, non-local tail term. We show that, contrary to some claims in the literature, this term cannot, in general, be neglected. We account for self-force effects directly by calculating the electromagnetic energy flux at infinity and on the horizon. The radiative field is obtained using black hole perturbation theory. We solve the relevant equations analytically, in the low-frequency and slow-motion approximation, as well as numerically in the general case. Our results show that great care must be taken when neglecting the tail term, which is often fundamental to capture the dynamics of the particle: in fact, it only seems to be negligible when the magnetic force greatly dominates the gravitational force, so that the motion is well described by the Abraham--Lorentz--Dirac equation. We also report a curious "horizon dominance effect" that occurs for a radiating particle in a circular orbit around a black hole (emitting either scalar, electromagnetic or gravitational waves): for fixed orbital radius, the fraction of energy that is absorbed by the black hole can be made arbitrarily large by decreasing the particle velocity.</description>

      <title>A Scotogenic Model as a Prototype for Leptogenesis with One Single Gauge Singlet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of a minimal Scotogenic model with two additional scalar doublets and a single heavy Majorana fermion to explain neutrino masses, dark matter, and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. In this minimal setup, Leptogenesis is purely flavored, and a second Majorana neutrino is not necessary because the Yukawa couplings of the extra doublets yield the necessary $CP$-odd phases. The mechanism we employ can also be applied to a wide range of scenarios with at least one singlet and two gauge multiplets. Despite stringent limits from the dark matter abundance, direct detection experiments, and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe, we find a parametric region consistent with all bounds which could resolve the above shortcomings of the Standard Model of particle physics. Methodically, we improve on the calculation of correlations between the mixing scalar fields given their finite width. We also present an argument to justify the kinetic equilibrium approximation for out-of-equilibrium distribution functions often used in calculations of Baryogenesis and Leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Geometrical Heavy Lifting: Yang-Mills, Spin, and Torsion in Dynamical Projective Gravitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thomas-Whitehead (TW) gravity is a gauge theory of gravitation based on projective geometry. The theory maintains projective symmetry through the TW connection, an affine connection over the volume bundle of the spacetime manifold. TW gravity obtains dynamics through Lovelock expansions in the action while preserving general relativity as a weak field limit. In this paper we clarify the process of lifting tensor and spinor fields from spacetime to the volume bundle and demonstrate that a choice of lifting amounts to a gauge fixing condition. This leads to a natural extension of previous work, where we now realize these prior constructions have been restricted to a particular gauge. In pursuit of generality, we also introduce torsion to the TW connection, leading to new dynamics. In particular, the appearance of torsion induces interaction terms involving gravitational coupling with Yang-Mills fields and Dirac spinors. An explicit realization of this is a geometrically sourced chiral mass term arising from the torsion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Large curvature fluctuations from no-scale supergravity with a spectator field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the large curvature perturbations which can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the context of no-scale supergravity. Our study does not depend on any exotic scenario, such as scalar potentials with inflection points or bulks, and aims to avoid the fine-tuning of model parameters to achieve the formation of PBHs. This formation relies on the quantum fluctuations of a light spectator stochastic field after the inflationary period. Our analysis is based on the SU(2,1)/SU(2)$\times$U(1) symmetry, considering both the inflaton and the spectator field. Specifically, we examine existing no-scale models with Starobinsky-like scalar potentials that are consistent with observable constraints on inflation from measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). These models involve two chiral fields: the inflaton and the modulus field. We propose a novel role for the modulus field as a spectator field, responsible for generating PBHs. Our hypothesis suggests that while the inflaton field satisfies the CMB constraints of inflation, it is the modulus field acting as the spectator that leads to large curvature perturbations, capable to explain the production of PBHs. Additionally, we prioritize retaining the inflationary constraints from the CMB through the consideration of spectator fluctuations. Therefore, by exploring the relationship between these fields within the framework of the SU(2,1)/SU(2)$\times$U(1) symmetry, our aim is to unveil their implications for the formation of PBHs.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational wave observations can test the validity of General Relativity (GR) in the strong field regime. Certain classes of scalar-tensor theories indeed predict that compact objects can exhibit significant deviations from their GR counterparts. Here we explore the quasinormal modes of axial perturbations in spherically symmetric black holes in three such classes: (i) dilatonic black holes with an additional scalar-Ricci coupling (EdRGB), (ii) spontaneously scalarized black holes (EsRGB) with a quadratic coupling to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant and the Ricci scalar, (iii) spontaneously scalarized black holes with a quadratic and a quartic coupling to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of dark energy and dark matter is one of modern physics' greatest open problems. Scalar-tensor theories with screened scalar fields like the chameleon model are among the most popular proposed solutions. In this article, we present the first analysis of the impact of a chameleon field on the dynamical Casimir effect, whose main feature is the particle production associated with a resonant condition of boundary periodic motion in cavities. For this, we employ a recently developed method to compute the evolution of confined quantum scalar fields in a globally hyperbolic spacetime by means of time-dependent Bogoliubov transformations. As a result, we show that particle production is reduced due to the presence of the chameleon field. In addition, our results for the Bogoliubov coefficients and the mean number of created particles agree with known results in the absence of a chameleon field. Our results initiate the discussion of the evolution of quantum fields on screened scalar field backgrounds.</description>

      <title>A plethora of long-range neutrino interactions probed by DUNE and T2HK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upcoming neutrino experiments will soon search for new neutrino interactions more thoroughly than ever before, boosting the prospects of extending the Standard Model. In anticipation of this, we forecast the capability of two of the leading long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, DUNE and T2HK, to look for new flavor-dependent neutrino interactions with electrons, protons, and neutrons that could affect the transitions between different flavors. We interpret their sensitivity in the context of long-range neutrino interactions, mediated by a new neutral boson lighter than $10^{-10}$ eV, and sourced by the vast amount of nearby and distant matter in the Earth, Moon, Sun, Milky Way, and beyond. For the first time, we explore the sensitivity of DUNE and T2HK to a wide variety of $U(1)^\prime$ symmetries, built from combinations of lepton and baryon numbers, each of which induces new interactions that affect oscillations differently. We find ample sensitivity: in all cases, DUNE and T2HK may constrain the existence of the new interaction even if it is supremely feeble, may discover it, and, in some cases, may identify the symmetry responsible for it.</description>

      <title>Spin foam amplitude of the black-to-white hole transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been conjectured that quantum gravity effects may cause the black-to-white hole transition due to quantum tunneling. The transition amplitude of this process is explored within the framework of the spin foam model on a 2-complex containing 56 vertices. We develop a systematic way to construct the bulk triangulation from the boundary triangulation to obtain the 2-complex. By using Thiemann's complexifier coherent state as the boundary state to resemble the semiclassical geometry, we introduce a procedure to calculate the parameters labeling the coherent state from the continuous curved geometry. Considering that triad fields of different orientations, i.e., $e_i^a$ and $-e_i^a$, give the same intrinsic geometry of the boundary, we creatively adopt the boundary state as a superposition of the coherent states associated with both orientations. We employ the method of complex critical point to numerically compute the transition amplitude. Despite the numerical results, it is interestingly found that the transition amplitude is dominated by the terms allowing the change in orientation. This suggests that the black-to-white hole transition should be accompanied by quantum tunneling process of a change in orientation.</description>

Abstract: We provide evidence for a correspondence between the formation of primordial black holes and the stability of circular null geodesics around the collapsing perturbation. We first show that the critical threshold of the compaction function to form a black hole in radiation is well approximated by the critical threshold for the appearance of the first unstable circular orbit. We also show that the critical exponent in the scaling law of the primordial black hole mass close to the threshold is set by the inverse of the Lyapunov coefficient of the unstable orbits when a self-similar stage is developed close to criticality.</description>

Abstract: Bethe ansatz equations for spin-$s$ Heisenberg spin chain with $s\ge1$ are significantly more difficult to analyze than the spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ case, due to the presence of repeated roots. As a result, it is challenging to derive extra conditions for the Bethe roots to be physical and study the related completeness problem. In this paper, we propose the rational $Q$-system for the XXX$_s$ spin chain. Solutions of the proposed $Q$-system give all and only physical solutions of the Bethe ansatz equations required by completeness. This is checked numerically and proved rigorously. The rational $Q$-system is equivalent to the requirement that the solution and the corresponding dual solution of the $TQ$-relation are both polynomials, which we prove rigorously. Based on this analysis, we propose the extra conditions for solutions of the XXX$_s$ Bethe ansatz equations to be physical.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores quantum field theories with pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians, where PT-symmetric Hamiltonians serve as a special case. In specific regimes, these pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians have real eigenspectra, orthogonal eigenstates, and unitary time evolution. So far, most pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories have been constructed using analytic continuation or by adding non-Hermitian terms to otherwise Hermitian Hamiltonians. However, in this paper, we take a different approach. We construct pseudo-Hermitian scalar and fermionic quantum field theories from first principles by extending the Poincar\'e algebra to include non-Hermitian generators. This allows us to develop consistent pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories, with Lagrangian densities that transform appropriately under the proper Poincar\'e group. By doing so, we establish a more solid theoretical foundation for the emerging field of non-Hermitian quantum field theory.</description>

We define Carroll black holes as solutions of Carroll gravity that exhibit Carroll thermal properties and have a Carroll extremal surface, notions introduced in our work.

As examples, we discuss the Carroll versions of Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstroem, and BTZ black holes and black hole solutions of generic 1+1 dimensional Carroll dilaton gravity, including Carroll JT and Carroll Witten black holes.</description>

Abstract: Recently an algorithm to build $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ duals, including mirror duals, of 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ quiver theories and their 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ uplift has been introduced. In this work we use this new tool to study the so-called bad theories. Our approach allows us to determine exactly indices/partition functions for generic values of fugacities/real mass and FI parameters revealing their surprising feature: the 4d index/3d partition function of a bad theory behaves as a sum of distributions rather than an ordinary function of the deformation parameters. We focus on the bad SQCD, with $U(N_c)$ gauge group in 3d and $USp(2N_c)$ in 4d, while in an upcoming paper we will consider linear quivers which, in the 3d case, have both unitary and special unitary bad nodes.</description>

Abstract: We study the renormalization of a particular sector of Horndeski theory. In particular, we focus on the nonminimal coupling of a scalar field to the Gauss-Bonnet term and its kinetic coupling to the Einstein tensor. Adopting a power expansion on the scalar function that couples the Gauss-Bonnet term, we find specific conditions on their coefficients such that the action and charges are finite. To accomplish the latter, we add a finite set of intrinsic boundary terms. The contribution of the nonminimal coupling generates an effective scalar mass, allowing us to recover a modified Breitenlohner-Freedman bound. Furthermore, we compute the holographic 1-point functions and Ward identities associated with the scalar field and the metric. We constrain the parameter space of the theory by taking into account the preservation of scaling symmetry at the boundary.</description>

Abstract: The quantization of a massive spin $1/2$ field that satisfies the Klein-Gordon equation is studied. The framework is consistent, provided it is formulated as a pseudo-hermitian quantum field theory by the redefinition of the field dual and the identification of an operator that modifies the inner product of states in Hilbert space to preserve a real energy spectrum and unitary evolution. Since the fermion field has mass dimension one, the theory admits renormalizable fermion self-interactions.</description>

Abstract: We consider a four-dimensional $SU(N_c)$ gauge theory coupled to $N_f$ species of color fermions and $N_f^2$ colorless scalars. The quantum field theory possesses a weakly interacting ultraviolet fixed point that we determine from beta functions computed up to four-loop order in the gauge coupling, and up to three-loop order in the Yukawa and quartic scalar couplings. The fixed point has one relevant direction giving rise to asymptotic safety. We compute fixed point values of dimensionless couplings together with the corresponding scaling exponents up to the first three nontrivial orders in Veneziano parameter $\epsilon$, both for infinite and finite number of colors $N_c$. We also consider anomalous dimensions for fields, scalar mass squared, and a class of dimension-three operators. Contrary to previous studies, we take into account possible mixing of the latter and compute eigenvalues of the corresponding matrix. Further, we investigate the size of the conformal window in the Veneziano limit and its dependence on $N_c$.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Casimir energy on $\mathcal{N}=1$ conformal supergravity backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17740v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a first principles derivation of the supersymmetric Casimir energy of $\mathcal{N}=1$ SCFTs in four dimensions using the supercharge algebra on general conformal supergravity backgrounds that admit Killing spinors. The superconformal Ward identities imply that there exists a continuous family of conserved R-currents on supersymmetric backgrounds, as well as a continuous family of conserved currents for each conformal Killing vector. These continuous families interpolate between the consistent and covariant R-current and energy-momentum tensor. The resulting Casimir energy, therefore, depends on two continuous parameters corresponding to the choice of conserved currents used to define the energy and R-charge. This ambiguity is in addition to any possible scheme dependence due to local terms in the effective action. As an application, we evaluate the general expression for the supersymmetric Casimir energy we obtain on a family of backgrounds with the cylinder topology $\mathbb{R}\times S^3$ and admitting a single Majorana supercharge. Our result is a direct consequence of the supersymmetry algebra, yet it resembles more known expressions for the non-supersymmetric Casimir energy on such backgrounds and differs from the supersymmetric Casimir energy obtained from the zero temperature limit of supersymmetric partition functions. We defer a thorough analysis of the relation between these results to future work.</description>

      <title>On the Hilbert Space of Dyons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the construction of the Hilbert space of non-relativistic particles moving in three spatial dimensions. This is given by the space of sections of a line bundle that can in general be topologically non-trivial. Such bundles are classified by a set of integers--one for each pair of particles--and arise physically when we describe the interactions of dyons, particles which carry both electric and magnetic charges. The choice of bundle fixes the representation of the Euclidean group carried by the Hilbert space. These representations are shown to recover the 'pairwise helicity' formalism recently discussed in the literature.</description>

      <title>A double scaling for the 4d/3d reduction of $\mathcal{N}=1$ dualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we revisit the $S^1$ reduction of 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theories, considering a double scaling on the radius of the circle and on the real masses arising from the global symmetries in the compactification. We discuss the implication of this double scaling for SQCD with gauge algebra of ABCD type. We then show how our prescription translates in the reduction of the 4d superconformal index to the 3d squashed three sphere partition function. This allows us to derive the expected integral identities for the 3d dualities directly from the four dimensional ones. This is relevant for the study of orthogonal SQCD, where the derivation from the 4d index is not possible in absence of the double scaling, because of a divergence due to a flat direction in the Coulomb branch of the effective theory on the circle. Furthermore, we obtain, for the even orthogonal case, a 3d duality with a quadratic fundamental monopole superpotential already discussed in the literature, that receives in this way an explanation from 4d.</description>

      <title>The worldvolume fermion as baryon in holographic QCD with a theta angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the worldvolume fermion on the flavor brane in the D0-D4/D8 model which is holographically equivalent to the four-dimensional QCD with a theta term. The action for the worldvolume fermion is obtained by the T-duality rules in string theory and we accordingly derive its effectively five-dimensional, canonical four-dimensional forms by using the systematical dimensional reduction and decomposition of spinor. Afterwards, we employ the AdS/CFT dictionary in order to evaluate the two-point correlation function as the spectral function for the worldvolume fermion and interpret the fermion as baryon by analyzing its quantum number with the baryon vertex in holography. In this sense, the interacted action involving the worldvolume fermion and gauge field on the flavor brane are finally derived in holography which describes the various interaction of meson and baryon with the theta angle in large-N limit. Therefore, this work provides a holographic picture to describe baryon and its interactions based on string theory, in particular, in the presence of a theta angle.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian Multipoles from the Next-to-Leading Post-Minkowskian Gravitational Waveform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the frequency-domain LO and NLO post-Minkowskian (PM) waveforms obtained from the tree-level and one-loop amplitudes describing the scattering of two massive scalar objects and the emission of one graviton. We explicitly calculate their post-Newtonian (PN) limit obtaining an expansion up to the third subleading PN order in all ingredients: the tree-level amplitude, the odd and even parts of the real one-loop kernel, and the Compton or "rescattering" cuts, thus reaching 3PN precision for the latter. We provide explicit expressions for the multipole decomposition of these results in the center-of-mass frame and compare them with the results obtained from the classical Multipolar post-Minkowskian (MPM) method. We find perfect agreement between the two, once the BMS supertranslation frame is properly adjusted and the infrared divergences due to rescattering are suitably subtracted in dimensional regularization. This shows that the approach proposed in arXiv:2312.07452 can be applied beyond the soft-regime ensuring the agreement between amplitude-based and MPM results for generic frequencies.</description>

      <title>A Goldstone Boson Equivalence for Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effective field theory of single-field inflation characterizes the inflationary epoch in terms of a pattern of symmetry breaking. An operator acquires a time-dependent vacuum expectation value, defining a preferred spatial slicing. In the absence of dynamical gravity, the fluctuations around the time-dependent background are described by the Goldstone boson associated with this symmetry breaking process. With gravity, the Goldstone is eaten by the metric, becoming the scalar metric fluctuation. In this paper, we will show that in general single-field inflation, the statistics of scalar metric fluctuations are given by the statistics of this Goldstone boson decoupled from gravity up to corrections that are controlled as an expansion in slow-roll parameters. This even holds in the presence of additional parameters, like the speed of sound, that naively enhance the impact of the gravitational terms. In the process, we derive expressions for leading and sub-leading gravitational corrections to all-orders in the Goldstone boson.</description>

      <title>Spinning Particle Geometries in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study spinning particle/defect geometries in the context of AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$. These solutions lie below the BTZ threshold, and can be obtained from identifications of AdS$_3$. We construct the Feynman propagator by solving the bulk equation of motion in the spinning particle geometry, summing over the modes of the fields and passing to the boundary. The quantization of the scalar fields becomes challenging when confined to the regions that are causally well-behaved. If the region containing closed timelike curves (CTCs) is included, the normalization of the scalar fields enjoys an analytical simplification and the propagator can be expressed as an infinite sum over image geodesics. In the dual CFT$_2$, the propagator can be recast as the HHLL four-point function, where by taking into account the $PSL (2,\mathbb{Z})$ modular images, we recover the bulk computation. We comment on the casual behavior of bulk geometries associated with single-trace operators of spin scaling with the central charge below the BTZ threshold.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the first class constraints that describe the infinite spin irreducible $4D$ Poincar\'{e} group representation in flat space to new first class constraints in $AdS_4$ space. The constraints are realized as operators acting in Fock space spanned by the creation and annihilation operators with two-component spinor indices. As a result, we obtain a new closed gauge algebra on $AdS_4$ with the known flat space limit. Using this gauge algebra, we construct the BRST charge and derive the Lagrangian and gauge transformations for free bosonic infinite spin field theory in $AdS_4$ space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the duality between the ABJ(M) theory at Chern-Simons level $k=4$ and the orientifold ABJ theory at Chern-Simons level $k=1$ by using the $S^{3}$ partition function. The partition function can be computed using the supersymmetric localization in terms of a matrix model, and we derive an ideal Fermi gas system by applying the Fermi gas formalism to the matrix model. By using this formalism, we show that the matrix model can be embedded in the partition function of $\hat{A}_{3}$ or $\hat{D}_{3}$ quiver theories, and the equality of these quiver theories, which comes from $\hat{A}_{3}=\hat{D}_{3}$, leads to exact relations of the matrix models. These exact relations can be used to check the identification of the flavor symmetries. The perfect agreement between the matrix models also implies that no decoupled sector is needed.</description>

Abstract: Fibonacci anyons provide the simplest possible model of non-Abelian fusion rules: [1] x [1] = [0] + [1]. We propose a conformal field theory construction of topological quantum registers based on Fibonacci anyons realized as quasiparticle excitations in the Z_3 parafermion fractional quantum Hall state. To this end, the results of Ardonne and Schoutens for the correlation function of n = 4 Fibonacci fields are extended to the case of arbitrary n (and 3 r electrons). Special attention is paid to the braiding properties of the obtained correlators. We explain in details the construction of a monodromy representation of the Artin braid group acting on n-point conformal blocks of Fibonacci anyons. For low n (up to n = 8), the matrices of braid group generators are displayed explicitly. A simple recursion formula makes it possible to extend without efforts the construction to any n. Finally, we construct N qubit computational spaces in terms of conformal blocks of 2N + 2 Fibonacci anyons.</description>

We identify the gauge theory in correspondence is a supergroup version of the gauge origami, from which we construct the transfer matrix of the eqCM system.</description>

      <title>Anyon exclusions statistics on surfaces with gapped boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:1809.02604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An anyon exclusion statistics, which generalizes the Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics of bosons and fermions, was proposed by Haldane[1]. The relevant past studies had considered only anyon systems without any physical boundary but boundaries often appear in real-life materials. When fusion of anyons is involved, certain `pseudo-species' anyons appear in the exotic statistical weights of non-Abelian anyon systems; however, the meaning and significance of pseudo-species remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose an extended anyon exclusion statistics on surfaces with gapped boundaries, introducing mutual exclusion statistics between anyons as well as the boundary components. Motivated by Refs. [2, 3], we present a formula for the statistical weight of many-anyon states obeying the proposed statistics. We develop a systematic basis construction for non-Abelian anyons on any Riemann surfaces with gapped boundaries. From the basis construction, we have a standard way to read off a canonical set of statistics parameters and hence write down the extended statistical weight of the anyon system being studied. The basis construction reveals the meaning of pseudo-species. A pseudo-species has different `excitation' modes, each corresponding to an anyon species. The `excitation' modes of pseudo-species corresponds to good quantum numbers of subsystems of a non-Abelian anyon system. This is important because often (e.g., in topological quantum computing) we may be concerned about only the entanglement between such subsystems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.09181v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analytically extend the 5D Myers-Perry metric through the event and Cauchy horizons by defining Eddington-Finkelstein-type coordinates. Then, we use the orthonormal frame formalism to formulate and perform separation of variables on the massive Dirac equation, and analyse the asymptotic behaviour at the horizons and at infinity of the solutions to the radial ordinary differential equation (ODE) thus obtained. Using the essential self-adjointness result of Finster and R\"oken and Stone's formula, we obtain an integral spectral representation of the Dirac propagator for spinors with low masses and suitably bounded frequency spectra in terms of resolvents of the Dirac Hamiltonian, which can in turn be expressed in terms of Green's functions of the radial ODE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09273v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the production of secondary gravity waves in Galileon inflation with an ultra-slow roll (USR) phase and show that the spectrum of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) in this case is consistent with the recent NANOGrav 15-year data and with sensitivities of other ground and space-based missions, LISA, BBO, DECIGO, CE, ET, HLVK (consists of aLIGO, aVirgo, and KAGRA), and HLV(03). Thanks to the non-renormalization property of Galileon theory, the amplitude of the large fluctuation is controllable at the sharp transitions between SR and USR regions. We show that the behaviour of the GW spectrum, when one-loop effects are included in the scalar power spectrum, is preserved under a shift of the sharp transition scale with peak amplitude $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2\sim {\cal O}(10^{-6})$, and hence it can cover a wide range of frequencies within ${\cal O}(10^{-9}{\rm Hz} - 10^{7}{\rm Hz})$. An analysis of the allowed mass range for primordial black holes (PBHs) is also performed, where we find that mass values ranging from ${\cal O}(1M_{\odot} - 10^{-18}M_{\odot})$ can be generated over the corresponding allowed range of low and high frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15273v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement between disjoint subregions in quantum critical systems through the lens of the logarithmic negativity. We work with systems in arbitrary dimensions, including conformal field theories and their corresponding lattice Hamiltonians, as well as resonating valence-bond states. At small separations, the logarithmic negativity is big and displays universal behaviour, but we show non-perturbatively that it decays faster than any power at large separations. This can already be seen in the minimal setting of single-spin subregions. The corresponding absence of distillable entanglement at large separations generalises the 1d result, and indicates that quantum critical groundstates do not possess long-range bipartite entanglement, at least for bosons. For systems with fermions, a more suitable definition of the logarithmic negativity exists that takes into account fermion parity, and we show that it decays algebraically. Along the way we obtain general results for the moments of the partially-transposed density matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this Letter we consider renormalization of a class of scalar operators with fixed hypercharge $Q$ within the Standard Model. We carry out explicit computation of the corresponding anomalous dimensions up to the three-loop order. In spite of the fact that our result is gauge-dependent, in the Landau gauge and in the limit of vanishing weak isospin coupling the expression can be matched to recent gauge-independent computation based on the large-charge method. Our result serves an important and non-trivial cross-check of new developments in large-charge expansion and applications of the latter to realistic gauge theories. We not only confirm the leading and subleading terms in perturbative $Q$ expansion up to three loops, but also provide the expressions for sub-subleading coefficients that at the moment are not captured by the large-charge approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08997v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work derives 5 methods to evaluate families of odd zeta values by combining a power of $\pi$ with Lambert series whose ratios of successive terms tend to $e^{-\pi\sqrt{a}}$ with integers $a\ge7$, outperforming Ramanujan's results with merit $a=4$. Families with $a=7$ and $a=8$ evaluate $\zeta(2n+1)$. Families with $a=9$ and $a=16$ evaluate $\zeta(4n+1)$ with faster convergence. A fifth family with $a=12$ evaluates $\zeta(6n+1)$ and gives the fastest convergence for $\zeta(6n+7)$. Members of three of the families were discovered empirically by Simon Plouffe. An intensive new search strongly suggests that there are no more than 5 families with integers $a\ge7$. There are at least 20 families that involve Lambert series with rational $a&gt;4$. Quasi-modular transformations of Lambert series resolve rational sequences that were discovered empirically. Expansions of Lambert series in polylogarithms, familiar from quantum field theory, provide proofs of all known evaluations with rational merit $a&gt;4$.</description>

      <title>The Fate of Entanglement</title>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a fundamentally non-local correlation between particles. In its simplest realisation, a measurement on one particle is affected by a prior measurement on its partner, irrespective of their separation. For multiple particles, purely collective types of entanglement exist but their detection, even theoretically, remains an outstanding open question. Here, we show that all forms of multi-party entanglement entirely disappear during the typical evolution of a system as it heats up, evolves in time, or as its parts become separated. These results follow from the nature of the entanglement-free continent in the space of physical states, and hold in great generality. We illustrate these phenomena with a frustrated molecular quantum magnet in and out of equilibrium. In contrast, if the particles are fermions, such as electrons, another notion of entanglement exists that precludes entanglement-free regions, and thus protects quantum correlations. These findings provide fundamental knowledge about the structure of entanglement in quantum matter and architectures, paving the way for its manipulation.</description>

      <title>Deconfined quantum criticality of nodal $d$-wave superconductivity, N\'eel order and charge order on the square lattice at half-filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a SU(2) lattice gauge theory on the square lattice, with a single fundamental complex fermion and a single fundamental complex boson on each lattice site. Projective symmetries of the gauge-charged fermions are chosen so that they match with those of the spinons of the $\pi$-flux spin liquid. Global symmetries of all gauge-invariant observables are chosen to match with those of the particle-hole symmetric electronic Hubbard model at half-filling. Consequently, both the fundamental fermion and fundamental boson move in an average background $\pi$-flux, their gauge-invariant composite is the physical electron, and eliminating gauge fields in a strong gauge-coupling expansion yields an effective extended Hubbard model for the electrons. The SU(2) gauge theory displays several confining/Higgs phases: a nodal $d$-wave superconductor, and states with N\'eel, valence-bond solid, charge, or staggered current orders. There are also a number of quantum phase transitions between these phases which are very likely described by 2+1 dimensional deconfined conformal gauge theories, and we present large flavor expansions for such theories. These include the phenomenologically attractive case of a transition between an insulator with N\'eel order and a $d$-wave superconductor with gapless Bogoliubov quasiparticles at 4 nodal points in the Brillouin zone.</description>

      <title>Direction-dependent conductivity in planar Hall set-ups with tilted Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the magnetoelectric conductivity tensors in planar Hall set-ups, which are built with tilted Weyl semimetals (WSMs) and multi-Weyl semimetals (mWSMs), considering all possible relative orientations of the electromagnetic fields ($\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $) and the direction of the tilt. The non-Drude part of the response arises from a nonzero Berry curvature in the vicinity of the WSM/mWSM node under consideration. Only in the presence of a nonzero tilt do we find linear-in-$ | \mathbf B| $ terms in set-ups where the tilt-axis is not perpendicular to the plane spanned by $\mathbf E $ and $ \mathbf B $. The advantage of the emergence of the linear-in-$ | \mathbf B| $ terms is that, unlike the various $| \mathbf B|^2 $-dependent terms that can contribute to experimental observations, they have purely a topological origin, and they dominate the overall response-characteristics in the realistic parameter regimes. The important signatures of these terms are that they (1) change the periodicity of the response from $\pi $ to $2\pi$, when we consider their dependence on the angle $\theta $ between $\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $; and (2) lead to an overall change in sign of the conductivity depending on $\theta$, when measured with respect to the $\mathbf B =0$ case.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{O}\,(1/\sqrt\omega)$ anomaly in Brans-Dicke gravity with trace-carrying matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact static spherisymmetric solution for the Brans-Dicke action sourced by a self-gravitating massless Klein-Gordon helicity-0 field. In contrast to the Maxwell electromagnetic field, a Klein-Gordon field possesses an energy-momentum tensor with $\textit{non-vanishing trace}$. Upon a Weyl mapping into the Einstein frame, the transformed Brans-Dicke scalar field takes on the role of a "dilaton" coupled with the Klein-Gordon field. Despite this dilatonic coupling, the field equations of the resulting Einstein-Klein-Gordon-dilaton action are fully soluble when employing the harmonic radial coordinate. The exact solution derived herein can serve as a prototype for future Brans-Dicke gravity studies involving trace-carrying matter fields. Notably, in the limit of infinite $\omega$, the Brans-Dicke scalar field exhibits an anomalous behavior of ${\cal O}\,(1/\sqrt\omega)$ as opposed to ${\cal O}\,(1/\omega)$. As a consequence, the solution converges to a spacetime configuration of General Relativity sourced by the original Klein-Gordon field and a free scalar field, the latter of which is the ${\cal O}\,(1/\sqrt\omega)$ "remnant" of the Brans-Dicke scalar field. Furthermore, we provide a formal mathematical proof substantiating these two conclusions. Although the ${\cal O}\,(1/\sqrt\omega)$ anomaly has been previously discovered for Brans-Dicke vacuum and Brans-Dicke-Maxwell electrovacuum, our findings establish its prevalence in Brans-Dicke gravity $\textit{regardless}$ of the trace of the energy-momentum tensor of the source. Taken together, the ${\cal O}\,(1/\sqrt\omega)$ anomaly challenges the conventional belief in the ${\cal O}\,(1/\omega)$ signature commonly associated with Brans-Dicke gravity. In particular, it may have implications in improving the relativistic corrections to Newtonian gravity beyond the weak-field parametrized post-Newtonian formalism.</description>

      <title>Spatial Dependence of the Growth Factor in Scalar-Tensor Cosmology</title>

Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories have taken on a key role in attempts to confront the growing open questions in standard cosmology. It is important to understand entirely their dynamics at perturbative level including any possible spatial dependence in their growth of large scale structures. In this work, we investigate the spatial dependence of the growth rate of scalar-tensor theories through the M\'{e}sz\'{a}ros equation. We confirm that at subhorizon level this dependence does not play a major role for viable models. However, we establish conditions on which this criterion is met which may be important for developing new models. In our work, we consider three specific models that exhibit spatial dependence of the growth rate at subhorizon modes, which may also be important for early Universe models.</description>

      <title>Sharp departure beyond post-Newtonian formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a concrete example exhibiting marked deviation from the parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) approximation in a modified theory of gravity. Specifically, we derive the exact formula for the Robertson parameter $\gamma$ in Brans-Dicke gravity for compact mass sources, explicitly incorporating the pressure content of these sources. We achieve this by exploiting the $\textit integrability$ of the 00-component of the Brans-Dicke field equation. In place of the conventional PPN result $\gamma_{\,PPN}=\frac{\omega+1}{\omega+2}$, we obtain the analytical expression $\gamma_{\,exact}=\frac{\omega+1+(\omega+2)\varTheta}{\omega+2+(\omega+1)\varTheta}$ where $\varTheta$ is the ratio of the total pressure $P_\parallel^*+2P_\perp^*$ and total energy $E^*$ contained within the mass source. Our non-perturbative formula is valid for all field strengths and types of matter comprising the mass source. We draw four key conclusions: (1) The usual $\gamma_{\,PPN}$ formula is violated in the presence of pressure, viz. when $\varTheta\neq0$, revealing a limitation of the PPN approximation in Brans-Dicke gravity. (2) The PPN result mainly stems from the assumption of pressureless matter. Even in the weak-field star case, non-zero pressure leads to a violation of the PPN $\gamma$ formula. Conversely, the PPN result is a good approximation for low-pressure matter, i.e. when $\varTheta\approx0$, for all field strengths. (3) Observational constraints on $\gamma$ set joint bounds on $\omega$ and $\varTheta$, with the latter representing a global characteristic of a mass source. If the equation of state of matter in the mass source approaches the ultra-relativistic form, entailing $\varTheta\simeq1$, $\gamma_{\,exact}$ converges to 1 irrespective of $\omega$. (4) In a broader context, our findings indicate the latent significance of considering the interior structure of stars in observational astronomy.</description>
