      <title>Machine Learning for Reducing Noise in RF Control Signals at Industrial Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial particle accelerators typically operate in dirtier environments than research accelerators, leading to increased noise in RF and electronic systems. Furthermore, given that industrial accelerators are mass produced, less attention is given to optimizing the performance of individual systems. As a result, industrial accelerators tend to underperform their own hardware capabilities. Improving signal processing for these machines will improve cost and time margins for deployment, helping to meet the growing demand for accelerators for medical sterilization, food irradiation, cancer treatment, and imaging. Our work focuses on using machine learning techniques to reduce noise in RF signals used for pulse-to-pulse feedback in industrial accelerators. Here we review our algorithms and observed results for simulated RF systems, and discuss next steps with the ultimate goal of deployment on industrial systems.</description>

      <title>Cs-O$_2$-Li as enhanced NEA surface layer with increased lifetime for GaAs photocathodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GaAs-based photocathodes are the only viable source capable of providing spin-polarized electrons for accelerator applications. This type of photocathode requires a thin surface layer, in order to achieve negative electron affinity (NEA) for efficient photo-emission. However, this layer is vulnerable to environmental and operational effects, leading to a decay of the quantum efficiency $\eta$ characterized by a decay constant or lifetime $\tau$. In order to increase $\tau$, additional agents can be introduced during the activation procedure to improve the chemical robustness of the surface layer. This paper presents the results of recent research on Li as enhancement agent for photocathode activation using Cs and O$_2$, forming Cs-O$_2$-Li as enhanced NEA layer. Measurements yielded an increase in lifetime by a factor of up to 19 $\pm$ 2 and an increase in extracted charge by a factor of up to 16.5 $\pm$ 2.4, without significant reduction of $\eta$. This performance is equal to or better than that reported for other enhanced NEA layers so far.</description>
