      <title>The Non-Abelian Tensor Square of Finite Metacyclic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the group $\nu(G)$, an extension of the non-abelian tensor square $G$ by the direct product $G\times G$, in order to determine a presentation of $G \otimes G$ when $G$ is a general finite metacyclic group, $G=g(a,b; m,n, r, s)$, with $m$ odd. A presentation of $\nu(G)$ is obtained from that of $G$ and, consequently, we describe the appropriate relevant sections of $\nu(G)$, such as the non-abelian tensor square, the exterior square $G \wedge G$ and the Schur multiplier, $M(G)$.</description>

      <title>On $p$-parts of conjugacy class sizes and the index of the $p$-core</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a prime $p$ and an arbitrary finite group $G$,
  we show that if $p^{2}$ does not divide the size of each conjugacy class of \emph{$p$-regular} element (element of order not divisible by $p$)
  in $G$, then the largest power of $p$ dividing the index $|G:\mathbf{O}_{p}(G)|$ is at most $p^{2}$.</description>

      <title>Embedding groups into acyclic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that labelled Thompson groups and twisted Brin--Thompson groups are all acyclic. This allows us to prove several new embedding results for groups. First, every group of type $F_n$ embeds quasi-isometrically as a subgroup of an acyclic group of type $F_n$ that has no proper finite-index subgroups. This improves results of Baumslag--Dyer--Heller ($n=1$) and Baumslag--Dyer--Miller ($n=2$) from the early 80s, as well as a more recent result of Bridson ($n=2$). Second, we show that every finitely generated group embeds quasi-isometrically as a subgroup of a $2$-generated, simple, acyclic group. Our results also allow us to produce, for each $n\geqslant 2$, the first known example of an acyclic group that is of type $F_n$ but not $F_{n+1}$. These examples can moreover be taken to be simple. Furthermore, our examples provide a rich source of universally boundedly acyclic groups.</description>

      <title>Bounded weight functions on regular languages and groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a bounded weight function on a language, and show that the set of bounded weight functions on a regular language is a rational polyhedral cone. We study the cell recognised by a bounded weight function (that is, the set of elements of the language where the bound is attained), and show that if the language is regular then this cell is regular. The related notion of a weight function on a finitely generated group is introduced, and the case of Coxeter groups is studied in detail. Applications to the representation theory of weighted Hecke algebras are given.</description>

      <title>The Structure of Sequentially Complete Locally Minimal Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing results from \cite{DTk,DU} we study the fine structure of locally minimal (locally) precompact Abelian groups (these are the locally essential subgroups $G$ of LCA groups $L$, i.e., such that $G$ non-trivially meets all ``small" closed subgroup of $L$). More precisely we prove that if $G$ is a dense locally minimal and sequentially closed subgroup of a LCA group $L$, then the connected component $c(G)$ of $G$ has the same weight as $c(L)$. Moreover, when $w(c(G))$ is not Ulam measurable, then $c(G) = c(L)$. We provide an extended discussion illustrating how this result fails in various ways in the non-abelian case (even for nilpotent groups of class 2).
  Motivated by the above result, we study further those locally minimal precompact Abelian groups $G$, termed {\em critical locally minimal},such that $c(G) =c(K)$ (where $K$ is the compact completion of $G$) and $G/c(G)$ is not locally minimal. Such a group cannot be compact, neither connected, nor totally disconnected. We provide a proper class of critical locally minimal groups with additional compactness-like properties and we study the class $\CCC$ of compact Abelian groups with a dense critical locally minimal subgroup. In particular, we completely describe the connected components of the finite-dimensional groups belonging to $\CCC$.</description>

      <title>Derangements in affine classical groups and Cohen-Lenstra heuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observe that Anzanello's work on the proportion of derangements in affine classical groups over finite fields is related to symplectic and orthogonal Cohen-Lenstra type distributions on integer partitions. This leads to a proof of three q-polynomial identities conjectured by Anzanello, which were crucial for her work.</description>

      <title>On Salem numbers of degree 4 and arithmetic hyperbolic orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we construct an arithmetic hyperbolic $6-$orbifold $\mathcal{O}$ such that, any square-rootable Salem number of degree at most $4$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is realized as the exponential of the length of a closed geodesic in $\mathcal{O}$. We also prove that $n=6$ is the minimal dimension among arithmetic hyperbolic orbifolds of the first type where it can be obtained. In an appendix, we establish a general relation between the discriminant of a Salem number and the determinant of a quadratic space which realizes it. In particular, for any $m,d&gt;0$ we present a geometric proof of the existence of Salem numbers of degree $2m$ with discriminant $(-1)^{m+1}d$ in $\mathbb{Q}^{\times}/\mathbb{Q}^{\times 2}$.</description>

      <title>Interactions between Coarse Homotopy and Ends on Proper Geodesic Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the coarse-geometric notion of ends in the context of coarse homotopy. We show that, when recontextualized as a functor from an appropriate coarse category of proper geodesic spaces, the set of ends $\mathcal{E}\text{nds}(-)$ is a coarse homotopy invariant. Further, we prove the existence of a natural surjection from the coarse path component functor $\pi_0^{\text{Crs}}(-)$ to $\mathcal{E}\text{nds}(-)$, and show that in general, this is not an injection (even when restricted to locally finite planar graphs). Finally, we begin to consider when this injection indeed exists by showing that this is the case for locally finite geometric trees, providing a number of useful preliminary lemmas on the behaviour of geodesics in this context.</description>

      <title>The impact of Schur multipliers in harmonic analysis and operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schur multipliers are basic linear maps on matrix algebras. Their close albeit still intriguing connection with Fourier multipliers establishes a powerful bridge between harmonic analysis and operator algebras. In this paper, we survey their growing impact over the past 15 years. Particular attention will be drawn to recent bounds on Schatten $p$-classes, with far-reaching applications in harmonic analysis on group von Neumann algebras and operator rigidity phenomena for higher-rank Lie groups and lattices. Key novelties arise from new insights into nonToeplitz Schur multipliers and unprecedented connections with highly singular operators from Euclidean harmonic analysis.</description>

      <title>Permutation groups, partition lattices and block structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10461v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a transitive permutation group on $\Omega$. The $G$-invariant partitions form a sublattice of the lattice of all partitions of $\Omega$, having the further property that all its elements are uniform (that is, have all parts of the same size). If, in addition, all the equivalence relations defining the partitions commute, then the relations form an \emph{orthogonal block structure}, a concept from statistics; in this case the lattice is modular. If it is distributive, then we have a \emph{poset block structure}, whose automorphism group is a \emph{generalised wreath product}. We examine permutation groups with these properties, which we call the \emph{OB property} and \emph{PB property} respectively, and in particular investigate when direct and wreath products of groups with these properties also have these properties.
  A famous theorem on permutation groups asserts that a transitive imprimitive group $G$ is embeddable in the wreath product of two factors obtained from the group (the group induced on a block by its setwise stabiliser, and the group induced on the set of blocks by~$G$). We extend this theorem to groups with the PB property, embeddng them into generalised wreath products. We show that the map from posets to generalised wreath products preserves intersections and inclusions.
  We have included background and historical material on these concepts.</description>

      <title>On trace set of hyperbolic surfaces and a conjecture of Sarnak and Schmutz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the trace set of a Fuchsian lattice. There are two results of this paper: the first is that for a non-uniform lattice, we prove Scmutz's conjecture: the trace set of a Fuchsian lattice exhibits linear growth if and only if the lattice is arithmetic. Additionally, we show that for a fixed surface group of genus bigger than 2 and any positive number $\epsilon$, te set of cocompact lattice embedding such that their growth rate of trace set exceeds $n^{2-\epsilon}$ has positive Weil-Petersson volume. We also provide an asymptotic analysis of the volume of this set.</description>

Abstract: We prove that every finitely generated residually finite group $G$ can be embedded in a finitely generated branch group $\Gamma$ such that two elements in $G$ are conjugate in $G$ if and only if they are conjugate in $\Gamma$. As an application we construct a finitely generated branch group with solvable word problem and unsolvable conjugacy problem and thereby answer a question of Bartholdi, Grigorchuk, and \v{S}uni\'{k}.</description>
