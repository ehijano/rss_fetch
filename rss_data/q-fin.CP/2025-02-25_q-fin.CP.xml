      <title>Currency Arbitrage Optimization using Quantum Annealing, QAOA and Constraint Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currency arbitrage capitalizes on price discrepancies in currency exchange rates between markets to produce profits with minimal risk. By employing a combinatorial optimization problem, one can ascertain optimal paths within directed graphs, thereby facilitating the efficient identification of profitable trading routes. This research investigates the methodologies of quantum annealing and gate-based quantum computing in relation to the currency arbitrage problem. In this study, we implement the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) utilizing Qiskit version 1.2. In order to optimize the parameters of QAOA, we perform simulations utilizing the AerSimulator and carry out experiments in simulation. Furthermore, we present an NchooseK-based methodology utilizing D-Wave's Ocean suite. This methodology enables a comparison of the effectiveness of quantum techniques in identifying optimal arbitrage paths. The results of our study enhance the existing literature on the application of quantum computing in financial optimization challenges, emphasizing both the prospective benefits and the present limitations of these developing technologies in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Predicting Liquidity-Aware Bond Yields using Causal GANs and Deep Reinforcement Learning with LLM Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial bond yield forecasting is challenging due to data scarcity, nonlinear macroeconomic dependencies, and evolving market conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages Causal Generative Adversarial Networks (CausalGANs) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning (RL) to generate high-fidelity synthetic bond yield data for four major bond categories (AAA, BAA, US10Y, Junk). By incorporating 12 key macroeconomic variables, we ensure statistical fidelity by preserving essential market properties. To transform this market dependent synthetic data into actionable insights, we employ a finetuned Large Language Model (LLM) Qwen2.5-7B that generates trading signals (BUY/HOLD/SELL), risk assessments, and volatility projections. We use automated, human and LLM evaluations, all of which demonstrate that our framework improves forecasting performance over existing methods, with statistical validation via predictive accuracy, MAE evaluation(0.103%), profit/loss evaluation (60% profit rate), LLM evaluation (3.37/5) and expert assessments scoring 4.67 out of 5. The reinforcement learning-enhanced synthetic data generation achieves the least Mean Absolute Error of 0.103, demonstrating its effectiveness in replicating real-world bond market dynamics. We not only enhance data-driven trading strategies but also provides a scalable, high-fidelity synthetic financial data pipeline for risk &amp; volatility management and investment decision-making. This work establishes a bridge between synthetic data generation, LLM driven financial forecasting, and language model evaluation, contributing to AI-driven financial decision-making.</description>

      <title>Decoding Financial Health in Kenyas' Medical Insurance Sector: A Data-Driven Cluster Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines insurance companies' financial performance and reporting trends within the medical sector using advanced clustering techniques to identify distinct patterns. Four clusters were identified by analyzing financial ratios and time series data, each representing unique financial performance and reporting consistency combinations. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and KMeans clustering were employed to capture temporal variations and uncover key insights into company behaviors. The findings reveal that resilient performers consistently report and have financial stability, making them reliable options for policyholders. In contrast, clusters of underperforming companies and those with reporting gaps highlight operational challenges and issues related to data consistency. These insights emphasize the importance of transparency and timely reporting to ensure the sector's resilience. This study contributes to the literature by integrating time series analysis into financial clustering, offering practical recommendations for improving data governance and financial stability in the insurance sector. Future research could further investigate non-financial indicators and explore alternative clustering methods to provide a deeper understanding of performance dynamics.</description>

      <title>Event-Based Limit Order Book Simulation under a Neural Hawkes Process: Application in Market-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an event-driven Limit Order Book (LOB) model that captures twelve of the most observed LOB events in exchange-based financial markets. To model these events, we propose using the state-of-the-art Neural Hawkes process, a more robust alternative to traditional Hawkes process models. More specifically, this model captures the dynamic relationships between different event types, particularly their long- and short-term interactions, using a Long Short-Term Memory neural network. Using this framework, we construct a midprice process that captures the event-driven behavior of the LOB by simulating high-frequency dynamics like how they appear in real financial markets. The empirical results show that our model captures many of the broader characteristics of the price fluctuations, particularly in terms of their overall volatility. We apply this LOB simulation model within a Deep Reinforcement Learning Market-Making framework, where the trading agent can now complete trade order fills in a manner that closely resembles real-market trade execution. Here, we also compare the results of the simulated model with those from real data, highlighting how the overall performance and the distribution of trade order fills closely align with the same analysis on real data.</description>

      <title>Risk Measures for DC Pension Plan Decumulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the developed world replaces Defined Benefit (DB) pension plans with Defined Contribution (DC) plans, there is a need to develop decumulation strategies for DC plan holders. Optimal decumulation can be viewed as a problem in optimal stochastic control. Formulation as a control problem requires specification of an objective function, which in turn requires a definition of reward and risk. An intuitive specification of reward is the total withdrawals over the retirement period. Most retirees view risk as the possibility of running out of savings. This paper investigates several possible left tail risk measures, in conjunction with DC plan decumulation. The risk measures studied include (i) expected shortfall (ii) linear shortfall and (iii) probability of shortfall. We establish that, under certain assumptions, the set of optimal controls associated with all expected reward and expected shortfall Pareto efficient frontier curves is identical to the set of optimal controls for all expected reward and linear shortfall Pareto efficient frontier curves. Optimal efficient frontiers are determined computationally for each risk measure, based on a parametric market model. Robustness of these strategies is determined by testing the strategies out-of-sample using block bootstrapping of historical data.</description>

      <title>Pricing and calibration in the 4-factor path-dependent volatility model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the path-dependent volatility (PDV) model of Guyon and Lekeufack (2023), where the instantaneous volatility is a linear combination of a weighted sum of past returns and the square root of a weighted sum of past squared returns. We discuss the influence of an additional parameter that unlocks enough volatility on the upside to reproduce the implied volatility smiles of S\&amp;P 500 and VIX options. This PDV model, motivated by empirical studies, comes with computational challenges, especially in relation to VIX options pricing and calibration. We propose an accurate \emph{pathwise} neural network approximation of the VIX which leverages on the Markovianity of the 4-factor version of the model. The VIX is learned pathwise as a function of the Markovian factors and the model parameters. We use this approximation to tackle the joint calibration of S\&amp;P 500 and VIX options, quickly sample VIX paths, and price derivatives that jointly depend on S\&amp;P 500 and VIX. As an interesting aside, we also show that this \emph{time-homogeneous}, low-parametric, Markovian PDV model is able to fit the whole surface of S\&amp;P 500 implied volatilities remarkably well.</description>

      <title>Gaining efficiency in deep policy gradient method for continuous-time optimal control problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient implementation of deep policy gradient method (PGM) for optimal control problems in continuous time. The proposed method has the ability to manage the allocation of computational resources, number of trajectories, and complexity of architecture of the neural network. This is, in particular, important for continuous-time problems that require a fine time discretization. Each step of this method focuses on a different time scale and learns a policy, modeled by a neural network, for a discretized optimal control problem. The first step has the coarsest time discretization. As we proceed to other steps, the time discretization becomes finer. The optimal trained policy in each step is also used to provide data for the next step. We accompany the multi-scale deep PGM with a theoretical result on allocation of computational resources to obtain a targeted efficiency and test our methods on the linear-quadratic stochastic optimal control problem.</description>
