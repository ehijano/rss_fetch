      <title>A spring-block theory of feature learning in deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central question in deep learning is how deep neural networks (DNNs) learn features. DNN layers progressively collapse data into a regular low-dimensional geometry. This collective effect of non-linearity, noise, learning rate, width, depth, and numerous other parameters, has eluded first-principles theories which are built from microscopic neuronal dynamics. Here we present a noise-non-linearity phase diagram that highlights where shallow or deep layers learn features more effectively. We then propose a macroscopic mechanical theory of feature learning that accurately reproduces this phase diagram, offering a clear intuition for why and how some DNNs are ``lazy'' and some are ``active'', and relating the distribution of feature learning over layers with test accuracy.</description>

      <title>Griffiths singularity in quasi-one dimensional restricted $\pm J$ Ising spin glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the exact ground state energy of the quasi-one dimensional restricted $\pm J$ Ising spin glass in a uniform magnetic field using the transfer matrix method. Magnetic field dependence allows us to derive the magnetization as a function of concentration and magnetic field. It turns out that, in the limit of zero field, the magnetization tends to a nonzero value with a singular dependence on the magnetic field. We derive the explicit form of the singularity in thermodynamic quantities such as energy $E\simeq E_0+m_0 h + E_1e^{-h_0/h}$, which is an essential singularity known as Griffiths singularity. We confirm our analytical results using the numerical approach based on iterative equations for energy.</description>

      <title>Nearest-Neighbours Neural Network architecture for efficient sampling of statistical physics models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of sampling efficiently the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution of disordered systems is important both for the theoretical understanding of these models and for the solution of practical optimization problems. Unfortunately, this task is known to be hard, especially for spin glasses at low temperatures. Recently, many attempts have been made to tackle the problem by mixing classical Monte Carlo schemes with newly devised Neural Networks that learn to propose smart moves. In this article we introduce the Nearest-Neighbours Neural Network (4N) architecture, a physically-interpretable deep architecture whose number of parameters scales linearly with the size of the system and that can be applied to a large variety of topologies. We show that the 4N architecture can accurately learn the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution for the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model, and specifically for some of its most difficult instances. In particular, it captures properties such as the energy, the correlation function and the overlap probability distribution. Finally, we show that the 4N performance increases with the number of layers, in a way that clearly connects to the correlation length of the system, thus providing a simple and interpretable criterion to choose the optimal depth.</description>

      <title>Protecting Quantum Information via Many-Body Dynamical Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamically localized states in quantum many-body systems are fundamentally important in understanding quantum thermalization and have applications in quantum information processing. Here we explore many-body dynamical localization (MBDL) without disorders in a non-integrable quantum XY spin chain under periodical and quadratic kicks. We obtain the localization phase diagram with the MBDL and delocalization states and show dynamical observables to extract the phase diagram. For proper kick strengths in the MBDL regime, we reveal a local dynamical decoupling effect for persistent Rabi oscillation of certain spins. Furthermore, we propose the MBDL-protected quantum information at high temperatures, and present an analysis of the dynamical decoupling to obtain the required system parameters for quantum storage. Compared to other non-thermalized states, the disorder-free MBDL states require much fewer repetitions and resources, providing a promising way to protect and store quantum information robust against thermal noises.</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek behavior in a topological phase transition with a quadratic band crossing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism describes the scaling behavior when driving a system across a continuous symmetry-breaking transition. Previous studies have shown that the KZ-like scaling behavior also lies in the topological transitions in the Qi-Wu-Zhang model (2D) and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model (1D), although symmetry breaking does not exist here. Both models with linear band crossings give that $\nu=1$ and $z=1$. We wonder whether different critical exponents can be acquired in topological transitions beyond linear band crossing. In this work, we look into the KZ behavior in a topological 2D checkerboard lattice with a quadratic band crossing. We investigate from dual perspectives: momentum distribution of the Berry curvature in clean systems for simplicity, and real-space analysis of domain-like local Chern marker configurations in disordered systems, which is a more intuitive analog to conventional KZ description. In equilibrium, we find the correlation length diverges with a power $\nu\simeq 1/2$. Then, by slowly quenching the system across the topological phase transition, we find that the freeze-out time $t_\mathrm{f}$ and the unfrozen length scale $\xi(t_\mathrm{f})$ both satisfy the KZ scaling, verifying $z\simeq 2$. We subsequently explore KZ behavior in topological phase transitions with other higher-order band crossing and find the relationship between the critical exponents and the order. Our results extend the understanding of the KZ mechanism and non-equilibrium topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Viscous liquid dynamics modeled as random walks within overlapping hyperspheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hypersphere model is a simple one-parameter model of the potential energy landscape of viscous liquids, which consists of a percolating system of hyperspheres of equal sizes randomly distributed in $R^{3N}$ where $N$ is the number of particles. We study random walks within overlapping hyperspheres in 12 to 45 dimensions, utilizing an algorithm for on-the-fly placement of the hyperspheres in conjunction with the kinetic Monte Carlo method. We find behavior typical of viscous liquids; thus decreasing the hypersphere density (corresponding to decreasing the temperature) leads to a slowing down of the dynamics by many orders of magnitude. The shape of the mean-square displacement as a function of time is found to be very similar to that of the Kob-Andersen binary Lennard-Jones mixture and the Random Barrier Model, which predicts well the frequency-dependent fluidity of nine glass-forming liquids of different chemistry [Bierwirth et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 248001 (2017)].</description>

Abstract: The nonanalyticity of the Loschmidt echo at critical times in quantum quenched systems is termed as the dynamical quantum phase transition, extending the notion of quantum criticality to a nonequilibrium scenario. In this paper, we establish a new paradigm of dynamical phase transitions driven by a sudden change in the internal spatial correlations of the disorder potential in a low-dimensional disordered system. The quench dynamics between prequenched pure and postquenched random system Hamiltonian reveals an anomalous quantum dynamical quantum phase transition triggered by an infinite disorder correlation in the modulation potential. The physical origin of the anomalous phenomenon is associated with the overlap between the two distinctly different extended states. Furthermore, we explore the quench dynamics between the prequenched random and postquenched pure system Hamiltonian. Interestingly, the quenched system undergoes dynamical quantum phase transitions for the prequench white-noise potential in the thermodynamic limit. In addition, the quench dynamics also shows a clear signature of the delocalization phase transition in the correlated Anderson model.</description>

Abstract: Although higher-order interactions are known to affect the typical state of dynamical processes giving rise to new collective behavior, how they drive the emergence of rare events and fluctuations is still an open problem. We investigate how fluctuations of a dynamical quantity of a random walk exploring a higher-order network arise over time. \newtext{In the quenched case, where the hypergraph structure is fixed, through large deviation theory we show that the appearance of rare events is hampered in nodes with many higher-order interactions, and promoted elsewhere. Dynamical fluctuations are further boosted in an annealed scenario, where both the diffusion process and higher-order interactions evolve in time. Here, extreme fluctuations generated by optimal higher-order configurations can be predicted in the limit of a saddle-point approximation.} Our study lays the groundwork for a wide and general theory of fluctuations and rare events in higher-order networks.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of symmetry-protected long-range entanglement in stochastic quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-range entangled states are vital for quantum information processing and quantum metrology. Preparing such states by combining measurements with unitary gates opened new possibilities for efficient protocols with finite-depth quantum circuits. The complexity of these algorithms is crucial for the resource requirements on a large-scale noisy quantum device, while their stability to perturbations decides the fate of their implementation. In this work, we consider stochastic quantum circuits in one and two dimensions comprising randomly applied unitary gates and local measurements. These operations preserve a class of discrete local symmetries, which are broken due to the stochasticity arising from timing and gate imperfections. In the absence of randomness, the protocol generates a symmetry-protected long-range entangled state in a finite-depth circuit. In the general case, by studying the time evolution under this hybrid circuit, we analyze the time to reach the target entangled state. We find two important time scales that we associate with the emergence of certain symmetry generators. The quantum trajectories embody the local symmetry with a time scaling logarithmically with system size, while global symmetries require exponentially long times. We devise error-mitigation protocols that significantly lower both time scales and investigate the stability of the algorithm to perturbations that naturally arise in experiments. We also generalize the protocol to realize toric code and Xu-Moore states in two dimensions, opening avenues for future studies of anyonic excitations. Our results unveil a fundamental relationship between symmetries and dynamics across a range of lattice geometries, which contributes to a broad understanding of the stability of preparation algorithms in terms of phase transitions. Our work paves the way for efficient error correction for quantum state preparation.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws Do Not Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has advocated for training AI models on ever-larger datasets, arguing that as the size of a dataset increases, the performance of a model trained on that dataset will correspondingly increase (referred to as "scaling laws"). In this paper, we draw on literature from the social sciences and machine learning to critically interrogate these claims. We argue that this scaling law relationship depends on metrics used to measure performance that may not correspond with how different groups of people perceive the quality of models' output. As the size of datasets used to train large AI models grows and AI systems impact ever larger groups of people, the number of distinct communities represented in training or evaluation datasets grows. It is thus even more likely that communities represented in datasets may have values or preferences not reflected in (or at odds with) the metrics used to evaluate model performance in scaling laws. Different communities may also have values in tension with each other, leading to difficult, potentially irreconcilable choices about metrics used for model evaluations -- threatening the validity of claims that model performance is improving at scale. We end the paper with implications for AI development: that the motivation for scraping ever-larger datasets may be based on fundamentally flawed assumptions about model performance. That is, models may not, in fact, continue to improve as the datasets get larger -- at least not for all people or communities impacted by those models. We suggest opportunities for the field to rethink norms and values in AI development, resisting claims for universality of large models, fostering more local, small-scale designs, and other ways to resist the impetus towards scale in AI.</description>

      <title>Weight fluctuations in (deep) linear neural networks and a derivation of the inverse-variance flatness relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14120v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stationary (late-time) training regime of single- and two-layer underparameterized linear neural networks within the continuum limit of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for synthetic Gaussian data. In the case of a single-layer network in the weakly underparameterized regime, the spectrum of the noise covariance matrix deviates notably from the Hessian, which can be attributed to the broken detailed balance of SGD dynamics. The weight fluctuations are in this case generally anisotropic, but effectively experience an isotropic loss. For an underparameterized two-layer network, we describe the stochastic dynamics of the weights in each layer and analyze the associated stationary covariances. We identify the inter-layer coupling as a distinct source of anisotropy for the weight fluctuations. In contrast to the single-layer case, the weight fluctuations are effectively subject to an anisotropic loss, the flatness of which is inversely related to the fluctuation variance. We thereby provide an analytical derivation of the recently observed inverse variance-flatness relation in a model of a deep linear neural network.</description>

      <title>Bosonic near-CFT$_1$ models from Fock-space fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13131v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of near-CFT$_1$ models with a conserved U(1) charge, whose basic degrees of freedom are canonical bosons. The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model -- the first microscopic model that realizes the near-CFT$_1$ dynamics -- is based on random $p$-local interactions among fermions. However, a bosonic near-CFT$_1$ model has remained elusive in the $p$-local approach because such constructions generally suffer from unwanted orderings at low temperatures. Our construction is based on a recent insight that near-CFT$_1$ dynamics can quite generally arise if we place a large amount of random fluxes in a many-body Fock space and $p$-locality is not essential. All such models are essentially solved by chord diagrams regardless of the nature of the underlying degrees of freedom. We further argue that such bosonic models do not suffer from energetic instablities or unwanted low-temperature orderings. For comparison we also consider a second class of charge-conserving models which are based on qubits. The thermodynamic scalings of these models are very similar to those of the double-scaled complex SYK model but are free of certain singularities the latter suffers from. We also show the level statistics of both models are described by random matrix theory universality down to very low energies.</description>

      <title>Two liquid states of distinguishable helium-4: the existence of another non-superfluid frozen by heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07716v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there can exist two liquid states in distinguishable helium-4 ($^4$He) obeying Boltzmann statistics by path integral centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) simulations. This is an indication of quantum liquid polyamorphism induced by nuclear quantum effect. For 0.08-3.3 K and 1-500 bar, we extensively conducted the isothermal-isobaric CMD simulations to explore not only possible states and state diagram but the state characteristics. The distinguishable $^4$He below 25 bar does not freeze down to 0.1 K even though it includes no Bosonic exchange effect and therefore no Bose condensation. One liquid state, low quantum-dispersion liquid (LQDL), is nearly identical to normal liquid He-I of real $^4$He. The other is high quantum-dispersion liquid (HQDL) consisting of atoms with longer quantum wavelength. This is another non-superfluid existing below 0.5 K or the temperatures of LQDL. The HQDL is also a low-entropy and fragile liquid to exhibit, unlike conventional liquids, rather gas-like relaxation of velocity autocorrelation function, while there the atoms diffuse without noticeable contribution from quantum tunneling. The LQDL-HQDL transition is not a thermodynamic phase transition but a continuous crossover accompanied by the change of the expansion factor of quantum wavelength. Freezing of HQDL into the low quantum-dispersion amorphous solid occurs by heating from 0.2 to 0.3 K at 40-50 bar, while this $P$-$T$ condition coincides with the Kim-Chan normal-supersolid phase boundary of real $^4$He. The obtained state diagram was compared with that of the confined subnano-scale $^4$He systems where Bosonic correlation is considerably suppressed.</description>

      <title>Random close packing of binary hard spheres favors the stability of neutron-rich atomic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In spite of the success of the Bethe-Weizs\"acker mass formula in its modern numerical and predictive implementations, the common-knowledge principle that it is electrostatics which, ultimately, favors neutron-rich nuclei still presents unclear aspects. For example, while it is true that the Coulomb interaction promotes the tendency towards neutron-rich nuclei, the opposite effects of Majorana exchange forces and Pauli exclusion are known to counteract this tendency. We show that a recent analytical progress in the mathematical description of random close packing of spheres with different sizes provides a missing contribution to the theoretical description of the $Z$ versus $N$ slope in the nuclides chart. In particular, the theory predicts, on purely geometric grounds, that the most stable nuclei are those with ratio $Z/N \approx 0.75$. This new "geometric" random-packing contribution to the semi-empirical mass formula may be the missing aspect of nuclear structure that tilts the balance towards neutron-rich nuclei in the Segr\`e stability chart.</description>

Abstract: We consider short-range classical spin glasses, or other disordered systems, consisting of Ising spins. For a low-temperature Gibbs state in infinite size in such a system, for given random bonds, it is controversial whether its decomposition into pure states will be trivial or non-trivial. We undertake a general study of the overall structure of this problem, based on metastates, which are essential to prove the existence of a thermodynamic limit. A metastate is a probability distribution on Gibbs states, for given disorder, that satisfies certain covariance properties. First, we prove that any metastate can be decomposed as a mixture of indecomposable metastates, and that all Gibbs states drawn from an indecomposable metastate are alike macroscopically. Next, we consider stochastic stability of a metastate under random perturbations of the disorder, and prove that any metastate is stochastically stable. Using related methods and older results, we prove that if the pure-state decomposition of any Gibbs states drawn from an indecomposable metastate is countably infinite, then the weights in the decomposition follow a Poisson-Dirichlet distribution with a fixed value of the single parameter describing such distributions, and also that if the overlap takes a finite number of values, then the pure states are organized as an ultrametric space, as in $k$-RSB. Dynamically-frozen states play a role in the analysis of Gibbs states drawn from a metastate, either as states or as parts of states. Using a mapping into real Hilbert space, we prove further results about Gibbs states, and classify them into six types. Metastate-average states are studied, and can be related to states arising dynamically at long times after a quench from high temperature, under some conditions.</description>
