      <title>On the $m$th-order Affine P\'olya-Szeg\"o Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An affine P\'olya-Szeg\"o principle for a family of affine energies, with equality condition characterization, is demonstrated. In particular, this recovers, as special cases, the $L^p$ affine P\'olya-Szeg\"o principles due to Cianchi, Lutwak, Yang and Zhang, and subsequently Haberl, Schuster and Xiao. Various applications of this new P\'olya-Szeg\"o principle are shown.</description>

      <title>Generalized Euclidean operator radius inequalities of a pair of bounded linear operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ \mathbb{B}(\mathscr{H})$ represent the $C^*$-algebra, which consists of all bounded linear operators on $\mathscr{H},$ and let $N ( .) $ be a norm on $ \mathbb{B}(\mathscr{H})$. We define a norm $w_{(N,e)} (. , . )$ on $ \mathbb{B}^2(\mathscr{H})$ by $$ w_{(N,e)}(B,C)=\underset{|\lambda_1|^2+\lambda_2|^2\leq1}\sup \underset{\theta\in\mathbb{R}}\sup N\left(\Re \left(e^{i\theta}(\lambda_1B+\lambda_2C)\right)\right),$$ for every $B,C\in\mathbb{B}(\mathscr{H})$ and $\lambda_1,\lambda_2\in\mathbb{C}.$ We investigate basic properties of this norm and prove some bounds involving it. In particular, when $N( .)$ is the Hilbert-Schmidt norm, we prove some Hilbert-Schmidt Euclidean operator radius inequalities for a pair of bounded linear operators.</description>

      <title>Paired kernels and truncated Toeplitz operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers paired operators in the context of the Lebesgue Hilbert space $L^2$ on the unit circle and its subspace, the Hardy space $H^2$. The kernels of such operators, together with their analytic projections, which are generalizations of Toeplitz kernels, are studied. Inclusion relations between such kernels are considered in detail, and the results are applied to describing the kernels of finite-rank asymmetric truncated Toeplitz operators.</description>

      <title>A sparse resolution of the DiPerna-Majda gap problem for $2$D Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central question which originates in the celebrated work in the 1980's of DiPerna and Majda asks what is the optimal decay $f &gt; 0$ such that uniform rates $|\omega|(Q) \leq f(|Q|)$ of the vorticity maximal functions guarantee strong convergence without concentrations of approximate solutions to energy-conserving weak solutions of the $2$D Euler equations with vortex sheet initial data. A famous result of Majda (1993) shows $f(r) = [\log (1/r)]^{-1/2}$, $r&lt;1/2$, as the optimal decay for \emph{distinguished} sign vortex sheets. In the general setting of \emph{mixed} sign vortex sheets, DiPerna and Majda (1987) established $f(r) = [\log (1/r)]^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha &gt; 1$ as a sufficient condition for the lack of concentrations, while the expected gap $\alpha \in (1/2, 1]$ remains as an open question. In this paper we resolve the DiPerna-Majda $2$D gap problem: In striking contrast to the well-known case of distinguished sign vortex sheets, we identify $f(r) = [\log (1/r)]^{-1}$ as the optimal regularity for mixed sign vortex sheets that rules out concentrations.
  For the proof, we propose a novel method to construct explicitly solutions with mixed sign to the $2$D Euler equations in such a way that wild behaviour creates within the relevant geometry of \emph{sparse} cubes (i.e., these cubes are not necessarily pairwise disjoint, but their possible overlappings can be controlled in a sharp fashion). Such a strategy is inspired by the recent work of the first author and Milman \cite{DM} where strong connections between energy conservation and sparseness are established.</description>

      <title>Measures of noncompactness in Hilbert $C^*$-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a countably generated Hilbert $C^*$-module $\mathcal M$ over a $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal A$. There is a measure of noncompactness $\lambda$ defined, roughly as the distance from finitely generated projective submodules, which is independent of any topology. We compare $\lambda$ to the Hausdorff measure of noncompactness with respect to the family of seminorms that induce a topology recently iontroduced by Troitsky, denoted by $\chi^*$. We obtain $\lambda\equiv\chi^*$. Related inequalities involving other known measures of noncompactness, e.g. Kuratowski and Istr\u{a}\c{t}escu are laso obtained as well as some related results on adjontable operators.</description>

      <title>Pointwise and uniform bounds for functions of the Laplacian on non-compact symmetric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $L$ be the distinguished Laplacian on the Iwasawa $AN$ group associated with a semisimple Lie group $G$. Assume $F$ is a Borel function on $\mathbb{R}^+$. We give a condition on $F$ such that the kernels of the functions $F(L)$ are uniformly bounded. This condition involves the decay of $F$ only and not its derivatives. By a known correspondence, this implies pointwise estimates for a wide range of functions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on symmetric spaces. In particular, when $G$ is of real rank one and $F(x)={\rm e}^{it\sqrt x}\psi(\sqrt x)$, our bounds are sharp.</description>

      <title>A generalization of K-theory to operator systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of K-theory to operator systems. Motivated by spectral truncations of noncommutative spaces described by $C^*$-algebras and inspired by the realization of the K-theory of a $C^*$-algebra as the Witt group of hermitian forms, we introduce new operator system invariants indexed by the corresponding matrix size. A direct system is constructed whose direct limit possesses a semigroup structure, and we define the $K_0$-group as the corresponding Grothendieck group. This is an invariant of unital operator systems, and, more generally, an invariant up to Morita equivalence of operator systems. For $C^*$-algebras it reduces to the usual definition. We illustrate our invariant by means of the spectral localizer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00403v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that the groups of finite energy (that is, Sobolev class $H^1$) paths and loops with values in a compact Lie group are amenable in the sense of Pierre de la Harpe, that is, every continuous action of such a group on a compact space admits an invariant regular Borel probability measure. To our knowledge, the strongest previously known result concerned the amenability of groups of continuous paths and loops (Malliavin and Malliavin 1992).</description>

      <title>On the boundedness and Schatten class property of noncommutative martingale paraproducts and operator-valued commutators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Schatten class membership of semicommutative martingale paraproducts and use the transference method to describe Schatten class membership of purely noncommutative martingale paraproducts, especially for CAR algebras and $\mathop{\otimes}\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}\mathbb{M}_{d}$ in terms of martingale Besov spaces.
  Using Hyt\"{o}nen's dyadic martingale technique, we also obtain sufficient conditions on the Schatten class membership and the boundedness of operator-valued commutators involving general singular integral operators.
  We establish the complex median method, which is applicable to complex-valued functions. We apply it to get the optimal necessary conditions on the Schatten class membership of operator-valued commutators associated with non-degenerate kernels in Hyt\"{o}nen's sense. This resolves the problem on the characterization of Schatten class membership of operator-valued commutators. Our results are new even in the scalar case.
  Our new approach is built on Hyt\"{o}nen's dyadic martingale technique and the complex median method. Compared with all the previous ones, this new one is more powerful in several aspects: $(a)$ it permits us to deal with more general singular integral operators with little smoothness; $(b)$ it allows us to deal with commutators with complex-valued kernels; $(c)$ it goes much further beyond the scalar case and can be applied to the semicommutative setting.
  By a weak-factorization type decomposition, we get some necessary but not optimal conditions on the boundedness of operator-valued commutators. In addition, we give a new proof of the boundedness of commutators still involving general singular integral operators concerning $BMO$ spaces in the commutative setting.</description>

      <title>Examples of compact quantum groups with $\operatorname{\mathsf{L}^{\!\infty}}(\mathbb{G})$ a factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.10976v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For each $\lambda\in\left]0,1\right]$ we exhibit an uncountable family of compact quantum groups $\mathbb{G}$ such that the von Neumann algebra $\mathsf{L}^{\!\infty}(\mathbb{G})$ is the injective factor of type $\mathrm{III}_\lambda$ with separable predual. We also show that uncountably many injective factors of type $\mathrm{III}_0$ arise as $\mathsf{L}^{\!\infty}(\mathbb{G})$ for some compact quantum group $\mathbb{G}$. To distinguish between our examples we introduce invariants related to the scaling group modeled on the Connes invariant $T$ for von Neumann algebras and investigate the connection between so obtained invariants of $\mathbb{G}$ and the Connes invariants $T(\mathsf{L}^{\!\infty}(\mathbb{G}))$, $S(\mathsf{L}^{\!\infty}(\mathbb{G}))$. In the final section we show that factors of type $\mathrm{I}$ cannot be obtained as $\mathsf{L}^{\!\infty}(\mathbb{G})$ for a non-trivial compact quantum group $\mathbb{G}$.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Lp Isoperimetric and Sobolev Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17468v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schneider introduced an inter-dimensional difference body operator on convex bodies and proved an associated inequality. In the prequel to this work, we showed that this concept can be extended to a rich class of operators from convex geometry and proved the associated isoperimetric inequalities. The role of cosine-like operators, which generate convex bodies in $\mathbb R^n$ from those in $\mathbb R^n$, were replaced by inter-dimensional simplicial operators, which generate convex bodies in $\mathbb R^{nm}$ from those in $\mathbb R^{n}$ (or vice versa). In this work, we treat the $L^p$ extensions of these operators, and, furthermore, extend the role of the simplex to arbitrary $m$-dimensional convex bodies containing the origin. We establish $m$th-order $L^p$ isoperimetric inequalities, including the $m$th-order versions of the $L^p$ Petty projection inequality, $L^p$ Busemann-Petty centroid inequality, $L^p$ Santal\'o inequalities, and $L^p$ affine Sobolev inequalities. As an application, we obtain isoperimetric inequalities for the volume of the operator norm of linear functionals $(\mathbb R^n, \|\cdot\|_E) \to (\mathbb R^m, \|\cdot\|_F)$.</description>

      <title>On certain classes of mild solutions of the scalar Li\'enard equation revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we revisit the existence, uniqueness and exponential decay of some classes of mild solutions which are almost periodic (AP-), asymptotically almost periodic (AAP-) and pseudo almost periodic (PAP-) of the scalar Lin\'eard equation by employing the notion of Green function and Massera-type principle. First, by changing variable we convert this equation to a system of first order differential equations. Then, we transform the problem into a framework of an abstract parabolic evolution equation which associates with an evolution family equipped an exponential dichtonomy and the corresponding Green function is exponentially almost periodic. After that, we prove a Massera-type principle that the corresponding linear equation has a uniqueness AP-, AAP- and PAP- mild solution if the right hand side and the coefficient functions are AP-, AAP- and PAP- functions, respectively. The well-posedness of semilinear equation is proved by using fixed point arguments and the exponential decay of mild solutions are obtained by using Gronwall's inequality. Although our work revisits some previous works on well-posedness of the Lin\'eard equation on these type solutions but provide a difference view by using Green function and go farther on the aspects of asymptotic behaviour of solutions and the construction of abstract theory. Our abstract results can be also applied to other parabolic evolution equations.</description>
