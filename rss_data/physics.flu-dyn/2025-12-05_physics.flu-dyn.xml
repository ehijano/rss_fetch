      <title>Effective permeabilities for flow through anisotropic microscopic geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops a computational and theoretical framework for determining effective permeabilities in anisotropic microscopic geometries containing dense, fibre-like obstacles, motivated by the need to model flow in coiled aneurysm domains accurately. Building on homogenisation theory and fully resolved simulations in Representative Elementary Volumes (REVs), we validate the permeability model introduced in [C. Boutin, Study of permeability by periodic and self-consistent homogenisation. Eur. J. Mech. A Solids, 19(4):603-632, 2000] and propose a systematic methodology for capturing the directional variations induced by fibre orientation. The resulting permeability tensors are incorporated into macroscopic flow simulations based on the Darcy equation, enabling direct comparison of anisotropic and isotropic permeability models across several benchmark configurations. Our findings show that anisotropy has a significant impact on local flow direction and magnitude, generating directional permeability contrasts which cannot be reproduced by classical isotropic approximations. By integrating coil-induced microstructural effects into continuum-scale hemodynamic models, the proposed approach enables more realistic assessment of post-treatment aneurysm flow behaviour. Beyond this clinical application, the framework is broadly applicable to other biomedical and engineering systems involving fibrous or filamentous porous microstructures.</description>

      <title>Interactions Between Internal Solitary Waves and Floating Canopies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions between internal solitary waves and floating canopies of varying length and porosity are examined via laboratory experiments and complementary simulations for a miscible, two-layer system. In both approaches, internal solitary waves of varying amplitudes are generated by a jet-array mechanism that is driven by the nonlinear eKdV solution. Pycnocline displacements, phase speeds, and velocity fields are obtained using synchronized planar laser-induced fluorescence and particle imaging velocimetry systems in the experiment. In the simulations, the canopy is represented as a porous zone with prescribed porosity and hydraulic conductivity determined by the Kozeny-Carman model, which is validated by comparing simulated and measured horizontal velocity profiles. The higher-porosity (transitional) canopy produces a nearly monotonic, albeit minor, amplitude reduction and negligible wave energy dissipation after the interaction. However, the shear layer developed at the bottom edge of the lower-porosity (dense) canopy grows to a comparable strength as the shear sustained by the internal solitary wave profile at the pycnocline. The vortex pair generated by this shear accelerates the upper-layer fluid beneath the canopy, leading to complex nonlinear amplitude modulation and significant wave transformation. With an extended canopy length, the internal solitary waves settle to a quasi-steady state with a significant phase speed reduction. Upon the wave exiting the canopy, flow separation at the downstream edge of the canopy again pairs with the shear at the pycnocline, inducing an intensified jet. This complex interaction leads to energy transfer between kinetic and potential energy under the dense canopy.</description>

      <title>Predicting Time-Dependent Flow Over Complex Geometries Using Operator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast, geometry-generalizing surrogates for unsteady flow remain challenging. We present a time-dependent, geometry-aware Deep Operator Network that predicts velocity fields for moderate-Re flows around parametric and non-parametric shapes. The model encodes geometry via a signed distance field (SDF) trunk and flow history via a CNN branch, trained on 841 high-fidelity simulations. On held-out shapes, it attains $\sim 5\%$ relative L2 single-step error and up to 1000X speedups over CFD. We provide physics-centric rollout diagnostics, including phase error at probes and divergence norms, to quantify long-horizon fidelity. These reveal accurate near-term transients but error accumulation in fine-scale wakes, most pronounced for sharp-cornered geometries. We analyze failure modes and outline practical mitigations. Code, splits, and scripts are openly released at: https://github.com/baskargroup/TimeDependent-DeepONet to support reproducibility and benchmarking.</description>

      <title>Secondary flows drive triboelectric powder charging in pneumatic conveying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly resolved simulations reveal the fundamental influence of a carrier fluid's flow dynamics on triboelectric powder charging. We found that particles transported through a square-shaped duct charge faster than in a channel flow caused by secondary flows that led to more severe particle-wall collisions. Specifically, particles with a Stokes number of 4.69 achieve 85 % of their equilibrium charge approximately 1.5 times faster in duct flow than in channel flow. Also, charge distribution is more uniform in a duct cross-section compared with a channel cross-section. In channel flow, particles are trapped near the walls and collide frequently due to limited movement in the wall-normal direction, causing localized charge buildup. In contrast, duct flow promotes better mixing through secondary flows, reducing repeating collisions and providing uniform charge distribution across the cross-section. Upon charging, electrostatic forces significantly reshape particle behaviour and distribution. Once the powder achieves half of its equilibrium charge, particles increasingly accumulate at the wall, leading to a reduced concentration in the central region. These changes in particle distribution have a noticeable impact on the surrounding fluid phase and alter the overall flow dynamics. These findings open the possibility for a new measure to control powder charging by imposing a specific pattern.</description>

      <title>Can Explicit Subgrid Models Enhance Implicit LES Simulations? A GPU-Oriented High-Order-Solver Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods offer excellent accuracy for turbulent flow simulations, especially when implemented on GPU-oriented architectures that favor very high polynomial orders. On modern GPUs, high-order polynomial evaluations cost roughly the same as low-order ones, provided the DG degrees of freedom fit within device memory. However, even with high-order discretizations, simulations at high Reynolds numbers still require some level of under-resolution, leaving them sensitive to numerical dissipation and aliasing effects. Here, we investigate the interplay between intrinsic DG dissipation mechanisms (implicit dissipation) -- in particular split forms and Riemann solvers -- and explicit subgrid-scale models in Large Eddy Simulations (LES). Using the three-dimensional Taylor--Green vortex at $Re = 1600$ and an inviscid case ($Re \to \infty$), we evaluate kinetic energy dissipation, spectral accuracy, and numerical stability.
  Our results show that when stability for under-resolved turbulence is ensured through split-forms (energy- or entropy-stable) schemes, subgrid-scale (SGS) LES models are not strictly necessary. At moderate Reynolds numbers, when the spatial resolution is sufficient to capture the relevant turbulence scales (i.e., in well-resolved LES), adding SGS models does not improve accuracy because the wavenumber range where they act overlaps with the inherent numerical dissipation of the DG scheme. In contrast, when the resolution is insufficient, as is typical at high Reynolds numbers, explicit subgrid-scale models complement the numerical dissipation and enhance accuracy by removing the excess energy that numerical fluxes alone cannot dissipate.
  These findings provide practical guidance for choosing numerical strategies in high-order turbulence simulations.</description>

      <title>Drift towards isotropization during the 3D hydrodynamic turbulence onset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The incompressible three-dimensional Euler equations develop very thin pancake-like regions of exponentially increasing vorticity. The characteristic thickness of such regions decreases exponentially with time, while the other two dimensions do not change considerably, making the flow near each pancake strongly anisotropic. The pancakes emerge in increasing number with time, which may enhance the anisotropy of the flow, especially if they orient similarly in space. In the present paper, we study numerically the local isotropy of the flow by analyzing the evolution of the so-called isotropy markers [Phys. Rev. Fluids 10, L022602 (2025)]. We show that these functions drift slowly towards unity, indicating the process of slow isotropization, which takes place without the viscous scales getting exited and despite the similar orientation of the emerging pancakes.</description>

      <title>Flux-controlled wall model for large eddy simulation integrating the compressible law of the wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in velocity and temperature transformations have enabled recovery of the law of the wall in compressible wall-bounded turbulent flows. Building on this foundation, a flux-controlled wall model (FCWM) for Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is proposed. Unlike conventional wall-stress models that solve the turbulent boundary layer equations, FCWM formulates the near-wall modeling as a control problem applied directly to the outer LES solution. It consists of three components: (1) the compressible law of the wall, (2) a feedback flux-control strategy, and (3) a shifted boundary condition. The model adjusts the wall shear stress and heat flux based on discrepancies between the computed and target transformed velocity and temperature, respectively, at the matching location. The proposed wall model is evaluated using LES of turbulent channel flows across a broad range of conditions, including quasi-incompressible cases with bulk Mach number \(M_b = 0.1\) and friction Reynolds number \(Re_\tau = 180 \sim 10{,}000\), and compressible cases with \(M_b = 0.74 \sim 4.0\) and bulk Reynolds number \(Re_b = 7667 \sim 34{,}000\). The wall-modelled LES reproduce mean velocity and temperature profiles in agreement with direct numerical simulation data. For all tested cases with \(M_b \leq 3\), the wall model achieves relative errors of \(|\epsilon_{C_f}| &lt; 4.1\%\), \(|\epsilon_{B_q}| &lt; 2.7\%\), and \(|\epsilon_{T_c}| &lt; 2.7\%\) in friction coefficient, non-dimensional heat flux, and centerline temperature, respectively. In the quasi-incompressible regime, the wall model achieves \(|\epsilon_{C_f}| &lt; 1\%\). Compared to the conventional equilibrium wall model, the proposed FCWM achieves higher accuracy in compressible turbulent channel flows without solving the boundary layer equations, thereby reducing computational cost.</description>

      <title>Towards an AI Fluid Scientist: LLM-Powered Scientific Discovery in Experimental Fluid Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence into experimental fluid mechanics promises to accelerate discovery, yet most AI applications remain narrowly focused on numerical studies. This work proposes an AI Fluid Scientist framework that autonomously executes the complete experimental workflow: hypothesis generation, experimental design, robotic execution, data analysis, and manuscript preparation. We validate this through investigation of vortex-induced vibration (VIV) and wake-induced vibration (WIV) in tandem cylinders. Our work has four key contributions: (1) A computer-controlled circulating water tunnel (CWT) with programmatic control of flow velocity, cylinder position, and forcing parameters (vibration frequency and amplitude) with data acquisition (displacement, force, and torque). (2) Automated experiments reproduce literature benchmarks (Khalak and Williamson [1999] and Assi et al. [2013, 2010]) with frequency lock-in within 4% and matching critical spacing trends. (3) The framework with Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) discovers more WIV amplitude response phenomena, and uses a neural network to fit physical laws from data, which is 31% higher than that of polynomial fitting. (4) The framework with multi-agent with virtual-real interaction system executes hundreds of experiments end-to-end, which automatically completes the entire process of scientific research from hypothesis generation, experimental design, experimental execution, data analysis, and manuscript preparation. It greatly liberates human researchers and improves study efficiency, providing new paradigm for the development and research of experimental fluid mechanics.</description>

      <title>NORi: An ML-Augmented Ocean Boundary Layer Parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NORi is a machine-learned (ML) parameterization of ocean boundary layer turbulence that is physics-based and augmented with neural networks. NORi stands for neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) Richardson number (Ri) closure. The physical parameterization is controlled by a Richardson number-dependent diffusivity and viscosity. The NODEs are trained to capture the entrainment through the base of the boundary layer, which cannot be represented with a local diffusive closure. The parameterization is trained using large-eddy simulations in an "a posteriori" fashion, where parameters are calibrated with a loss function that explicitly depends on the actual time-integrated variables of interest rather than the instantaneous subgrid fluxes, which are inherently noisy. NORi is designed for the realistic nonlinear equation of state of seawater and demonstrates excellent prediction and generalization capabilities in capturing entrainment dynamics under different convective strengths, oceanic background stratifications, rotation strengths, and surface wind forcings. NORi is numerically stable for at least 100 years of integration time in large-scale simulations, despite only being trained on 2-day horizons, and can be run with time steps as long as one hour. The highly expressive neural networks, combined with a physically-rigorous base closure, prove to be a robust paradigm for designing parameterizations for climate models where data requirements are drastically reduced, inference performance can be directly targeted and optimized, and numerical stability is implicitly encouraged during training.</description>

      <title>Stable self-adaptive timestepping for Reduced Order Models for incompressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces RedEigCD, the first self-adaptive timestepping technique specifically tailored for reduced-order models (ROMs) of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Building upon linear stability concepts, the method adapts the timestep by directly bounding the stability function of the employed time integration scheme using exact spectral information of matrices related to the reduced operators. Unlike traditional error-based adaptive methods, RedEigCD relies on the eigenbounds of the convective and diffusive ROM operators, whose computation is feasible at reduced scale and fully preserves the online efficiency of the ROM. A central theoretical contribution of this work is the proof, based on the combined theorems of Bendixson and Rao, that, under linearized assumptions, the maximum stable timestep for projection-based ROMs is shown to be larger than or equal to that of their corresponding full-order models (FOMs). Numerical experiments for both periodic and non-homogeneous boundary conditions demonstrate that RedEigCD yields stable timestep increases up to a factor 40 compared to the FOM, without compromising accuracy. The methodology thus establishes a new link between linear stability theory and reduced-order modeling, offering a systematic path towards efficient, self-regulating ROM integration in incompressible flow simulations.</description>

      <title>Degrees of universality in wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence of weakly interacting waves displays a great deal of universality: independence of the details of the interaction and of the pumping and dissipation scales. Here we study how inverse turbulent cascades (from small to large scales) transition from weak to strong. We find that while one-loop corrections can be dependent on excitation and dissipation scales, new types of universality appear in strong turbulence. We contrast turbulence of spin waves in ferromagnets with turbulent cascades in the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation (NSE) and in an MMT-like model in higher dimensions having a multiplicative interaction vertex: vertex renormalization gives rise to dependence on the pumping (UV scale) in the former but not in the latter. As a result of this spectral nonlocality, spin-wave turbulence stops being weak if one is sufficiently far from the pumping scale, even when the interaction of waves with comparable wavenumbers is weak. We paraphrase this as: nonlocality enhances nonlinearity.
  We then describe strong turbulence in a multi-component version of these models with a large number of components. We argue that strong spin-wave turbulence is similar to turbulence of the focusing NSE, as it realizes a critical-balance state. However, UV nonlocality causes the level of spin-wave turbulence at large scales to decrease with increasing pumping level, culminating in a state that is independent of the level of pumping.</description>

      <title>Near Real-time Adaptive Isotropic and Anisotropic Image-to-mesh Conversion for Numerical Simulations Involving Cerebral Aneurysms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13222v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Presented are two techniques that are designed to help streamline the discretization of complex vascular geometries within the numerical modeling process. The first method integrates multiple software tools into a single pipeline which can generate adaptive anisotropic meshes from segmented medical images. The pipeline is shown to satisfy quality, fidelity, smoothness, and robustness requirements while providing near real-time performance for medical image-to-mesh conversion. The second method approximates a user-defined sizing function to generate adaptive isotropic meshes of good quality and fidelity in real-time. Tested with two brain aneurysm cases and utilizing up to 96 CPU cores within a single, multicore node on Purdue University's Anvil supercomputer, the parallel adaptive anisotropic meshing method utilizes a hierarchical load balancing model (designed for large, cc-NUMA shared memory architectures) and contains an optimized local reconnection operation that performs three times faster than its original implementation from previous studies. The adaptive isotropic method is shown to generate a mesh of up to approximately 50 million elements in less than a minute while the adaptive anisotropic method is shown to generate approximately the same number of elements in about 5 minutes.</description>

      <title>Exploiting repeated matrix block structures for more efficient CFD on modern supercomputers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06710v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are often constrained by the memory-bound nature of sparse matrix-vector operations, which eventually limits performance on modern high-performance computing (HPC) systems. This work introduces a novel approach to increase arithmetic intensity in CFD by leveraging repeated matrix block structures. The method transforms the conventional sparse matrix-vector product (SpMV) into a sparse matrix-matrix product (SpMM), enabling simultaneous processing of multiple right-hand sides. This shifts the computation towards a more compute-bound regime by reusing matrix coefficients. Additionally, an inline mesh-refinement strategy is proposed: simulations initially run on a coarse mesh to establish a statistically steady flow, then refine to the target mesh. This reduces the wall-clock time to reach transition, leading to faster convergence with equivalent computational cost. The methodology is evaluated using theoretical performance bounds and validated through three test cases: a turbulent channel flow, Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection, and an industrial airfoil simulation. Results demonstrate substantial speed-ups - from modest improvements in basic configurations to over 50% in the mesh-refinement setup - highlighting the benefits of integrating SpMM across all CFD operators, including divergence, gradient, and Laplacian.</description>

      <title>The Weakly-Nonlinear Admittance at Open Ends of Two- and Three-Dimensional Acoustic Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a weakly-nonlinear exit condition for open ends of acoustic waveguides without mean flow; to our knowledge this is the first time an acoustic open end has been analysed outside the linear regime. The resulting admittance boundary condition, and its weakly-nonlinear counterpart, extends recent weakly-nonlinear modelling of curved ducts (Jensen &amp; Brambley 2025, arXiv:2503.11536) to include open ends. We approximate free space by considering the open-ended duct to be enclosed within a much larger concentric duct; within the larger duct, the smaller duct exit is modelled as an acoustic discontinuity. Importantly, the superposition principle is unneeded, allowing the model to be applied in the nonlinear regime. The exit condition can be calculated without needing to solve the full problem in either the outer or inner ducts, making it numerically efficient. The exit condition is validated in the linear regime by comparison to Wiener--Hopf solutions of the duct end correction, and a novel nonlinear end correction is proposed; we find that both non-plane waves and nonlinearity cause the end correction to vary significantly from Rayleigh's classical $0.6$ radii result. A number of numerical illustrations are then discussed, demonstrating nonlinear effects, sound radiating from curved ducts, sound radiating from an exponential horn (representative of brass instrument bells), and the harmonic effects of the open end on in-duct resonances. The model has potential applications to sound in woodwind and brass instruments.</description>

      <title>A family of three maximally symmetric boost-invariant flows in relativistic hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I discuss the constructions of boost-invariant dissipative conformal hydrodynamic flows by elaborating on the geometric procedure by Gubser and Yarom, which starts from a static, maximally symmetric flow on dS$_3\times\mathbb{R}$. Three foliations of dS$_3$ preserve three-dimensional non-Abelian isometry groups, namely, the flat ISO(2)-invariant, the spherical (closed) SO(3)-invariant, and the hyperbolic (open) SO(2,1)-invariant slicings. I show that the fluids that preserve these symmetries, after they have been Weyl transformed to flat spacetime, give rise to three physically distinct and boost-invariant solutions of the relativistic dissipative Navier-Stokes equations: the well-known and widely studied Bjorken and Gubser flows, and a seemingly thus far unexplored solution that arises from the hyperbolic slicing of dS$_3$. The new solution combines the radial expansion characteristic of the Gubser flow with the late-proper-time applicability of Bjorken's solution, and features a finite, radially bounded droplet whose expanding edge resembles a free-streaming shockwave.</description>

      <title>Enhanced magnetostrophic waves with magnetic field orthogonal to the rotation axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an isolated Gaussian velocity vortex perturbation in an otherwise quiescent, electrically conducting, and rotating fluid permeated by a uniform magnetic field $\bf{B}$. Studies suggest a presence of strong azimuthal wave motions on the timescale of centuries within the Earth's liquid outer core at higher latitudes. To understand these long-period oscillations, we focus on magnetostrophic waves, a slow component of magnetic-Coriolis waves with $\bf{B}$ orthogonally aligned with the rotation vector $\bf{\Omega}$, which replicate the field lines in the azimuthal direction. We present an analytical solution to the magnetic-Coriolis wave equation in Cartesian coordinates. Later, with numerical solution, we validate our analytical estimates and show that magnetostrophic waves travel relatively faster along the magnetic field when $\bf{B} \perp \bf{\Omega}$ compared with the case when both are aligned. The study confirms that with a magnetic field $\bf{B}$ orthogonally aligned to the rotation vector $\bf{\Omega}$, wave vectors satisfying the condition $\bf{\Omega}\cdot\bf{k} \approx 0$, travel with Alfv\'en velocities along the magnetic field lines as a component of inertial-Alfv\'en waves. The timescales on which Alfv\'en waves travel are relatively short, and it is also less likely that inertial-Alfv\'en waves will be sustained inside the core at higher latitudes \citep{Davidson2017}. This study shows that, excluding the inertial-Alfv\'en waves contribution ($k_z\neq 0$), there exists intensified magnetostrophic wave propagation when $\bf{B} \perp \bf{\Omega}$, which can explain the strong periodic oscillations on the time scales of centuries along the azimuthal field at higher latitudes. Results show persistence of the magnetostrophic waves despite the lower Lehnert number $Le$, suggesting the plausible existence of a low-intensity azimuthal magnetic field in the Earth's core.</description>
