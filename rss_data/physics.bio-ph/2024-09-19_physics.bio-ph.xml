      <title>Mechanochemical Morphodynamics of Active Bacterial Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacterial cells exhibit a diverse array of shapes and sizes, largely governed by their cell walls in conjunction with cytoskeletal proteins and internal turgor pressure. The present study develops a theoretical framework for modeling the shape dynamics of actively expanding bacterial cell walls, grounded in the concept of minimal energy dissipation. In the context of a bacterial cell wall, dissipative forces are generated through the insertion of peptidoglycan (PG) strands, while driving forces stem from alterations in mechanochemical energy, crucial for sustaining the cell wall's shape. The interplay between mechanical and chemical energies facilitates in evaluating the free energy landscape and helps in predicting the homeostasis of the bacterial cell size. The size limit derived through linear stability analysis (LSA) of a model system accurately mirrors the phase diagram produced by the theoretical model. Nonetheless, given the cell wall's intricate molecular architecture, a more detailed constitutive model is expected to provide more precise quantitative insights.</description>

      <title>Size-dependent self-avoidance enables superdiffusive migration in macroscopic unicellulars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many cells face search problems, such as finding food, mates or shelter, where their success depends on their search strategy. In contrast to other unicellular organisms, the slime mold Physarum polycephalum forms a giant network-shaped plasmodium while foraging for food. What is the advantage of the giant cell on the verge of multicellularity? We experimentally study and quantify the migration behavior of P. polycephalum plasmodia on the time scale of days in the absence and presence of food. We develop a model which successfully describes its migration in terms of ten data-derived parameters. Using the mechanistic insights provided by our data-driven model, we find that regardless of the absence or presence of food, P. polycephalum achieves superdiffusive migration by performing a self-avoiding run-and-tumble movement. In the presence of food, the run duration statistics change, only controlling the short-term migration dynamics. However, varying organism size, we find that the long-term superdiffusion arises from self-avoidance determined by cell size, highlighting the potential evolutionary advantage that this macroscopically large cell may have.</description>

      <title>Rotation-Beating dynamics of a driven flexible filament: role of motor protein properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have used numerical simulations to investigate how the properties of motor proteins control the dynamical behavior of a driven flexible filament. The filament is pinned at one end and positioned on top of a patch of anchored motor proteins, a setup commonly referred to as a spiral gliding assay. In nature, there is a variety of motor proteins with different properties. In this study, we have investigated the role of detachment rate, detachment force, stall force, and unloaded speed of motors on the dynamical behavior of the filament. We found that this system generally can show three different regimes: 1) Fluctuation, where the filament undergoes random fluctuations because the motors are unable to bend it. 2) Rotation, in which the filament bends and then moves continuously in one direction. 3) Beating, where the filament's direction of rotation changes over time. We found that the transition between fluctuation and rotation occurs when motors exert a force sufficient to buckle the filament. The threshold force coincides to the second buckling mode of a filament undergoing a continuously distributed load. Moreover, we showed that when motors near the pining point work close to their stall force, they get stuck and act as a second pin, leading to the beating regime.</description>

      <title>Three stages of nascent protein translocation through the ribosome exit tunnel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All proteins in living organisms are produced in ribosomes that facilitate the translation of genetic information into a sequence of amino acid residues. During translation, the ribosome undergoes initiation, elongation, termination, and recycling. In fact, peptide bonds are formed only during the elongation phase, which comprises periodic association of transfer RNAs and multiple auxiliary proteins with the ribosome and the addition of an amino acid to the nascent polypeptide one at a time. The protein spends a considerable amount of time attached to the ribosome. Here, we conceptually divide this portion of the protein lifetime into three stages. We define each stage on the basis of the position of the N-terminus of the nascent polypeptide within the ribosome exit tunnel and the context of the catalytic center. We argue that nascent polypeptides experience a variety of forces that determine how they translocate through the tunnel and interact with the tunnel walls. We review current knowledge about nascent polypeptide translocation and identify several white spots in our understanding of the birth of proteins.</description>

      <title>Prediction of excitable wave dynamics using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excitable systems can exhibit a variety of dynamics with different complexity, ranging from a single, stable spiral to spiral defect chaos (SDC), during which spiral waves are continuously formed and destroyed. The corresponding reaction-diffusion models, including ones for cardiac tissue, can involve a large number of variables and can be time-consuming to simulate. Here we trained a deep-learning (DL) model using snapshots from a single variable, obtained by simulating a single quasi-periodic spiral wave and SDC using a generic cardiac model. Using the trained DL model, we predicted the dynamics in both cases, using timesteps that are much larger than required for the simulations of the underlying equations. We show that the DL model is able to predict the trajectory of a quasi-periodic spiral wave and that the SDC activaton patterns can be predicted for approximately one Lyapunov time. Furthermore, we show that the DL model accurately captures the statistics of termination events in SDC, including the mean termination time. Finally, we show that a DL model trained using a specific domain size is able to replicate termination statistics on larger domains, resulting in significant computational savings.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum cycle generative adversarial network for small molecule generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The drug design process currently requires considerable time and resources to develop each new compound that enters the market. This work develops an application of hybrid quantum generative models based on the integration of parametrized quantum circuits into known molecular generative adversarial networks, and proposes quantum cycle architectures that improve model performance and stability during training. Through extensive experimentation on benchmark drug design datasets, QM9 and PC9, the introduced models are shown to outperform the previously achieved scores. Most prominently, the new scores indicate an increase of up to 30% in the quantitative estimation of druglikeness. The new hybrid quantum machine learning algorithms, as well as the achieved scores of pharmacokinetic properties, contribute to the development of fast and accurate drug discovery processes.</description>
