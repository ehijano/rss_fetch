      <title>Odd complete bipartite minors in graphs with independence number two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Chen and Deng have proved that every graph $G$ with independence number two contains $K_{\ell,\chi(G)- \ell}$ as a minor for each integer $\ell$ with $1\leq\ell &lt; \chi(G)$. In this paper, we extend this result to odd minor version. That is, we prove that each graph $G$ with independence number two contains $K_{\ell,\chi(G)- \ell}$ as an odd minor for each integer $\ell$ with $1\leq\ell &lt; \chi(G)$.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Alternating Paths via Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph whose edges are coloured with red and blue, then the number of colour-alternating walks of length $2k+1$ with $k+1$ red edges and $k$ blue edges is at most $k^k(k+1)^{k+1}(2k+1)^{-2k-1}n^{2k+2}$. This solves a problem that was recently posed by Basit, Granet, Horsley, K\"undgen and Staden. Our proof involves an application of the entropy method.</description>

      <title>The Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_4(\mathbb C)$ and the hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a relationship between the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_4(\mathbb C)$ and the hypercube graphs. Consider the $\mathbb C$-algebra $P$ of polynomials in four commuting variables. We turn $P$ into an $\mathfrak{sl}_4(\mathbb C)$-module on which each element of $\mathfrak{sl}_4(\mathbb C)$ acts as a derivation. Then $P$ becomes a direct sum of irreducible $\mathfrak{sl}_4(\mathbb C)$-modules
  $P = \sum_{N\in \mathbb N} P_N$, where $P_N$ is the $N$th homogeneous component of $P$. For $N\in \mathbb N$ we construct some additional $\mathfrak{sl}_4(\mathbb C)$-modules ${\rm Fix}(G)$ and $T$. For these modules the underlying vector space is described as follows. Let $X$ denote the vertex set of the hypercube $H(N,2)$, and let $V$ denote the $\mathbb C$-vector space with basis $X$. For the automorphism group $G$ of $H(N,2)$, the action of $G$ on $X$ turns $V$ into a $G$-module. The vector space $V^{\otimes 3} = V \otimes V \otimes V$ becomes a $G$-module such that $g(u \otimes v \otimes w)= g(u) \otimes g(v) \otimes g(w)$ for $g\in G$ and $u,v,w \in V$. The subspace ${\rm Fix}(G)$
  of $V^{\otimes 3}$ consists of the vectors in $V^{\otimes 3}$ that are fixed by every element in $G$.
  Pick $\varkappa \in X$. The corresponding subconstituent algebra $T$ of $H(N,2)$ is the subalgebra of ${\rm End}(V)$ generated by the adjacency map $\sf A$ of $H(N,2)$ and the dual adjacency map ${\sf A}^*$ of $H(N,2)$ with respect to $\varkappa$. In our main results, we turn ${\rm Fix}(G)$ and $T$ into $\mathfrak{sl}_4(\mathbb C)$-modules, and display $\mathfrak{sl}_4(\mathbb C)$-module isomorphisms $P_N \to {\rm Fix}(G) \to T$.
  We describe the $\mathfrak{sl}_4(\mathbb C)$-modules $P_N$, ${\rm Fix}(G)$, $T$ from multiple points of view.</description>

      <title>The edge-statistics conjecture for hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $r,k,\ell$ be integers such that $0\le\ell\le\binom{k}{r}$. Given a large $r$-uniform hypergraph $G$, we consider the fraction of $k$-vertex subsets which span exactly $\ell$ edges. If $\ell$ is 0 or $\binom{k}{r}$, this fraction can be exactly 1 (by taking $G$ to be empty or complete), but for all other values of $\ell$, one might suspect that this fraction is always significantly smaller than 1.
  In this paper we prove an essentially optimal result along these lines: if $\ell$ is not 0 or $\binom{k}{r}$, then this fraction is at most $(1/e) + \varepsilon$, assuming $k$ is sufficiently large in terms of $r$ and $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and $G$ is sufficiently large in terms of $k$. Previously, this was only known for a very limited range of values of $r,k,\ell$ (due to Kwan-Sudakov-Tran, Fox-Sauermann, and Martinsson-Mousset-Noever-Truji\'{c}). Our result answers a question of Alon-Hefetz-Krivelevich-Tyomkyn, who suggested this as a hypergraph generalisation of their "edge-statistics conjecture". We also prove a much stronger bound when $\ell$ is far from 0 and $\binom{k}{r}$.</description>

      <title>Interval-closed set rowmotion and homomesy on products of two chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study rowmotion dynamics on interval-closed sets. Our first main result proves a simplification of the global definition of interval-closed set rowmotion from (Elder, Lafreni\`ere, McNicholas, Striker, and Welch 2024). We then completely describe the orbits of interval-closed set rowmotion on products of two chains $[2]\times[n]$ and use this understanding to prove a homomesy conjecture from (ELMSW 2024) involving the signed cardinality statistic.</description>

      <title>On the distribution of topological and spectral indices on random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a detailed statistical study of the distribution of topological and spectral indices on random graphs $G=(V,E)$ in a wide range of connectivity regimes. First, we consider degree-based topological indices (TIs), and focus on two classes of them: $X_\Sigma(G) = \sum_{uv \in E} f(d_u,d_v)$ and $X_\Pi(G) = \prod_{uv \in E} g(d_u,d_v)$, where $uv$ denotes the edge of $G$ connecting the vertices $u$ and $v$, $d_u$ is the degree of the vertex $u$, and $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are functions of the vertex degrees. Specifically, we apply $X_\Sigma(G)$ and $X_\Pi(G)$ on Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs and random geometric graphs along the full transition from almost isolated vertices to mostly connected graphs. While we verify that $P(X_\Sigma(G))$ converges to a standard normal distribution, we show that $P( X_\Pi(G))$ converges to a log-normal distribution. In addition we also analyze Revan-degree-based indices and spectral indices (those defined from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the graph adjacency matrix). Indeed, for Revan-degree indices, we obtain results equivalent to those for standard degree-based TIs. Instead, for spectral indices, we report two distinct patterns: the distribution of indices defined only from eigenvalues approaches a normal distribution, while the distribution of those indices involving both eigenvalues and eigenvectors approaches a log-normal distribution.</description>

      <title>Van Lint-MacWilliams' conjecture and maximum cliques in Cayley graphs over finite fields, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-known Van Lint--MacWilliams' conjecture states that if $q$ is an odd prime power, and $A\subseteq \mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ such that $0,1 \in A$, $|A|=q$, and $a-b$ is a square for each $a,b \in A$, then $A$ must be the subfield $\mathbb{F}_q$. This conjecture was first proved by Blokhuis and is often phrased in terms of the maximum cliques in Paley graphs of square order. Previously, Asgarli and the author extended Blokhuis' theorem to a larger family of Cayley graphs. In this paper, we give a new simple proof of Blokhuis' theorem and its extensions. More generally, we show that if $S \subseteq \mathbb{F}_{q^2}^*$ has small multiplicative doubling, and $A\subseteq \mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ with $0,1 \in A$, $|A|=q$, such that $A-A \subseteq S \cup \{0\}$, then $A=\mathbb{F}_q$. This new result refines and extends several previous works; moreover, our new approach avoids using heavy machinery from number theory.</description>

      <title>On the boundary polynomial of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the boundary polynomial of a graph $G$ as the ordinary generating function in two variables $B(G;x,y):= \displaystyle\sum_{S\subseteq V(G)} x^{|B(S)|}y^{|S|}$, where $B(S)$ denotes the outer boundary of $S$. We investigate this graph polynomial obtaining some algebraic properties of the polynomial. We found that some parameters of $G$ are algebraically encoded in $B(G;x,y)$, \emph{e.g.}, domination number, Roman domination number, vertex connectivity, and differential of the graph $G$. Furthermore, we compute the boundary polynomial for some classic families of graphs. We also establish some relationships between $B(G;x,y)$ and $B(G^\prime;x,y)$ for the graphs $G^\prime$ obtained by removing, adding, and subdividing an edge from $G$. In addition, we prove that a graph $G$ has an isolated vertex if and only if its boundary polynomial has a factor ($y+1$). Finally, we show that the classes of complete, complete without one edge, empty, path, cycle, wheel, star, double-star graphs, and many others are characterized by the boundary polynomial.</description>

      <title>The detour covering number and cummerbund covering number of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce several new concepts about graphs and investigate their basic properties. A longest path in a graph is called a detour and a longest cycle is called a cummerbund. The detour covering number of a graph is the number of vertices that lie in a detour. A graph is said to be detour covered if every vertex lies in a detour. The cummerbund covering number and cummerbund covered graphs are defined similarly. Some of the main results are as follows. (1) Minimum degree and forbidden subgraph conditions that ensure a graph to be cummerbund covered or detour covered. (2) The minimum cummerbund covering number and minimum detour covering number of a graph with connectivity or girth conditions. (3) The minimum cummerbund covering number of a $2$-connected bipartite graph and the extremal graphs.</description>

      <title>Trichotomy and $tK_m$-goodness of sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph with $n$ vertices and $n+k-2$ edges and $tK_m$ denote the disjoint union of $t$ complete graphs $K_m$. In this paper, by developing a trichotomy for sparse graphs, we show that for given integers $m\ge 2$ and $t\ge 1$, there exists a positive constant $c$ such that if $1\le k\le cn^{\frac{2}{m-1}}$ and $n$ is large, then $G$ is $tK_m$-good, that is, the Ramsey number is \[ r(G, tK_m)=(n-1)(m-1)+t\,. \] In particular, the above equality holds for any positive integers $k$, $m$, and $t$, provided $n$ is large. The case $t=1$ was obtained by Burr, Erd\H{o}s, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp (1980), and the case $k=1$ was established by Luo and Peng (2023).</description>

      <title>Independent mutual-visibility coloring and related concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, a subset $M\subseteq V(G)$ is a mutual-visibility (MV) set if for every $u,v\in M$, there exists a $u,v$-geodesic whose internal vertices are not in $M$. We investigate proper vertex colorings of graphs whose color classes are mutual-visibility sets. The main concepts that arise in this investigation are independent mutual-visibility (IMV) sets and vertex partitions into these sets (IMV colorings). The IMV number $\mu_{i}$ and the IMV chromatic number $\chi_{\mu_{i}}$ are defined as maximum and minimum cardinality taken over all IMV sets and IMV colorings, respectively. Along the way, we also continue with the study of MV chromatic number $\chi_{\mu}$ (as the smallest number of sets in a vertex partition into MV sets), which was initiated in an earlier paper.
  We establish a close connection between the (I)MV chromatic numbers of subdivisions of complete graphs and Ramsey numbers $R(4^k;2)$. From the computational point of view, we prove that the problems of computing $\chi_{\mu_{i}}$ and $\mu_{i}$ are NP-complete, and that it is NP-hard to decide whether a graph $G$ satisfies $\imv(G)=\alpha(G)$ where $\alpha(G)$ is the independence number of $G$. Several tight bounds on $\chi_{\mu_{i}}$, $\chi_{\mu}$ and $\mu_{i}$ are given. Exact values/formulas for these parameters in some classical families of graphs are proved. In particular, we prove that $\chi_{\mu_{i}}(T)=\chi_{\mu}(T)$ holds for any tree $T$ of order at least $3$, and determine their exact formulas in the case of lexicographic product graphs. Finally, we give tight bounds on the (I)MV chromatic numbers for the Cartesian and strong product graphs, which lead to exact values in some important families of product graphs.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian cycles in $ 15 $-tough ($ P_{3}\cup 3P_{1} $)-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $ G $ is called $ t $-tough if $ \left|S\right|\geq t\cdot w\left(G-S\right)$ for every cutset $ S $ of $G$. Chv\'atal conjectured that there exists a constant $ t_{0} $ such that every $ t_{0} $-tough graph has a hamiltonian cycle. Gao and Shan have proved that every $7$-tough $(P_{3}\cup 2P_{1})$-free grah is hamiltonian. In this paper, we confirm this conjecture for $ (P_{3}\cup 3P_{1}) $-free graphs.</description>

      <title>On the mutiplicities of interpoint distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a set $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points and a distance $d&gt;0$, the multiplicity of $d$ is the number of times the distance $d$ appears between points in $X$. Let $a_1(X) \geq a_2(X) \geq \cdots \geq a_m(X)$ denote the multiplicities of the $m$ distances determined by $X$ and let $a(X)=\left(a_1(X),\dots,a_m(X)\right)$. In this paper, we study several questions from Erd\H{o}s's time regarding distance multiplicities. Among other results, we show that:
  (1) If $X$ is convex or ``not too convex'', then there exists a distance other than the diameter that has multiplicity at most $n$.
  (2) There exists a set $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, such that many distances occur with high multiplicity. In particular, at least $n^{\Omega(1/\log\log{n})}$ distances have superlinear multiplicity in $n$.
  (3) For any (not necessarily fixed) integer $1\leq k\leq\log{n}$, there exists $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, such that the difference between the $k^{\text{th}}$ and $(k+1)^{\text{th}}$ largest multiplicities is at least $\Omega(\frac{n\log{n}}{k})$. Moreover, the distances in $X$ with the largest $k$ multiplicities can be prescribed.
  (4) For every $n\in\mathbb{N}$, there exists $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, not all collinear or cocircular, such that $a(X)= (n-1,n-2,\ldots,1)$. There also exists $Y\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points with pairwise distinct distance multiplicities and $a(Y) \neq (n-1,n-2,\ldots,1)$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the monotonic normalized heat diffusion property on distance-regular graphs with classical parameters of diameter $3$. Regev and Shinkar found a Cayley graph for which this property fails. On the other hand, this property has been proved on abelian Cayley graphs, graphs with $3$ distinct eigenvalues and regular bipartite graphs with $4$ distinct eigenvalues by Price, Nica and Kubo-Namba, respectively. A distance regular graph with classical parameters of diameter $3$ has $4$ distinct eigenvalues and is not necessarily bipartite or vertex transitive.</description>

      <title>Extending Generalized Splines Over The Integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative ring with identity and $G$ a graph. \emph{An extending generalized spline} on $G$ is a vertex labeling $f \in \prod_{v} M_v$ such that at each edge $e=uv$ there is an $R$-module $M_{uv}$ together with homomorphisms $ \varphi_u : M_u \to M_{uv}$ and $ \varphi_v : M_v \to M_{uv}$ for each vertex $u, v$ incident to the edge $e$ so that $\varphi_u(f_u)=\varphi_v(f_v).$ Extending generalized splines are further generalizations for generalized splines. They can also be considered as generalized splines over modules.
  The main goal of this paper is to study the $R$-module structure of extending generalized splines. We concentrate on two following questions: which of the results for general splines extend to generalized splines over modules and if there is an algorithm or an explicit formula for special basis classes, called a flow up basis, for generalized splines over modules. We show that certain results concerning generalized splines can be extended to a setting where each vertex $v$ is assigned a module $M_v=m_v\mathbb Z$. We provide an algorithm to construct a special basis for generalized splines over these modules on paths. Additionally, we introduce a new technique to construct a flow-up basis on arbitrary graphs using the idea of an algorithm on paths.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds on the zeros of the chromatic polynomial of graphs and claw-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for any graph $G$ the (complex) zeros of its chromatic polynomial, $\chi_G(x)$, lie inside the disk centered at $0$ of radius $4.25 \Delta(G)$, where $\Delta(G)$ denote the maximum degree of $G$. This improves on a recent result of Jenssen, Patel and the second author, who proved a bound of $5.94\Delta(G)$. We moreover show that for graphs of sufficiently large girth we can replace $4.25$ by $3.60$ and for claw-free graphs we can replace $4.25$ by $3.81$.
  Our proofs build on the ideas developed by Jenssen, Patel and the second author, adding some new ideas. A key novel ingredient for claw-free graphs is to use a representation of the coefficients of the chromatic polynomial in terms of the number of certain partial acyclic orientations.</description>

      <title>Perfect divisibility of (fork, antifork$\cup K_1$)-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A {\em fork} is a graph obtained from $K_{1,3}$ (usually called {\em claw}) by subdividing an edge once, an {\em antifork} is the complement graph of a fork, and a {\em co-cricket} is a union of $K_1$ and $K_4-e$. A graph is perfectly divisible if for each of its induced subgraph $H$, $V (H)$ can be partitioned into $A$ and $B$ such that $H[A]$ is perfect and $\omega(H[B]) &lt; \omega(H)$. Karthick {\em et al.} [Electron. J. Comb. 28 (2021), P2.20.] conjectured that fork-free graphs are perfectly divisible, and they proved that each (fork, co-cricket)-free graph is either claw-free or perfectly divisible. In this paper, we show that every (fork, {\em antifork}$\cup K_1$)-free graph is perfectly divisible. This improves some results of Karthick {\em et al.}.</description>

      <title>Nearly spanning cycle in the percolated hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $Q^d$ be the $d$-dimensional binary hypercube. We form a random subgraph $Q^d_p\subseteq Q^d$ by retaining each edge of $Q^d$ independently with probability $p$. We show that, for every constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there exists a constant $C=C(\varepsilon)&gt;0$ such that, if $p\ge C/d$, then with high probability $Q^d_p$ contains a cycle of length at least $(1-\varepsilon)2^d$. This confirms a long-standing folklore conjecture, stated in particular by Condon, Espuny D\'iaz, Gir\~ao, K\"uhn, and Osthus [Hamiltonicity of random subgraphs of the hypercube, Mem. Amer. Math. Soc. 305 (2024), No. 1534].</description>

      <title>Binary operations on pattern-avoiding cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose $c_n(\sigma)$ denotes the number of cyclic permutations in $\mathcal{S}_n$ that avoid a pattern $\sigma$. In this paper, we define partial groupoid structures on cyclic pattern-avoiding permutations that allow us to build larger cyclic pattern-avoiding permutations from smaller ones. We use this structure to find recursive lower bounds on $c_n(\sigma)$. These bounds imply that $c_n(\sigma)$ has a growth rate of at least 3 for $\sigma\in\{231,312,321\}$ and a growth rate of at least 2.6 for $\sigma\in\{123,132,213\}$. In the process, we prove (and sometimes improve) a conjecture of B\'{o}na and Cory that $c_n(\sigma)\geq 2 c_{n-1}(\sigma)$ for all $\sigma\in\mathcal{S}_3\setminus\{123\}$ and $n\geq 2.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halin graphs constitute an interesting class of planar and polyhedral graphs. A generalized Halin graph is obtained by connecting all leaves of a planar embedding of a tree via a cycle. A Halin graph is a generalized Halin graph having no vertex of degree two. We classify all generalized Halin graphs with positive Lin-Lu-Yau curvature.</description>

      <title>New bounds for proper $h$-conflict-free colourings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proper $k$-colouring of a graph $G$ is called $h$-conflict-free if every vertex $v$ has at least $\min\, \{h, {\rm deg}(v)\}$ colours appearing exactly once in its neighbourhood. Let $\chi_{\rm pcf}^h(G)$ denote the minimum $k$ such that such a colouring exists. We show that for every fixed $h\ge 1$, every graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ satisfies $\chi_{\rm pcf}^h(G) \le h\Delta + \mathcal{O}(\log \Delta)$. This expands on the work of Cho et al., and improves a recent result of Liu and Reed in the case $h=1$. We conjecture that for every $h\ge 1$ and every graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ sufficiently large, the bound $\chi_{\rm pcf}^h(G) \le h\Delta + 1$ should hold, which would be tight. When the minimum degree $\delta$ of $G$ is sufficiently large, namely $\delta \ge \max\{100h, 3000\log \Delta\}$, we show that this upper bound can be further reduced to $\chi_{\rm{pcf}}^h(G) \le \Delta + \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{h\Delta})$. This improves a recent bound from Kamyczura and Przyby{\l}o when $\delta \le \sqrt{h\Delta}$.</description>

      <title>Counting tame $SL_3$- and some $SL_4$ -frieze patterns over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we count tame $ SL_3 $-frieze patterns over finite fields and also tame $ SL_4 $-frieze patterns in the case that their width $ w $ is even. Let $ n = w + k + 1 $. We consider the sets $ C_k(n) $ of tuples of $ n $ points in the projective space $ \mathbb{P}^{k-1}(K) $, such that $ k $ consecutive points are always independent (the first and last point in the tuple are considered to be consecutive). We prove that the problem of counting tame $ SL_k $-frieze patterns can be reduced to counting these sets if $ \gcd(k,n) = 1 $. Otherwise, certain subsets $ C_k^*(n) $ need to be considered instead. Afterwards we count $ C_k(n)$ in the cases $ k = 3 $ and $ k = 4 $ and $ C_3^*(n) $, leading to our results.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an alternative combinatorial parametrization of Borel orbits in classical symmetric varieties using matchings of the Corona graph. As an application, we obtain ultra log-concavity and unimodality for the number of Borel orbits in Types AIII and CII. Moreover, we prove a conjecture of Can and Ugurlu concerning the non-integrality of the coefficients of the polynomial that interpolates the number of orbits in Type BI.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial K3 surfaces and the Mori fan of the Dolgachev--Nikulin--Voisin family in degree 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a combinatorial K3 surface. Those form a certain class of type III semistable K3 surfaces and are completely determined by combinatorial data called curve structures. Emphasis is put on degree $2$ combinatorial K3 surfaces, but the approach can be used to study higher degree as well. We describe elementary modifications both in terms of the curve structures as well as on the Picard groups. Together with a description of the nef cone in terms of curve structures, this provides an approach to explicitly computing the Mori fan of the Dolgachev--Nikulin--Voisin family in degree $2$.</description>

      <title>Flip-graphs of non-orientable filling surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a surface $\Sigma$ with punctures that serve as marked points and at least one marked point on each boundary component. We build a filling surface $\Sigma_n$ by singling out one of the boundary components and denoting by $n$ the number of marked points it contains. We consider the triangulations of $\Sigma_n$ whose vertices are the marked points and the associated flip-graph $\mathcal{F}(\Sigma_n)$. Quotienting $\mathcal{F}(\Sigma_n)$ by the homeomorphisms of $\Sigma$ that fix the privileged boundary component results in a finite graph $\mathcal{MF}(\Sigma_n)$. Bounds on the diameter of $\mathcal{MF}(\Sigma_n)$ are available when $\Sigma$ is orientable and we provide corresponding bounds when $\Sigma$ is non-orientable. We show that the diameter of this graph grows at least like $5n/2$ and at most like $4n$ as $n$ goes to infinity. If $\Sigma$ is an unpunctured M\"obius strip, $\mathcal{MF}(\Sigma_n)$ coincides with $\mathcal{F}(\Sigma_n)$ and we prove that the diameter of this graph grows exactly like $5n/2$ as $n$ goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>A note on the number of distinct elements and zero-sum subsequence lengths in cyclic groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short note we investigate zero-sum sequences in finite abelian groups, examining the relationship between the sequence's support size, that is the number of distinct elements, and its properties concerning zero-sums. In particular, for sequences $S$ in a cyclic group, we establish a direct connection between $MZ(S)$, the length of the shortest nonempty subsequence summing to zero and the number of distinct values in $S$. Our results reveal that sequences with larger support must contain shorter non-empty zero-sum subsequences, in line with classical zero-sum results. Additionally, we present one application of our main result to a factorization of ideals problem in rings of integers of a number field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explicitly construct a minimal free resolution of the cover ideals of clique-whiskered graphs. In particular, Cohen--Macaulay chordal graphs, clique corona graphs, and Cohen--Macaulay Cameron--Walker graphs are examples of clique-whiskered graphs. We also introduce multi-clique-whiskered graphs as a generalization of both clique-whiskered graphs and multi-whisker graphs. We prove that multi-clique-whiskered graphs are vertex decomposable and hence sequentially Cohen--Macaulay. Moreover, we provide formulas for the projective dimension and the Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity of their edge ideals. Finally, we construct minimal free resolutions of the cover ideals of both multi-clique-whiskered graphs and very well-covered graphs.</description>

Abstract: In 1997, Van Hamme proposed 13 supercongruences corresponding to $1/\pi$ series of the Ramanujan-type. Inspired by the recent work of V.J.W. Guo, we establish a unified $q$-analogue of Van Hamme's (B.2), (E.2) and (F.2) supercongruences, which is also a refinement of some known results obtained by different authors. As a consequence, we give a parametric supercongruence related to the Euler polynomials.</description>

      <title>A characterization of testable hypergraph properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:1707.03303v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a combinatorial characterization of all testable properties of $k$-uniform hypergraphs ($k$-graphs for short). Here, a $k$-graph property $P$ is testable if there is a randomized algorithm which makes a bounded number of edge queries and distinguishes with probability $2/3$ between $k$-graphs that satisfy $P$ and those that are far from satisfying $P$. For the $2$-graph case, such a combinatorial characterization was obtained by Alon, Fischer, Newman and Shapira. Our results for the $k$-graph setting are in contrast to those of Austin and Tao, who showed that for the somewhat stronger concept of local repairability, the testability results for graphs do not extend to the $3$-graph setting. Our proof relies on a random subhypergraph sampling result proved in a companion paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study the acyclic orientations of graphs. We obtain an encoding of the acyclic orientations of the complete $p$-partite graph with size of its parts $n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_p$ via a vector with $p$ symbols and length $n=n_1+n_2+\ldots+n_p$ when the parts are fixed but not the vertices in each part. We also give a recursive way to construct all acyclic orientations of a complete multipartite graph, this construction can be done by computer easily in order $\mathcal{O}(n)$. Furthermore, we obtain a closed formula for non-isomorphic acyclic orientations of both the complete multipartite graphs and the complete multipartite graphs with a directed spanning tree. Moreover, we obtain a closed formula for the number of acyclic orientations of a complete multipartite graph $K_{n_1,\ldots,n_p}$ with labelled vertices. Finally, we obtain a way encode all acyclic orientations of an arbitrary graph as a permutation code. Using the codification mentioned above we obtain sharp upper and lower bounds of the number of acyclic orientations of a graph.</description>

      <title>Star colouring and locally constrained graph homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We relate star colouring of even-degree regular graphs to the notions of locally constrained graph homomorphisms to the oriented line graph $ \vec{L}(K_q) $ of the complete graph $ K_q $ and to its underlying undirected graph $ L^*(K_q) $. Our results have consequences for locally constrained graph homomorphisms and oriented line graphs in addition to star colouring. We show that $ L^*(H) $ is a 2-lift of the line graph $ L(H) $ for every graph $ H $. Dvo\v{r}\'ak, Mohar and \v{S}\'amal (J. Graph Theory, 2013) proved that for every 3-regular graph $ G $, the line graph of $ G $ is 4-star colourable if and only if $ G $ admits a locally bijective homomorphism to the cube $ Q_3 $. We generalise this result as follows: for $ p\geq 2 $, a $ K_{1,p+1} $-free $ 2p $-regular graph $ G $ admits a $ (p+2) $-star colouring if and only if $ G $ admits a locally bijective homomorphism to $ L^*(K_{p+2}) $. As a result, if a $ K_{p+1} $-free $ 2p $-regular graph $ G $ with $ p\geq 2 $ is $ (p+2) $-star colourable, then $ -2 $ and $ p-2 $ are eigenvalues of $ G $. We also prove the following: (i) for $ p\geq 2 $, a $ 2p $-regular graph $ G $ admits a $ (p+2) $-star colouring if and only if $ G $ has an orientation that admits an out-neighbourhood bijective homomorphism to $ \vec{L}(K_{p+2}) $; (ii) the line graph of a 3-regular graph $ G $ is 4-star colourable if and only if $ G $ is bipartite and distance-two 4-colourable; and (iii) it is NP-complete to check whether a planar 4-regular 3-connected graph is 4-star colourable.</description>

Abstract: We define and study q-delta-matroids, and q-g-matroids. These objects are analogues, for finite-dimensional vector spaces over finite fields, of delta-matroids and g-matroids arising from finite sets.

      <title>A Resolution of the McCarty Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The McCarty Conjecture states that any McCarty Matrix (an $n\times n$ matrix $A$ with positive integer entries and each of the $2n$ row and column sums equal to $n$), can be additively decomposed into two other matrices, $B$ and $C$, such that $B$ has row and column sumsets both equal to $\{1, 2,... n\}$, and $C$ has row and column sumsets both equal to $\{0, 1,... n-1\}$. The problem can also be formulated in terms of bipartite graphs. In this paper we use probabilistic methods to resolve this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Vertex-Based Localization of Erd\H{o}s-Gallai Theorems for Paths and Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a simple graph $G$, let $n$ and $m$ denote the number of vertices and edges in $G$, respectively. The Erd\H{o}s-Gallai theorem for paths states that in a simple $P_k$-free graph, $m \leq \frac{n(k-1)}{2}$, where $P_k$ denotes a path with length $k$ (that is, with $k$ edges). In this paper, we generalize this result as follows: For each $v \in V(G)$, let $p(v)$ be the length of the longest path that contains $v$. We show that \[m \leq \sum_{v \in V(G)} \frac{p(v)}{2}\] The Erd\H{o}s-Gallai theorem for cycles states that in a simple graph $G$ with circumference (that is, the length of the longest cycle) at most $k$, we have $m \leq \frac{k(n-1)}{2}$. We strengthen this result as follows: For each $v \in V(G)$, let $c(v)$ be the length of the longest cycle that contains $v$, or $2$ if $v$ is not part of any cycle. We prove that \[m \leq \left( \sum_{v \in V(G)} \frac{c(v)}{2} \right) - \frac{c(u)}{2}\] where $c(u)$ denotes the circumference of $G$. \newline Furthermore, we characterize the class of extremal graphs that attain equality in these bounds.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds on the number of envy-free divisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze lower bounds for the number of envy-free divisions, in the classical Woodall-Stormquist setting and in a non-classical case, when envy-freeness is combined with the equipartition of a measure.
  1. In the first scenario, there are $r$ hungry players, and the cake (that is, the segment $[0,1]$) is cut into $r$ pieces. Then there exist at least two different envy-free divisions. This bound is sharp: for each $r$, we present an example of preferences such that there are exactly two envy-free divisions.
  2. In the second (hybrid) scenario, there are $p$ not necessarily hungry players ($p$ is a prime) and a continuous measure $\mu$ on $[0,1]$. The cake is cut into $2p-1$ pieces, the pieces are allocated to $p$ boxes (with some restrictions) and the players choose the boxes. Then there exists at least $\binom{2p-1}{p-1} \cdot 2^{2-p}$ envy-free divisions such that the measure $\mu$ is equidistributed among the players.</description>

      <title>Strongly regular graphs in hyperbolic quadrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $Q^+(2n+1,q)$ be a hyperbolic quadric of $\PG(2n+1,q)$. Fix a generator $\Pi$ of the quadric. Define $\cG_n$ as the graph with vertex set the points of $Q^+(2n+1,q)\setminus \Pi$ and two vertices adjacent if they either span a secant to $Q^+(2n+1,q)$ or a line contained in $Q^+(2n+1,q)$ meeting $\Pi$ non-trivially. Then such a construction defines a strongly regular graph, which is the complement of a (non-induced) subgraph of the collinearity graph of $Q^+(2n+1,q)$. In this paper, we directly compute the parameters of $\cG_n$, which is cospectral, when $q=2$, to the tangent graph $NO^+(2n+2,2)$, but it is non-isomorphic for $n\geq3$. We also prove the non-isomorphism by analyzing the case of the quadric $Q^+(7,2)$.</description>

      <title>1-2 Conjectures for Graphs with Low Degeneracy Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent work, Keusch proved the so-called 1-2-3 Conjecture, raised by Karo\'nski, {\L}uczak, and Thomason in 2004: for every connected graph different from $K_2$, we can assign labels~$1,2,3$ to the edges so that no two adjacent vertices are incident to the same sum of labels. Despite this significant result, several problems close to the 1-2-3 Conjecture in spirit remain widely open. In this work, we focus on the so-called 1-2 Conjecture, raised by Przyby{\l}o and Wo\'zniak in 2010, which is a counterpart of the 1-2-3 Conjecture where labels~$1,2$ only can be assigned, and both vertices and edges are labelled. We consider both the 1-2 Conjecture in its original form, where adjacent vertices must be distinguished w.r.t.~their sums of incident labels, and variants for products and multisets. We prove some of these conjectures for graphs with bounded maximum degree (at most~$6$) and bounded maximum average degree (at most~$3$), going beyond earlier results of the same sort.</description>

      <title>Competing types in preferential attachment graphs with community structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the two-type preferential attachment model of Antunovi\'c, Mossel and R\'acz, where each new vertex takes its type according to a defined rule based on the types of its neighbours, to incorporate community structure, and investigate whether the proportions of vertices of each type synchronise between communities. The behaviour depends both on the choice of community structure and on the type assignment rule.
  For essentially all cases where the single community model has more than one possible limit, communities may fail to synchronise for weakly interacting communities. Even when the single community model almost surely converges to a deterministic limit, synchronisation is not guaranteed. However, we give natural conditions on the assignment rule and, for two communities, on the structure, either of which will imply synchronisation to this limit, and each of which is essentially best possible.
  We also give an example where the proportions of types almost surely do not converge, which is impossible in the single community model.</description>

      <title>Random sampling of permutations through quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a classical algorithm for random sampling of permutations, drawing inspiration from the Steinhaus-Johnson-Trotter algorithm. Our approach takes a comprehensive view of permutation sampling by expressing them as products of adjacent transpositions. Building on this, we develop a quantum analogue of the classical algorithm using a quantum circuit model for random sampling of permutations. As an application, we present a quantum algorithm for the two-sample randomization test to assess the difference of means in classical data. Finally, we propose a nested corona product graph generative model for symmetric groups, which facilitates random sampling of permutations from specific sets of permutations through a quantum circuit model.</description>

Abstract: Groupoid cardinality is an invariant of locally finite groupoids which has many of the properties of the cardinality of finite sets, but which takes values in all non-negative real numbers, and accounts for the morphisms of a groupoid. Several results on groupoid cardinality are proved, analogous to the relationship between cardinality of finite sets and i.e. injective or surjective functions. We also generalize to a broad class of (2,1)-categories a famous theorem of Lov\'asz which characterizes the isomorphism type of relational structures by counting the number of homomorphisms into them.</description>

We demonstrate precisely that, under a specific map, the correlation functions of the currents of $q\widetilde{Y}_{L,0,N}[\Psi]$, coincide with the Sergeev-Veselov super Macdonald polynomials.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a free arrangement of $d$ lines in the complex projective plane, with exponents $d_1\leq d_2$. Let $m$ be the maximal multiplicity of points in $\mathcal{A}$. In this note, we describe first the simple cases $d_1 \leq m$. Then we study the case $d_1=m+1$, and describe which line arrangements can occur by deleting or adding a line to $\mathcal{A}$. When $d \leq 14$, there are only two free arrangements with $d_1=m+2$, namely one with degree $13$ and the other with degree $14$. We study their geometries in order to deepen our understanding of the structure of free line arrangements in general.</description>

      <title>A practical algorithm for 2-admissibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $2$-admissibility of a graph is a promising measure to identify real-world networks which have an algorithmically favourable structure. In contrast to other related measures, like the weak/strong $2$-colouring numbers or the maximum density of graphs that appear as $1$-subdivisions, the $2$-admissibility can be computed in polynomial time. However, so far these results are theoretical only and no practical implementation to compute the $2$-admissibility exists.
  Here we present an algorithm which decides whether the $2$-admissibility of an input graph $G$ is at most $p$ in time $O(p^4 |V(G)|)$ and space $O(|E(G)| + p^2)$. The simple structure of the algorithm makes it easy to implement. We evaluate our implementation on a corpus of 214 real-world networks and find that the algorithm runs efficiently even on networks with millions of edges, that it has a low memory footprint, and that indeed many networks have a small $2$-admissibility.</description>

      <title>Weighted Random Dot Product Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling of intricate relational patterns has become a cornerstone of contemporary statistical research and related data science fields. Networks, represented as graphs, offer a natural framework for this analysis. This paper extends the Random Dot Product Graph (RDPG) model to accommodate weighted graphs, markedly broadening the model's scope to scenarios where edges exhibit heterogeneous weight distributions. We propose a nonparametric weighted (W)RDPG model that assigns a sequence of latent positions to each node. Inner products of these nodal vectors specify the moments of their incident edge weights' distribution via moment-generating functions. In this way, and unlike prior art, the WRDPG can discriminate between weight distributions that share the same mean but differ in other higher-order moments. We derive statistical guarantees for an estimator of the nodal's latent positions adapted from the workhorse adjacency spectral embedding, establishing its consistency and asymptotic normality. We also contribute a generative framework that enables sampling of graphs that adhere to a (prescribed or data-fitted) WRDPG, facilitating, e.g., the analysis and testing of observed graph metrics using judicious reference distributions. The paper is organized to formalize the model's definition, the estimation (or nodal embedding) process and its guarantees, as well as the methodologies for generating weighted graphs, all complemented by illustrative and reproducible examples showcasing the WRDPG's effectiveness in various network analytic applications.</description>
