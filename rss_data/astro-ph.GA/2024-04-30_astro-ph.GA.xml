      <title>A dusty proto-cluster surrounding the binary galaxy HerBS-70 at $z = 2.3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on deep SCUBA-2 observations at 850$\mu$m and NOEMA spectroscopic measurements at 2 mm of the environment surrounding the luminous, massive ($M_{*} \approx 2 \times 10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$) Herschel-selected source HerBS-70. This source was revealed by previous NOEMA observations to be a binary system of dusty star-forming galaxies at $z= 2.3$, with the East component (HerBS-70E) hosting an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). The SCUBA-2 observations detected, in addition to the binary system, twenty-one sources at $&gt; 3.5 \sigma$ over an area of $\sim 25$ square comoving Mpc with a sensitivity of $\sigma_{850} = 0.75$ mJy. The surface density of continuum sources around HerBS-70 is three times higher than for field galaxies. The NOEMA spectroscopic measurements confirm the protocluster membership of three of the nine brightest sources through their CO(4 - 3) line emission, yielding a volume density 36 times higher than for field galaxies. All five confirmed sub-mm galaxies in the HerBS-70 system have relatively short gas depletion times ($80 - 500$ Myr), indicating the onset of quenching for this protocluster core due to the depletion of gas. The dark matter halo mass of the HerBS-70 system is estimated around $5 \times{} 10^{13}$ M$_{\odot}$, with a projected current-day mass of $10^{15}$ M$_{\odot}$, similar to the local Virgo and Coma clusters. These observations support the claim that DSFGs, in particular the ones with observed multiplicity, can trace cosmic overdensities.</description>

      <title>CO Observations of Early-mid Stage Major-mergers in MaNGA Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the molecular gas in early-mid stage major-mergers, with a sample of 43 major-merger galaxy pairs selected from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey and a control sample of 195 isolated galaxies selected from the xCOLD GASS survey. Adopting kinematic asymmetry as a new effective indicator to describe the merger stage, we aim to study the role of molecular gas in the merger-induced star formation enhancement along the merger sequence of galaxy pairs. We obtain the molecular gas properties from CO observations with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), Institut de Radioastronomie Milimetrique (IRAM) 30-m telescope, and the MASCOT survey. Using these data, we investigate the differences in molecular gas fraction ($f_{\rm H_{2}}$), star formation rate (SFR), star formation efficiency (SFE), molecular-to-atomic gas ratio ($M_{\rm H_{2}}/M_{\rm HI}$), total gas fraction ($f_{\rm gas}$), and the star formation efficiency of total gas (${\rm SFE_{gas}}$) between the pair and control samples. In the full pair sample, our results suggest the $f_{\rm H_{2}}$ of paired galaxies is significantly enhanced, while the SFE is comparable to that of isolated galaxies. We detect significantly increased $f_{\rm H_{2}}$ and $M_{\rm H_{2}}/M_{\rm HI}$ in paired galaxies at the pericenter stage, indicating an accelerated transition from atomic gas to molecular gas due to interactions. Our results indicate that the elevation of $f_{\rm H_{2}}$ plays a major role in the enhancement of global SFR in paired galaxies at the pericenter stage, while the contribution of enhanced SFE in specific regions requires further explorations through spatially resolved observations of a larger sample spanning a wide range of merger stages.</description>

      <title>Associating LOFAR Galactic Faraday structures with the warm neutral medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faraday tomography observations with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) have unveiled a remarkable network of structures in polarized synchrotron emission at high Galactic latitudes. The observed correlation between LOFAR structures, dust polarization, and HI emission suggests a connection to the neutral interstellar medium (ISM). We investigated this relationship by estimating the rotation measure (RM) of the warm neutral (partially ionized) medium (WNM) in the local ISM. Our work combines UV spectroscopy from FUSE and dust polarization observations from \Planck\ with LOFAR data. We derived electron column densities from UV absorption spectra toward nine background stars, within the field of published data from the LOFAR two-meter sky survey. The associated RMs were estimated using a local magnetic field model fitted to the dust polarization data of \Planck. A comparison with Faraday spectra at the position of the stars suggests that LOFAR structures delineate a slab of magnetized WNM and synchrotron emission, located ahead of the bulk of the warm ionized medium. This conclusion establishes an astrophysical framework for exploring the link between Faraday structures and the dynamics of the magnetized multiphase ISM. It will be possible to test it on a larger sample of stars when maps from the full northern sky survey of LOFAR become available.</description>

      <title>Implications on star-formation-rate indicators from HII regions and diffuse ionised gas in the M101 Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the connection between diffuse ionised gas (DIG), HII regions, and field O and B stars in the nearby spiral M101 and its dwarf companion NGC 5474 using ultra-deep H$\alpha$ narrow-band imaging and archival GALEX UV imaging. We find a strong correlation between DIG H$\alpha$ surface brightness and the incident ionising flux leaked from the nearby HII regions, which we reproduce well using simple Cloudy simulations. While we also find a strong correlation between H$\alpha$ and co-spatial FUV surface brightness in DIG, the extinction-corrected integrated UV colours in these regions imply stellar populations too old to produce the necessary ionising photon flux. Combined, this suggests that HII region leakage, not field OB stars, is the primary source of DIG in the M101 Group. Corroborating this interpretation, we find systematic disagreement between the H$\alpha$- and FUV-derived star formation rates (SFRs) in the DIG, with SFR$_{{\rm H}\alpha} &lt; $SFR$_{\rm FUV}$ everywhere. Within HII regions, we find a constant SFR ratio of 0.44 to a limit of $\sim10^{-5}$ M$_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$. This result is in tension with other studies of star formation in spiral galaxies, which typically show a declining SFR$_{{\rm H}\alpha}/$SFR$_{\rm FUV}$ ratio at low SFR. We reproduce such trends only when considering spatially averaged photometry that mixes HII regions, DIG, and regions lacking H$\alpha$ entirely, suggesting that the declining trends found in other galaxies may result purely from the relative fraction of diffuse flux, leaky compact HII regions, and non-ionising FUV-emitting stellar populations in different regions within the galaxy.</description>

      <title>X-ray View of Little Red Dots: Do They Host Supermassive Black Holes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of Little Red Dots (LRDs) -- a population of compact, high-redshift, dust-reddened galaxies -- is one of the most surprising results from \textit{JWST}. However, the nature of LRDs is still debated: some studies suggest that these galaxies host accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs), while others conclude that the near-infrared emission primarily originates from intense star formation. In this work, we utilize ultra-deep \textit{Chandra} observations and study LRDs residing behind the lensing galaxy cluster, Abell~2744. We probe the X-ray emission from individual galaxies but find that they remain undetected and provide SMBH mass upper limits of $\lesssim(1.5-16)\times10^{6}~\rm{M_{\odot}}$ assuming Eddington limited accretion. To increase the signal-to-noise ratios, we conduct a stacking analysis of the full sample with a total lensed exposure time of $\approx87$~Ms. We also bin the galaxies based on their stellar mass, lensing magnification, and detected broad-line H$\alpha$ emission. All but one stacked sample remains undetected with SMBH mass upper limits of $\lesssim2.5\times10^{6}~\rm{M_{\odot}}$. We obtain a tentative, $\approx2.6\sigma$ detection for LRDs exhibiting broad-line H$\alpha$ emission. Taking this detection at face value, the inferred mean SMBH mass is $\approx3.2\times10^{6}~\rm{M_{\odot}}$ assuming Eddington-limited accretion, about 1.5 orders of magnitude lower than that inferred from \textit{JWST} data. Our results imply that LRDs do not host over-massive SMBHs and/or accrete at a few percent of their Eddington limit. The significant discrepancy between the \textit{JWST} and \textit{Chandra} data hints that the scaling relations used to infer the SMBH mass from the H$\alpha$ line and virial relations may not be applicable for high-redshift LRDs.</description>

      <title>MAGAZ3NE: Massive, Extremely Dusty Galaxies at $z\sim2$ Lead to Photometric Overestimation of Number Densities of the Most Massive Galaxies at $3&lt;z&lt;4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present rest-frame optical spectra from Keck/MOSFIRE and Keck/NIRES of 16 candidate ultramassive galaxies targeted as part of the Massive Ancient Galaxies at $z&gt;3$ Near-Infrared (MAGAZ3NE) Survey. These candidates were selected to have photometric redshifts $3\lesssim z_{\rm phot}&lt;4$, photometric stellar masses log($M$/M$_\odot$)$&gt;11.7$, and well-sampled photometric spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the UltraVISTA and VIDEO surveys. In contrast to previous spectroscopic observations of blue star-forming and post-starburst ultramassive galaxies, candidates in this sample have very red SEDs implying significant dust attenuation, old stellar ages, and/or active galactic nuclei (AGN). Of these galaxies, eight are revealed to be heavily dust-obscured $2.0&lt;z&lt;2.7$ galaxies with strong emission lines, some showing broad features indicative of AGN, three are Type I AGN hosts at $z&gt;3$, one is a $z\sim1.2$ dusty galaxy, and four galaxies do not have a confirmed spectroscopic redshift. In fact, none of the sample has |$z_{\rm spec}-z_{\rm phot}$|$&lt;0.5$, suggesting difficulties for photometric redshift programs in fitting similarly red SEDs. The prevalence of these red interloper galaxies suggests that the number densities of high-mass galaxies are overestimated at $z\gtrsim3$ in large photometric surveys, helping to resolve the `impossibly early galaxy problem' and leading to much better agreement with cosmological galaxy simulations. A more complete spectroscopic survey of ultramassive galaxies is required to pin down the uncertainties on their number densities in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Faraday tomography of LoTSS-DR2 data: II. Multi-tracer analysis in the high-latitude outer Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a follow-up study on the analysis of the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) mosaic in the high-latitude outer Galaxy presented in the first paper of this series. Here, we focus on the search for alignment between the magnetic field traced by dust, HI filaments, starlight optical linear polarisation, and linear depolarised structures (depolarisation canals) observed in low-frequency synchrotron polarisation. This alignment was previously found in several smaller fields observed with LOFAR, offering valuable insights into the nature of the interstellar medium and the 3D spatial distribution of the diffuse ionised medium. We aim to determine whether the alignment of the interstellar medium (ISM) phases observed through multiple tracers is a common occurrence or an exception. Additionally, in areas where depolarisation canals align with the magnetic field, we use starlight polarisation to constrain the distance to the structures associated with the observed canals. We employed the Rolling Hough Transform (RHT) and projected Rayleigh statistics (PRS) to identify and quantify the alignment between the different tracers. On the scale of the whole mosaic, we did not find any evidence of a universal alignment among the three tracers. However, in one particular area, the western region (Dec between $29^\circ$ and $70^\circ$ and RA between $\mathrm{7^h44^m}$ and $\mathrm{9^h20^m}$), we do find a significant alignment between the magnetic field, depolarisation canals, and HI filaments. Based on this alignment, we used the starlight polarisation of stars with known parallax distances to estimate that the minimum distance to the structures observed by LOFAR in this region lies within the range of 200 to 240 pc. We associate these structures with the edge of the Local Bubble.</description>

      <title>Capture of field stars by dark substructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use analytical and $N$-body methods to study the capture of field stars by gravitating substructures moving across a galactic environment. We find that the majority of captured stars move on temporarily-bound orbits that escape from the substructure potential after a few orbital revolutions. In numerical experiments where a substructure model is immersed in a galaxy on a circular orbit, we also find particles that remain bound to the substructure potential for indefinitely-long times. This population is absent from substructure models initially placed outside the galaxy on an eccentric orbit. We show that gravitational capture is most efficient in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) on account of their low velocity dispersions and high stellar phase-space densities. In these galaxies `dark' sub-subhaloes which do not experience in-situ star formation may capture field stars and become visible as stellar overdensities with unusual properties: (i) they would have a large size for their luminosity, (ii) contain stellar populations indistinguishable from the host galaxy, and (iii) exhibit dark matter (DM)-dominated mass-to-light ratios. We discuss the nature of several `anomalous' stellar systems reported as star clusters in the Fornax and Eridanus II dSphs which exhibit some of these characteristics. A large population of DM sub-subhaloes with a mass function $d N/d M_\bullet\sim M_\bullet^{-\alpha}$ generates stellar substructures with a luminosity function, $d N/d M_\star\sim M_\star^{-\beta}$, where $\beta=(2\alpha+1)/3=1.6$ for $\alpha=1.9$. Detecting and characterizing these objects in dSphs would provide unprecedented constraints on the particle mass and cross section of a large range of DM particle candidates.</description>

      <title>Neutral hydrogen filaments in interstellar media: Are they physical?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trending term "filament" is extensively used in the interstellar medium (ISM) and the star formation community, and is believed to be one of the most important objects that gauge molecular cloud and star formation. However, the physical definition of these ubiquitous, elongated, high contrast features is poorly defined and still actively debated. Despite the absence of a unified consensus, filaments are believed to be involved in many important physical processes from galaxy structure formation to the emergence of protostellar objects. Therefore, understanding how filaments form, what constrains their growth, and their general physical properties, are extremely important for theorists and observers who study the dynamics of the ISM and consequent star formations. This review serves as a collection of the community's views and develops the concept of "filaments" in the context of the ISM and star-forming clouds. Observationally, filaments are seen across the entire sky and often carry an aspect ratio of the order of hundreds. In the context of the ISM, filaments are believed to form by stretching and tearing from magnetized ISM turbulence. ISM filaments are subjected to heating and cooling phases, and are likely to be magnetically aligned. Cold clouds are formed inside ISM due to turbulence instability. This review updates the understanding of ISM filaments in the community.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Track of the GD-1 Stellar Stream Inside a Host with a Fermionic Dark Matter Core-Halo Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional studies on stellar streams typically involve phenomenological $\Lambda$CDM halos or ad hoc dark matter (DM) profiles with different degrees of triaxiality, which preclude to gain insights into the nature and mass of the DM particles. Recently, a Maximum Entropy Principle of halo formation has been applied to provide a DM halo model which incorporates the fermionic (quantum) nature of the particles, while leading to DM profiles which depend on the fermion mass. Such profiles develop a more general dense core - diluted halo morphology able to explain the Galactic rotation curve, while the degenerate fermion core can mimic the central massive black hole (BH). We attempt to model the GD-1 stellar stream using a spherical core-halo DM distribution for the host, which, at the same time, explains the dynamics of the S-cluster stars through its degenerate fermion-core with no central BH. We used two optimization algorithms in order to fit both the initial conditions of the stream orbit and the fermionic model. The stream observables are 5D phase-space data from the Gaia DR2 survey. We were able to find good fits for both the GD-1 stream and the S-stars for a family of fermionic core-halo profiles parameterized by the fermion mass. This work provides evidence that the fermionic profile is a reliable model for both the massive central object and the DM of the Galaxy. Remarkably, this model predicts a total MW mass of $2.3\times 10^{11}M_{\odot}$ which is in agreement with recent mass estimates obtained from Gaia DR3 rotation curves (Gaia RC). In summary, with one single fermionic model for the DM distribution of the MW, we obtain a good fit in three totally different distance scales of the Galaxy: $\sim 10^{-6}$ kpc (central, S-stars), $\sim14$ kpc (mid, GD-1) and $\sim 30$ kpc (boundary, Gaia RC mass estimate).</description>

      <title>Strength in numbers: A multiphase wind model with multiple cloud populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic outflows have a multiphase nature making them challenging to model analytically. Many previous studies have tried to produce models that come closer to reality. In this work, we continue these efforts and describe the interaction of the hot wind fluid with multiple cold cloud populations, with their number density determined by different probability density functions. To do so, we introduced realistic cloud-wind interaction source terms and a time-varying cooling area. We find that the model reproduces well results from small-scale hydrodynamic simulations, but exhibits a general destructive behavior both for a single cloud population as well as multiple ones. We show that including multiple cloud populations can alter the evolution of the wind drastically. We also compare our model to observations and show that the differential acceleration of multiple clouds can lead to a non-negligible velocity `dispersion' relevant for down-the-barrel studies. Furthermore, we compute the emitted cooling surface brightness and find it generally too faint to explain observed Lyman-$\alpha$ halos.</description>

      <title>The recent star formation histories of nearby galaxies on resolved scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies are affected by a variety of factors, both external (field vs. cluster/group) and internal (presence of a bar and AGN, morphological type). In this work, we extend our previous study and apply the &lt;SFR5&gt;/&lt;SFR200&gt; metric to a sample of eleven nearby galaxies with MUSE observations. Based on a combination of H$\alpha$ and UV photometry, &lt;SFR5&gt;/&lt;SFR200&gt; is sensitive to star formation timescales of ~5-200 Myr and therefore measures the present-day rate of change in the star formation rate, dSFR/dt. Within this limited galaxy sample, we do not observe systematic variations between the global value of &lt;SFR5&gt;/&lt;SFR200&gt; and the presence of an active galactic nucleus, stellar bar, nor with group or cluster membership. Within some of the individual galaxies, we however observe significant differences in &lt;SFR5&gt;/&lt;SFR200&gt; between the arm and interarm regions. In half of the galaxies, the recent SFH of both arm and interarm regions has been very similar. However, in the galaxies with higher bulge-to-total light ratios and earlier morphological type, the SFR is declining more rapidly in the interarm regions. This decline in SFR is not a result of low molecular gas surface density or a decrease in the star formation efficiency, implying that other factors are responsible for this SFR decrease.</description>

      <title>Shocks in the Warm Neutral Medium I -- Theoretical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Atomic and molecular line emissions from shocks may provide valuable information on the injection of mechanical energy in the interstellar medium (ISM), the generation of turbulence, and the processes of phase transition between the Warm Neutral Medium (WNM) and the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM).Aims. In this series of papers, we investigate the properties of shocks propagating in the WNM. Our objective is to identify the tracers of these shocks, use them to interpret ancillary observations of the local diffuse matter, and provide predictions for future observations.
  Methods. Shocks propagating in the WNM are studied using the Paris-Durham shock code, a multi-fluid model built to follow the thermodynamical and chemical structures of shock waves, at steady-state, in a plane-parallel geometry. The code, already designed to take into account the impact of an external radiation field, is updated to treat self-irradiated shocks at intermediate ($30&lt;V_S &lt;100$ km s$^{-1}$) and high velocity ($V_S \ge 100$ km s$^{-1}$) which emit ultraviolet (UV), extreme-ultraviolet (EUV), and X-ray photons. The couplings between the photons generated by the shock, the radiative precursor, and the shock structure are computed self-consistently using an exact radiative transfer algorithm for line emission. The resulting code is explored over a wide range of parameters ($0.1 \le n_H \le 2$ cm$^{-3}$, $10 \le V_S \le 500$ km s$^{-1}$, and $0.1 \le B \le 10$ $\mu$G) that covers the typical conditions of the WNM in the solar neighborhood.
  Results. The explored physical conditions are prompt to the existence of a diversity of stationary magnetohydrodynamic solutions, including J-type, CJ-type, and C-type shocks. These shocks are found to naturally induce phase transition between the WNM and the CNM, provided that the postshock thermal pressure is larger than the maximum pressure of the WNM and that the maximum density allowed by magnetic compression is larger than the minimum density of the CNM. The input flux of mechanical energy is primarily reprocessed into line emissions from the X-ray to the submillimeter domain. Intermediate and high velocity shocks are found to generate a UV radiation field that scales as $V_S^3$ for $V_S &lt; 100$ km s$^{-1}$ and as $V_S^2$ at higher velocities, and an X-ray radiation field that scales as $V_S^3$ for $V_S \ge 100$ km s$^{-1}$. Both radiation fields may extend over large distances in the preshock depending of the density of the surrounding medium and the hardness of the X-ray field which is solely driven by the shock velocity.
  Conclusions. This first paper presents the thermochemical trajectories of shocks in the WNM and their associated spectra. It corresponds to a new milestone in the development of the Paris-Durham shock code and a stepping stone for the analysis of observations that will be carried out in forthcoming works.</description>

      <title>Extinction and AGN over host galaxy contrast effects on the optical spectroscopic classification of AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical spectroscopic classification of active galactic nuclei (AGN) into type 1 and type 2 can be understood in the frame of the AGN unification models. However, it remains unclear which physical properties are driving the classification into intermediate sub-types (1.0,1.2,1.5,1.8,1.9). To shed light on this issue, we present an analysis of the effect of extinction and AGN and host galaxy luminosities on sub-type determination for a sample of 159 X-ray selected AGN with a complete and robust optical spectroscopic classification. The sample spans a rest-frame 2 - 10 keV X-ray luminosity range of $10^{42}-10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and redshifts between 0.05 and 0.75. From the fitting of their UV-to-mid-infrared spectral energy distributions, we extracted the observed AGN over total AGN+galaxy contrast, optical/UV line-of-sight extinction as well as host galaxy and AGN luminosities. The observed contrast exhibits a clear decline with sub-type, distinguishing two main groups: 1.0-5 and 1.8-9/2. This difference is partly driven by an increase in extinction following the same trend. Nevertheless, 50% of 1.9s and 2s lack sufficient extinction to explain the lack of detection of broad emission lines, unveiling the necessity of an additional effect. Our findings show that 1.8-9/2s preferentially live in host galaxies with higher luminosities while displaying similar intrinsic AGN luminosities to 1.0-5s. Consequently, the AGN to host galaxy luminosity ratio diminishes, hindering the detection of the emission of the broad emission lines, resulting in the 1.8-9/2 classification of those with insufficient extinction. Thus, the combination of increasing extinction and decreasing AGN/galaxy luminosity ratio, mainly driven by an increasing host galaxy luminosity, constitutes the main reasons behind the sub-type classification into 1.0-5 and 1.8-9/2.</description>

      <title>A Wide Metallicity Range for Gyr-old Stars in the Nuclear Star Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report metallicities for three $\sim$Gyr-old stars in the Milky Way nuclear star cluster (NSC) using high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy. We derive effective temperatures from a calibration with Sc line strength, which yields results in good agreement with other methods, and metallicities from spectral fits to Fe I lines. Our derived metallicities range from -1.2 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; +0.5, a span of 1.7 dex. In addition we use isochrone projection to obtain masses of 1.6 to 4.3 M$_\odot$, and ages assuming single-star evolution. The oldest of these stars is 1.5 Gyr while the youngest and most metal-rich is only 100 Myr. The wide range in metallicity poses interesting questions concerning the chemical evolution and enrichment of the NSC and adds to the evidence for the presence of a young, metal-rich population in the NSC. We suggest that the candidate intermediate-age, metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -1.2) star may be best explained as a blue straggler from an underlying old population.</description>

      <title>The Local Dark Matter Kinematic Substructure Based on LAMOST K Giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations indicate that correlations exist between the velocity distributions of stars and dark matter (DM). We study the local DM velocity distribution based on these correlations. We select K giants from LAMOST DR8 cross-matched with Gaia DR3, which has robust measurements of three-dimensional velocity and metallicity, and separate them into the disk, halo substructure and main halo components in the chemo-dynamical space utilizing the Gaussian Mixture Model. The substructure component is highly radially anisotropic, and possibly related to the Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES) merger event, while the halo component is isotropic and accreted from the earliest mergers following the Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution (Standard Halo Model, SHM). We find that the GES-like substructure contributes $\sim85\%$ of the local non-disk stars in the Solar neighbourhood, which is nearly invariant when applying different volume cuts or additional angular momentum constraints. Utilizing the metallicity-stellar-mass relation and the stellar-mass-halo-mass relation, we find that $\sim25_{-15}^{+24}\%$ of local DM is in the kinematic substructure. Combined with the stellar distributions of non-disk components, we compute the velocity distribution of local DM. The modified heliocentric velocity distribution of local DM shifts to a lower speed and has a sharper peak compared to the SHM, which yields updated detection limits for the DM direct detection experiments. Our work confirms that the local DM velocity distribution deviates from the SHM, and needs to be properly accounted in the DM detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Testing the accuracy of SED modeling techniques using the NIHAO-SKIRT-Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use simulated galaxy observations from the NIHAO-SKIRT-Catalog to test the accuracy of Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) modeling techniques. SED modeling is an essential tool for inferring star-formation histories from nearby galaxy observations, but is fraught with difficulty due to our incomplete understanding of stellar populations, chemical enrichment processes, and the nonlinear, geometry-dependent effects of dust on our observations. The NIHAO-SKIRT-Catalog uses hydrodynamic simulations and radiative transfer to produce SEDs from the ultraviolet (UV) through the infrared (IR), accounting for the effects of dust. We use the commonly used Prospector software to perform inference on these SEDs, and compare the inferred stellar masses and star-formation rates (SFRs) to the known values in the simulation. We match the stellar population models to isolate the effects of differences in the star-formation history, the chemical evolution history, and the dust. We find that the combined effect of model mismatches for high mass ($&gt; 10^{9.5} M_{\odot}$) galaxies leads to inferred SFRs that are on average underestimated by a factor of 2 when fit to UV through IR photometry, and a factor of 3 when fit to UV through optical photometry. These biases lead to significant inaccuracies in the resulting sSFR-mass relations, with UV through optical fits showing particularly strong deviations from the true relation of the simulated galaxies. In the context of massive existing and upcoming photometric surveys, these results highlight that star-formation history inference from photometry remains imprecise and inaccurate, and that there is a pressing need for more realistic testing of existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Intergalactic Lyman-$\alpha$ haloes before reionization are detectable with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $James \ Webb \ Space \ Telescope \ (JWST)$ recently reported a large population of UV luminous galaxies at high redshifts, $ z &gt; 10$, as well as Lyman-$\alpha$ emitting (LAE) galaxies out to $z \sim 11$. We use the observed UV luminosities along with a data-driven approach at lower redshifts to place constraints on the observability of the intergalactic Lyman-$\alpha$ intensity, scattered in the form of Loeb-Rybicki haloes, during the pre-reionization and reionization epochs ($z \sim 9-16$). We forecast the sensitivity and resolution required to detect these intergalactic haloes, finding that individual haloes with LAE luminosities $&gt; 10^{43}$ ergs/s are detectable at a few sigma level at $z \lesssim 11$, while stacking of $\sim 10$ haloes is expected to result in detections out to $z \sim 16$. Finding these haloes is expected to shed light on the neutral intergalactic hydrogen during cosmic reionization.</description>

      <title>On the Pair-Instability Supernova origin of J1010+2358</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first (Pop III) stars formed only out of H and He and were likely more massive than present-day stars. Massive Pop III stars in the range 140-260 M$_\odot$ are predicted to end their lives as pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), enriching the environment with a unique abundance pattern, with high ratios of odd to even elements. Recently, the most promising candidate for a pure descendant of a zero-metallicity massive PISN (260 M$_{\odot}$) was discovered by the LAMOST survey, the star J1010+2358. However, the key elements to verify the high PISN contribution, C and Al, were missing from the analysis. To rectify this, we obtained and analyzed a high-resolution VLT/UVES spectrum, correcting for 3D and/or non-LTE effects. Our measurements of both C and Al give much higher values (~1 dex) than expected from a 260 M$_{\odot}$ PISN. Furthermore, we find significant discrepancies with the previous analysis, and therefore a much less pronounced odd-even effect. Thus, we show that J1010+2358 cannot be a pure descendant of a 260 M$_{\odot}$ PISN. Instead, we find that the best fit model consists of a 13 M$_{\odot}$ Pop II core-collapse supernova combined with a Pop III supernova. Alternative, less favoured solutions $(\chi^2/\chi^2_{\rm best}\approx2.3)$ include a 50% contribution from a 260 M$_{\odot}$ PISN, or a 40% contribution from a Pop III type Ia supernova. Ultimately, J1010+2358 is certainly a unique star giving insights into the earliest chemical enrichment. However, this star has not necessarily obtained any of its metals from a PISN. So the search continues for a concrete proof of the existence of zero-metallicity PISNe.</description>

      <title>The calm before the (next) storm: no third outburst in 2019--2020, and ongoing monitoring of the transient AGN IC 3599</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on follow-up observations of the Seyfert 1.9 galaxy IC 3599 with the NASA Neil Gehrels Swift mission. The detection of a second X-ray outburst in 2010 by Swift after the first discovery of a bright X-ray outburst in 1990 by ROSAT led to the suggestion of two very different explanations: The first one assumed that IC 3599 exhibits outbursts due to repeated partial tidal stripping of a star, predicting another outburst of IC 3599 in 2019/2020. The second, alternative scenario assumed that the event observed in X-rays is due to an accretion disk instability which would suggest a much longer period between the large outbursts. Our continued monitoring campaign by Swift allowed us to test the first scenario which predicted a repetition of high amplitude flaring activity in 2019/2020. We do not find any evidence of dramatic flaring activity with factors of 100 since the last X-ray outburst seen in 2010. These observations support the accretion disk scenario. Further, while IC 3599 remains in low emission states, the long-term X-ray light curve of IC 3599 reveals ongoing strong variability of a factor of a few. The most remarkable event is a mini flare of a factor of 10 in X-rays in December 2022. After that flare, the otherwise supersoft X-ray spectrum shows an exceptional hardening, reminiscent of a temporary corona formation.</description>

      <title>A Panchromatic Study of the X-ray Binary Population in NGC 300 on Sub-Galactic Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The population-wide properties and demographics of extragalactic X-ray binaries (XRBs) correlate with the star formation rates (SFRs), stellar masses ($M_{\star}$), and environmental factors (such as metallicity, $Z$) of their host galaxy. Although there is evidence that XRB scaling relations ($L_X$/SFR for high mass XRBs [HMXBs] and $L_X$/$M_{\star}$ for low mass XRBs [LMXBs]) may depend on metallicity and stellar age across large samples of XRB-hosting galaxies, disentangling the effects of metallicity and stellar age from stochastic effects, particularly on subgalactic scales, remains a challenge. We use archival X-ray through IR observations of the nearby galaxy NGC 300 to self-consistently model the broadband spectral energy distribution and examine radial trends in its XRB population. We measure a current ($&lt;$100 Myr) SFR of 0.18$\pm$0.08 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and $M_{\star}$= $(2.15^{+0.26}_{-0.14})\times10^9$ $M_{\odot}$. Although we measure a metallicity gradient and radially resolved star formation histories that are consistent with the literature, there is a clear excess in the number of X-ray sources below $\sim10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ that are likely a mix of variable XRBs and additional background AGN. When we compare the subgalactic $L_X$/SFR ratios as a function of $Z$ to the galaxy-integrated $L_X$-SFR-$Z$ relationships from the literature, we find that only the regions hosting the youngest ($\lesssim$30 Myr) HMXBs agree with predictions, hinting at time evolution of the $L_X$-SFR-$Z$ relationship.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing \emph{VI} images of NGC 2419 acquired over 17 years, light curves for most of the known variables in the field of the cluster are produced. A cluster membership analysis for about 3100 stars in the cluster field with proper motions from $Gaia$-DR3, revealed the presence of member stars as far as 140 pc from the cluster center and enabled the construction of a cleaner CMD free of field stars. It was found that RRab and RRc stars share the inter-order region in the instability strip, which is unusual for OoII clusters. Theoretical considerations confirm that Pop II cepheids are descendants of extreme ZAHB blue tail stars with very thin envelopes of about 10\% of the total mass. Member RR Lyrae stars were employed to calculate independent estimates of the mean cluster metallicity and distance; we found [Fe/H]$_{\rm UV}= -1.90 \pm 0.27$ and $D=86.3 \pm 5.0$ kpc from the RRab and [Fe/H]$_{\rm UV}= -1.88 \pm 0.30$ and $D=83.1 \pm 8.1$ kpc from the RRc light curves.</description>

      <title>Cool-core, X-ray cavities and cold front revealed in RXCJ0352.9+1941 cluster by Chandra and GMRT observations</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of 30 ks Chandra and 46.8 ks (13 Hr) 1.4 GHz GMRT radio data on the cool-core cluster RXCJ0352.9+1941 with an objective to investigate AGN activities at its core. This study confirms a pair of X-ray cavities at projected distances of about 10.30 kpc and 20.80 kpc, respectively, on the NW and SE of the X-ray peak. GMRT L band (1.4 GHz) data revealed a bright radio source associated with the core of this cluster hosting multiple jet-like emissions. The spatial association of the X-ray cavities with the inner pair of radio jets confirm their origin due to AGN outbursts. The 1.4 GHz radio power ${\rm 7.4 \pm 0.8 \times 10^{39} \, erg\, s^{-1}}$ is correlated with the mechanical power stored in the X-ray cavities ($\sim7.90\times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$), implying that the power injected by radio jets in the ICM is sufficient enough to offset the radiative losses. The X-shaped morphology of diffuse radio emission seems to be comprised of two pairs of orthogonal radio jets, likely formed due to a spin-flip of jets due to the merger of two systems. The X-ray surface brightness analysis of the ICM in its environment revealed two non-uniform, extended spiral-like emission structures on either side of the core, pointing towards the sloshing of gas due to a minor merger and might have resulted in a cold front at $\sim$31 arcsec (62 kpc) with a temperature jump of 1.44 keV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Understanding the connection between outflows, winds, accretion and disks in the inner protostellar regions is crucial for comprehending star and planet formation process. Aims. We aim to we explore the inner 300 au of the protostar IRAS 4A2 as part of the ALMA FAUST Large Program. Methods. We analysed the kinematical structures of SiO and CH$_3$OH emission with 50 au resolution. Results. The emission arises from three zones: i) a very compact and unresolved region ($&lt;$50 au) dominated by the ice sublimation zone, at $\pm$1.5 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to vsys, traced by methanol; ii) an intermediate region (between 50 au and 150 au) traced by both SiO and CH$_3$OH, between 2 and 6 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to vsys, with an inverted velocity gradient (with respect to the large scale emission), whose origin is not clear; iii) an extended region ($&gt;$150 au) traced by SiO, above 7 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to vsys, and dominated by the outflow. In the intermediate region we estimated a CH$_3$OH/SiO abundance ratio of about 120-400 and a SiO/H$_2$ abundance of 10$^{-8}$. We explored various possibilities to explain the origin of this region such as, rotating disk/inner envelope, jet on the plane of the sky/precessing, wide angle disk wind. Conclusions. We propose that CH$_3$OH and SiO in the inner 100 au probe the base of a wide-angle disk wind. The material accelerated in the wind crosses the plane of the sky, giving rise to the observed inverted velocity gradient, and sputtering the grain mantles and cores releasing CH$_3$OH and SiO. This is the first detection of a disk wind candidate in SiO, and the second ever in CH$_3$OH.</description>

      <title>Plasmoid Instability in the Multiphase Interstellar Medium</title>

Abstract: The processes controlling the complex clump structure, phase distribution, and magnetic field geometry that develops across a broad range of scales in the turbulent interstellar medium remains unclear. Using unprecedentedly high resolution three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of thermally unstable turbulent systems, we show that large current sheets unstable to plasmoid-mediated reconnection form regularly throughout the volume. The plasmoids form in three distinct environments: (i) within cold clumps, (ii) at the asymmetric interface of the cold and warm phases, and (iii) within the warm, volume-filling phase. We then show that the complex magneto-thermal phase structure is characterized by a predominantly highly magnetized cold phase, but that regions of high magnetic curvature, which are the sites of reconnection, span a broad range in temperature. Furthermore, we show that thermal instabilities change the scale dependent anisotropy of the turbulent magnetic field, reducing the increase in eddy elongation at smaller scales. Finally, we show that most of the mass is contained in one contiguous cold structure surrounded by smaller clumps that follow a scale free mass distribution. These clumps tend to be highly elongated and exhibit a size versus internal velocity relation consistent with supersonic turbulence, and a relative clump distance-velocity scaling consistent with subsonic motion. We discuss the striking similarity of cold plasmoids to observed tiny scale atomic and ionized structures and HI fibers, and consider how the prevalence of plasmoids will modify the motion of charged particles thereby impacting cosmic ray transport and thermal conduction in the ISM and other similar systems.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Cosmic Black Hole Growth and Mass Distribution from Quasar Luminosity Functions at $z&gt;4$: Implications for Faint and Low-mass Populations in JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of the quasar luminosity function (QLF) is fundamental to understanding the cosmic evolution of black holes (BHs) through their accretion phases. In the era of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), Euclid, and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, their unprecedented detection sensitivity and wide survey area can unveil the low-luminosity quasar and low-mass BH population, and provide new insights into quasar host galaxies. We present a theoretical model describing BH growth from initial seeding at $z&gt;20$ to $z\sim 4$,incorporating the duration of accretion episodes, the distribution of Eddington ratios, and the mass dependency of BH accretion rates. By constraining the model parameters with the observed QLFs at $4\leq z\leq6$ across a wide UV luminosity range ($-29&lt;M_{\rm 1450}&lt;-24$), we find that the high-redshift BH population grows rapidly at $z\gtrsim6$, and decelerates the pace in subsequent epochs. Toward lower redshifts ($z&lt;6$), mass-dependent accretion inhibits the growth of high-mass BHs with $M_{\bullet}&gt;10^8~M_\odot$, leading to mass saturation at $M_\bullet\gtrsim 10^{10}~M_\odot$. We predict the BH mass function down to $M_{\bullet}\sim 10^6~M_\odot$ for both unobscured and obscured quasar populations at $4\leq z \leq 11$, offering a benchmark for future observational tests. Our model accounts for the presence of both bright and faint quasars at $z&gt;4$, including those discovered by JWST. Furthermore, our findings suggest two distinct pathways for the early assembly of the BH-galaxy mass correlation: the population with a BH-to-stellar mass ratio near the local value of $M_\bullet/M_{\star}\simeq5\times10^{-3}$ maintains a proximity to the relation through its evolution via moderate growth, while the population that begins to grow above the local relation accretes mass rapidly and becomes as overmassive as $M_\bullet/M_\star \sim 0.01-0.1$ by $z\sim 6$.</description>

      <title>Most of the photons that reionized the Universe came from dwarf galaxies</title>

Abstract: The identification of sources driving cosmic reionization, a major phase transition from neutral Hydrogen to ionized plasma around 600-800 Myr after the Big Bang (Dayal et al. 2018, Mason et al. 2019, Robertson et al. 2022), has been a matter of intense debate (Robertson et al. 2022). Some models suggest that high ionizing emissivity and escape fractions ($f_{\rm esc}$) from quasars support their role in driving cosmic reionization (Madau &amp; Haardt 2015, Mitra et al. 2018). Others propose that the high $f_{\rm esc}$ values from bright galaxies generates sufficient ionizing radiation to drive this process (Naidu et al. 2020). Finally, a few studies suggest that the number density of faint galaxies, when combined with a stellar-mass-dependent model of ionizing efficiency and $f_{\rm esc}$, can effectively dominate cosmic reionization (Finkelstein et al. 2019, Dayal et al. 2020). However, so far, low-mass galaxies have eluded comprehensive spectroscopic studies owing to their extreme faintness. Here we report an analysis of eight ultra-faint galaxies (in a very small field) during the epoch of reionization with absolute magnitudes between $M_{\rm UV}$ $\sim -17$ to $-15$ mag (down to 0.005 $L^{\star}$. We find that faint galaxies during the Universe's first billion years produce ionizing photons with log($\xi_{\mathrm{ion}}$/ Hz erg$^{-1}$) =$25.80\pm 0.14$, a factor of 4 higher than commonly assumed values (Robertson et al. 2015). If this field is representative of the large scale distribution of faint galaxies, the rate of ionizing photons exceeds that needed for reionization, even for escape fractions of order five per cent.</description>

      <title>The viability of low-mass subhaloes as targets for gamma-ray dark matter searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the discovery potential of low-mass Galactic dark matter (DM) subhaloes for indirect searches of DM. We use data from the Via Lactea II (VL-II) N-body cosmological simulation, which resolves subhaloes down to $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ solar masses and it is thus ideal for this purpose. First, we characterize the abundance, distribution and structural properties of the VL-II subhalo population in terms of both subhalo masses and maximum circular velocities. Then, we repopulate the original simulation with millions of subhaloes of masses down to about five orders of magnitude below the minimum VL-II subhalo mass (more than one order of magnitude in velocities). We compute subhalo DM annihilation astrophysical "J-factors" and angular sizes for the entire subhalo population, by placing the Earth at a random position but at the right galactocentric distance in the simulation. Thousands of these realizations are generated in order to obtain statistically meaningful results. We find that some nearby low-mass Galactic subhaloes, not massive enough to retain stars or gas, may indeed yield DM annihilation fluxes comparable to those expected from other, more massive and acknowledgeable DM targets like dwarf satellite galaxies. Typical angular sizes are of the order of the degree, thus subhaloes potentially appearing as extended sources in gamma-ray telescopes, depending on instrument angular resolution and sensitivity. Our work shows that low-mass Galactic subhaloes with no visible counterparts are expected to play a relevant role in current and future indirect DM search searches and should indeed be considered as excellent DM targets.</description>

      <title>Final Results of Search for New Milky Way Satellites in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program Survey: Discovery of Two More Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the final results of our search for new Milky Way (MW) satellites using the data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program (SSP) survey over $\sim 1,140$ deg$^2$. In addition to three candidates that we already reported, we have identified two new MW satellite candidates in the constellation of Sextans at a heliocentric distance of $D_{\odot} \simeq 126$kpc, and Virgo at $D_{\odot} \simeq 151$kpc, named Sextans II and Virgo III, respectively. Their luminosities (Sext II:$M_V\simeq-3.9$mag; Vir III:$M_V\simeq-2.7$mag) and half-light radii (Sext II:$r_h\simeq154$ pc; Vir III:$r_h\simeq 44$ pc) place them in the region of size-luminosity space of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs). Including four previously known satellites, there are a total of nine satellites in the HSC-SSP footprint. This discovery rate of UFDs is much higher than that predicted from the recent models for the expected population of MW satellites in the framework of cold dark matter models, thereby suggesting that we encounter a too many satellites problem. Possible solutions to settle this tension are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Energy self-extraction of a Kerr black hole with the force-free magnetosphere frame-dragged</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that the zero-angular-momentum-observers (ZAMOs) circulating with the frame-dragging-angular-velocity $\omega$ plays a leading part in energy extraction. When the condition $\Omega_{\rm F}&lt;\Omega_{\rm H}$ is satisfied, where $\Omega_{\rm H}$ and $\Omega_{\rm F}$ are the horizon and field-line (FL) angular-velocities (AVs), they will see that the null surface S$_{\rm N}$ with $\omega_{\rm N}=\Omega_{\rm F}$ always exists in the force-free magnetosphere.
  Denoting the ZAMO-measured FLAV with $\Omega_{{\rm F}\omega} \equiv \Omega_{\rm F} - \omega$, this surface S$_{\rm N}$ where $\Omega_{{\rm F}\omega}=0$ defines the gravito-magneto-centrifugal divider of the magnetosphere, with a kind of plasma-shed on it. The outer domain ${D}_{\rm (out)}$ outside S$_{\rm N}$ spins forward ($\Omega_{{\rm F}\omega}&gt;0$), whereas the inner domain ${D}_{\rm (in)}$ inside spins backward ($\Omega_{{\rm F}\omega}&lt;0$).
  The force-free and freezing-in conditions break down on S$_{\rm N}$, thereby allowing the particle-current sources to be set up on S$_{\rm N}$. Because the electric field ${\bf E}_{\rm p}$ reverses direction there, the Poynting flux reverses direction as well from outward to inward, though the positive angular momentum always flows outwardly.
  Electromagnetic self-extraction of energy will be possible only through the frame-dragged magnetosphere, with the inner domain ${D}_{\rm (in)}$ nested between the horizon and the surface S$_{\rm N}$, in order to comply with the 1st and 2nd laws of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Small-scale dynamo with nonzero correlation time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The small-scale dynamo is typically studied by assuming that the correlation time of the velocity field is zero. Some authors have used a smooth renovating flow model to study how the properties of the dynamo are affected by the correlation time being nonzero. Here, we assume the velocity is an incompressible Gaussian random field (which need not be smooth), and derive the lowest-order corrections to the evolution equation for the two-point correlation of the magnetic field in Fourier space. Using this, we obtain the evolution equation for the longitudinal correlation function of the magnetic field ($M_L$) in nonhelical turbulence, valid for arbitrary Prandtl number. The non-resistive terms of this equation do not contain spatial derivatives of $M_L$ of order greater than two. We further simplify this equation in the limit of high Prandtl number, and find that the growth rate of the magnetic energy is much smaller than previously reported. Nevertheless, the magnetic power spectrum still retains the Kazantsev form at high Prandtl number.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Ages of Galaxies with an Artificial Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new method of predicting the ages of galaxies using a machine learning (ML) algorithm with the goal of providing an alternative to traditional methods. We aim to match the ability of traditional models to predict the ages of galaxies by training an artificial neural network (ANN) to recognise the relationships between the equivalent widths of spectral indices and the mass-weighted ages of galaxies estimated by the MAGPHYS model in data release 3 (DR3) of the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. We discuss the optimisation of our hyperparameters extensively and investigate the application of a custom loss function to reduce the influence of errors in our input data. To quantify the quality of our predictions we calculate the mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and R^2 score for which we find MSE = 0.020, MAE = 0.108 and R^2 = 0.530. We find our predicted ages have a similar distribution with standard deviation sigma_p = 0.182 compared with the GAMA true ages sigma_t = 0.207. This is achieved in approximately 23s to train our ANN on an 11th Gen Intel Core i9-11900H running at 2.50GHz using 32GB of RAM. We report our results for when light-weighted ages are used to train the ANN, which improves the accuracy of the predictions. Finally, we detail an evaluation of our method relating to physical properties and compare with other ML techniques to encourage future applications of ML techniques in Astronomy.</description>

      <title>On the universal validity of Case B recombination theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an ongoing search for low-mass extreme emission line galaxies, we identified a galaxy with a Ha/Hb Balmer line ratio of 2.620 +- 0.078. Ha/Hb Balmer ratios lower than the dust-free Case~B value appear relatively frequently in extreme emission line galaxies. These low values suggest that the Case~B assumption may not be valid in these objects. After ruling out the possibility that the low Ha/Hb ratio is due to systematic errors introduced by observational effects, we use constraints from the total Hb luminosity, the [OIII]/[OII] line ratio and the Balmer line equivalent widths, to suggest that the gas is optically thick to both Ha and Lya photons, and the geometry and orientation of the scattering gas causes Ha photons to be preferentially removed from the line of sight with respect to higher order Balmer series photons. Finally, we use data from the SDSS survey to show that Balmer self-absorption may be more important than previously assumed in high excitation emission line galaxies, where Lya pumping of the hydrogen excited state can be effective. If not recognized, Balmer self-absorption could lead to inaccurate estimates of galaxy physical properties. As an example, the effect of dust extinction could be over-estimated, for spherically symmetric scattering medium, or under-estimated, for a not spherically-symmetric distribution.</description>

      <title>A Young Super Star Cluster Powering a Nebula of Retained Massive Star Ejecta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We suggest that "Godzilla", an intriguing source in the lensed Sunburst galaxy at $z=2.37$, is a young super star cluster powering a compact nebula within gravitationally trapped stellar ejecta. Employing HST photometry and spectroscopy from MUSE and X-Shooter at VLT, we infer physical and chemical properties of the cluster and nebula, finding Godzilla is young (4-6 Myr), massive ($\sim 10^{6-7}M_\odot$), a stellar metallicity $Z \simeq 0.25Z_\odot$, and has the FUV component more compact than a few pc. The nebula gas is significantly enriched with N and He, indicating stellar wind material, and has highly elevated O relative to the sub-solar stellar metallicity, which indicates entrainment of CCSNe ejecta. The high gas density $n_{\rm e} \simeq 10^{7-8}{\rm cm}^{-3}$ implies a highly pressurized intracluster environment. We propose the high pressure is due to CCSN-driven supersonic turbulence in warm, self-shielding gas, which has accumulated in the cluster center after runaway radiative cooling and is dense enough to resist removal by CCSNe. The nebula gas shows sub-solar C/O, Ne/O and Si/O values, which may reflect the CCSN element yields for initial stellar masses $&gt;40M_\odot$. A comparison to element yield synthesis models for young star clusters shows that the gas abundance pattern is consistent with complete retention and mixture of stellar winds and CCSNe ejecta until the inferred cluster age. The O and He enhancement we find may have implications for the formation of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters, as Godzilla likely has already formed second-generation stars prior to the onset of CCSNe and evolved star winds, in order not to contradict the non-observation of O and large He enhancement in second-generation stars.</description>

      <title>Dark supernova remnant buried in the Galactic-Centre "Brick" G0.253+0.016 revealed by an expanding CO-line bubble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We performed a 12CO and 13CO-line study of the "Brick" (G0.253+0.016) in the Galactic Centre (GC) by analyzing archival data obtained with the Nobeyama 45-m telescope. We present kinematics and molecular gas distributions in the longitude-velocity diagram, and suggest that the Brick is located along the GC Arm I in the central molecular zone (CMZ), which yields a distance from the Sun of 8 kpc and galacto-centric distance of 0.2 kpc. The major and minor-axis diameters of the Brick are $D_x\times D_y=8.4 {\rm pc} \times 4.1 {\rm epc}$ at position angle of $40\deg$ and $130\deg$, respectively, and the scale radius is $r_{\rm brick}=\sqrt{D_x D_y}=2.96$ pc. The molecular mass inferred from the 12CO-line integrated intensity is $M_{\rm bri,xco}\sim 5.1\times 10^4 M_\odot$ for a conversion factor $X_{\rm CO}=1.0\times 10^{20}$ H$_2$ cm$^{-2}$ [K km/s]$^{-1}$. On the other hand, the dynamical (Virial) mass for the measured velocity dispersion of $\sigma_v=10.0 $ km/s is calculated to be $M_{\rm bri,vir}\sim 6.8 \times 10^4M_\odot$, which yields a new conversion factor of $X_{\rm CO} =1.3\times 10^{20}$ H$_2$ cm$^{-2}$ [K km/s]${-1}$. The Brick's center has a cavity surrounded by a spherical molecular bubble of radius $r_{\rm bub}=1.85$ pc and mass $\sim 1.7\times 10^4M_\odot$ expanding at $v_{\rm exp}\simeq 10 $ km/s with kinetic energy of $E_0\sim 1.7\times 10^{49}$ erg. If the bubble is approximated by an adiabatic spherical shock wave, the age is estimated to be $t\sim 2/5 r_{\rm bub}/v_{\rm exp}\sim 7.2\times 10^4$ y. Neither non-thermal radio structures nor thermal radio emission indicative of HII region are found in the archival data from the MeerKAT. We suggest that the molecular bubble will be a dark supernova remnant buried in the Brick, which, therefore, has experienced in the past ($\sim 0.1$ Myr ago) massive-star formation with a supernova explosion.</description>

Abstract: The mass ($M_\mathrm{BH}$) of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) can be measured using spatially-resolved kinematics of the region where the SMBH dominates gravitationally. The most reliable measurements are those that resolve the smallest physical scales around the SMBHs. We consider here three metrics to compare the physical scales probed by kinematic tracers dominated by rotation: the radius of the innermost detected kinematic tracer $R_\mathrm{min}$ normalised by respectively the SMBH's Schwarzschild radius ($R_\mathrm{Schw}\equiv 2GM_\mathrm{BH}/c^2$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $c$ the speed of light), sphere-of-influence (SOI) radius ($R_\mathrm{SOI}\equiv GM_\mathrm{BH}/\sigma_\mathrm{e}^2$, where $\sigma_\mathrm{e}$ is the stellar velocity dispersion within the galaxy's effective radius) and equality radius [the radius $R_\mathrm{eq}$ at which the SMBH mass equals the enclosed stellar mass, $M_\mathrm{BH}=M_*(R_\mathrm{eq})$, where $M_*(R)$ is the stellar mass enclosed within the radius $R$]. All metrics lead to analogous simple relations between $R_\mathrm{min}$ and the highest circular velocity probed $V_\mathrm{c}$. Adopting these metrics to compare the SMBH mass measurements using molecular gas kinematics to those using megamaser kinematics, we demonstrate that the best molecular gas measurements resolve material that is physically closer to the SMBHs in terms of $R_\mathrm{Schw}$ but is slightly farther in terms of $R_\mathrm{SOI}$ and $R_\mathrm{eq}$. However, molecular gas observations of nearby galaxies using the most extended configurations of the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array can resolve the SOI comparably well and thus enable SMBH mass measurements as precise as the best megamaser measurements.</description>

      <title>The Black-Hole Masses of High-Redshift QSOs</title>

Abstract: Observations of high-redshift quasars frequently promote suggestions of large black hole masses, whose presence so early in cosmic time is not easily explicable. I consider the parallel with ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) -- now known to be stellar-mass black hole (and neutron star) binaries apparently radiating far above their Eddington luminosities $L_{\rm Edd}$. The true luminosity in ULXs is actually only of order $L_{\rm Edd}$, for {\it stellar-mass} accretors, but has a very anisotropic (`beamed') component, plus a near-isotropic component of similar luminosity but much lower specific intensity. Observers viewing ULXs from within the beam but assuming spherical symmetry deduce a luminosity $\gg L_{\rm Edd}$. These features appear because the accretors are fed mass at highly super-Eddington rates, most of it expelled in high-speed ($v &gt;0.2c$) outflows from the accretion disc.
  I show that in similarly-beamed AGN, emission-line properties would be essentially the same as in unbeamed sources, but standard virial mass indicators unusable because velocity widths are dominated by the outflows, not bound motions about the black holes. In an ensemble of this kind the apparently most luminous systems are always the most distant, but have the lowest black hole masses. Interpreting observations of this ensemble without knowing that they are beamed leads instead to very high black hole mass estimates. The analogy with ULXs therefore suggests that high-redshift quasars might actually have central black hole masses which could have grown from stellar values within the lookback time. I consider how one might test these ideas observationally.</description>

      <title>Low surface brightness galaxies from BASS+MzLS with Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: From $\sim$ 5000 deg$^{2}$ of the combination of the Beijing-Arizona Sky Survey (BASS) and Mayall $z$-band Legacy Survey (MzLS) which is also the northern sky region of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Surveys, we selected a sample of 31,825 candidates of low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs) with the mean effective surface brightness 24.2 $&lt; \bar{\mu}_{\rm eff,g} &lt;$ 28.8 mag arcsec$^{\rm -2}$ and the half-light radius 2.5$^{\prime\prime}$ $&lt; r_{\rm eff} &lt;$ 20$^{\prime\prime}$ based on the released photometric catalogue and the machine learning model. The distribution of the LSBGs is of bimodality in the $g$ - $r$ color, indicating the two distinct populations of the blue ($g$ - $r &lt;$ 0.60) and the red ($g$ - $r &gt;$ 0.60) LSBGs. The blue LSBGs appear spiral, disk or irregular while the red LSBGs are spheroidal or ellipitcal and spatially clustered. This trend shows that the color has a strong correlation with galaxy morphology for LSBGs. In the spatial distribution, the blue LSBGs are more uniformly distributed while the red ones are highly clustered, indicating that red LSBGs preferentially populated denser environment than the blue LSBGs. Besides, both populations have consistent distribution of ellipticity (median $\epsilon\sim$ 0.3), half-light radius (median $r_{\rm eff} \sim$ 4$^{\prime\prime}$), and Sersic index (median $n$ = 1), implying the dominance of the full sample by the round and disk galaxies. This sample has definitely extended the studies of LSBGs to a regime of lower surface brightness, fainter magnitude, and broader other properties than the previously SDSS-based samples.</description>
