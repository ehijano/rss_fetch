      <title>Super-resolution of two Closely-spaced Electromagnetic Fields via Walsh-Modulated Dynamical Decoupling Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to quantum fluctuations, non-orthogonal quantum states cannot be distinguished with complete certainty, making their underlying physical parameters difficult to resolve. Traditionally, it has been believed that the linewidth of a system behaves like these quantum fluctuations to set the ultimate limit on frequency resolution as two oscillating electromagnetic fields are applied. Consequently, the measurement time required to resolve a frequency difference $\Delta \omega$ was assumed to diverge as $\Delta \omega \rightarrow 0$. Here, we show that linewidth does not play a defining role in resolving two closely spaced frequencies. Instead, the ultimate limit is set by parameter-independent quantum fluctuations, such as shot noise in our case. We propose and experimentally demonstrate the first general broadband protocol for super-resolution spectroscopy. Specifically, our protocol uses a Walsh-modulated dynamical decoupling (WMDD) sequence to encode $\Delta \omega$ between two unknown tones into a quantum state. This leverages phase information to suppress parameter-independent shot noise, thereby enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio and enabling super-resolution spectroscopy. With this approach, we resolve two randomly chosen oscillating electric fields of order 100 MHz separated by 5 Hz, with a measured frequency difference of 5.0(1.6) Hz using a measurement time per run of just 1 ms, representing an improvement of 200 beyond the traditional resolution limit. As such, our technique accelerates data acquisition by more than $10^5$ magnitude compared to conventional methods. Crucially, as our protocol is rooted in the motional Raman (quantum vector signal analyzer) framework, it is effective across an arbitrary frequency range and thus promises to enhance broadband sensing of electromagnetic fields and improve spectral efficiency of next-generation communication systems.</description>

      <title>Experimental cross sections for K-shell ionization by electron impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive compilation of experimental K-shell ionization cross sections induced by electron impact has been assembled, including results up to December 2024. The data are organized according to the target atomic number and to the incident electron energy for elements ranging from H to U. From the 2509 reported data, more than 50% pertain only to 8 elements (H, He, Ar, Cr, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Ag). Conversely, 13 elements have only one or two results, and no data is available for 27 elements in the range of atomic numbers considered. Additionally, a further inspection of the database reveals that the majority of the data is concentrated within a small energy range, spanning up to four times the K-shell ionization energy. Finally, the different methods used to measure the ionization cross section are analyzed and a discussion about the main sources of uncertainties is presented.</description>

      <title>Dynamically-decoupled hyper-Ramsey spectroscopy of optical clock transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyper-Ramsey protocols have been successfully implemented on ultra-narrow optical clock transitions to reduce systematic frequency-shifts induced by AC-Stark shift and amplitude pulse variation. However, the compensation remains imperfect against laser probe intensity fluctuation, decoherence and unsuited for external quasi-static or low frequency noise perturbations. Here, we address these limitations by employing dynamical-decoupling methods composed by multiple rotary Hahn-echo pulses toggling probe frequency detunings between opposite signs during interrogating laser pulses. Time-optimized Uhrig sequences of refocusing pulses produce highly contrasted and robust hyper-Ramsey interferences against low-frequency noise distortions caused by environmental factors and imperfections in the probe parameters. Dynamically-decoupled SU(2) hyper-clocks pave the way to universal noise-resilient quantum sensors, unveiling fault-tolerant quantum metrology to track fundamental symmetries and search for new physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity Enhancement in Atom-Interferometer Gyroscopes via Phase-Modulation Signal Readout Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensors based on atom interferometers are advancing both fundamental physics and practical applications, with higher sensitivity being a key requirement for these investigations. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a sensitivity enhancement of an atom-interferometer gyroscope using a phase-modulation signal readout scheme. Phase modulation applied to the laser light used for atomic state manipulation is transferred to the atomic phase and read out via multi-harmonic demodulation. The observed sensitivity improvement factor of $1.20\pm0.04$ over the conventional phase sweep scheme agrees with theoretical predictions. We also found that phase-dispersion compensation control, which compensates atomic velocity dispersion and preserves interference contrast at high angular rates, effectively eliminates the nonlinearity inherent in multi-harmonic demodulation. The sensitivity improvement achieved by our method is applicable to a broad class of atom interferometers and requires no modifications to the optical or vacuum systems, making it particularly effective for size-constrained applications such as large-baseline experiments and inertial navigation systems.</description>

      <title>Elimination of angular dependency in quantum three-body problem made easy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A straightforward technique is presented to eliminate the angular dependency in a nonrelativistic quantum three-body system. Solid bipolar spherical harmonics are used as the angular basis. A correspondence relation between minimal bipolar spherical harmonics and the Wigner functions $\mathcal{D}$ is reported. This relation simplifies the evaluation of angular matrix elements compared to prior methods. A closed form of an angular matrix element is presented. The resulting radial equations are suitable for numerical estimation of the energy eigenvalues for arbitrary angular momentum and space parity states. The reported relations are validated through accurate numerical estimation of energy eigenvalues within the framework of the Ritz-variational principle using an explicitly correlated multi-exponent Hylleraas-type basis for $L=0$ to $7$ natural and for $L=1$ to $4$ unnatural space parity states of the helium atom. The results show a good agreement with the best reported values.</description>

      <title>Lamb-Dicke Dynamics of Interacting Rydberg Atoms Coupled to the Motion of an Optical Tweezer Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays provide a platform for quantum simulation and computation. In this work, we investigate the Lamb-Dicke dynamics of coupled Rydberg atoms for different trapping frequencies. We model the atomic motion by both internal and motional degrees of freedom, in which the motional states arise due to the oscillation of each atom in optical tweezer traps due to the light-atom interaction. In this setup, the internal states are coupled to a laser light with a Rabi frequency, while each internal state of each atom is also harmonically trapped with a trap frequency that depends on the internal state. The impact of the coherent motion of the optical tweezers on the collective dynamics of the many-body Rydberg atoms is explored for varying Lamb-Dicke parameters and with different trap frequencies. We see the occurrence of dynamical phases e.g., Rabi oscillations in the decoupled limit, the limit torus phase for magic trapping, and the limit cycle phase as the trap frequency is further increased.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical nuclear electric resonance (ONER) was recently proposed as a fast and robust single-qubit gate mechanism in $^{87}$Sr. Here, we demonstrate that ONER enables purely optical single-qudit control, addressing multiple hyperfine ground-state transitions within the ten-dimensional nuclear spin manifold. We show that ONER achieves high-fidelity spin manipulations, exceeding fidelities of 99.9%, while maintaining coherence even under realistic noise sources. These results establish ONER as a scalable and experimentally viable platform for high-dimensional quantum computing and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Phase amplitude separation of wave function as local gauge transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum-mechanical wave function is complex, but all observations are real, expressible through expectation values and transition matrix elements that involve the wave functions. It can be useful to separate at the outset the amplitude and phase as real quantities that together carry the same information that is contained in the complex wave function. Two main avenues for doing so go way back in the history of the subject and have been used both for scattering and bound states. A connection is made here to gauge transformations of electrodynamics where the advent of quantum mechanics and later quantum field theory showed the central role that local gauge transformations play in physics.</description>

      <title>Multi-plateau high-harmonic generation in liquids driven by off-site recombination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-perturbative high-harmonic generation (HHG) has recently been observed in the liquid phase, where it was demonstrated to have a different physical mechanism compared to gas and solid phases of matter. The currently best physical picture for liquid HHG eliminates scattered-electron contributions and identifies on-site recombination as the dominant contributor. This mechanism accurately predicts the cut-off energy and its independence of the driving laser wavelength and intensity. However, this implies that additional energy absorbed in the liquid as the driving laser intensity is increased does not result in higher-order non-linearities, which is in contrast to the conventional expectation from most nonlinear media. Here we experimentally observe the formation of a second plateau in HHG from multiple liquids (water, heavy water, propranol, and ethanol), thus explaining the conundrum of the missing higher-order response. We analyze this second plateau with a combination of experimental, state-of-the-art ab-initio numerical (in diverse systems of water, ammonia, and liquid methane), and semi-classical analytical, techniques, and elucidate its physical origin to electrons that recombine on neighboring water molecules rather than at the ionization site, leading to unique HHG ellipticity dependence. Remarkably, we find that the second plateau is dominated by electrons recombining at the second solvation shell, relying on wide hole delocalization. Theory also predicts the appearance of even higher plateaus, indicating a general trend. Our work establishes new physical phenomena in the highly non-linear optical response of liquids, paving the way to attosecond probing of electron dynamics in solutions.</description>

      <title>Phase-Space Topology in a Single-Atom Synthetic Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24020v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate topological features in the synthetic Fock-state lattice of a single-atom system described by the quantum Rabi model. By diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, we identify a zero-energy defect state localized at a domain wall of the synthetic lattice, whose spin polarization is topologically protected. To address the challenge of applying band topology to the Fock-state lattice, we introduce a topological invariant based on phase-space geometry-the phase-space winding number. We show that the Zak phase, representing the geometric phase difference between two sublattices, can also be computed using a phase-space parameter and corresponds directly to the phase-space winding number. This quantized geometric phase reflects the spin polarization of the defect state, demonstrating a bulk-boundary correspondence. The resulting phase-space topology reveals the emergence of single-atom dressed states with contrasting properties-topologically protected fermionic states and driving-tunable bosonic states. Our results establish phase-space topology as a novel framework for exploring topological physics in single-atom synthetic dimensions, uncovering quantum-unique topological protection distinct from classical analogs.</description>

      <title>Quantum channel for modeling spin-motion dephasing in Rydberg chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum channel to model the dissipative dynamics resulting from the coupling between spin and motional degrees of freedom in chains of neutral atoms with Rydberg interactions. The quantum channel acts on the reduced spin state obtained under the frozen gas approximation, modulating its elements with time-dependent coefficients. These coefficients can be computed exactly in the perturbative regime, enabling efficient modeling of spin-motion dephasing in systems too large for exact methods. We benchmark the accuracy of our approach against exact diagonalization for small systems, identifying its regime of validity and the onset of perturbative breakdown. We then apply the quantum channel to compute fidelity loss during transport of single-spin excitations across extended Rydberg chains in regimes intractable via exact diagonalization. By revealing the quantum-classical crossover, these results establish a bound on the maximum chain length for efficient entanglement distribution. The quantum channel significantly reduces the complexity of simulating spin dynamics coupled to motional degrees of freedom, providing a practical tool for estimating the impact of spin-motion coupling in near-term experiments with Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02278v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the realization and characterization of a novel magic-wavelength nanofiber-based two-color optical dipole trap for cesium that allows us to generate two diametral periodic one-dimensional arrays of trapping sites with a spacing significantly smaller than half the resonant free-space wavelength of the cesium D2 transition. This is achieved by launching a blue-detuned partial standing wave and two red-detuned light fields through the nanofiber. We trap and optically interface the atoms in the resulting periodic optical potential and characterize the trap by measuring the lifetime of the trapped atoms, the atom-light coupling strength, the filling factor, and the trap frequencies in the radial and axial directions. The implementation of this nanofiber-based optical interface with magic trapping wavelengths and sub-$\lambda/2$ spacing is an important step towards the exploration of novel collective radiative effects, such as selective radiance.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Approach for Strong Field QED Tests with He-like Ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04423v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detailed comparisons between theory and experiment for quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects in He-like ions have been performed in the literature to search for hints of new physics. Different frequentist statistical analyses of the existing atomic transition energy data have shown contradictory conclusions as to the presence of possible deviations from the theory predictions. We present here an approach using Bayesian statistics which allows to assign quantitative probabilities to the different deviation models from theory for He-like ions for $Z = 5$ to 92. Potential deviations beyond the standard model or higher order QED effects are modeled with $f(Z) \propto Z^k$ functions. Considering the currently available data, no significant difference between theory and experiment is found, and we show that recent experiments have reduced the possible deviations previously observed in the literature. Using past measurements and a weighted average on the different deviation models, we indicate the accuracy required for future measurements to investigated possible divergences.</description>

      <title>Subwavelength micromachined vapor-cell based Rydberg sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, micromachined vapor cells have been revolutionizing the field of chip-scale quantum sensors such as magnetometers and atomic clocks. In parallel, Rydberg atomic quantum sensing has emerged as a powerful technique for broadband, non-invasive and ultra-sensitive electrometry. Yet, to date, Rydberg sensing has largely been limited to glass-blown, centimeter-scale vapor cells. Here, we perform Rydberg spectroscopy using a wafer-scale fabricated Pyrex-Si-Pyrex cell with millimeter-scale dimensions. The Rydberg spectroscopic line is characterized with respect to critical parameters such as temperature, the frequency and amplitude of the applied radiofrequency field, light intensity, and the spatial position of the interrogating beam. Our study reveals lineshapes directly influenced by a complex landscape of electrostatic fields with values up to approximately 0.6 V/cm. By controlling key parameters, we were able to reduce the effect of these internal electric fields and demonstrate the detection of RF fields with a sensitivity as low as $10\,\mu\mathrm{V/cm}$ These results highlight the potential of micromachined vapor cells for sub-wavelength electromagnetic field measurements, with applications in communications, near-field RF imaging, and chip-scale quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of strong coupling of a subradiant atom array to a cavity vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17079v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By considering linear scattering of laser-driven cold atoms inside an undriven high-finesse optical resonator, we experimentally demonstrate effects unique to a strongly coupled vacuum field. Arranging the atoms in an incommensurate lattice with respect to the radiation wavelength, the Bragg scattering into the cavity can be suppressed by destructive interference: the atomic array is subradiant to the cavity mode under transverse illumination. We show however, that strong collective coupling leads to a drastic modification of the excitation spectrum, as evidenced by well-resolved vacuum Rabi splitting in the intensity of the fluctuations. Furthermore, we demonstrate a significant polarization rotation in the linear scattering off the subradiant array via Raman scattering induced by the strongly coupled vacuum field.</description>

      <title>Saturation of thermal and spin conductances in a dissipative superfluid junction</title>

Abstract: Fermionic superfluid junctions typically exhibit suppressed thermal and spin transport due to the presence of a pairing gap but allow coherent particle transport. While dissipation generally weakens coherent transport, it can also induce excitations that open other transport channels. In this work, we experimentally study a one-dimensional superfluid junction of strongly interacting fermions with local particle loss and observe dissipation-induced thermal and spin transport that appear to saturate at strong dissipation. Notably, in this regime, the measured thermal and spin conductances are comparable to the universal quantized conductance of one-dimensional ideal Fermi gas. Qualitatively similar behavior is observed for two dissipation mechanisms, either spin-imbalanced or pairwise losses. Our findings provide new insights into transport in interacting open quantum systems and suggest possibilities of dissipative control of spin and thermoelectric transport.</description>

      <title>Unraveling superradiance: Entanglement and mutual information in collective decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13401</link>

Abstract: We study the collective decay of an initially inverted ensemble of two-level emitters in two distinct scenarios: when coupled to a squeezed photonic reservoir and when interacting with a one-dimensional waveguide. Using a quantum-state diffusion approach to unravel the emission process, we investigate entanglement and classical correlations along individual quantum trajectories over time. This numerical analysis shows that despite an initial build-up of entanglement and a significant amount of entanglement due to either spin squeezing or dark states at late times, the essential features of the superradiant burst are well described by averages over fully factorizable states. We explain this observation in terms of an almost complete factorization of all 2-local observables, which we identify as a generic property of superradiant decay. Based on this insight, we provide a purely classical theory for the burst in squeezed superradiance, which is both intuitive and exact for a large number of emitters. Moreover, we find that our numerical approach also performs well in the presence of subradiant states, which dominate the slow residual decay of non-uniform ensembles at late times.</description>

      <title>Observation of many-body coherence in quasi-one-dimensional attractive Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Macroscopic coherence is an important feature of quantum many-body systems exhibiting collective behaviors, with examples ranging from atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, and quantum liquids to superconductors. Probing many-body coherence in a dynamically unstable regime, however, presents an intriguing and outstanding challenge in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body physics. Here, we experimentally study the first- and second-order coherence of degenerate quasi-one-dimensional (1D) Bose gases quenched from repulsive to modulationally unstable attractive interaction regimes. The resulting dynamics, monitored by in-situ density and matter-wave interference imaging, reveals phase-coherent density wave evolutions arising from the interplay between noise-amplified density modulations and dispersive shock waves of broad interest within nonlinear physics. At longer times, the gases become phase-scrambled, exhibiting a finite correlation length. Interestingly, following an interaction quench back to the repulsive regime, we observe that quasi-long-range coherence can be spontaneously re-established. This captivating rephasing dynamics can be attributed to the nucleation and annihilation of density defects in the quasi-1D geometry. These results shed light on out-of-equilibrium phase coherence in quantum many-body systems in a regime where beyond mean-field effects may arise and theoretical approaches have not been well-established.</description>
