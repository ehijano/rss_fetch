      <title>The N-Body Problem on Coadjoint Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show (Theorem 3) that the symplectic reduction of the spatial $n$-body problem at non-zero angular momentum is a singular symplectic space consisting of two symplectic strata, one for spatial motions and the other for planar motions. Each stratum is realized as coadjoint orbit in the dual of the Lie algebra of the linear symplectic group $Sp(2n-2)$. The planar stratum arises as the frontier upon taking the closure of the spatial stratum. We reduce by going to center-of-mass coordinates to reduce by translations and boosts and then performing symplectic reduction with respect to the orthogonal group $O(3)$. The theorem is a special case of a general theorem (Theorem 2) which holds for the $n$-body problem in any dimension $d$. This theorem follows largely from a ``Poisson reduction'' theorem, Theorem 1. We achieve our reduction theorems by combining the Howe dual pair perspective of reduction espoused by Lerman-Montgomery-Sjamaar with a normal form arising from a symplectic singular value decomposition due to Xu. We begin the paper by showing how Poisson reduction by the Galilean group rewrites Newton's equations for the $n$-body problem as a Lax pair. In section 6.4 we show that this Lax pair representation of the $n$-body equations is equivalent to the Albouy-Chenciner representation in terms of symmetric matrices.</description>

      <title>On the mean-field limit for the Vlasov-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a probabilistic proof of the mean-field limit and propagation of chaos of a classical N-particle system in three dimensions with Coulomb interaction force of the form $f^N(q)=\pm\frac{q}{|q|^3}$ and $N$-dependent cut-off at $|q|&gt;N^{-\frac{5}{12}+\sigma}$ where $\sigma&gt;0$ can be chosen arbitrarily small. This cut-off size is much smaller than the typical distance to the nearest neighbour. In particular, for typical initial data, we show convergence of the Newtonian trajectories to the characteristics of the Vlasov-Poisson system. The proof is based on a Gronwall estimate for the maximal distance between the exact microscopic dynamics and the approximate mean-field dynamics. Thus our result leads to a derivation of the Vlasov-Poisson equation from the microscopic $N$-particle dynamics with force term arbitrary close to the physically relevant Coulomb force.</description>

      <title>Infinite-order combinatorial Transverse Intersection Algebra TIA via the probabilistic wiggling model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper constructs a graded-commutative, associative, differential Transverse Intersection Algebra TIA {on the torus (in any dimension) with its cubical decomposition by using a probabilistic wiggling interpretation. This structure agrees with the combinatorial graded intersection algebra (graded by codimension) defined by transversality on pairs of `cuboidal chains' which are in general position. In order to define an intersection of cuboids which are not necessarily in general position, the boundaries of the cuboids are considered to be `wiggled' by a distance small compared with the lattice parameter, according to a suitable probability distribution and then almost always the wiggled cuboids will be in general position, producing a transverse intersection with new probability distributions on the bounding sides. In order to make a closed theory, each geometric cuboid appears in an infinite number of forms with different probability distributions on the wiggled boundaries. The resulting structure is commutative, associative and satisfies the product rule with respect to the natural boundary operator deduced from the geometric boundary of the wiggled cuboids.
  This TIA can be viewed as a combinatorial analogue of differential forms in which the continuity of space has been replaced by a lattice with corrections to infinite order. See the comparison to Whitney forms at the end of the paper.
  For application to fluid algebra we also consider the same construction starting with the $2h$ cubical complex instead of the $h$ cubical complex. The adjoined higher order elements will be identical to those required in the $h$ cubical complex.
  The $d$-dimensional theory is a tensor product of $d$ copies of the one-dimensional theory.</description>

      <title>Role of Riemannian geometry in double-bracket quantum imaginary-time evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double-bracket quantum imaginary-time evolution (DB-QITE) is a quantum algorithm which coherently implements steps in the Riemannian steepest-descent direction for the energy cost function. DB-QITE is derived from Brockett's double-bracket flow which exhibits saddle points where gradients vanish. In this work, we perform numerical simulations of DB-QITE and describe signatures of transitioning through the vicinity of such saddle points. We provide an explicit gate count analysis using quantum compilation programmed in Qrisp.</description>

      <title>Incompressible Optimal Transport and Applications in Fluid Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of incompressible fluid mixing arises in numerous engineering applications and has been well-studied over the years, yet many open questions remain. This paper aims to address the question "what do efficient flow fields for mixing look like, and how do they behave?" We approach this question by developing a framework which is inspired by the dynamic and geometric approach to optimal mass transport. Specifically, we formulate the fluid mixing problem as an optimal control problem where the dynamics are given by the continuity equation together with an incompressibility constraint. We show that within this framework, the set of reachable fluid configurations can formally be endowed with the structure of an infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifold, with a metric which is induced by the control effort, and that flow fields which are maximally efficient at mixing correspond to geodesics in this Riemannian space.</description>

Abstract: This article characterizes phase transitions in temperature within a specific space of H\"older continuous potentials, distinguished by their regularity and asymptotic behavior at zero. We also characterize the phase transitions in temperature that are robust within this space.

      <description>arXiv:2504.01176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize covariant positive decomposable maps between unital C*-algebras in terms of a dilation theorem, which generalizes a seminal result by H. Scutaru from Rep. Math. Phys. 16 (1):79-87, 1979. As a case study, we provide a certain characterization of the operator sum representation of maps on $\mathbb{M}_n (\mathbb{C})$, covariant with respect to the maximal commutative subgroup of $\mathrm{U}(n)$. A connection to quantum dynamics is established by specifying sufficient and necessary conditions for covariance of D-divisible (decomposably divisible) quantum evolution families, recently introduced in J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 56 (2023) 485202.</description>

      <title>New intertwining operators for the Calogero model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is long known that quantum Calogero models feature intertwining operators, which increase or decrease the coupling constant by an integer amount, for any fixed number of particles. We name these as ``horizontal'' and construct new ``vertical'' intertwiners, which \emph{change the number of interacting particles} for a fixed but integer value of the coupling constant. The emerging new structure of a grid of intertwiners exists only in the algebraically integrable situation (integer coupling) and allows one to obtain each Liouville charge from the free power sum in the particle momenta by iterated intertwining either horizontally or vertically. We present recursion formul\ae\ for the new intertwiners as a factorization problem for partial differential operators and prove their existence for small values of particle number and coupling. As a byproduct, a new basis of non-symmetric Liouville integrals appears, algebraically related to the standard symmetric one.</description>

Abstract: We consider a scattering problem generated by the Sturm-Liouville equation on a tree which consists of an equilateral compact subtree and a half-infinite lead attached to its root. We assume that the potential on the lead is identically zero while the potentials on the finite edges are real. We show how to find the shape of the tree using the S-function of the scattering problem and the eigenvalues of the operators associated with the compact tree.</description>

      <title>Global variants of $\mathcal{N}=1^*$ theories and Calogero-Moser systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global variants of four-dimensional gauge theories are specified by their spectrum of genuine Wilson-'t Hooft line operators. The choice of global variant has significant consequences when spacetime is taken to be $\mathbb{R}^3 \times S^1$. We focus on $\mathcal N=1^*$ theories, which are closely connected to twisted elliptic Calogero-Moser systems. We establish, on general grounds, how this gauge-theoretic topological data manifests itself on the integrable system side by introducing a notion of global variants for complex many-body integrable systems associated with Lie algebras. Focusing on $\mathcal N=1^*$ theories of type $A$ and $B_2$, we elucidate the implications for the structure of gapped vacua, the emergent (generalized) symmetries realized in each vacuum, and the action of spontaneously broken modular invariance.</description>

      <title>Improvement of fully-implicit two-phase pore-network models by employing generalized flux functions with additional throat variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In fully-implicit two-phase pore-network models, developing a well-converged scheme remains a major challenge, primarily due to the discontinuities in the phase conductivities. This paper addresses these numerical issues by proposing a generalized flux function that establishes a continuous flux expression for two-phase flows by introducing an additional throat variable $\Theta$. Two approaches for expressing this additional throat variable are introduced: the first applies regularization strategies, while the second constructs an additional residual constraint equation. It is shown that this approach significantly improves accuracy and ensures the temporal convergence, as demonstrated through various numerical examples.</description>

Abstract: Copositive matrices and copositive polynomials are objects from optimization. We connect these to the geometry of Feynman integrals in physics. The integral is guaranteed to converge if its kinematic parameters lie in the copositive cone. P\'olya's method makes this manifest. We study the copositive cone for the second Symanzik polynomial of any Feynman graph. Its algebraic boundary is described by Landau discriminants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An alternative method to invert the Radon transforms without the use of Courand-Hilbert's identities has been proposed and developed independently from the space dimension. For the universal representation of inverse Radon transform, we study the consequences of inhomogeneity of outset function without the restrictions on the angular Radon coordinates. We show that this inhomogeneity yields a natural evidence for the presence of the extra contributions in the case of the full angular region. In addition, if the outset function is well-localized in the space, we demonstrate that the corresponding boundary conditions and the angular restrictions should be applied for both the direct and inverse Radon transforms. Besides, we relate the angular restrictions on the Radon variable to the boundary exclusion of outset function and its Radon image.</description>

      <title>Tensor free probability theory: asymptotic tensor freeness and central limit theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voiculescu's notion of asymptotic free independence applies to a wide range of random matrices, including those that are independent and unitarily invariant. In this work, we generalize this notion by considering random matrices with a tensor product structure that are invariant under the action of local unitary matrices. Assuming the existence of the \emph{tensor distribution} limit described by tuples of permutations, we show that an independent family of local unitary invariant random matrices satisfies asymptotically a novel form of freeness, which we term \emph{tensor freeness}. It can be defined via the vanishing of mixed \emph{tensor free cumulants}, allowing the joint tensor distribution of tensor free elements to be described in terms of that of individual elements. We present several applications of these results in the context of random matrices with a tensor product structure, such as partial transpositions of (local) unitarily invariant random matrices and tensor embeddings of random matrices. Furthermore, we propose a tensor free version of the central limit theorem, which extends and recovers several previous results for tensor products of free variables.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the regularized Kohn-Sham iteration in Banach spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2003.05389v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kohn-Sham iteration of generalized density-functional theory on Banach spaces with Moreau-Yosida regularized universal Lieb functional and an adaptive damping step is shown to converge to the correct ground-state density. This result demands state spaces for (quasi)densities and potentials that are uniformly convex with modulus of convexity of power type. The Moreau-Yosida regularization is adapted to match the geometry of the spaces and some convex analysis results are extended to this type of regularization. Possible connections between regularization and physical effects are pointed out as well. The proof of convergence presented here (Theorem 23) contains a critical mistake that has been noted and fixed for the finite-dimensional case in arXiv:1903.09579. Yet, the proposed correction is not straightforwardly generalizable to a setting of infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. This means the question of convergence in such a case is still left open. We present this draft as a collection of techniques and ideas for a possible altered, successful demonstration of convergence of the Kohn--Sham iteration in Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>On the metric property of quantum Wasserstein divergences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13150v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Wasserstein divergences are modified versions of quantum Wasserstein distances defined by channels, and they are conjectured to be genuine metrics on quantum state spaces by De Palma and Trevisan. We prove triangle inequality for quantum Wasserstein divergences for every quantum system described by a separable Hilbert space and any quadratic cost operator under the assumption that a particular state involved is pure, and all the states have finite energy. We also provide strong numerical evidence suggesting that the triangle inequality holds in general, for an arbitrary choice of states.</description>

      <title>Topological holography, quantum criticality, and boundary states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16878v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological holography is a holographic principle that describes the generalized global symmetry of a local quantum system in terms of a topological order in one higher dimension. This framework separates the topological data from the local dynamics of a theory and provides a unified description of the symmetry and duality in gapped and gapless phases of matter. In this work, we develop the topological holographic picture for (1+1)d quantum phases, including both gapped phases as well as a wide range of quantum critical points, including phase transitions between symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases, symmetry enriched quantum critical points, deconfined quantum critical points, and intrinsically gapless SPT phases. Topological holography puts a strong constraint on the emergent symmetry and the anomaly for these critical theories. We show how the partition functions of these critical points can be obtained from dualizing (orbifolding) more familiar critical theories. The topological responses of the defect operators are also discussed in this framework. We further develop a topological holographic picture for conformal boundary states of (1+1)d rational conformal field theories. This framework provides a simple physical picture to understand conformal boundary states and also uncovers the nature of the gapped phases corresponding to the boundary states.</description>

      <title>Fermat Principle and weak deflection angle from Lindstedt-Poincare method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14462v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fermat principle is advocated to be a convenient tool to analyze the light propagation in a curved space time. It is shown that in the weak deflection regime the light ray trajectories can be systematically described by applying the Lindstedt--Poincar\'e method of solving perturbatively the nonlinear oscillation equations. The expansion in terms of inverse invariant impact parameter for Schwarzschild, Reissner--Nordstr\"om and Kerr (equatorial motion) metrics is described. The corresponding deflection angles are computed to the third order. Only algebraic operations are involved in the derivation; no integrations or Fourier expansion of elliptic functions are necessary. It is argued, that contrary to the naive perturbative expansion, the Lindstedt--Poincar\'e approach correctly represents the main properties of light propagation in asymptotic regime. At each step it preserves the periodicity of the relevant nonlinear oscillations of the inverse radial coordinate which allows to group the trajectories with the same invariant impact parameter into disjoint sets of ones generated by particular oscillations. Moreover, it allows for partial summation of perturbative expansion leading to the uniformly bounded approximations.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity of the Fidelity in Open Qudit Systems: Gate and Noise Dependence in High-dimensional Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15141v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional quantum computing has generated significant interest due to its potential to address scalability and error correction challenges faced by traditional qubit-based systems. This paper investigates the Average Gate Fidelity (AGF) of single qudit systems under Markovian noise in the Lindblad formalism, extending previous work by developing a comprehensive theoretical framework for the calculation of higher-order correction terms. We derive general expressions for the perturbative expansion of the Average Gate Infidelity (AGI) in terms of the environmental coupling coefficient and validate these with extensive numerical simulations, emphasizing the transition from linear to nonlinear behaviour in the strong coupling regime. Our findings highlight the dependence of AGI on qudit dimensionality, quantum gate choice, and noise strength, providing critical insights for optimising quantum gate design and error correction protocols. Additionally, we utilise our framework to identify universal bounds for the AGI in the strong coupling regime and explore the practical implications for enhancing the performance of near-term qudit architectures. This study offers a robust foundation for future research and development in high-dimensional quantum computing, contributing to the advancement of robust, high-fidelity quantum operations.</description>

      <title>Geometric measure of quantum complexity in cosmological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Nielsen's geometric approach to quantum complexity, the introduction of a suitable geometrical space, based on the Lie group formed by fundamental operators, facilitates the identification of complexity through geodesic distance in the group manifold. Earlier work has shown that the computation of geodesic distance can be challenging for Lie groups relevant to harmonic oscillators. Here, this problem is approached by working to leading order in an expansion by the structure constants of the Lie group. An explicit formula for an upper bound on the quantum complexity of a harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian with time-dependent frequency is derived. Applied to a massless test scalar field on a cosmological de Sitter background, the upper bound on complexity as a function of the scale factor exhibits a logarithmic increase on super-Hubble scales. This result aligns with the gate complexity and earlier studies of de Sitter complexity. It demonstrates the consistent application of Nielsen complexity to quantum fields in cosmological backgrounds and paves the way for further applications.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic Yang-Mills fields on $B$-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considering $B$-branes over a complex manifold $X$ as objects of the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves over $X$, we define holomorphic gauge fields on $B$-branes and introduce the Yang-Mills functional for these fields. These definitions extend well-known concepts in the context of vector bundles to the setting of $B$-branes.
  For a given $B$-brane, we show that its Atiyah class is the obstruction to the existence of gauge fields. When $X$ is the variety of complete flags in a $3$-dimensional complex vector space, we prove that any $B$-brane over $X$ admits at most one holomorphic gauge field.
  Furthermore, we establish that the set of Yang-Mills fields on a given $B$-brane, if nonempty, is in bijective correspondence with the points of an algebraic set defined by $m$ complex polynomials of degree less than four in $m$ indeterminates, where $m$ is the dimension of the space of morphisms from the brane to its tensor product with the sheaf of holomorphic one-forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A charged particle in a suitably strong magnetic field spirals along the field lines while slowly drifting transversely. This note provides a brief derivation of an effective Lagrangian formulation for the guiding-centre approximation that captures this dynamics without resolving the gyro motion. It also explains how the effective Lagrangian may, for special magnetic fields, admit a 'quasi-symmetry' which can give rise to a conserved quantity helpful for plasma confinement in fields lacking a geometric isometry. The aim of this note is to offer a pedagogical introduction and some perspectives on this well-established subject.</description>

      <title>Exact d'Alembertian for Lorentz distance functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We refine a recent distributional notion of d'Alembertian of a signed Lorentz distance function to an achronal set in a metric measure spacetime obeying the timelike measure contraction property. We show precise representation formulas and comparison estimates (both upper and lower bounds). Under a condition we call "infinitesimally strict concavity" (known for infinitesimally Minkowskian structures and established here for Finsler spacetimes), we prove the associated distribution is a signed measure certifying the integration by parts formula. This treatment of the d'Alembertian using techniques from metric geometry expands upon its recent nonlinear yet elliptic interpretation; even in the smooth case, our formulas seem to pioneer its exact shape across the timelike cut locus. Two central ingredients our contribution unifies are the localization paradigm of Cavalletti-Mondino and the Sobolev calculus of Beran-Braun-Calisti-Gigli-McCann-Ohanyan-Rott-S\"amann.
  In the second part of our work, we present several applications of these insights. First, we show the equivalence of the timelike curvature-dimension condition with a Bochner-type inequality. Second, we set up synthetic mean curvature (as well as barriers for CMC sets) exactly. Third, we prove synthetic volume and area estimates of Heintze-Karcher-type, which enable us to show several synthetic volume singularity theorems.</description>

      <title>Spectral decomposition of field operators and causal measurement in quantum field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the spectral decomposition of field operators in bosonic quantum field theory as a limit of a strongly continuous family of positive-operator-valued measure decompositions. The latter arise from integrals over families of bounded positive operators. Crucially, these operators have the same locality properties as the underlying field operators. We use the decompositions to construct families of quantum operations implementing measurements of the field observables. Again, the quantum operations have the same locality properties as the field operators. What is more, we show that these quantum operations do not lead to superluminal signaling and are possible measurements on quantum fields in the sense of Sorkin.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Modelling of Elasticity Tensor Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for the probabilistic modelling of random fourth order material tensor fields, with a focus on tensors that are physically symmetric and positive definite (SPD), of which the elasticity tensor is a prime example. Given the critical role that spatial symmetries and invariances play in determining material behaviour, it is essential to incorporate these aspects into the probabilistic description and modelling of material properties. In particular, we focus on spatial point symmetries or invariances under rotations, a classical subject in elasticity. Following this, we formulate a stochastic modelling framework using a Lie algebra representation via a memoryless transformation that respects the requirements of positive definiteness and invariance. With this, it is shown how to generate a random ensemble of elasticity tensors that allows an independent control of strength, eigenstrain, and orientation. The procedure also accommodates the requirement to prescribe specific spatial symmetries and invariances for each member of the whole ensemble, while ensuring that the mean or expected value of the ensemble conforms to a potentially 'higher' class of spatial invariance. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that the set of SPD tensors forms a differentiable manifold, which geometrically corresponds to an open cone within the ambient space of symmetric tensors. Thus, we explore the mathematical structure of the underlying sample space of such tensors, and introduce a new distance measure or metric, called the 'elasticity metric', between the tensors. Finally, we model and visualize a one-dimensional spatial field of orthotropic Kelvin matrices using interpolation based on the elasticity metric.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Forward and Inverse Problems in Subsurface Imaging using Latent Space Translations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In subsurface imaging, learning the mapping from velocity maps to seismic waveforms (forward problem) and waveforms to velocity (inverse problem) is important for several applications. While traditional techniques for solving forward and inverse problems are computationally prohibitive, there is a growing interest in leveraging recent advances in deep learning to learn the mapping between velocity maps and seismic waveform images directly from data. Despite the variety of architectures explored in previous works, several open questions still remain unanswered such as the effect of latent space sizes, the importance of manifold learning, the complexity of translation models, and the value of jointly solving forward and inverse problems. We propose a unified framework to systematically characterize prior research in this area termed the Generalized Forward-Inverse (GFI) framework, building on the assumption of manifolds and latent space translations. We show that GFI encompasses previous works in deep learning for subsurface imaging, which can be viewed as specific instantiations of GFI. We also propose two new model architectures within the framework of GFI: Latent U-Net and Invertible X-Net, leveraging the power of U-Nets for domain translation and the ability of IU-Nets to simultaneously learn forward and inverse translations, respectively. We show that our proposed models achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for forward and inverse problems on a wide range of synthetic datasets, and also investigate their zero-shot effectiveness on two real-world-like datasets.

      <title>Phase vs coin vs position disorder as a probe for the resilience and revival of single particle entanglement in cyclic quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum states exhibiting single-particle entanglement (SPE) can encode and process quantum information more robustly than their multi-particle analogs. Understanding the vulnerability and resilience of SPE to disorder is therefore crucial. This letter investigates phase, coin, and position disorder via discrete-time quantum walks on odd and even cyclic graphs to study their effect on SPE. The reduction in SPE is insignificant for low levels of phase or coin disorder, showing the resilience of SPE to minor perturbations. However, SPE is seen to be more vulnerable to position disorder. We analytically prove that maximally entangled single-particle states (MESPS) at time step $t=1$ are impervious to phase disorder regardless of the choice of the initial state. Further, MESPS at timestep $t=1$ is also wholly immune to coin disorder for phase-symmetric initial states. Position disorder breaks odd-even parity and distorts the physical time cone of the quantum walker, unlike phase or coin disorder. SPE saturates towards a fixed value for position disorder, irrespective of the disorder strength at large timestep $t$. Furthermore, SPE can be enhanced with moderate to significant phase or coin disorder strengths at specific time steps. Interestingly, disorder can revive single-particle entanglement from absolute zero in some instances, too. These results are crucial in understanding single-particle entanglement evolution and dynamics in a lab setting.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove that Schr\"{o}dinger's equation with a Hamiltonian of the form $H=-\Delta+i(A \nabla + \nabla A) + V$, which includes a magnetic potential $A$, has the same dispersive and solution decay properties as the free Schr\"{o}dinger equation. In particular, we prove $L^1 \to L^\infty$ decay and some related estimates for the wave equation.
  The potentials $A$ and $V$ are short-range and $A$ has four derivatives, but they can be arbitrarily large. All results hold in three space dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinearity and non-Hermiticity, for example due to environmental gain-loss processes, are a common occurrence throughout numerous areas of science and lie at the root of many remarkable phenomena. For the latter, parity-time-reflection ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry has played an eminent role in understanding exceptional-point structures and phase transitions in these systems. Yet their interplay has remained by-and-large unexplored. We analyze models governed by the replicator equation of evolutionary game theory and related Lotka-Volterra systems of population dynamics. These are foundational nonlinear models that find widespread application and offer a broad platform for non-Hermitian theory beyond physics. In this context we study the emergence of exceptional points in two cases: (a) when the governing symmetry properties are tied to global properties of the models, and, in contrast, (b) when these symmetries emerge locally around stationary states--in which case the connection between the linear non-Hermitian model and an underlying nonlinear system becomes tenuous. We outline further that when the relevant symmetries are related to global properties, the location of exceptional points in the linearization around coexistence equilibria coincides with abrupt global changes in the stability of the nonlinear dynamics. Exceptional points may thus offer a new local characteristic for the understanding of these systems. Tri-trophic models of population ecology serve as test cases for higher-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>On the Quantum K-theory of Quiver Varieties at Roots of Unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19383v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Psi(\textbf{z},\textbf{a},q)$ a the fundamental solution matrix of the quantum difference equation of a Nakajima variety $X$. In this work, we prove that the operator $$ \Psi(\textbf{z},\textbf{a},q) \Psi\left(\textbf{z}^p,\textbf{a}^p,q^{p^2}\right)^{-1} $$ has no poles at the primitive complex $p$-th roots of unity $q=\zeta_p$. As a byproduct, we show that the iterated product of the operators ${\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}}(\textbf{z},\textbf{a},q )$ from the $q$-difference equation on $X$: $$ {\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\textbf{z} q^{(p-1)\mathcal{L}},\textbf{a},q) \cdots {\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\textbf{z} q^{\mathcal{L}},\textbf{a},q) {\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\textbf{z} ,\textbf{a},q) $$ evaluated at $q=\zeta_p$ has the same eigenvalues as ${\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\textbf{z}^p,\textbf{a}^p,q^p)$.
  Upon a reduction of the quantum difference equation of $X$ to the quantum differential equation over the field of finite characteristic, the above iterated product transforms into a Grothendiek-Katz $p$-curvature of the corresponding quantum connection whreas ${\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\textbf{z}^p,\textbf{a}^p,q^p)$ becomes a certain Frobenius twist of that connection. In this way, we give an explicit description of the spectrum of the $p$-curvature of quantum connection for Nakajima varieties.</description>

      <title>Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem via Different Quantum Computing Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the application of emerging photonic and quantum computing architectures to solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a well-known NP-hard optimization problem. We investigate several approaches: Simulated Annealing (SA), Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO-Ising) methods implemented on quantum annealers and Optical Coherent Ising Machines, as well as the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm on gate-based quantum computers. QAOA and QPE were tested on the IBM Quantum platform. The QUBO-Ising method was explored using the D-Wave quantum annealer, which operates on superconducting Josephson junctions, and the Quantum Computing Inc (QCi) Dirac-1 entropy quantum optimization machine. Gate-based quantum computers demonstrated accurate results for small TSP instances in simulation. However, real quantum devices are hindered by noise and limited scalability. Circuit complexity grows with problem size, restricting performance to TSP instances with a maximum of 6 nodes. In contrast, Ising-based architectures show improved scalability for larger problem sizes. SQUID-based Ising machines can handle TSP instances with up to 12 nodes, while entropy computing implemented in hybrid optoelectronic components extend this capability to 18 nodes. Nevertheless, the solutions tend to be suboptimal due to hardware limitations and challenges in achieving ground state convergence as the problem size increases. Despite these limitations, Ising machines demonstrate significant time advantages over classical methods, making them a promising candidate for solving larger-scale TSPs efficiently.</description>

      <title>Gauge preservation in renormalization for Yang-Mills and gravity theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work, multiplicative renormalization \cite{dixon} for Yang-Mills theories is reviewed. While this subject is not new, it is suggested that a clear understanding of these methods leads to a systematic way for interpreting the counter terms needed for non multiplicative renormalization of quantum gravity, for models such as \cite{dewitt}-\cite{stelle2}. These models are renormalizable but contain apparent instabilities leading to possible unitarity loss, an earlier analog is \cite{pais}. This systematic may be interesting, especially in the modern context, since there are efforts for avoiding with those apparent instabilities by employing variants of the standard quantization methods \cite{mannheim1}-\cite{salve}.</description>

      <title>Gazeau-Klauder coherent states for a harmonic position-dependent mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the dynamic of position-dependent mass system confined in harmonic
  oscillator potential. We derive the eigensystems by solving the Schr\''odinger-like equation which
  describes this system. We construct coherent states a Gazeau-Klauder for this system. We
  show that these states satisfy the Klauder's mathematical condition to build coherent states. We
  compute and analyse some statistical properties of these states. We find that these states exhibit
  sub-Poissonian statistics. We also evaluate quasiprobability distributions such as the Wigner
  function to demonstrate graphically nonclassical features of these states.</description>
