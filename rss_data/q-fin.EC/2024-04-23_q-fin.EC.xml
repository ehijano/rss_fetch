      <title>A national longitudinal dataset of skills taught in U.S. higher education curricula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher education plays a critical role in driving an innovative economy by equipping students with knowledge and skills demanded by the workforce. While researchers and practitioners have developed data systems to track detailed occupational skills, such as those established by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), much less effort has been made to document skill development in higher education at a similar granularity. Here, we fill this gap by presenting a longitudinal dataset of skills inferred from over three million course syllabi taught at nearly three thousand U.S. higher education institutions. To construct this dataset, we apply natural language processing to extract from course descriptions detailed workplace activities (DWAs) used by the DOL to describe occupations. We then aggregate these DWAs to create skill profiles for institutions and academic majors. Our dataset offers a large-scale representation of college-educated workers and their role in the economy. To showcase the utility of this dataset, we use it to 1) compare the similarity of skills taught and skills in the workforce according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2) estimate gender differences in acquired skills based on enrollment data, 3) depict temporal trends in the skills taught in social science curricula, and 4) connect college majors' skill distinctiveness to salary differences of graduates. Overall, this dataset can enable new research on the source of skills in the context of workforce development and provide actionable insights for shaping the future of higher education to meet evolving labor demands especially in the face of new technologies.</description>

      <title>Use of two Public Distributed Ledgers to track the money of an economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tool to improve the effectiveness and the efficiency of public spending is proposed here. In the 19th century banknotes had a serial number. However, in modern days the use of digital transactions that do not use physical currency has opened the possibility to digitally track almost each cent of the economy. In this article a serial number or tracking number for each cent, pence or any other monetary unit of the economy is proposed. Then, almost all cents can be tracked by recording the transactions in a public distributed ledger, rather than recording the amount of the transaction, the information recorded in the block of the transaction is the actual serial number or tracking number for each cent that changes ownership. In order to keep the privacy of the transaction, only generic identification of private companies and individuals are recorded along with generic information about the concept of transaction, the region and the date/time. A secondary public distributed ledger whose blocks are identified by a hash reference that is recorded in the bank statement available to the payer and the payee allows for checking the accuracy of the first public distributed ledger by comparing the transactions made in one day, one region and one type of concept. However, the transactions made or received by the government are recorded with a much higher level of detail in the first ledger and a higher level of disclosure in the second ledger. The result is a tool that is able to accurately track public spending, to keep privacy of individuals and companies and to make statistical analysis and experiments or real tests in the economy of a country. This tool has the potential to assist public policymakers in demonstrating the societal benefits resulting from their policies, thereby enabling more informed decision-making for future policy endeavours.</description>

      <title>Long-term forecasts of statewide travel demand patterns using large-scale mobile phone GPS data: A case study of Indiana</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth in availability of large-scale GPS mobility data from mobile devices has the potential to aid traditional travel demand models (TDMs) such as the four-step planning model, but those processing methods are not commonly used in practice. In this study, we show the application of trip generation and trip distribution modeling using GPS data from smartphones in the state of Indiana. This involves extracting trip segments from the data and inferring the phone users' home locations, adjusting for data representativeness, and using a data-driven travel time-based cost function for the trip distribution model. The trip generation and interchange patterns in the state are modeled for 2025, 2035, and 2045. Employment sectors like industry and retail are observed to influence trip making behavior more than other sectors. The travel growth is predicted to be mostly concentrated in the suburban regions, with a small decline in the urban cores. Further, although the majority of the growth in trip flows over the years is expected to come from the corridors between the major urban centers of the state, relative interzonal trip flow growth will likely be uniformly spread throughout the state. We also validate our results with the forecasts of two travel demand models, finding a difference of 5-15% in overall trip counts. Our GPS data-based demand model will contribute towards augmenting the conventional statewide travel demand model developed by the state and regional planning agencies.</description>

      <title>The Economics of Blockchain Governance: Evaluate Liquid Democracy on the Internet Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), utilizing blockchain technology to enable collective governance, are a promising innovation. This research addresses the ongoing query in blockchain governance: How can DAOs optimize human cooperation? Focusing on the Network Nervous System (NNS), a comprehensive on-chain governance framework underpinned by the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) and liquid democracy principles, we employ theoretical abstraction and simulations to evaluate its potential impact on cooperation and economic growth within DAOs. Our findings emphasize the significance of the NNS's staking mechanism, particularly the reward multiplier, in aligning individual short-term interests with the DAO's long-term prosperity. This study contributes to the understanding and effective design of blockchain-based governance systems.</description>

      <title>Natural Capital as a Stock Option</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unfolding climate crisis is a physical manifestation of the damage that market economy, driven by the high intensity consumption of fossil fuels, has inflicted on the Earth System and on the stability conditions that were established by a complex conjugation of natural factors during the Holoecene. The magnitude of the human activities and its predatory nature is such that it is no longer possible to consider the Earth System and the services it provides for the habitability of the planet, the so-called natural capital, as an economical externality. Thus one is left with two main choices in what concerns the sustaintability of the planet's habitability: radical economic degrowth or highly efficient solutions to internalise the maintenance and the restoration of ecosystems and the services of the Earth System. It is proposed that an interesting strategy for the latter is to consider the natural capital as a stock option.</description>

      <title>Competition and Collaboration in Crowdsourcing Communities: What happens when peers evaluate each other?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crowdsourcing has evolved as an organizational approach to distributed problem solving and innovation. As contests are embedded in online communities and evaluation rights are assigned to the crowd, community members face a tension: they find themselves exposed to both competitive motives to win the contest prize and collaborative participation motives in the community. The competitive motive suggests they may evaluate rivals strategically according to their self-interest, the collaborative motive suggests they may evaluate their peers truthfully according to mutual interest. Using field data from Threadless on 38 million peer evaluations of more than 150,000 submissions across 75,000 individuals over 10 years and two natural experiments to rule out alternative explanations, we answer the question of how community members resolve this tension. We show that as their skill level increases, they become increasingly competitive and shift from using self-promotion to sabotaging their closest competitors. However, we also find signs of collaborative behavior when high-skilled members show leniency toward those community members who do not directly threaten their chance of winning. We explain how the individual-level use of strategic evaluations translates into important organizational-level outcomes by affecting the community structure through individuals' long-term participation. While low-skill targets of sabotage are less likely to participate in future contests, high-skill targets are more likely. This suggests a feedback loop between competitive evaluation behavior and future participation. These findings have important implications for the literature on crowdsourcing design, and the evolution and sustainability of crowdsourcing communities.</description>

      <title>A Global Minimum Tax for Large Firms Only: Implications for Tax Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Global Minimum Tax (GMT) is applied only to firms above a certain size threshold. We set up a simple model of tax competition and profit shifting by heterogeneous multinational firms to evaluate the effects of this partial coverage of the GMT. A non-haven and a haven country are bound by the GMT rate for large multinationals, but can set tax rates for firms below the threshold non-cooperatively. We show that the introduction of the GMT with a moderate tax rate increases tax revenues in both the non-haven and the haven countries. Gradual increases in the GMT rate, however, trigger a sudden change in the tax competition equilibrium from a uniform to a split corporate tax rate, at which tax revenues in the non-haven country decline. In contrast, gradual increases in the coverage of the GMT never harm the non-haven country. We also discuss the quantitative effects of introducing a $15\%$ GMT rate in a calibrated version of our model.</description>

      <title>The benefits and costs of agglomeration: insights from economics and complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are many benefits and costs that come from people and firms clustering together in space. Agglomeration economies, in particular, are the manifestation of centripetal forces that make larger cities disproportionately more wealthy than smaller cities, pulling together individuals and firms in close physical proximity. Measuring agglomeration economies, however, is not easy, and the identification of its causes is still debated. Such association of productivity with size can arise from interactions that are facilitated by cities ("positive externalities"), but also from more productive individuals moving in and sorting into large cities ("self-sorting"). Under certain circumstances, even pure randomness can generate increasing returns to scale. In this chapter, we discuss some of the empirical observations, models, measurement challenges, and open question associated with the phenomenon of agglomeration economies. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of urban complexity theory, and in particular urban scaling, for the literature in agglomeration economies.</description>

      <title>An Economic Solution to Copyright Challenges of Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems are trained on large data corpora to generate new pieces of text, images, videos, and other media. There is growing concern that such systems may infringe on the copyright interests of training data contributors. To address the copyright challenges of generative AI, we propose a framework that compensates copyright owners proportionally to their contributions to the creation of AI-generated content. The metric for contributions is quantitatively determined by leveraging the probabilistic nature of modern generative AI models and using techniques from cooperative game theory in economics. This framework enables a platform where AI developers benefit from access to high-quality training data, thus improving model performance. Meanwhile, copyright owners receive fair compensation, driving the continued provision of relevant data for generative model training. Experiments demonstrate that our framework successfully identifies the most relevant data sources used in artwork generation, ensuring a fair and interpretable distribution of revenues among copyright owners.</description>

      <title>The Effect of External Debt on Greenhouse Gas Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.01840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We estimate the causal effect of external debt on greenhouse gas emissions in a panel of 78 emerging market and developing economies over the 1990-2015 period. Unlike previous literature, we use external instruments to address the potential endogeneity in the relationship between external debt and greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, we use international liquidity shocks as instrumental variables for external debt. We find that dealing with the potential endogeneity problem brings about a positive and statistically significant effect of external debt on greenhouse gas emissions: a 1 percentage point (pp.) rise in external debt causes, on average, a 0.5% increase in greenhouse gas emissions. One possible mechanism of action could be that, as external debt increases, governments are less able to enforce environmental regulations because their main priority is to increase the tax base to pay increasing debt services or because they are captured by the private sector who owns that debt and prevented from tightening such regulations.</description>

      <title>Path-dependency and leverage effect on capital return in periodic growth processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08678v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probability theory is applied to the finances of periodic growth processes. The expected value of the profit rate, on accrual basis, does not directly depend on divestments, neither on the capitalization path. The expected value of capitalization is path dependent. Because of the path-dependent capitalization, the return rate on capital is path-dependent, and the time-average return rate on capital differs from the expected value of the return rate on capital for the growth cycle. In the absence of intermediate divestments, the internal rate of return is path-independent, thereby differing from the expected value of the rate of return on capital. It is shown that the area-average of internal rate of return is not representative for the rate of return on capital within an estate. It is shown that the rotation cycle length maximizing the return rate on equity is independent of market interest rate. Correspondingly, from the viewpoint of wealth accumulation, the often-suggested dependency of suitable rotation length on discount rate appears to be a modeling artifact. Leverage effect enters the microeconomics of the growth processes through a separate leverage equation, where the leverage coefficient may reach positive or negative values. The leverage effect on the internal rate of return and the net present value are discussed. Both effects are solvable, resulting in incorrect estimates.</description>

      <title>Doing AI: Algorithmic decision support as a human activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic decision support (ADS), using Machine-Learning-based AI, is becoming a major part of many processes. Organizations introduce ADS to improve decision-making and use available data, thereby possibly limiting deviations from the normative "homo economicus" and the biases that characterize human decision-making. However, a closer look at the development and use of ADS systems in organizational settings reveals that they necessarily involve a series of largely unspecified human decisions. They begin with deliberations for which decisions to use ADS, continue with choices while developing and deploying the ADS, and end with decisions on how to use the ADS output in an organization's operations. The paper presents an overview of these decisions and some relevant behavioral phenomena. It points out directions for further research, which is essential for correctly assessing the processes and their vulnerabilities. Understanding these behavioral aspects is important for successfully implementing ADS in organizations.</description>
