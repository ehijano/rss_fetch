      <title>The equivalence of smooth and synthetic notions of timelike sectional curvature bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timelike sectional curvature bounds play an important role in spacetime geometry, both for the understanding of classical smooth spacetimes and for the study of Lorentzian (pre-)length spaces introduced in \cite{kunzinger2018lorentzian}. In the smooth setting, a bound on the sectional curvature of timelike planes can be formulated via the Riemann curvature tensor. In the synthetic setting, bounds are formulated by comparing various geometric configurations to the corresponding ones in constant curvature spaces. The first link between these notions in the Lorentzian context was established in \cite{harris1982triangle}, which was instrumental in the proof of powerful results in spacetime geometry \cite{beem1985toponogov, beem1985decomposition, galloway2018existence}. For general semi-Riemannian manifolds, the equivalence between sectional curvature bounds and synthetic bounds was established in \cite{alexander2008triangle}, however in this approach the sectional curvatures of both timelike and spacelike planes have to be considered. In this article, we fill a gap in the literature by proving the full equivalence between sectional curvature bounds on timelike planes and synthetic timelike bounds on strongly causal spacetimes. As an essential tool, we establish Hessian comparison for the time separation and signed distance functions.</description>

      <title>Remarks on a theorem of Eells and Sampson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an extension of Eells and Sampson's rigidity theorem for harmonic maps from a closed manifold of non-negative Ricci curvature to a manifold of non-positive sectional curvature. We give an application of our result in the setting of harmonic-Einstein (or Ricci-harmonic) metrics and as a consequence we recover a classical rigidity result of Hamilton for the problem of prescribed positive definite Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>A Hilbert metric for bounded symmetric domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bounded symmetric domains carry several natural invariant metrics, for example the Carath\'eodory, Kobayashi or the Bergman metric. We define another natural metric, from generalized Hilbert metric defined in [FGW20], by considering the Borel embedding of the domain as an open subset of its dual compact Hermitian symmetric space and then its Harish-Chandra realization in projective spaces. We describe this construction on the four classical families of bounded symmetric domains and compute both this metric and its associated Finsler metric. We compare it to Carath\'eodory and Bergman metrics and show that, except for the complex hyperbolic space, those metrics differ.</description>

      <title>Submanifolds with boundary and Stokes' Theorem in Heisenberg groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study the notion of $C^1_\mathbb{H}$-regular submanifold with boundary in sub-Riemannian Heisenberg groups. As an application, we prove a version of Stokes' Theorem for $C^1_\mathbb{H}$-regular submanifolds with boundary that takes into account Rumin's complex of differential forms in Heisenberg groups.</description>

      <title>The Fubini--Study metric on an `odd' Grassmannian is rigid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the ideas of Gasqui and Goldschmidt, we give an explicit description of the infinitesimal Einstein deformations admitted by the Fubini--Study metric on complex Grassmannians $G_{m}(\mathbb{C}^{n+m})$ with $m,n\geq 2$. The deformations were first shown to exist by Koiso in the 1980s but it has remained an open question as to whether they can be integrated to give genuine deformations of the Fubini--Study metric. We show that when $n+m$ is odd, the answer is no.</description>

      <title>A Dimca-Greuel type inequality for foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a holomorphic foliation at $p\in \mathbb{C}^2$, and $B$ be a separatrix of $\mathcal{F}$. We prove the following Dimca-Greuel type inequality $\frac{\mu_p(\mathcal{F},B)}{\tau_p(\mathcal{F},B)}&lt;4/3$, where $\mu_p(\mathcal{F},B)$ is the multiplicity of $\mathcal{F}$ along $B$ and $\tau_p(\mathcal{F},B)$ is the dimension of the quotient of $\mathbb{C}[[x,y]]$ by the ideal generated by the components of any $1$-form defining $\mathcal{F}$ and any equation of $B$. As a consequence, we provide a new proof of the $\frac{4}{3}$-Dimca-Greuel's conjecture for singularities of irreducible plane curve germs, with foliations ingredients, that differs from those given by Alberich-Carrami\~nana, Almir\'on, Blanco, Melle-Hern\'andez and Genzmer-Hernandes but it is in line with the idea developed by Wang.</description>

      <title>A priori bounds for geodesic diameter. Part III. A Sobolev-Poincar\'e inequality and applications to a variety of geometric variational problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05504</link>
      <description>arXiv:1709.05504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on a novel type of Sobolev-Poincar\'e inequality (for generalised weakly differentiable functions on varifolds), we establish a finite upper bound of the geodesic diameter of generalised compact connected surfaces-with-boundary of arbitrary dimension in Euclidean space in terms of the mean curvatures of the surface and its boundary. Our varifold setting includes smooth immersions, surfaces with finite Willmore energy, two-convex hypersurfaces in level-set mean curvature flow, integral currents with prescribed mean curvature vector, area minimising integral chains with coefficients in a complete normed commutative group, varifold solutions to Plateau's problem furnished by min-max methods or by Brakke flow, and compact sets solving Plateau problems based on \v{C}ech homology. Due to the generally inevitable presence of singularities, path-connectedness was previously known neither for the class of varifolds (even in the absence of boundary) nor for the solutions to the Plateau problems considered.</description>

      <title>Compatible E-differential forms on Lie algebroids over (pre-)multisymplectic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08193v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider higher generalizations of both a (twisted) Poisson structure and the equivariant condition of a momentum map on a symplectic manifold. On a Lie algebroid over a (pre-)symplectic and (pre-)multisymplectic manifold, we introduce a Lie algebroid differential form called a compatible E-n-form. This differential form satisfies a compatibility condition, which is consistent with both the Lie algebroid structure and the (pre-)(multi)symplectic structure. There are many interesting examples such as a Poisson structure, a twisted Poisson structure and a twisted R-Poisson structure for a pre-n-plectic manifold. Moreover, momentum maps and momentum sections on symplectic manifolds, homotopy momentum maps and homotopy momentum sections on multisymplectic manifolds have this structure.</description>

      <title>A note on Rational Functions with three branched points on the Riemann sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06956v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying the existence of rational functions with given branched data is a classical problem in the field of complex analysis and algebraic geometry. This problem dates back to Hurwitz and remains open to this day. In this paper, we utilize complex analysis to establish a property of rational functions with three branched points on the Riemann sphere. As applications, we present some new types of exceptional branched data. These results cover some previous results mentioned in \cite{EKS84,PP06,Zhu19}. We also establish the existence of a certain type of rational functions on the Riemann sphere.</description>

      <title>Duality of quantum geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum connections are defined by parallel transport operators acting on a Hilbert space. They transport tangent operators along paths in parameter space. The metric tensor of a Riemannian manifold is replaced by an inner product of pairs of operator fields, similar to the inner product of the Kubo-Mori formalism of Linear Response Theory. The metric is used to define the dual of a quantum connection.The gradient of the parallel transport operators is the quantum vector potential. It defines the covariant derivative of operator fields. The covariant derivatives are used to quantify the holonomy of the quantum connection. It is shown that a quantum connection is holonomic if and only if its dual is holonomic. If the parallel transport operators are unitary then an alpha-family of quantum connections can be defined in a way similar to Amari's alpha family of connections in Information Geometry. The minus alpha connection is the dual of the alpha connection. In particular, the alpha equal zero connection is self-dual. An operator field can be combined with a path in parameter space to produce a path in operator space. A definition is given for such a path in operator space to be autoparallel. The path in parameter space is then a geodesic for the induced connection.</description>

      <title>On the Ashbaugh-Benguria type conjecture about lower-order Neumann eigenvalues of the Witten-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An isoperimetric inequality for lower order nonzero Neumann eigenvalues of the Witten-Laplacian on bounded domains in a Euclidean space or a hyperbolic space has been proven in this paper. About this conclusion, we would like to point out two things:
  It strengthens the well-known Szeg\H{o}-Weinberger inequality for nonzero Neumann eigenvalues of the classical free membrane problem given in [J. Rational Mech. Anal. 3 (1954) 343-356] and [J. Rational Mech. Anal. 5 (1956) 633-636];
  Recently, Xia-Wang [Math. Ann. 385 (2023) 863-879] gave a very important progress to the celebrated conjecture of M. S. Ashbaugh and R. D. Benguria proposed in [SIAM J. Math. Anal. 24 (1993) 557-570]. It is easy to see that our conclusion here covers Xia-Wang's this progress as a special case.
  In this paper, we have also proposed two open problems which can be seen as a generalization of Ashbaugh-Benguria's conjecture mentioned above.</description>

      <title>Several isoperimetric inequalities of Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues of the Witten-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, by mainly using the rearrangement technique and suitably constructing trial functions, under the constraint of fixed weighted volume, we can successfully obtain several isoperimetric inequalities for the first and the second Dirichlet eigenvalues, the first nonzero Neumann eigenvalue of the Witten-Laplacian on bounded domains in space forms. These spectral isoperimetric inequalities extend those classical ones (i.e. the Faber-Krahn inequality, the Hong-Krahn-Szeg\H{o} inequality and the Szeg\H{o}-Weinberger inequality) of the Laplacian.</description>
