      <title>Matrix representation of the results of Picard--Lefschetz--Pham theory near the real plane in $\mathbb{C}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is motivated by an attempt to construct a two-dimensional analogue of the Wiener--Hopf method. It is supposed that understanding the branching structure of unknown functions will provide insight into the form in which these functions can be sought. The unknown functions are represented as two-dimensional integrals of analytic functions with parameters, making it natural to study the branching of the integration surface using Picard--Lefschetz theory. A convenient matrix-vector representation of the main result of Picard--Lefschetz theory is introduced, and the following two statements are formulated. First, under certain constraints, the integration surface can be represented as a finite-dimensional vector with coefficients in the group ring over the fundamental group of the space with removed singularities. Second, a bypass in the parameter space around one of the components of the Landau set is described by multiplication by a relatively simple matrix (also composed of elements from the group ring). Successive loops are described by the product of such matrices. As an illustration, it is shown how the matrix formalism yields the Picard-Lefschetz formula and provides nontrivial topological relationships in the parameter space.</description>

      <title>On Rank of Multivectors in Geometric Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of rank of multivector in Clifford geometric algebras of arbitrary dimension without using the corresponding matrix representations and using only geometric algebra operations. We use the concepts of characteristic polynomial in geometric algebras and the method of SVD. The results can be used in various applications of geometric algebras in computer science, engineering, and physics.</description>

      <title>Matchgate circuits deeply thermalize</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ensemble of states generated by performing projective measurements on the output of a random matchgate (or free-fermionic) quantum circuit. We rigorously show that this `projected ensemble' exhibits deep thermalization: For large system sizes, it converges towards a universal ensemble that is uniform over the manifold of Gaussian fermionic states. As well as proving moment-wise convergence of these ensembles, we demonstrate that the full distribution of any physical observable in the projected ensemble is close to its universal form in Wasserstein-1 distance, which we argue is an appropriate and efficiently computable measure of convergence when studying deep thermalization. Using this metric, we also numerically find that local matchgate circuits deeply thermalize after a timescale $t \sim L^2$ set by the diffusive spreading of quantum information. Our work opens up new avenues to experimentally accessible protocols to probe the emergence of quantum statistical mechanics and benchmark quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Hilbert space separability and the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics is formulated on a Hilbert space that is assumed to be separable. However, there seems to be no clear reason justifying this assumption. Does it have physical implications? We answer in the positive by proposing a test that witnesses the non-separability of the Hilbert space, at the expense of requiring measurements with uncountably many outcomes. In the search for a less elusive manifestation of non-separability, we consider the original Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) state as a candidate for possessing nonlocal correlations stronger than any state in a separable Hilbert space. Nevertheless, we show that, under mild assumptions, this state is not a vector in any bipartite space, even non-separable, and therefore cannot be described within the standard Hilbert space formalism.</description>

      <title>Linear hyperbolic equations in a double null foliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bianchi identities for the Weyl curvature tensor of a spacetime $(M, g)$ solving the vacuum Einstein equations in a double null foliation exhibit a hyperbolic structure, which can be used to obtain detailed nonlinear estimates on the null Weyl tensor components. The aim of this paper is twofold. First we discuss existence and uniqueness for solutions of first-order linear hyperbolic systems of equations in a double null foliation on an arbitrary spacetime, with initial data posed on a past null hypersurface $\underline C_0 \cup C_0$. We prove a global existence and uniqueness theorem for these systems. Then we discuss the relationship between these systems, the Bianchi equations, and the linearized Bianchi equations (the linearized Bianchi equations are obtained from the usual Bianchi equations by replacing the null Weyl tensor components with unknown tensorfields). We derive a novel algebraic constraint which must be satisfied, at every point in the spacetime, by tensorfields satisfying the linearized Bianchi equations.</description>

      <title>Exact low-temperature Green's functions in AdS/CFT: From Heun to confluent Heun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain exact expressions for correlation functions of charged scalar operators at finite density and low temperature in CFT$_4$ dual to the RN-AdS$_5$ black brane. We use recent developments in the Heun connection problem in black hole perturbation theory arising from Liouville CFT and the AGT correspondence. The connection problem is solved perturbatively in an instanton counting parameter, which corresponds to a low-temperature expansion in a double-scaling limit where $\omega, T \to 0$ holding $\omega/T$ fixed. We gain analytic control over the emergence of the zero temperature branch cut as a confluent limit of the Heun equation. From the Green's function we extract analytic results for the critical temperature of the holographic superconductor, as well as dispersion relations for both gapped and gapless low temperature quasinormal modes. We demonstrate precise agreement with numerics.</description>

      <title>Overscreened spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Kondo impurity and Shiba state at the edge of a one-dimensional spin-1 superconducting wire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a model describing a system where the superconductivity competes with the overscreened Kondo effect. The model consists of a single spin$-\frac{1}{2}$ quantum impurity at the edge of a quantum wire where spin$-1$ bulk fermions interact attractively, generating a (superconducting) mass gap. The competition between the Kondo screening and the superconductivity leads to a rich phase structure. We find that for strong Kondo coupling, there is a regime of phase space where the Kondo phase is stable with the impurity \textit{overscreened} by a multiparticle Kondo effect, and a Kondo scale is dynamically generated. When the bulk and boundary interaction strength are comparable, we find that a midgap state appears in the spectrum and screens the impurity, while in the ground state, the impurity is unscreened. This midgap state is akin to the Yu-Shiba-Rushinov (YSR) states that exist in the entire phase space in the BCS superconductor. Moreover, when the bulk superconducting interaction strength is stronger than the boundary Kondo interaction strength, the impurity can no longer be screened. Further, between the Kondo and YSR phases, we find a novel phase where, while the Kondo cloud overscreens the impurity, a boundary excitation exists that has vanishing energy in the thermodynamic limit. Similar phase diagrams that result from competition between different mechanisms were found for other models, too: the dissipative Kondo system, where dissipation competes with screening; the Kondo impurity coupled to spin-1/2 attractively interacting fermions where condensation competes with screening; and the XXX-Kondo model, where the lattice cutoff and the bulk spin interaction compete with screening.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heckman-Polychronakos operators form a prominent family of commuting differential-difference operators defined in terms of the Dunkl operators $\mathcal D_i$ as $\mathcal P_m= \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i \mathcal D_i)^m$. They have been known since 1990s in connection with trigonometric Calogero-Moser-Sutherland Hamiltonian and Jack symmetric polynomials. We explicitly compute the eigenvalues of these operators for symmetric and skew-symmetric eigenfunctions, as well as partial sums of eigenvalues for general polynomial eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Density matrix exponentiation and sample-based Hamiltonian simulation: Non-asymptotic analysis of sample complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density matrix exponentiation (DME) is a quantum algorithm that processes multiple copies of a program state $\sigma$ to realize the Hamiltonian evolution $e^{-i \sigma t}$. While serving as a prototypical sample-based quantum algorithm, DME is a powerful tool for various quantum information processing tasks, such as quantum principal component analysis and Hamiltonian simulation. In this work, we present a detailed sample complexity analysis of DME and sample-based Hamiltonian simulation. In particular, we prove that the sample complexity of DME is no larger than $4t^2/\varepsilon$, where $t$ is the desired evolution time and $\varepsilon$ is the desired imprecision level, as quantified by the normalized diamond distance. We also establish a fundamental lower bound on the sample complexity of sample-based Hamiltonian simulation, which matches our DME sample complexity bound up to a constant multiplicative factor, thereby proving that DME is optimal for sample-based Hamiltonian simulation. Finally, we point out that the DME sample complexity analysis in Appendix A of [Kimmel et al., npj Quantum Information 3, 13 (2017)] appears to be incomplete, highlighting the need for the results presented here, given the extensive use of DME over the past decade since its original proposal.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations Principle for the Fluctuating Boltzmann Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Boltzmann equation is one of the most famous equations and has vast applications in modern science. In the current study, we take the randomness of binary collisions into consideration and generalize the classical Boltzmann equation into a stochastic framework. The corresponding Kolmogorov forward equations and Liouville equation in either discrete or continuous time and state space are derived respectively, whose characteristic line gives the Boltzmann equation as a consequence of the law of large numbers. Then the large deviations principle for these equations is established, which not only explains the probabilistic origin of the H-theorem in the Boltzmann equation, but also provides a natural way to incorporate the Boltzmann equation into a broader Hamiltonian structure. The so-called Hamilton-Boltzmann equation enjoys many significant merits, like time reversibility, the conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy, Maxwellian-Boltzmann distribution as the equilibrium solution, etc. We also present results under the diffusive limit in parallel. Finally, the macroscopic hydrodynamic models including 13 moments are derived with respect to our Hamilton-Boltzmann equation under the BGK approximation. We expect our study can inspire new insights into the classical Boltzmann equation from either the stochastic aspect or a Hamiltonian view.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates for the Schr\"odinger equation in high dimensional critical electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove Strichartz estimates for the Schr\"odinger equation with scaling-critical electromagnetic potentials in dimensions $n\geq3$. The decay assumption on the magnetic potentials is critical, including the case of the Coulomb potential. Our approach introduces novel techniques, notably the construction of Schwartz kernels for the localized Schr\"odinger propagator, which separates the antipodal points of $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$, in these scaling critical electromagnetic fields. This method enables us to prove the $L^1(\mathbb{R}^n)\to L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for the localized Schr\"odinger propagator, as well as global Strichartz estimates. Our results provide a positive answer to the open problem posed in arXiv:0901.4024 arXiv:1611.04805 arXiv:0806.0778, and fill a longstanding gap left by arXiv:arXiv:0705.0546 arXiv:archive/0608699.</description>

Abstract: We construct {\it Topological Elliptic Genera}, homotopy-theoretic refinements of the elliptic genera for $SU$-manifolds and variants including the Witten-Landweber-Ochanine genus. The codomains are genuinely $G$-equivariant Topological Modular Forms developed by Gepner-Meier, twisted by $G$-representations. As the first installment of a series of articles on Topological Elliptic Genera, this issue lays the mathematical foundation and discusses immediate applications. Most notably, we deduce an interesting divisibility result for the Euler numbers of $Sp$-manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss for the first time canonical differential equations for hyperelliptic Feynman integrals. We study hyperelliptic Lauricella functions that include in particular the maximal cut of the two-loop non-planar double box, which is known to involve a hyperlliptic curve of genus two. We consider specifically three- and four-parameter Lauricella functions, each associated to a hyperelliptic curve of genus two, and construct their canonical differential equations. Whilst core steps of this construction rely on existing methods $\unicode{x2014}$ that we show to be applicable in the higher-genus case $\unicode{x2014}$ we use new ideas on the structure of the twisted cohomology intersection matrix associated to the integral family in canonical form to obtain a better understanding of the appearing new functions. We further observe the appearance of Siegel modular forms in the $\varepsilon$-factorized differential equation matrix, nicely generalizing similar observations from the elliptic case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Tracy-Singh product of matrices permits to construct a new gate $c \boxtimes c'$ from two $2$-qudit gates $c$ and $c'$. If $c$ and $c'$ are both Yang-Baxter gates, then $c \boxtimes c'$ is also a Yang-Baxter gate, and if at least one of them is entangling, then $c \boxtimes c'$ is also entangling. A natural question arises about the realisation of these gates, $c \boxtimes c'$, in terms of local and universal gates. In this paper, we consider this question and describe this realisation.</description>

      <title>Exploiting $\vartheta -$functions for the identification of topological materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An exact analytical expression is derived for Bloch states in three dimensions, based on the only assumption that the electronic wavefunction can be expanded in terms of Gaussian type orbitals.
  The resulting expression features multidimensional $\vartheta -$functions (and their derivatives) on which the action of discrete space group symmetries is evaluated analytically and contrasted against the symmetry transformations proper of modular forms.
  We integrate group theoretical arguments with continuity requirements of the Bloch states to produce a viable algorithm for the determination of band inversions in materials with a non-trivial topological electronic band structure; the proposed methodology is then applied to two simplified materials models.</description>

      <title>The fabulous world of GKP codes</title>

Abstract: Quantum error correction is an essential ingredient in the development of quantum technologies. Its subject is to investigate ways to embed quantum Hilbert spaces into a physical system such that this subspace is robust against small imperfections in the physical systems. This task is exceedingly complex: for one, this is due to the vast diversity of possible physical systems with different structure to use. For another, every physical setting also comes with its own imperfections that need to be protected against. Bred by the complexity of a technological ambition, research on quantum error correction has developed into a large field of research that ranges from engineering of small systems with a single photon to the creation of macroscopic topological phases of matter and models of complex emergent physics. A quintessential tool in quantum error correction is the stabilizer formalism, which tames quantum systems by enforcing symmetries. A Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code is a stabilizer code that creates a logical subspace within an infinite dimensional Hilbert space by endowing it with translational symmetries. While in practice the infinitude of the Hilbert space, as well as the infinitude of the translational symmetry group are considered as obstacles for implementation, in theory these are precisely the features that make the theory of GKP codes particularly rich, well behaved and well-connected to fascinating topics in mathematics. The purpose of this thesis is to explore these connections: to understand the coding theoretic and practical properties of GKP codes, utilizing its rich mathematical foundation, and to provide a foundation for future research. Along this journey we discover -- through the looking glass of GKP codes -- how quantum error correction fits into a fabulous mathematical world and formulate a series of dreams about possible directions of research.</description>

      <title>Tensorial free convolution, semicircular, free Poisson and R-transform in high order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work builds on our previous developments regarding a notion of freeness for tensors. We aim to establish a tensorial free convolution for compactly supported measures. First, we define higher-order analogues of the semicircular (or Wigner) law and the free Poisson (or Marcenko-Pastur) law, giving their moments and free cumulants. We prove the convergence of a Wishart-type tensor to the free Poisson law and recall the convergence of a Wigner tensor to the semicircular law. We also present a free Central Limit Theorem in this context. Next, we introduce a tensorial free convolution, define the $R$-transform, and provide the first examples of free convolution of measures.</description>

      <title>Dirac bracket and Nambu structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A relation between the Dirac bracket (DB) and Nambu bracket (NB) is presented. The Nambu bracket can be related with Dirac bracket if we can write the DB as a generalized Poisson structure. The NB associated with DB have all the standard properties of the original DB. When the dimension of the phase space is $s+2$ where $s$ is the number of second class constraints, the associated Nambu structure has $s+2$ entries and reduces to the Dirac bracket when $s$ of its entries are fixed to be the second class constraints. In general, when the dimension of phase space is $d=r+s$ a new Nambu structure that describes correctly the constrained dynamics can also be constructed but in thsi case addicional conditidionts are requiered. In that case the associated NB corresponds to a ``Dirac-Nambu'' bracket with $r$ entries.</description>

      <title>Harmonic, Holomorphic and Rational Maps from Self-Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the so-called rational map ansatz on the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$, for any compact simple Lie group $G$ such that $G/{\widehat K}\otimes U(1)$ is an Hermitian symmetric space, for some subgroup ${\widehat K}$ of $G$. It generalizes the rational maps on the two-sphere $SU(2)/U(1)$, and also on $CP^N=SU(N+1)/SU(N)\otimes U(1)$, and opens up the way for applications of such ans\"atze on non-linear sigma models, Skyrme theory and magnetic monopoles in Yang-Mills-Higgs theories. Our construction is based on a well known mathematical result stating that stable harmonic maps $X$ from the two-sphere $S^2$ to compact Hermitian symmetric spaces $G/{\widehat K}\otimes U(1)$ are holomorphic or anti-holomorphic. We derive such a mathematical result using ideas involving the concept of self-duality, in a way that makes it more accessible to theoretical physicists. Using a topological (homotopic) charge that admits an integral representation, we construct first order partial differential self-duality equations such that their solutions also solve the (second order) Euler-Lagrange associated to the harmonic map energy $E=\int_{S^2} \mid dX\mid^2 d\mu$. We show that such solutions saturate a lower bound on the energy $E$, and that the self-duality equations constitute the Cauchy-Riemann equations for the maps $X$. Therefore, they constitute harmonic and (anti)holomorphic maps, and lead to the generalization of the rational map ans\"atze in $\mathbb{R}^3$.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity of Black Box Work Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting work from a physical system is one of the cornerstones of quantum thermodynamics. The extractable work, as quantified by ergotropy, necessitates a complete description of the quantum system. This is significantly more challenging when the state of the underlying system is unknown, as quantum tomography is extremely inefficient. In this article, we analyze the number of samples of the unknown state required to extract work. With only a single copy of an unknown state, we prove that extracting any work is nearly impossible. In contrast, when multiple copies are available, we quantify the sample complexity required to estimate extractable work, establishing a scaling relationship that balances the desired accuracy with success probability. Our work develops a sample-efficient protocol to assess the utility of unknown states as quantum batteries and opens avenues for estimating thermodynamic quantities using near-term quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Self-Dual Gauge Theory from the Top Down</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of dualities between certain non-supersymmetric self-dual gauge theories on a large class of $4d$ self-dual asymptotically flat backgrounds, and the large $N$ limit of an independently defined $2d$ chiral defect CFT. Our construction goes via twisted holography for the type I topological string on a Calabi-Yau five-fold which fibres over twistor space. In particular, we show that single-trace operators of the $2d$ defect CFT are in bijection with states of the celestial chiral algebra. We match the operator products of these states with the collinear splitting amplitudes of the self-dual gauge theory up to one-loop. Assigning vacuum expectations to central operators in the boundary theory computes bulk amplitudes on self-dual backgrounds. We are able to extract form factors from these amplitudes, which we use to give a simple closed formula for certain $n$-point two-loop all $+$ amplitudes in $\mathrm{SU}(K) \times \mathrm{SU}(R)$ gauge theory coupled to bifundamental massless fermions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a generalization of Poisson-Chern-Simons theory, defined on any supermanifold equipped with an appropriate filtration of the tangent bundle. Our construction recovers interacting eleven-dimensional supergravity in Cederwall's formulation, as well as all possible twists of the theory, and does so in a uniform and geometric fashion. Among other things, this proves that Costello's description of the maximal twist is the twist of eleven-dimensional supergravity in its pure spinor description. It also provides a pure spinor lift of the interactions in the minimally twisted theory. Our techniques enhance the BV formulation of the interactions of each theory to a homotopy Poisson structure by defining a compatible graded-commutative product; this suggests interpretations in terms of deformations of geometric structures on superspace, and provides some concrete evidence for a first-quantized origin of the theories.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue and pseudospectrum processes generated by nonnormal Toeplitz matrices with rank 1 perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08129v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent studies on a time-dependent random matrix model called the non-Hermitian matrix-valued Brownian motion, we propose two kinds of dynamical processes of $n \times n$ matrices generated by nonnormal Toeplitz matrices. As a deterministic rank 1 perturbation, $\delta J$ is added at time $m \leq n$, where $\delta \in {\mathbb{C}}$ and $J$ is the all-ones matrix. For each process, first we report the complicated motion of the eigenvalues which are numerically calculated. Then we derive the specific equation which determines the motion of non-zero eigenvalues and clarifies the time-dependence of degeneracy of the zero-eigenvalue. The Catalan numbers play an important role to describe an outlier of non-zero eigenvalues. Comparison with the solutions of this equation, it is concluded that the numerically observed non-zero eigenvalues distributing around the zero-eigenvalue are not the exact eigenvalues of the original system but of the system perturbed by uncontrolled rounding errors of computer. This phenomenon implies the high sensitivity of the degenerated zero-eigenvalue to random dense perturbations. The domain in which the eigenvalues of randomly perturbed system are distributed is identified with the pseudospectrum including the zero-eigenvalue of the original system with $\delta J$. We characterize the pseudospectrum processes using the symbol curves of the corresponding nonnormal Toeplitz operators without $\delta J$. We report new phenomena in our second model such that at each time the outermost closed simple curve cut out from the symbol curve is realized as the exact eigenvalues, but the inner part of symbol curve is reduced in size and embedded in the pseudospectrum including the zero-eigenvalue. The asymptotics of the processes in the infinite-matrix limit $n \to \infty$ are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a protocol for the two-time measurement of entropic observables in quantum open systems driven out of thermal equilibrium by coupling to several heat baths. We concentrate on the Markovian approximation of the time-evolution and relate the expected value of the so defined entropy variations with the well-known expression of entropy production due to Lebowitz and Spohn. We do so under the detailed balance condition and, as a byproduct, we show that the probabilities of outcomes of two-time measurements are given by a continuous time Markov process determined by the Lindblad generator of the Markovian quantum dynamics.</description>

Abstract: It is shown by analyzing the $1D$ Schr\"odinger equation that discontinuities in the coupling constant can occur in both the energies and the eigenfunctions. Surprisingly, those discontinuities, which are present in the energies {\it versus} the coupling constant, are of three types only: (i) discontinuous energies (similar to 1st order phase transitions), (ii) discontinuous first derivative in the energy while the energy is continuous (similar to 2nd order phase transitions), (iii) the energy and all its derivatives are continuous but the functions are different below and above the point of discontinuity (similar to infinite order phase transitions). Supersymmetric (SUSY) Quantum Mechanics provides a convenient framework to study this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Generalized Eigenspaces and Pseudospectra of Nonnormal and Defective Matrix-Valued Dynamical Systems</title>

Abstract: We consider nonnormal matrix-valued dynamical systems with discrete time. For an eigenvalue of matrix, the number of times it appears as a root of the characteristic polynomial is called the algebraic multiplicity. On the other hand, the geometric multiplicity is the dimension of the linear space of eigenvectors associated with that eigenvalue. If the former exceeds the latter, then the eigenvalue is said to be defective and the matrix becomes nondiagonalizable by any similarity transformation. The discrete-time of our dynamics is identified with the geometric multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue $\lambda_0=0$. Its algebraic multiplicity takes about half of the matrix size at $t=1$ and increases stepwise in time, which keeps excess to the geometric multiplicity until their coincidence at the final time. Our model exhibits relaxation processes from far-from-normal to near-normal matrices, in which the defectivity of $\lambda_0$ is recovering in time. We show that such processes are realized as size reductions of pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. Here the pseudospectra are the domains on the complex plane which are not necessarily exact spectra but in which the resolvent of matrix takes extremely large values. The defective eigenvalue $\lambda_0$ is sensitive to perturbation and the eigenvalues of the perturbed systems are distributed densely in the pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. By constructing generalized eigenspace for $\lambda_0$, we give the Jordan block decomposition for the resolvent of matrix and characterize the pseudospectrum dynamics. Numerical study of the systems perturbed by Gaussian random matrices supports the validity of the present analysis.</description>

      <title>Exact linearity of the macroscopic Hall current response in infinitely extended gapped fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an infinitely extended system of fermions on a $d$-dimensional lattice with (magnetic) translation-invariant short-range interactions. We further assume that the system has a unique gapped ground state. Physically, this is a model for the bulk of a generic topological insulator at zero temperature, and we are interested in the current response of such a system to a constant external electric field. Using the non-equilibrium almost-stationary states (NEASS) approach, we prove that the longitudinal current density induced by a constant electric field of strength $\varepsilon$ is of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$, i.e. the system is an insulator in the usual sense. For the Hall current density we show instead that it is linear in $\varepsilon$ up to terms of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$. The proportionality factor $\sigma_\mathrm{H}$ is by definition the Hall conductivity, and we show that it is given by a generalization of the well known double commutator formula to interacting systems. As a by-product of our results, we find that the Hall conductivity is constant within gapped phases, and that for $d=2$ the relevant observable that "measures" the Hall conductivity in experiments, the Hall conductance, not only agrees with $\sigma_H$ in expectation up to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$, but also has vanishing variance.
  A notable difference to several existing results on the current response in interacting fermion systems is that we consider a macroscopic system exposed to a small constant electric field, rather than to a small voltage drop.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06349v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectral variant of the quantum marginal problem asks: Given prescribed spectra for a set of overlapping quantum marginals, does there exist a compatible joint state? The main idea of this work is a symmetry-reduced semidefinite programming hierarchy that detects when when no such joint state exists. The hierarchy is complete, in the sense that it detects every incompatible set of spectra. The refutations it provides are dimension-free, certifying incompatibility in all local dimensions. The hierarchy also applies to the sums of Hermitian matrices problem, the compatibility of local unitary invariants, for certifying vanishing Kronecker coefficients, and to optimize over equivariant state polynomials.</description>

      <title>Energy preserving evolutions over Bosonic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13801v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exponential convergence to invariant subspaces of quantum Markov semigroups plays a crucial role in quantum information theory. One such example is in bosonic error correction schemes, where dissipation is used to drive states back to the code-space - an invariant subspace protected against certain types of errors. In this paper, we investigate perturbations of quantum dynamical semigroups that operate on continuous variable (CV) systems and admit an invariant subspace. First, we prove a generation theorem for quantum Markov semigroups on CV systems under the physical assumptions that (i) the generator is in GKSL form with corresponding jump operators defined as polynomials of annihilation and creation operators; and (ii) the (possibly unbounded) generator increases all moments in a controlled manner. Additionally, we show that the level sets of operators with bounded first moments are admissible subspaces of the evolution, providing the foundations for a perturbative analysis. Our results also extend to time-dependent semigroups and multi-mode systems. We apply our general framework to two settings of interest in continuous variable quantum information processing. First, we provide a new scheme for deriving continuity bounds on the energy-constrained capacities of Markovian perturbations of quantum dynamical semigroups. Second, we provide quantitative perturbation bounds for the steady state of the quantum Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup and the invariant subspace of the photon dissipation used in bosonic error correction.</description>

      <title>An efficient stochastic particle method for high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18666v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical resolution of high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs remains a huge challenge due to the curse of dimensionality. Starting from the weak formulation of the Lawson-Euler scheme, this paper proposes a stochastic particle method (SPM) by tracking the deterministic motion, random jump, resampling and reweighting of particles. Real-valued weighted particles are adopted by SPM to approximate the high-dimensional solution, which automatically adjusts the point distribution to intimate the relevant feature of the solution. A piecewise constant reconstruction with virtual uniform grid is employed to evaluate the nonlinear terms, which fully exploits the intrinsic adaptive characteristic of SPM. Combining both, SPM can achieve the goal of adaptive sampling in time. Numerical experiments on the 6-D Allen-Cahn equation and the 7-D Hamiltonian-Jacobi-Bellman equation demonstrate the potential of SPM in solving high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs efficiently while maintaining an acceptable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Classical integrability in the presence of a cosmological constant: analytic and machine learning results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the integrability of two-dimensional theories that are obtained by a dimensional reduction of certain four-dimensional gravitational theories describing the coupling of Maxwell fields and neutral scalar fields to gravity in the presence of a potential for the neutral scalar fields. For a certain solution subspace, we demonstrate partial integrability by showing that a subset of the equations of motion in two dimensions are the compatibility conditions for a linear system. Subsequently, we study the integrability of these two-dimensional models from a complementary one-dimensional point of view, framed in terms of Liouville integrability. In this endeavour, we employ various machine learning techniques to systematise our search for numerical Lax pair matrices for these models, as well as conserved currents expressed as functions of phase space variables.</description>

      <title>Uniform-in-time estimates on the size of chaos for interacting Brownian particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of classical Brownian particles interacting via a smooth long-range potential in the mean-field regime, and we analyze the propagation of chaos in form of sharp, uniform-in-time estimates on many-particle correlation functions. Our results cover both the kinetic Langevin setting and the corresponding overdamped Brownian dynamics. The approach is mainly based on so-called Lions expansions, which we combine with new diagrammatic tools to capture many-particle cancellations, as well as with fine ergodic estimates on the linearized mean-field equation, and with discrete stochastic calculus with respect to initial data. In the process, we derive some new ergodic estimates for the linearized Vlasov-Fokker-Planck kinetic equation that are of independent interest. Our analysis also leads to uniform-in-time concentration estimates and to a uniform-in-time quantitative central limit theorem for the empirical measure associated with the particle dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Ground State of the S=1 Antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Chain is Topologically Nontrivial if Gapped</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17041v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Under the widely accepted but unproven assumption that the one-dimensional S=1 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model has a unique gapped ground state, we prove that the model belongs to a nontrivial symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase. In other words, we rigorously rule out the possibility that the model has a unique gapped ground state that is topologically trivial. To be precise, we assume that the models on open finite chains with boundary magnetic field have unique ground states with a uniform gap and prove that the ground state of the infinite chain has a nontrivial topological index. This further implies the presence of a gapless edge excitation in the model on the half-infinite chain and the existence of a topological phase transition in the model that interpolates between the Heisenberg chain and the trivial model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, exact solutions of the nonlinear cubic-quintic Duffing-van der Pol oscillator with variable coefficients are obtained. Two approaches have been applied, one based on the factorization method combined with the Field Method, and a second one relying on Painlev\'e analysis. Both procedures allow us to find the same exact solutions to the problem. The Lagrangian formalism for this system is also derived. Moreover, some examples for particular choices of the time-dependent coefficients, and their corresponding general and particular exact solutions are presented.</description>

      <title>A Hodge Theory for Entanglement Cohomology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore and extend the application of homological algebra to describe quantum entanglement, initiated in arXiv:1901.02011, focusing on the Hodge-theoretic structure of entanglement cohomology in finite-dimensional quantum systems. We construct analogues of the Hodge star operator, inner product, codifferential, and Laplacian for entanglement $k$-forms. We also prove that such $k$-forms obey versions of the Hodge isomorphism theorem and Hodge decomposition, and that they exhibit Hodge duality. As a corollary, we conclude that the dimensions of the $k$-th and $(n-k)$-th cohomologies coincide for entanglement in $n$-partite pure states, which explains a symmetry property ("Poincare duality") of the associated Poincare polynomials.</description>

      <title>On the Unruh effect for hyperbolic observers in spacetimes of maximal proper acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, after the introduction of the notion of spacetime of maximal proper acceleration and its associated fundamental geometric and kinematic properties, the Unruh temperature formula is generalized to the case of hyperbolic observers in spacetimes of maximal proper acceleration. Such a generalization implies the existence of a maximal value for the Unruh temperature. We discuss this result for an electrodynamic model of point charged particle in a spacetime of maximal proper acceleration. It is shown that according to this mathematical model the maximal Unruh temperature must be of order $10^5\, K$ for current high acceleration gradient laser-plasma acceleration experiments.</description>

      <title>Efficient Eigenstate Preparation in an Integrable Model with Hilbert Space Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the preparation of all the eigenstates of spin chains using quantum circuits. It is known that generic eigenstates of free-fermionic spin chains can be prepared with circuits whose depth grows only polynomially with the length of the chain and the number of particles. We show that the polynomial growth is also achievable for selected interacting models where the interaction between the particles is sufficiently simple. Our working example is the folded XXZ model, an integrable spin chain that exhibits Hilbert space fragmentation. We present the explicit quantum circuits that prepare arbitrary eigenstates of this model on an open chain efficiently. We perform error-mitigated noisy simulations with circuits of up to 13 qubits and different connectivities between qubits, achieving a relative error below 5%. As a byproduct, we extend a recent reformulation of the Bethe ansatz as a quantum circuit from closed to open boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>A priori bounds for the dynamic fractional $\Phi^4$ model on $\mathbb{T}^3$ in the full subcritical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show a priori bounds for the dynamic fractional $\Phi^4$ model on $\mathbb{T}^3$ in the full subcritical regime using the framework of Hairer's regularity structures theory. Assuming the model bounds our estimates imply global existence of solutions and existence of an invariant measure. We extend the method developed for the usual heat operator by Chandra, Moinat and Weber [CMW23] to the fractional heat operator, thereby treating a more physically relevant model. A key ingredient in this work is the development of localised multilevel Schauder estimates for the fractional heat operator which is not covered by Hairer's original work. Furthermore, the algebraic arguments from [CMW23] are streamlined significantly.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous transformations in a gauged twistor formulation of a massive particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the mass-shell constraints in the gauged twistor formulation of a massive particle given in [Phys. Rev. D 93, 045016 (2016)] are incorporated in an action automatically by extending the local $U(2)$ transformation to its inhomogeneous extension denoted by $IU(2)$. Therefore it turns out that all the necessary constraints are incorporated into an action by virtue of the local $IU(2)$ symmetry of the system.</description>
