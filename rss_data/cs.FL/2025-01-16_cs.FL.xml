      <title>Mining Diamonds in labeled Transition Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Labeled transition systems can be a great way to visualize the complex behavior of parallel and communicating systems. However, if, during a particular timeframe, no synchronization or communication between processes occurs, then multiple parallel sequences of actions are able to interleave arbitrarily, and the resulting graph quickly becomes too complex for the human eye to understand easily. With that in mind, we propose an exact formalization of these arbitrary interleavings, and an algorithm to find all said interleavings in deterministic LTSs, to reduce the visual complexity of labeled transition systems.</description>

      <title>Cellular automata can really solve the parity problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining properties of an arbitrary binary sequence is a challenging task if only local processing is allowed. Among these properties, the determination of the parity of 1s by distributed consensus has been a recurring endeavour in the context of automata networks. In its most standard formulation, a one-dimensional cellular automaton rule should process any odd-sized cyclic configuration and lead the lattice to converge to the homogeneous fixed point of 0s if the parity of 1s is even and to the homogeneous fixed point of 1s, otherwise. The only known solution to this problem with a single rule was given by Betel, de Oliveira and Flocchini (coined BFO rule after the authors' initials). However, three years later the authors of the BFO rule realised that the rule would fail for some specific configuration and proposed a computationally sound fix, but a proof could not be worked out. Here we provide another fix to the BFO rule along with a full proof, therefore reassuring that a single-rule solution to the problem really does exist.</description>

      <title>The Hurt-Sada Array and Zeckendorf Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wesley Ivan Hurt and Ali Sada both independently proposed studying an infinite array where the $0$'th row consists of the non-negative integers $0,1,2,\ldots$ in increasing order. Thereafter the $n$'th row is formed from the $(n-1)$'th row by "jumping" the single entry $n$ by $n$ places to the right. Sada also defined a sequence $s(n)$ defined to be the first number that $n$ jumps over. In this note I show how the Hurt-Sada array and Sada's sequence are intimately connected with the golden ratio $\varphi$ and Zeckendorf representation. I also consider a number of related sequences.</description>

      <title>Completing the picture for the Skolem Problem on order-4 linear recurrence sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For almost a century, the decidability of the Skolem Problem - that is, the problem of finding whether a given linear recurrence sequence (LRS) has a zero term - has remained open. A breakthrough in the 1980s established that the Skolem Problem is indeed decidable for algebraic LRS of order at most 3, and real algebraic LRS of order at most 4. However, for general algebraic LRS of order 4 the question of decidability has remained open. Our main contribution in this paper is to prove decidability for this last case, i.e. we show that the Skolem Problem is decidable for all algebraic LRS of order at most 4.</description>

      <title>Reward Machines for Deep RL in Noisy and Uncertain Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00120v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reward Machines provide an automaton-inspired structure for specifying instructions, safety constraints, and other temporally extended reward-worthy behaviour. By exposing the underlying structure of a reward function, they enable the decomposition of an RL task, leading to impressive gains in sample efficiency. Although Reward Machines and similar formal specifications have a rich history of application towards sequential decision-making problems, they critically rely on a ground-truth interpretation of the domain-specific vocabulary that forms the building blocks of the reward function--such ground-truth interpretations are elusive in the real world due in part to partial observability and noisy sensing. In this work, we explore the use of Reward Machines for Deep RL in noisy and uncertain environments. We characterize this problem as a POMDP and propose a suite of RL algorithms that exploit task structure under uncertain interpretation of the domain-specific vocabulary. Through theory and experiments, we expose pitfalls in naive approaches to this problem while simultaneously demonstrating how task structure can be successfully leveraged under noisy interpretations of the vocabulary.</description>

      <title>Compositional Automata Embeddings for Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning is a powerful way to control an AI agent's behavior at runtime. That said, popular goal representations, e.g., target states or natural language, are either limited to Markovian tasks or rely on ambiguous task semantics. We propose representing temporal goals using compositions of deterministic finite automata (cDFAs) and use cDFAs to guide RL agents. cDFAs balance the need for formal temporal semantics with ease of interpretation: if one can understand a flow chart, one can understand a cDFA. On the other hand, cDFAs form a countably infinite concept class with Boolean semantics, and subtle changes to the automaton can result in very different tasks, making them difficult to condition agent behavior on. To address this, we observe that all paths through a DFA correspond to a series of reach-avoid tasks and propose pre-training graph neural network embeddings on "reach-avoid derived" DFAs. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed pre-training method enables zero-shot generalization to various cDFA task classes and accelerated policy specialization without the myopic suboptimality of hierarchical methods.</description>
