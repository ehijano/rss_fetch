      <title>On mathematical aspects of surface correction via ion beam etching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the ion beam dwell time calculation problem in Ion Beam Figuring we suggest a mathematical framework for solving a specific type of inverse problems, which appear in various areas of applied mathematics and physics. From the point of view of functional analysis we deal with a linear operator equation, which, taking advantage of the observation that the associated operator, acting from the space of dwell times into the space of measurement data, is close to a finite-dimensional one, can be solved employing the pseudoinverse operator. For the main case of interest we describe the behavior of the singular vectors inside the domain, on which measurement data are given, which turn out to be close to functions $e^{ikx}$. Heuristically, these singular vectors are similar to eigenfunctions of the infinitely deep quantum well. An alternative problem formulation, closer to practical calculations, utilizes reconstructing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) and radial basis functions, which are used for pointwise approximation of measurement data and ensuing dwell time determination. Depending on the particularities of the concrete problem either framework or a suitable combination of each can be used.</description>

      <title>Finite-rank conformal quantum mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the simplest example of the landscape of conformal field theories: one-dimensional CFTs with finite-dimensional state space. Following the definition of quantum field theory given by G. Segal, we formulate the condition under which a one-dimensional QFT (quantum mechanics) possesses conformal symmetry, and we give a complete classification of conformal Hamiltonians with finite rank. It turns out that correlation functions in such theories are polynomial functions of the underlying geometric data. Moreover, the one-dimensional conformal Ward identities determine their scaling behavior, so that the correlators of the conformal observables are, in fact, homogeneous polynomials.</description>

      <title>Boundary structure of gauge fields on asymptotically AdS spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study boundary structure of asymptotically AdS gravity and (gauge) fields defined on this background by employing the gauge PDE approach. The essential step of the construction is the incorporation of the boundary-defining function among the fields of the theory, which allows us to realise the asymptotic boundary as a space-time submanifold by employing the gauge PDE implementation of Penrose's concept of asymptotically-simple space. In so doing the gauge PDE describing the boundary structure is obtained by restricting to the boundary of spacetime and simultaneously restricting to the boundary of the field space by setting the boundary defining function to zero. To implement this step systematically we introduce a notion of $Q$-boundary which seems to be new. The main concrete result of this work is the construction of the efficient boundary calculus, which gives a recursive procedure to obtain the explicit form of the equations satisfied by the boundary fields and their gauge transformations for boundary dimension $d \geq 3$. These include obstruction equations (such as Bach equation or Yang-Mills equation for $d=4$) and generalised conservation equations in the subleading sector. In particular, we derive the explicit form of the higher conformal Yang-Mills equation for $d=8$. The approach is very general and, in principle, applies to generic (gauge) fields on the Einstein gravity background producing a conformally-invariant gauge theory on the boundary, which describes their boundary structure. It can be considered as an extension of the Fefferman-Graham construction that takes into account both the leading and the subleading sector of the bulk fields.</description>

      <title>Randomness before Probability, Quantised Gas Laws Directly from Objective Martin-Lof Randomness of Detailed Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that objective Martin-Lof randomness and Kolmogorov complexity of instantaneous detailed data lists for $N$ helium gas atoms on $M$ possible energies is necessary and sufficient to directly write down its Helmholtz free energy and thus all thermostatics of the gas. We show that such theory formally precedes application of probability and statistics. Each datum in a list is distinct if $N,M$ are formally well defined and with passive monitoring of thermostatic variables only, each is to be intrinsic. In this introductory paper we consider a low density cool gas of noninteracting He atoms in quantum and classical regimes. Objective definitions of detailed disorder and of thermostatic entropy arise for gas in spontaneous detailed motion along with new insights into irreversible processes and an objective Second Law. Algorithmic probability is rigorously associated with Kolmogorov complexity. A condition for equal a priori probability naturally arises and Fermi-Dirac quantum statistics follows from Martin-Lof randomness.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Theory of Surface Elasticity and Anelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we formulate a geometric theory of elasticity and anelasticity for bodies containing material surfaces with their own elastic energies and distributed surface eigenstrains. Bulk elasticity is written in the language of Riemannian geometry, and the framework is extended to material surfaces by using the differential geometry of hypersurfaces in Riemannian manifolds. Within this setting, surface kinematics, surface strain measures, surface material metric, and the induced second fundamental form follow naturally from the embedding of the material surface in the material manifold. The classical theory of surface elasticity of Gurtin and Murdoch (1975) is revisited and reformulated in this geometric framework, and then extended to anelastic bodies with anelastic material surfaces. Constitutive equations for isotropic and anisotropic material surfaces are formulated systematically, and bulk and surface anelasticity are introduced by replacing the elastic metrics with their anelastic counterparts. The balance laws are derived variationally using the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle. These include the bulk balance of linear momentum together with the surface balance of linear momentum, whose normal component gives a generalized Laplace's law. As an application, we obtain the complete solution for a spherical incompressible isotropic solid ball containing a cavity filled with a compressible hyperelastic fluid, where the cavity boundary is an anelastic material surface with distributed surface eigenstrains. The analytical and numerical results quantify the effects of surface and fluid eigenstrains on the pressure-stretch response and residual stress.</description>

      <title>Charge functions for high dimensional partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To construct a BPS algebra with representations furnished by n-dimensional partitions, the first step is to construct the eigenvalue of the Cartan operators acting on them. The generating function of the eigenvalues are called the charge function. It has an important property that for each partition, the poles of the function correspond to the projection of the boxes which can be added to or removed from the partition legally. The charge functions of lower dimensional partitions, i.e., Young diagrams for 2D, plane partitions for 3D and solid partitions for 4D, are already given in the literature. In this paper, we propose an expression of the charge function for arbitrary odd dimensional partitions and have it proved for 5D case. Some explicit numerical tests for 7D and 9D case are also conducted to confirm our formula.</description>

      <title>Bethe equations for the critical three-state Potts spin chain with toroidal boun dary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the parameterization of the spectra of the three-state critical Potts quantum chain with integrable twisted boundary conditions in terms of Bethe ansatz type equations. The Bethe equations are found by investigating the structure of the eigenvalues of the respective twisted transfer matrices, and with the help of certain identities satisfied by the product of transfer matrix operators. We have studied the completeness of the spectrum in terms of the Bethe roots for small lattice sizes and have computed the eigenstate momenta. We found that the spins of the low-lying excitations can have fractional values in accordance with predictions of the underlying conformal field theory. We argue that our framework can be used to build integrable Hamiltonians whose spectra are determined by mixing different toroidal boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Two-spinon effects on the thermal Tonks-Girardeau gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20929v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of the two-spinon excitations on the field-field correlator of the Tonks-Girardeau gas. While these excitations have been previously examined in the ground state of the system, their role at finite temperatures remains unexplored. Here, we extend the analysis to the one-dimensional interacting Bose gas at thermal equilibrium, focusing on the one-body correlation function of the infinitely repulsive Lieb-Liniger model. We demonstrate that two-spinon excitations, characterized by two holes within the rapidity distribution, constitute the dominant contribution to the field-field correlator at low temperatures. Furthermore, we analytically show that incorporating additional particle-hole excitations diminishes their contribution, highlighting the efficacy of the two-spinon framework in capturing the essential physics of the system. Numerical evaluations of both the Fredholm determinant and the spectral sum stemming from the two-spinon program, with the addition of particle-hole excitations, reveal convergence at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Isoperiodic deformations of Abelian differentials of the second kind over elliptic curves and the Boussinesq equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study deformations of a genus one Riemann surface and of a second order Abelian differential on the surface which preserve the periods of the differential with respect to a chosen canonical homology basis of the surface. We call these deformations isoperiodic. We derive a second order ordinary differential equation with rational coefficients governing the variations of the position of the unique pole of the differential under the isoperiodic deformations. The obtained equation depends on the order of the pole of the differential. We characterize the solutions of the obtained ordinary differential equations that correspond to the isoperiodic deformations. We apply these results to the theory of genus one solutions to the Boussinesq equation.</description>

      <title>Deformations of the Hill curves and isoperiodicity in the KdV and the sine-Gordon equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a family of genus $g$ hyperelliptic curves as double ramified coverings over the Riemann sphere with the set of branch points of the form $\{0, \infty, x_1, \dots, x_g, u_1, \dots, u_g\}$. The branch point at infinity $P_\infty$ is selected to be a marked point on the Riemann surfaces. A meromorphic differential $\Omega$ with a unique pole being of order two at $P_\infty$, is completely defined by the values of half of its periods, the $a$-periods. Fixing values of $a$-periods of $\Omega$, we then find a continuous subfamily in the considered family of hyperelliptic curves along which all the periods of $\Omega$ are constant. This subfamily is defined by the functions $u_j(x_1, \dots, x_g)$, while $x_1, \dots, x_g$ are independent parameters. We derive a system of differential equations for the functions $u_j(x_1, \dots, x_g)$, which, remarkably, has rational coefficients. We call this subfamily the isoperiodic deformations of the hyperelliptic curves relative to the given differential of the second kind $\Omega.$ We deduce necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of isoperiodic deformations. We discuss reality conditions as well. Using the obtained results, we solve the following problem for the Korteweg-de Vries and sine-Gordon equations: starting from an algebro-geometric data which generate a real periodic solution of a period $T$, how to deform the data, so that the associated solutions remain periodic with the same period $T$.</description>

      <title>Highly robust logical qubit encoding in an ensemble of V-symmetrical qutrits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose using even and odd Sch\"odinger cat states formed from coherent states of U(3) of an ensemble of qutrits with a symmetrical V-configuration (a qubit-disguised qutrit) to encode a logical qubit. These carefully engineered logical qubit states are parameter independent stationary states of the effective master equation governing the evolution of the ensemble and, consequently, constitute dark states and are invulnerable to dissipation and correlated collective dephasing. In particular, the logical qubit states are immune to single qutrit decay (the analogous of single photon loss process for qutrits) and simultaneous decay and driving of two qutrits (the analogous two-photon loss and driving processes for qutrits). In addition, we show how to implement the single-qubit quantum NOT gate and the Hadamard gate followed by either the phase gate or the phase and $Z$ gates. We study analytically the case of two qutrits and conclude that the logical qubit states exhibit parity-sensitive inhomogeneous broadening and local correlated dephasing: the even logical state is completely immune to these processes, while odd one is vulnerable. Nevertheless, in the presence of these interactions one can also define another odd state with mixed permutation symmetry that is immune to both inhomogeneous broadening and local correlated dephasing. We suggest that these results can be extrapolated to an arbitrary number of qutrits. The effective master equation is deduced from a physical system composed of two parametrically coupled cavities with one of them interacting dispersively with an ensemble of three-level atoms (the qutrits). In principle this physical system can be implemented by means of two coplanar waveguide resonators, a SQUID parametrically coupling them, and a cloud of alkali atoms close to one of the resonators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By defining a graded global R-operator $\mathbb{R}_{ab}^{(2D,2S)}$ that couples free-fermion structures and incorporates anisotropic Hubbard interactions while satisfying the Yang--Baxter equation, we construct a strictly solvable two-dimensional lattice model. We then build the layer-to-layer transfer matrix through a bidirectional-monodromy construction and prove the model's integrability via the associated global RTT relations. Using the nested algebraic Bethe ansatz, we obtain the exact eigenvalues of the transfer matrix and derive the corresponding first- and second-level Bethe equations. Finally, by taking the logarithmic derivative of the transfer matrix at the regular point, we recover explicitly a local Hamiltonian that features anisotropic hopping, an on-site Hubbard interaction, and orbital-coupling contributions.</description>

      <title>The Two-Sheeted Topology of Extended Kerr-Type Spacetimes and a Parity-of-Crossings Property for Ring-Traversing Geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the global structure of the extended Kerr spacetime and of a broader class of Kerr-type spacetimes possessing ring singularities. By working with the elementary analytic extension (the union of the interior and exterior regions glued across the disk), we show that excising the ring singularity yields a domain that can be realised as a branched double cover of an exterior Kerr region. The branch locus is the ring itself, and the associated deck transformation defines a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$-action that exchanges the two sheets ($r&gt;0$ and $r&lt;0$) of the spacetime.
  We give a covering-space characterisation of this double-sheeted structure and show that admissible geodesics which cross the ring singularity implement the non-trivial deck transformation. In particular, we prove a parity-of-crossings property: any admissible geodesic that traverses an even number of ring singularities returns to its original sheet, while an odd number of traversals terminates on the opposite sheet.
  Generalising to $N$ disjoint ring singularities, we prove that the fundamental group of the excised manifold is the free group $F_N$ generated by simple loops around each ring, and we classify the associated double covers. Identifying the physically distinguished cover where every ring induces a sheet exchange, we extend the parity-of-crossings theorem to the multi-ring setting. We then formally extend these results to the maximal analytic extension (the infinite Carter--Penrose chain), proving that the sheet-exchange mechanism applies globally to this infinite structure.
  Finally, applying the Novikov self-consistency principle to this topological framework, we demonstrate that the requirement of global consistency restricts admissible histories to discrete sectors labelled by ring-crossing parities.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Induced Vacuum Polarization and Mode Shifts in Maxwell-Klein-Gordon Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric confinement is known to modify single-particle dynamics through effective potentials, yet its imprint on the interacting quantum vacuum remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the Maxwell--Klein--Gordon system constrained to curved surfaces and demonstrate that the geometric potential $\Sigma_{\mathrm{geom}}(\mathbf{r})$ acts as a local renormalization environment. We show that extrinsic curvature modifies the scalar loop spectrum, entering the vacuum polarization as a position-dependent mass correction $M^2(\mathbf{r}) \to m^2 + \Sigma_{\mathrm{geom}}(\mathbf{r})$. This induces a finite, gauge-invariant ``geometry-induced running'' of the electromagnetic response. In the long-wavelength regime ($|{\bf Q}|R \ll 1$), we derive a closed-form expression for the relative frequency shift $\Delta\omega/\omega$, governed by the overlap between the electric energy density and the geometric potential. Applying this formalism to Gaussian bumps, cylindrical shells, and tori, we identify distinct spectral signatures that distinguish these quantum loop corrections from classical geometric optics. Our results suggest that spatial curvature can serve as a tunable knob for ``vacuum engineering,'' offering measurable shifts in high-$Q$ cavities and plasmonic systems.</description>

      <title>Varied Branches of Nondegenerate Vector Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our study on nondegenerate dark-bright-bright solitons in a three-component Manakov model with repulsive interactions reveals the existence of diverse branches of nondegenerate vector solitons. For fixed bright component particle numbers and a given soliton velocity, the nondegenerate dark-bright-bright solitons exhibit four distinct branches with different density profiles and phase distributions, comprising two positive mass branches and two negative mass branches. The energy-velocity dispersion relation of each pair of positive- and one negative-mass branches form a closed loop, resulting in two mutually independent loops for the soliton's overall dispersion. All soliton branches share a common maximal velocity, which is determined by the larger bright soliton particle number. Linear stability analysis shows that all these branches are stable against weak perturbations. Extending to an $N$-component Manakov system, the nondegenerate solitons have $2^{N-1}$ distinct branches, of which $2^{N-2}$ branches solitons is positive mass and $2^{N-2}$ branches solitons is negative mass. Each pair of positive- and negative-mass branches form a closed dispersion relation loop, so that the vector solitons have $2^{N-2}$ disjoint loops. These results uncover the rich branches and interesting dispersion relations of nondegenerate vector solitons in multi-component models.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Standard Quantum Detailed Balance and Thermodynamically Consistent Entropy Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that if a quantum Markovian semigroup satisfies the standard quantum detailed balance condition, its generator admits a special representation that yields a vanishing entropy production rate. Conversely, if the generator admits a special representation adhering to the condition of thermodynamic consistency and leading to a vanishing entropy production rate, then the corresponding quantum Markovian semigroup must satisfy the standard quantum detailed balance condition. In this context, we adopt the definition of entropy production rate that is motivated by the physics literature and standard for thermodynamically consistent Lindbladians.</description>

Abstract: We find a weaker condition on spectral measures, "eventual absolute continuity", that ensure quantum delocalization as in the RAGE Theorem in the case of purely absolutely continuous spectrum. We then adapt these idea to strongly improve some phase-averaged delocalization bounds for the Fibonacci quasicrystal.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transport of a Free Quantum Particle and its Shape Space Interpretation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A solution of the free Schr\"odinger equation is investigated by means of Optimal transport. The curve of probability measures $\mu_t$ this solution defines is shown to be an absolutely continuous curve in the Wasserstein space $W_2(\mathbb{R}^3)$. The optimal transport map from $\mu_t$ to $\mu_s$, the cost for this transport (i.e. the Wasserstein distance) and the value of the Fisher information along $\mu_t$ are being calculated. It is finally shown that this solution of the free Schr\"odinger equation can naturally be interpreted as a curve in so-called Shape space, which forgets any positioning in space but only describes properties of shapes. In Shape space, $\mu_t$ continues to be a shortest path geodesic.</description>

      <title>$L_\infty$-algebraic extensions of non-Lorentzian kinematical Lie algebras, gravities, and brane couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Newtonian limit of Newton-Cartan gravity relies crucially on the Lie-algebraic central extension to the Galilean algebra, namely the Bargmann algebra. Lie-algebraic central extensions naturally generalise to $L_\infty$-algebraic central extensions, which in turn classify branes in superstring theory via the brane bouquet. This paper classifies all $L_\infty$-algebraic central extensions of all kinematical Lie algebras that do not depend on the spatial rotation generators as well as all iterated central extensions thereof (for codimensions $\le3$). The Bargmann central extension of the Galilean algebra then appears as merely one term in a sequence of $L_\infty$-algebraic central extensions in each degree; a similar situation obtains for the Newton-Hooke algebra and the static algebra, but not for the Carrollian algebra nor those kinematical Lie algebras that are not Wigner-\.In\"on\"u deformations of a simple algebra.
  The sequence of $L_\infty$-algebraic central extensions in each degree then corresponds to a tower of $p$-form fields. After imposing conventional constraints, the zero-form field provides absolute time, and the higher-form fields are certain wedge products of the field strengths of the one-form (Bargmann) gravitational field. These then provide natural $(p-1)$-brane couplings to the corresponding non-Lorentzian gravities, which are found to produce velocity-dependent gravitational effects in the presence of torsion. The $L_\infty$-algebraic cocycles also provide Wess-Zumino-Witten terms for the $(p-1)$-brane action, which require the introduction of doubled spatial coordinates that are reminiscent of double field theory, but which (in some cases at least, and given appropriate kinetic terms) do not result in doubled physics.</description>

      <title>Phase Space Modeling of Extended Sources Based on Wigner Distribution and Hamiltonian Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise modeling of extended sources is a central challenge in modern optical engineering, laser physics, and computational lithography. Unlike ideal point sources or completely incoherent thermal radiation sources, real-world light sources -- such as high-power laser diode arrays, superluminescent diodes (SLD), extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography sources, and beams transmitted through atmospheric turbulence -- typically exhibit partial spatial coherence.
  Traditional geometric optics based on ray tracing ignores diffraction and interference effects; while classical wave optics is accurate, the computational cost of handling four-dimensional correlation functions for partially coherent fields is enormous. To balance computational efficiency and physical accuracy, phase space optics provides a unified theoretical framework. By introducing the Wigner distribution function (WDF), we can map the light field into a joint space-time-spatial frequency domain $(\bm{r}, \bm{p})$. This description not only retains all the information of wave optics (including interference terms) but also naturally transitions to the ray description of Hamiltonian optics in the short-wavelength limit, governed by Liouville's theorem of phase space volume conservation.
  This report aims to establish optimal modeling methods based on phase space and Hamiltonian optics for different types of extended sources such as partially coherent light, fully coherent light, and quasi-homogeneous light. The report will derive in detail the mathematical models for each source type and provide strict criteria for the applicability of geometric optics models using mathematical tools such as the Moyal expansion and generalized Fresnel number.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with potential and dispersion given by arbitrary functions: Reductions and exact solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper deals with nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations of the general form, depending on time and two spatial variables, the potential and dispersion of which are specified by one or two arbitrary functions. The equations under consideration naturally generalize a number of related nonlinear partial differential equations that occur in various areas of theoretical physics, including nonlinear optics, superconductivity, and plasma physics. Two- and one-dimensional reductions are described, which lead the studied nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations to simpler equations of lower dimension or ordinary differential equations (or systems of ordinary differential equations). Using methods of generalized and functional separation of variables, a number of new exact solutions of two-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations of the general form are found, which are expressed in quadratures or elementary functions. To analyze the equations under consideration, both Cartesian and polar coordinate systems are utilized. Special attention is paid to finding solutions with radial symmetry. The exact solutions obtained in this work can be used as test problems intended to assess the accuracy of numerical and approximate analytical methods for solving complex nonlinear PDEs of mathematical physics.</description>

      <title>On the Role of the Canonical Transformation in the Single-Channel Kondo Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This pedagogical work presents the significant role that canonical transformation plays in the interpretation of the Abelian bosonized single-channel SU(2) Kondo model, emphasizing its effect on the scaling dimension $\Delta$. The transformation shifts the longitudinal exchange coupling and modifies the scaling dimension of the spin-flip vertex $\tau_{\pm} e^{\pm i\beta \phi}$. Rather than fixing $\Delta$ to the fermionic value $\tfrac{1}{2}$, we keep $\alpha$ explicit, which allows us to identify how different choices lead to marginal or relevant regimes through $(1-\Delta(\alpha))J_\perp$. This approach offers a direct way to trace the scaling behavior from the bosonized Hamiltonian and shows how the RG flow connects to the definition of the Kondo temperature, where the resistance diverges, without switching to other methods.</description>

      <title>On the emergence of preferred structures in quantum theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assess the possibilities offered by Hilbert space fundamentalism, an attitude towards quantum physics according to which all physical structures (e.g. subsystems, locality, spacetime, preferred observables) should emerge from minimal quantum ingredients (typically a Hilbert space, Hamiltonian, and state). As a case study, we first mainly focus on the specific question of whether the Hamiltonian can uniquely determine a tensor product structure, a crucial challenge in the growing field of quantum mereology. The present paper reviews, clarifies, and critically examines two apparently conflicting theorems by Cotler et al. and Stoica. We resolve the tension, show how the former has been widely misinterpreted and why the latter is correct only in some weaker version. We then propose a correct mathematical way to address the general problem of preferred structures in quantum theory, relative to the characterization of emergent objects by unitary-invariant properties. Finally, we apply this formalism in the particular case we started with, and show that a Hamiltonian and a state are enough structure to uniquely select a preferred tensor product structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binet's equation provides a direct way to obtain the geometric shape of orbits in a central force field. It is well known that in Newtonian gravitation Binet's equation leads to all the conic curves as solutions for an inverse-square force. In this work, we show how Binet's equation arises from the horizontal and vertical infinitesimal displacements of a body in free fall and in inertial motion. This derivation uses elementary concepts of infinitesimal calculus. Second, we derive the relativistic version of Binet's equation for the Schwarzschild-(anti-)de Sitter metric. This derivation, which is novel, directly relates the coordinates involved in Binet's equation without the need to introduce potentials or the use of Killing vectors. Finally, we tackle some controversies related to the role of the cosmological constant in the trajectory of photons in a Schwarzschild-(anti-)de Sitter or even in Reissner-Nordstr\"om-(anti-)de Sitter spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: For the Ising model defined on $a\mathbb{Z}^2$ at critical temperature with external field $a^{15/8}h$, we give a simple and elementary proof that its truncated two-point function decays exponentially. The proof combines the high temperature expansion, random-cluster and random current representations. A new input in the proof is that, in the near-critical sourceless single current measure, there are many loops formed by a path on $a\mathbb{Z}^2$ with diameter of order $1$, together with two external edges that connect the path's endpoints to the ghost.</description>

Abstract: We construct a factorization algebra, via the factorization envelope, starting from a Lie conformal algebra, and prove that the associated vertex algebra is isomorphic to its enveloping vertex algebra. Our construction generalizes the Kac--Moody factorization algebra of Costello--Gwilliam and the Virasoro factorization algebra of Williams. Moreover, by considering the super analogue of this construction, we obtain new factorization algebras corresponding to vertex superalgebras, such as the Neveu--Schwarz vertex superalgebra and the $N=2$ vertex superalgebra.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Scattering and Integrability: A Hyperboloidal Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrability structures are known to play a key role in one-dimensional scattering. In the Schwarzschild gravitational context, the analysis emphasizing the role of the so-called Darboux covariance and its intimate connection with KdV conserved quantities was recently introduced by Lenzi &amp; Sopuerta. In a second stage, together with Jaramillo, this led in particular to the identification of the structural role of the "KdV-Virasoro-Schwarzian derivative" triangle in this problem. Such a gravitational scattering description dwells naturally on a Cauchy foliation of the spacetime. In the following, we first review--for the Schwarzschild background--this problem in a hyperboloidal foliation scheme, where the infinitesimal time generator of the dynamics is a non-selfadjoint operator. Then, we explore the underlying integrability features through a Lax-pair formulation. Specifically, the main results presented here are i) the explicit proposal of a weak Lax-pair, valid under suitable conditions involving fields at null infinity, with ii) the construction of the associated infinite sequence of isospectral flows. From a broader perspective, the very form of the non-selfadjoint infinitesimal time operator, which neatly separates into two components corresponding to bulk and boundary structures, paves the way for the description of the gravitational dynamics in terms of a "semi-direct action" of bulk degrees of freedom onto boundary degrees of freedom. This is akin to the "wave-mean flow" approach for black hole strong-gravity dynamics recently proposed in this line of research.</description>

      <title>Hirota-tau and Heun-function framework for Dirac vacuum polarization and quantum stabilization of kinks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a modified affine Toda model coupled to matter (ATM) which includes a scalar self-interacting potential and demonstrate that its first-order integro-differential structure, preserving a deformed Noether-topological current correspondence, provides a consistent framework for fermion-soliton interactions. In this formulation, the fermion-soliton energy is proportional to the soliton's topological charge. We show that fermionic back-reaction and the self-interacting scalar critically shape the fermion-kink energy, the in-gap bound-state spectrum, and the fermionic vacuum-polarization energy, yielding well-defined stability minima of the total energy as functions of the fermion and scalar masses and coupling parameters. A key result is that the Heun-equation formalism is necessary to construct nonzero-energy bound and scattering states: unlike the tau-function method, which captures only the zero mode, the Heun approach encodes the full scattering data through local solution matching conditions. These results refine the spectral analysis of deformed integrable models. The stability of soliton-fermion configurations has direct implications for topologically protected states in quantum information and condensed-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation from the Kurth solution in galactic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It will be shown that there exists an infinite-dimensional continuum ${\cal C}$ of weak static solutions of the Vlasov-Poisson system that bifurcates from the Kurth solution. Each $f_\ast\in {\cal C}$ has the charge density $\rho_{f_\ast}=\rho_{{\rm Kurth}}$, and (like the Kurth solution itself) each $f_\ast$ is surrounded by time-periodic weak solutions.</description>

      <title>Loop Corrected Supercharges from Holomorphic Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the loop corrections to supercharges in supersymmetric quantum field theories using the holomorphic twist formalism. We begin by reviewing the relation between supercharge corrections and the "twice-generalized" Konishi anomaly, which corrects the semi-chiral ring. In the holomorphic twist, these corrections appear as BRST anomalies and are computed using the higher operations of an underlying $L_\infty$ conformal algebra. We then apply this formalism to obtain the complete one-loop corrections to the supercharge of four-dimensional Lagrangian supersymmetric gauge theories, including $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, where it admits a remarkably compact expression in terms of superfields.</description>

      <title>Caustics in the spherically symmetric Einstein-dust system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Caustics-envelopes formed by the trajectories of fluid particles-arise in proposed dynamical extensions for shell-crossing singularities occurring in the Einstein-dust system. In this study, a local existence result is established, describing the dynamics in a neighbourhood of such caustics. Specifically, we obtain spherically symmetric spacetimes $(M,g_{\mu\nu})$ containing a caustic $\mathcal{C}$, which, in the quotient $M/SO(3)$, is a timelike curve forming a singular boundary between a 2-dust region and a vacuum region. The spacetimes are constructed from solutions to a PDE problem posed with a spacelike direction of evolution. Curvature invariants and energy densities diverge as the caustic is approached. Consequently the metric has limited regularity $g\in C^{1,1/2}$ and is shown to satisfy Einstein's equation weakly. On the complement of the caustic, the metric is smooth and satisfies Einstein's equation classically. A (degenerate) coordinate system is identified in which the dynamical variables are smooth with extension to the caustic. Finally, a novel family of static, spherically symmetric spacetimes is identified, complementing the local construction above. Each spacetime contains an eternal annular 2-dust region bounded by a pair of caustics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study semiclassical 1-D Schr\"odinger operators of the form $Pu = -h^2 u'' \,+\,x^\gamma W(x) u$ on a finite interval $[0,b]$ for $0 &lt; \gamma \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$. We show that that the WKB expansions of solution can be extended on $[h^{1-\epsilon},b]$, for any $\epsilon&gt;0$. Using a different approximation near $0$ and a matching procedure, we obtain the Cauchy Data at $0$ of such WKB solutions. This allows us to derive singular Bohr-Sommerfeld rules. We also pay special attention to uniformity in $W$ for our expansions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a bulk--boundary correspondence for translation-invariant stabilizer states in arbitrary spatial dimension, formulated in the framework of modules over Laurent polynomial rings. To each stabilizer state restricted to half-space geometry we associate a boundary operator module. Boundary operator modules provide examples of quasi-symplectic modules, which are objects of independent mathematical interest. In their study, we use ideas from algebraic L-theory in a setting involving non-projective modules and non-unimodular forms. Our results about quasi-symplectic modules in one spatial dimension allow us to resolve the conjecture that every stabilizer state in two dimensions is characterized by a corresponding abelian anyon model with gappable boundary. Our techniques are also applicable beyond two dimensions, such as in the study of fractons.</description>

      <title>Numerical computation of the density of states of aperiodic multiscale Schr\"odinger operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing the electronic structure of incommensurate materials is a central challenge in condensed matter physics, requiring efficient ways to approximate spectral quantities such as the density of states (DoS). In this paper, we numerically investigate two distinct approaches for approximating the DoS of incommensurate Hamiltonians for small values of the incommensurability parameters $\epsilon$ (e.g., small twist angle, or small lattice mismatch): the first employs a momentum-space decomposition, and the second exploits a semiclassical expansion with respect to $\epsilon$. In particular, we compare these two methods using a 1D toy model. We check their consistency by comparing the asymptotic expansion terms of the DoS, and it is shown that, for full DoS, the two methods exhibit good agreement in the small $\epsilon$ limit, while discrepancies arise for less small $\epsilon$, which indicates the importance of higher-order corrections in the semiclassical method for such regimes. We find these discrepancies to be caused by oscillations in the DoS at the semiclassical analogues of Van Hove singularities, which can be explained qualitatively, and quantitatively for $\epsilon$ small enough, by a semiclassical approach.</description>

Abstract: Any given system of ordinary differential equations in $n$-dimensional configuration space can be obtained from a peculiar variational problem with one local symmetry. The obtained action functional leads to the Hamiltonian formulation in $(4n+2)$-dimensional phase space. As concrete examples, we discuss the cases of Lagrange-d'Alembert equations with nonlinear nonholonomic constraints, as well as the equations of motion with dissipative (frictional) forces.</description>

      <title>A Self Propelled Vortex Dipole Model on a Catenoid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate vortex dipoles on surfaces of variable negative curvature, focusing on a catenoid of arbitrary throat radius as a concrete example. We construct the effective dynamical system including mutual and geometric self-interaction terms and show that the resulting Hamiltonian dynamics makes dipoles follow catenoid geodesics, in agreement with recent works, Gustafsson (J. Nonlinear Sci. 32, 62, 2022) and by Drivas, Glukhovskiy and Khesin (Int. Math. Res. Not. 2024, 14, 10880-10894). We utilize the symplectic structure to find a conserved momentum map J related to the U(1) symmetry along the azimuthal direction. We verify the conservation of both the Hamiltonian and this momentum for arbitrary throat radius. We then demonstrate direct and exchange scattering of classical vortices on the catenoid, and we contrast this with the collective rotational motion (with azimuthal drift) that arises for chiral pairs. Finally, we build a finite-dipole dynamical system on the catenoid and show that the self-propulsion terms emerge to leading order in the dipole size. This provides a concrete realization, on a curved minimal surface, of the intuitive statement that a finite dipole propels orthogonal to the dipole axis, with a speed modulated by curvature.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic implementation of multipartite quantum channels and other quantum instruments using local operations and classical communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05362v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a necessary condition that a quantum channel on a multipartite system may be approximated arbitrarily closely using local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We then extend those arguments to obtain a condition that applies to all quantum instruments, which range from the most refined case, a generalized measurement, to the most coarse-grained, which is a quantum channel. We illustrate these results by a detailed analysis of a quantum instrument that is known not to be implementable by LOCC, but which can be arbitrarily closely approximated within that framework. As one outgrowth of this analysis, we find a quantum measurement that falls into the same category: it cannot be implemented exactly by LOCC, but can be approximated by LOCC arbitrarily closely. This measurement has an infinite number of outcomes, leaving open the question as to whether or not there exists a measurement within this same category but having only a finite number of outcomes.</description>

      <title>Special potentials for relativistic Laplacians I: Fractional Rollnik-class</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a counterpart of the classical Rollnik-class of potentials for fractional and massive relativistic Laplacians, and describe this space in terms of appropriate Riesz potentials. These definitions rely on precise resolvent estimates. We show that Coulomb-type potentials are elements of fractional Rollnik-class up to but not including the critical singularity of the Hardy potential. For the operators with fractional exponent $\alpha = 1$ there exists no fractional Rollnik potential, however, in low dimensions we make sense of these classes as limiting cases by using $\Gamma$-convergence. In a second part of the paper we derive detailed results on the self-adjointness and spectral properties of relativistic Schr\"odinger operators obtained under perturbations by fractional Rollnik potentials. We also define an extended fractional Rollnik-class which is the maximal space for the Hilbert-Schmidt property of the related Birman-Schwinger operators.</description>

Abstract: We study the strong-field limit of a theory involving a quantum scalar field coupled to a vector background, which can be either an electromagnetic field or a non-gauge field coupled through the first derivative term. Our approach consists in obtaining resummed expressions for the associated heat kernels, from which we derive the corresponding resummed effective actions. These results allow us to discuss the effect of pair creation. Finally, we conjecture that resummations for more general theories should be possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the extendibility problem for Brauer states, focusing on the symmetric two-sided extendibility and the de Finetti extendibility. By employing the representation theory of the unitary and orthogonal groups, we provide a general recipe for determining the set of $(n,m)$-extendible and $n$-de Finetti-extendible Brauer states. From the concrete form of the commutant of the diagonal action of the orthogonal group, we explicitly determine the set of parameters for which the Brauer states are $(1,2)$-, $(1,3)$- and $(2,2)$-extendible in any dimension $d$ and find that Brauer states extend with a non-trivial trade-off in $n$ and $m$. Using the same recipe we also provide an estimate of the set of $(1,m)$-extendible Brauer states for any $m$ and dimension $d$. Finally, using the branching rules from $\mathrm{U}(d)$ to $\mathrm{O}(d)$, we obtain the set of $n$-de Finetti-extendible Brauer states in any dimension, and also analytically describe the $n\to\infty$ limiting shape which turns out not to be a polygon for odd dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for $n = 2$ the gaskets of critical rigid $O(n)$ loop-decorated random planar maps are $3/2$-stable maps. The case $n = 2$ thus corresponds to the critical case in random planar maps. The proof relies on the Wiener-Hopf factorisation for random walks. Our techniques also provide a characterisation of weight sequences of critical $O(2)$ loop-decorated maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bosonic Gaussian thermal states form a fundamental class of states in quantum information science. This paper explores the information geometry of these states, focusing on characterizing the distance between two nearby states and the geometry induced by a parameterization in terms of their mean vectors and Hamiltonian matrices. In particular, for the family of bosonic Gaussian thermal states, we derive expressions for their Fisher-Bures, Kubo-Mori, and $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices with respect to their mean vectors and Hamiltonian matrices. An important application of our formulas consists of fundamental limits on how well one can estimate these parameters. We additionally establish formulas for the derivatives and the symmetric logarithmic derivatives of bosonic Gaussian thermal states. The former could have applications in gradient descent algorithms for quantum machine learning when using bosonic Gaussian thermal states as an ansatz, and the latter in formulating optimal strategies for single parameter estimation of bosonic Gaussian thermal states. Finally, the expressions for the aforementioned information matrices could have additional applications in natural gradient descent algorithms when using bosonic Gaussian thermal states as an ansatz.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Berezin--Li--Yau and the Kr\"oger inequalities show that Riesz means of order $\geq 1$ of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on a domain $\Omega$ of finite measure are bounded in terms of their semiclassical limit expressions. We show that these inequalities can be improved by a multiplicative factor that depends only on the dimension and the product $\sqrt\Lambda |\Omega|^{1/d}$, where $\Lambda$ is the eigenvalue cut-off parameter in the definition of the Riesz mean. The same holds when $|\Omega|^{1/d}$ is replaced by a generalized inradius of $\Omega$. Finally, we show similar inequalities in two dimensions in the presence of a constant magnetic field.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional long-range statistical mechanical models have random walk correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider long-range percolation, Ising model, and self-avoiding walk on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, with couplings decaying like $|x|^{-(d+\alpha)}$ where $0 &lt; \alpha \le 2$, above the upper critical dimensions. In the spread-out setting where the lace expansion applies, we show that the two-point function for each of these models exactly coincides with a random walk two-point function, up to a constant prefactor. Using this, for $0&lt;\alpha &lt; 2$, we prove upper and lower bounds of the form $|x|^{-(d-\alpha)} \min\{ 1, (p_c - p)^{-2} |x|^{-2\alpha} \}$ for the two-point function near the critical point $p_c$. For $\alpha=2$, we obtain a similar upper bound with logarithmic corrections. We also give a simple proof of the convergence of the lace expansion, assuming diagrammatic estimates.</description>

      <title>Topological consequences of null-geodesic refocusing and applications to $Z^x$ manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23565v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(M,h)$ be a connected, complete Riemannian manifold, let $x\in M$ and $l&gt;0$. Then $M$ is called a $Z^x$ manifold if all geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ and it is called a $Y^x_l$ manifold if every unit-speed geodesic starting at $x$ returns to $x$ at time $l$. It is unknown whether there are $Z^x$ manifolds that are not $Y^x_l$ manifolds for any $l&gt;0$. By the B\'erard-Bergery theorem, any $Y^x_l$ manifold of dimension at least $2$ is compact with finite fundamental group. We prove the same result for $Z^x$ manifolds $M$ for which all unit-speed geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ in uniformly bounded time. We also prove that any $Z^x$ manifold $(M,h)$ with $h$ analytic is a $Y^x_l$ manifold for some $l&gt;0$. We start by defining a class of globally hyperbolic spacetimes (called observer-refocusing) such that any $Z^x$ manifold is the Cauchy surface of some observer-refocusing spacetime. We then prove that under suitable conditions the Cauchy surfaces of observer-refocusing spacetimes are compact with finite fundamental group and show that analytic observer-refocusing spacetimes of dimension at least $3$ are strongly refocusing. We end by stating a contact-theoretic conjecture analogous to our results in Riemannian and Lorentzian geometry.</description>

      <title>Entanglement recycling in two-step port-based teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A protocol involving the repetitive (twofold, to be precise) application of PBT protocol to the same resource is studied. The quantities characterizing the resulting protocol, so-called \textit{two-step PBT}, namely \textit{enatnglement fidelity} and \textit{success probability} are provided for two scenarios, relying on application of pretty-good measurement, i.e. deterministic and probabilistic PBT with non-EPR resource. This results show that two-step PBT is an accurate protocol, provided the resource is sufficiently large. In particular, the deterministic two-step PBT obtains fidelity that is remarkably close to the optimal MPBT fidelity for teleportation of two quantum states. Additionally, the \textit{recycling fidelity}, i.e. the quantity characterizing the degradation of the resource state is calculated for repetitive application of probabilistic protocol, for both EPR and optimized resource, showing that entanglement recycling with two-step PBT is possible in the former case as well.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue distribution in gaps of the essential spectrum of the Bochner-Schr\"odinger operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bochner-Schr\"odinger operator $H_{p}=\frac 1p\Delta^{L^p}+V$ on high tensor powers $L^p$ of a Hermitian line bundle $L$ on a Riemannian manifold $X$ of bounded geometry is studied under the assumption of non-degeneracy of the curvature form of $L$. For large $p$, the spectrum of $H_p$ asymptotically coincides with the union of all local Landau levels of the operator at the points of $X$. Moreover, if the union of the local Landau levels over the complement of a compact subset of $X$ has a gap, then the spectrum of $H_{p}$ in the gap is discrete. The main result of the paper is the trace asymptotics formula associated with these eigenvalues. As a consequence, we get a Weyl type asymptotic formula for the eigenvalue counting function.</description>

      <title>Structural and Compositional Complexities of Hierarchical Self-Assembly: a Hypergraph Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Programmable self-assembly enables the construction of complex molecular, supramolecular, and crystalline architectures from well-designed building blocks. We introduce a hypergraph-based formalism, Blocks &amp; Bonds (B&amp;B), that generalizes classical chemical graph theory by incorporating directed and multicolored interactions, internal symmetries, and hierarchical organization. Within this framework, we develop the Structure Code (SC), a compact and versatile language for describing self-assembled architectures. We define a Kolmogorov-style Structural Complexity as the total information content of SC, obtained through its tokenization and Shannon information assignment. Complementing this encoding-based measure, we introduce a much simpler quantity, the Compositional Complexity, which depends only on the number and cumulative usage of block and bond types in the construction set. A central result of this work is a strong empirical correlation between the token-based Structural Complexity and the Compositional Complexity across all examined systems. Owing to this agreement, the Compositional Complexity emerges as the most practical and broadly applicable measure: it is easy to compute, requires no explicit encoding, and yet closely tracks the actual information content of structurally diverse architectures. Applications to molecular systems (ethylene glycol, glucose), DNA-origami lattices, and crystalline assemblies show that B\&amp;B hypergraphs provide a unified, scalable, and information-efficient representation of structural organization, naturally capturing symmetry, modularity, and stereochemistry. This framework establishes a quantitative foundation for complexity-aware classification and inverse design of programmable matter.</description>

      <title>A Conceptual Introduction To Signature Change Through a Natural Extension of Kaluza-Klein Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an extension of basic Kaluza-Klein theory in which the higher-dimensional Lorentzian manifold develops a Cauchy horizon rather than remaining globally hyperbolic as in the conventional framework. In this setting, the $U(1)$-generating Killing field, assumed to exist in Kaluza-Klein theory, undergoes a transition in its causal character, from spacelike in the globally hyperbolic region to timelike in an acausal extension through a horizon. This yields a (lower-dimensional) quotient manifold whose metric changes signature from Lorentzian to Riemannian. In this way, one observes a singular, signature changing transition emerging rather naturally from the projection of a globally smooth, even analytic, Lorentzian geometry ``up in the bundle''. This reveals a ``signature change without signature change'' scenario -- a phrasing inspired by John Wheeler -- and extends the usual Kaluza-Klein framework in a conceptually natural direction.</description>

      <title>Space-time resonances in the spatiotemporal spectrum of nonlinear dispersive waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In weakly nonlinear dispersive wave systems, long-time dynamics are typically governed by time resonances, where wave phases evolve coherently due to exact frequency matching. Recent advances in spatio-temporal spectrum measurements, however, reveal prominent features that go beyond the predictions of time resonance theory. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework to interpret these signatures by identifying and characterizing an alternative mechanism: space resonances. These arise when wave packets share the same group velocity and remain co-located, leading to long-lived interactions. We further show that gauge-breaking terms in the Hamiltonian give rise to space resonances supported on negative frequencies. By combining sea-surface elevation data, numerical simulations, and analytical theory, we derive the leading-order spatio-temporal spectrum for weakly interacting water waves, providing a unified explanation for its observed features.</description>

      <title>Discrete Contact Angles and Electric Field Singularity in Electrowetting: A Multi-Scale Complex Potential Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study constructed a multi-scale theoretical framework to resolve the electric field singularity at the Triple Contact Point in electrowetting. Utilizing conformal transformation and complex analysis, we established the structure for both the global potential and local field solutions, complementing the analysis with numerical methods. Our primary finding is that the contact angle $\theta$ is not continuously adjustable but is restricted to a discrete set of values, constrained by the characteristic exponent $\lambda$. Analysis of the complex potential established $\text{Re}[\lambda] \ge 1$ as the critical condition for a non-singular electric field; conversely, singular solutions ($\text{Re}[\lambda] &lt; 1$) are localized exclusively in the acute-angle regime ($\theta &lt; \pi/2$). The high-order solution region exhibits a degeneracy phenomenon at specific angles, implying the local field structure is geometrically stable and universally applicable for a wide range of permittivity ratios $k$. Furthermore, we determined that the onset of electric field oscillation requires the simultaneous satisfaction of two critical conditions: the geometry must approach a flat boundary ($\theta \to \pi$) and the dielectric ratio must approach homogeneity ($k \to 1$). These findings provide a solid theoretical basis for designing non-singular electric fields and mitigating the common contact angle saturation phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: The Lagrange identity expresses the second derivative of the moment of inertia of a system of material points through kinetic energy and homogeneous potential energy, from which follows the Jacobi well-known result on the instability of a system of gravitating bodies. In this work, it is proven that if a Hamiltonian system satisfies the Lagrange identity, then it possesses additional tensor invariants that are not expressed through the basic invariants existing for all Hamiltonian systems. A new class of Hamiltonian systems with inhomogeneous potentials is considered, which also possess similar additional tensor invariants.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Variability Alters Macroscopic Rotation Speed in Stochastic Spiral Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general theory for noise-induced corrections to the angular velocity of spiral waves. Stochasticity produces two second-order effects: an instantaneous term from heterogeneity that always slows rotation, and an orbital-drift term from temporal fluctuations that can either accelerate or decelerate it. For our parameters, orbital drift is weaker, producing a net slowdown. Analytical predictions match Barkley-model simulations with temporal noise. Examination of additional noise types in silico confirms angular velocity slowing. This mechanism provides a robust route by which stochasticity reshapes spiral dynamics in excitable media, with direct implications for arrhythmias and neural wave propagation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that tau functions of the KP hierarchy satisfy addition formulas. We consider the general addition formula in the determinant form and take a certain limit of it. It expresses certain shifts of a tau function in terms of the Wronskian determinants of wave functions at various values of the spectral parameter. As an application the relation between solutions created by vertex operators and those created by Darboux transformations is clarified. As another application the new addition formula for Riemann's theta functions of Riemann surfaces is obtained by considering theta function solutions of the KP hierarchy. This addition formula is different from any of formulas in Fay's book.</description>

      <title>Linearized instability of Couette flow in stress-power law fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the linearized stability of plane Couette flow for stress-power law fluids, which exhibit non-monotonic stress-strain rate behavior. The constitutive model is derived from a thermodynamic framework using a non-convex rate of dissipation potential. Under velocity boundary conditions, the system may admit three steady-state solutions. Linearized stability analysis reveals that the two solutions on ascending constitutive branches are unconditionally stable, while the solution on the descending branch is unconditionally unstable. For mixed traction-velocity boundary conditions, the base state is unique. Stability depends solely on whether the prescribed traction lies on an ascending (stable) or descending (unstable) branch of the constitutive curve. The results demonstrate that flow stability in these complex fluids is fundamentally governed by both boundary conditions and constitutive non-monotonicity.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Single-Photon Detector: A framework for Superconducting-Level Performance without cryogenic cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-performance single-photon detectors (SPDs) are indispensable components for a wide range of quantum optical applications. However, the reliance of state-of-the-art devices on superconducting materials imposes severe technological demands and necessitates challenging operational conditions, such as cryogenics, thereby hindering scalable implementation. To address this, we propose the Enhanced Single-Photon Detector (ESPD) framework, a novel paradigm for achieving high-performance SPDs through the iterative enhancement of conventional room-temperature SPDs. Relying entirely on non-superconducting components and eliminating cryogenic cooling requirements, the ESPD scheme can upgrade a legacy SPD, with detection efficiency (DE) about $59\%$ and dark count rate (DCR) of $10^{-2}$, to a device with superior performance metrics, achieving DE exceeding $93\%$ and DCR below $10^{-9}$. This performance rivals or even surpasses that of state-of-the-art superconducting SPDs, allowing the minimal tolerable channel transmission rate for quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols to be reduced by several orders of magnitude. Although the architecture requires substantial integration effort, the scheme can provide superconducting-level performance without cryogenic cooling, offering a clear path toward the widespread deployment of high-performance SPDs as well as related quantum technologies in infrastructure-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of a static black hole in nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the axial electromagnetic quasinormal modes of a static, asymptotically Anti--de Sitter (AdS) black hole sourced by a nonlinear electrodynamics model of Pleba\'{n}ski type. Starting from the master equation governing axial perturbations, we impose ingoing boundary conditions at the event horizon and normalizable (Dirichlet) behavior at the AdS boundary. Following the approach of Jansen, we recast the radial equation into a linear generalized eigenvalue problem by using an ingoing Eddington--Finkelstein formulation, compactifying the radial domain, and regularizing the asymptotic coefficients. The resulting problem is solved using a Chebyshev--Lobatto pseudospectral discretization. We compute the fundamental quasinormal mode frequencies for both the purely electric ($Q_m=0$) and purely magnetic ($Q_e=0$) sectors, emphasizing the role of the nonlinearity parameter $\beta$ and the effective charge magnitude $Q$. Our results show that increasing either $\beta$ or $Q$ raises both the oscillation frequency $\omega_R$ and the damping rate $-\omega_I$, leading to faster but more rapidly decaying ringdown profiles. Nonlinear electrodynamics breaks the isospectrality between electric and magnetic configurations: magnetic modes are systematically less oscillatory and more weakly damped than their electric counterparts. For sufficiently large $\beta$ and small $Q_m$, the fundamental mode becomes purely imaginary ($\omega_R \approx 0$), in agreement with the absence of a trapping potential barrier in this regime. These findings reveal qualitative signatures of nonlinear electromagnetic effects on black hole perturbations and may have implications for high-field or high-charge astrophysical environments.</description>

Abstract: This review charts the emerging paradigm of intelligent structured light for high-field laser-matter interactions, where the precise spatiotemporal and vectorial control of light is a critical degree of freedom. We outline a transformative framework built upon three synergistic pillars. First, we survey the advanced electromagnetic toolkit, moving beyond conventional spatial light modulators to include robust static optics and the promising frontier of plasma light modulators. Second, we detail the optimization engine for this high-dimensional design space, focusing on physics-informed digital twins and AI-driven inverse design to automate the discovery of optimal light structures. Finally, we explore the groundbreaking applications enabled by this integrated approach, including programmable electron beams, orbital-angular-momentum-carrying {\gamma}-rays, compact THz accelerators, and robust communications. The path forward necessitates overcoming grand challenges in material science, real-time adaptive control at MHz rates, and the extension of these principles to the quantum realm. This review serves as a call to action for a coordinated, interdisciplinary effort to command, rather than merely observe, light-matter interactions at the extreme.</description>
