      <title>Correlated Growth of Causal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of causal structure in complex systems has gained increasing attention, with many recent studies exploring causal networks that capture cause-effect relationships across diverse fields. Despite increasing empirical evidence linking causal structures to network topological correlations, the mechanisms underlying the emergence of these correlations in causal networks remain poorly understood. In this Letter, we propose a general growth framework for causal networks, incorporating two key types of correlations: causal and dynamic. We analytically solve our model for degree correlation and validate the theoretical predictions against empirical data from four large-scale innovation networks. Our theory not only sheds light on the origins of topological correlations but also provides a general framework for understanding correlated growth across causal systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Collective Information Processing for Risk Encoding in Social Networks during Crises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online social networks are increasingly being utilized for collective sense making and information processing in disasters. However, the underlying mechanisms that shape the dynamics of collective intelligence in online social networks during disasters is not fully understood. To bridge this gap, we examine the mechanisms of collective information processing in human networks during five threat cases including airport power outage, hurricanes, wildfire, and blizzard, considering the temporal and spatial dimensions. Using the 13MM Twitter data generated by 5MM online users during these threats, we examined human activities, communication structures and frequency, social influence, information flow, and medium response time in social networks. The results show that the activities and structures are stable in growing networks, which lead to a stable power-law distribution of the social influence in networks. These temporally invariant patterns are not affected by people's memory and ties' strength. In addition, spatially localized communication spikes and global transmission gaps in the networks. The findings could inform about network intervention strategies to enable a healthy and efficient online environment, with potential long-term impact on risk communication and emergency response.</description>

      <title>A minimalistic and general weighted averaging method for inconsistent data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weighted average of inconsistent data is a common and tedious problem that many scientists have encountered. The standard weighted average is not recommended for these cases, and different alternative methods are proposed in the literature. Here, we discuss a method first proposed by Sivia in 1996 that is based on Bayesian statistics and keeps the number of assumptions to a minimum. We propose this approach as a new standard for calculating weighted averages. The uncertainty associated with each input value is considered to be just a lower bound of the true unknown uncertainty.The resulting likelihood function is no longer Gaussian, but has smoothly decreasing wings, which allows for a better treatment of scattered data and outliers. The proposed method is tested on a series of data sets: simulations, CODATA recommended value of the Newtonian gravitational constant, and some particle properties from the Particle Data Group, including the proton charge radius. A freely available Python library is also provided for a simple implementation of the proposed averaging method.</description>
