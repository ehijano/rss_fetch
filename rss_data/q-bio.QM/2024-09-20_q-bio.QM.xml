      <title>What is in a Scent? Understanding the role of scent marking in social dynamics and territoriality of free-ranging dogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scent marks play a crucial role in both territorial and sexual communication in many species. We investigated how free-ranging dogs respond to scent marks from individuals of different identities in terms of sex and group, across varying strategic locations within their territory. Both male and female dogs showed heightened interest in scent marks compared to control, exhibiting stronger territorial responses,. with males being more territorial than females. Overmarking behaviour was predominantly observed in males, particularly in response to male scent marks and those from neighbouring groups. Behavioural cluster analysis revealed distinct responses to different scent marks, with neighbouring group male scents eliciting the most distinct reactions. Our findings highlight the multifaceted role of scent marks in free-ranging dog communication, mediating both territorial defence and intrasexual competition. The differential responses based on the identity and gender of the scent-marker emphasize the complexity of olfactory signalling in this species. This study contributes to understanding the social behaviour of dogs in their natural habitat, and opens up possibilities for future explorations in the role of olfactory cues in the social dynamics of the species.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks can accurately model cardiac electrophysiology in 3D geometries and fibrillatory conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are fast becoming an important tool to solve differential equations rapidly and accurately, and to identify the systems parameters that best agree with a given set of measurements. PINNs have been used for cardiac electrophysiology (EP), but only in simple 1D and 2D geometries and for sinus rhythm or single rotor dynamics. Here, we demonstrate how PINNs can be used to accurately reconstruct the propagation of cardiac action potential in more complex geometries and dynamical regimes. These include 3D spherical geometries and spiral break-up conditions that model cardiac fibrillation, with a mean RMSE $&lt; 5.1\times 10^{-2}$ overall.
  We also demonstrate that PINNs can be used to reliably parameterise cardiac EP models with some biological detail. We estimate the diffusion coefficient and parameters related to ion channel conductances in the Fenton-Karma model in a 2D setup, achieving a mean relative error of $-0.09\pm 0.33$. Our results are an important step towards the deployment of PINNs to realistic cardiac geometries and arrhythmic conditions.</description>

      <title>Pathway Tools version 28.0: Integrated Software for Pathway/Genome Informatics and Systems Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03964</link>
      <description>arXiv:1510.03964v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pathway Tools is a bioinformatics software environment with a broad set of capabilities. The software provides genome-informatics tools such as a genome browser, sequence alignments, a genome-variant analyzer, and comparative-genomics operations. It offers metabolic-informatics tools, such as metabolic reconstruction, quantitative metabolic modeling, prediction of reaction atom mappings, and metabolic route search. Pathway Tools also provides regulatory-informatics tools, such as the ability to represent and visualize a wide range of regulatory interactions. The software creates and manages a type of organism-specific database called a Pathway/Genome Database (PGDB), which the software enables database curators to interactively edit. It supports web publishing of PGDBs and provides a large number of query, visualization, and omics-data analysis tools. Scientists around the world have created more than 45,000 PGDBs by using Pathway Tools, many of which are curated databases for important model organisms. Those PGDBs can be exchanged using a peer-to-peer database-sharing system called the PGDB Registry.</description>
