      <title>An alternative idea about the source of baryon asymmetry in the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper proposes an alternative scenario for the emergence of baryon asymmetry in the Universe. This scenario is realized in the lattice gravity model associated with the Dirac field as follows. At ultra-high temperatures of the Grand Unification order $T_c\sim10^{18}$ GeV and higher, the system is in a PT-symmetric phase. But when the temperature decreases, a phase transition to an asymmetric phase occurs, in which a non-zero tetrad appears, that is, space-time with the Minkowski metric, and the system's wave function splits into two: $|\rangle=|+\rangle+|-\rangle$. The fields of tetrads in states $|+\rangle$ and $|-\rangle$ differ in sign. At the very first moment of time with a duration of the order of the Planck time, a transition of fermions between these states is possible. These transitions in different parts of space are not correlated with each other. Therefore, the final asymmetry of the fermion charge between these states is relatively extremely small and it is preserved in time, since the interaction of the states $|+\rangle$ and $|-\rangle$ ceases at times greater than the Planck time.</description>

      <title>The density of states method for symplectic gauge theories at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the finite-temperature behaviour of the $Sp(4)$ Yang-Mills lattice theory in four dimensions, by applying the Logarithmic Linear Relaxation (LLR) algorithm. We demonstrate the presence of coexisting (metastable) phases, when the system is in the proximity of the transition. We measure observables such as the free energy, the expectation value of the plaquette operator and of the Polyakov loop, as well as the specific heat, and the Binder cumulant. We use these results to obtain a high-precision measurement of the critical coupling at the confinement-deconfinement transition, and assess its systematic uncertainty, for one value of the lattice extent in the time direction. Furthermore, we perform an extensive study of the finite-volume behaviour of the lattice system, by repeating the measurements for fixed lattice time extent, while increasing the spatial size of the lattice. We hence characterise the first-order transition on the lattice, and present the first results in the literature on this theory for the infinite volume extrapolation of lattice quantities related to latent heat and interface tension.
  Gauge theories with $Sp(4)$ group have been proposed as new dark sectors to provide a fundamental origin for the current phenomenological evidence of dark matter. A phase transition at high temperature, in such a new dark sector, occurring in the early universe, might have left a relic stochastic background of gravitational waves. Our results represent a milestone toward establishing whether such a new physics signal is detectable in future experiments, as they enter the calculation of the parameters, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, controlling the power spectrum of gravitational waves. We also outline the process needed in the continuum extrapolation of our measurements, and test its feasibility on one additional choice of temporal extent of the lattice.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the flux tube structure in full QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present lattice Monte Carlo results on the chromoelectric field created by a static quark-antiquark pair in the vacuum of QCD with 2+1 dynamical staggered fermions at physical masses. After isolating the nonperturbative, confining part of the field, we characterize its spatial profile for several values of the physical distances between the sources, ranging from about 0.5 fm up to the onset of string breaking. Moreover, we compare our results with a model of QCD vacuum as disordered chromomagnetic condensate.</description>

      <title>Floquet evolution of the q-deformed \texorpdfstring{SU(3)${}_1$}{SU(3)1} Yang-Mills theory on a two-leg ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate Floquet time-evolution of a truncated SU(3) lattice Yang-Mills theory on a two-leg ladder geometry under open boundary conditions using IBM's superconducting 156-qubit device ibm\_fez. To this end, we derive the quantum spin representation of the lattice Yang-Mills theory, and compose a quantum circuit carefully tailored to hard wares, reducing the use of CZ gates. Since it is still challenging to simulate Hamiltonian evolution in present noisy quantum processors, we make the step size in the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition very large, and simulate thermalization dynamics in Floquet circuit composed of the Suzuki-Trotter evolution. We demonstrate that IBM's Heron quantum processor can simulate, by error mitigation, Floqeut thermalization dynamics in a large system consisting of $62$ qubits. Our work would be a benchmark for further quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories using real devices.</description>

      <title>More About the Lattice Hamiltonian for Adjoint QCD$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our earlier work arXiv:2311.09334, we introduced a lattice Hamiltonian for Adjoint QCD$_2$ using staggered Majorana fermions. We found the gauge invariant space of states explicitly for the gauge group $\text{SU}(2)$ and used them for numerical calculations of observables, such as the spectrum and the expectation value of the fermion bilinear. In this paper, we carry out a more in-depth study of our lattice model, extending it to any compact and simply-connected gauge group $G$. We show how to find the gauge invariant space of states and use it to study various observables. We also use the lattice model to calculate the mixed 't Hooft anomalies of Adjoint QCD$_2$ for arbitrary $G$. We show that the matrix elements of the lattice Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of the Wigner 6$j$-symbols of $G$. For $G = \text{SU}(3)$, we perform exact diagonalization for lattices of up to six sites and study the low-lying spectrum, the fermion bilinear condensate, and the string tension. We also show how to write the lattice strong coupling expansion for ground state energies and operator expectation values in terms of the Wigner 6$j$-symbols. For $\text{SU}(3)$ we carry this out explicitly and find good agreement with the exact diagonalizations, and for $\text{SU}(4)$ we give expansions that can be compared with future numerical studies.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the peak of the sound velocity for isospin imbalanced strongly interacting matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of a system composed of strongly interacting matter with an isospin imbalance, using as an effective description of QCD the two-flavor Linear Sigma Model with quarks. From the one-loop effective potential, including the two light quarks, pions and sigma contributions, and enforcing the restrictions imposed by chiral symmetry, we show that the development of an isospin condensate comes together with the emergence of a Goldstone mode that provides a constraint for the chiral and isospin condensates as a result of a non-trivial mixing between the charged pions and the sigma. We compute the thermodynamical quantities of interest and in particular the sound velocity squared, showing that it presents a maximum for an isospin chemical potential similar to the one reported by lattice QCD results and also with a similar height. Therefore, we attribute the origin of the peak of the sound velocity to the proper treatment of the Goldstone mode and to the non-trivial mixing of the charged pions and sigma in the isospin condensed phase.</description>

      <title>Scale setting and hadronic properties in light quark sector with $(2+1)$-flavor Wilson fermions at the physical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report scale setting and hadronic properties for our new lattice QCD gauge configuration set (HAL-conf-2023). We employ $(2+1)$-flavor nonperturbatively improved Wilson fermions with stout smearing and the Iwasaki gauge action on a $96^4$ lattice, and generate configurations of 8,000 trajectories at the physical point. We show the basic properties of the configurations such as the plaquette value, topological charge distribution and their auto-correlation times. The scale setting is performed by detailed analyses of the $\Omega$ baryon mass. We calculate the physical results of quark masses, decay constants of pseudoscalar mesons and single hadron spectra in light quark sector. The masses of the stable hadrons are found to agree with the experimental values within a sub-percent level.</description>

      <title>Gauge Loop-String-Hadron Formulation on General Graphs and Applications to Fully Gauge Fixed Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a gauge invariant, Loop-String-Hadron (LSH) based representation of SU(2) Yang-Mills theory defined on a general graph consisting of vertices and half-links. Inspired by weak coupling studies, we apply this technique to maximal tree gauge fixing. This allows us to develop a fully gauge fixed representation of the theory in terms of LSH quantum numbers. We explicitly show how the quantum numbers in this formulation directly relate to the variables in the magnetic description. In doing so, we will also explain in detail the way that the Kogut-Susskind formulation, prepotentials, and point splitting, work for general graphs. In the appendix of this work we provide a self-contained exposition of the mathematical details of Hamiltonian pure gauge theories defined on general graphs.</description>

      <title>Nambu-Goldstone modes in a lattice Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with multi flavor symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15922v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a lattice Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with SU(2) and SU(3) flavor symmetries of staggered fermions in the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian formalism. This type of four-fermion interactions has been widely used for describing low-energy behaviors of strongly interacting quarks as an effective model. In particular, we focus on the Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the flavor symmetries. In the strong coupling regime for the interactions, we prove the following: (i) For the spatial dimension $\nu \ge 5$, the SU(3) model shows a long-range order at sufficiently low temperatures. (ii) In the case of the SU(2) symmetry, there appears a long-range order in the spatial dimension $\nu \ge 3$ at sufficiently low temperatures. (iii) These results hold in the ground states as well. (iv) In general, if a long-range order emerges in this type of models, then there appear gapless excitations above the sector of the infinite-volume ground states. These are nothing but the Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the global rotational symmetry of flavors. (v) In particular, we establish that the number of the lineraly independent Nambu-Goldstone modes is equal to the number of the broken symmetry generators on the Hilbert space constructed from a certain symmetry-breaking infinite-volume ground state.</description>

      <title>Pole trajectories of the $\Lambda(1405)$ helps establish its dynamical nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07686v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral trajectories of dynamically generated resonances are intimately connected to the SU(3) breaking pattern and their nature. From an analysis of a recent LQCD simulation on the $\pi\Sigma-\bar{K}N$ scattering for $I=0$ and the study of the quark mass dependence of the octet baryon masses, we determine for the first time unambiguously the trajectories of the two poles associated to the $\Lambda(1405)$ towards the symmetric point over the $\mathrm{Tr}[M]=C$ trajectory accurately. At $m_\pi\simeq 200$ MeV, our results are consistent with the lattice simulations, and the extrapolations to the physical point, based on the NLO chiral Lagrangians, agree well with existing experimental analyses. We predict qualitatively similar trajectories at LO and up to NLO, consistent with the LO interaction's dominance. At the SU(3) symmetric point up to NLO in this trajectory, the lower pole is located at $E^{(1)}=1583(5)(1)$ MeV, being dominantly a SU(3) singlet, while the higher pole belongs to the octet representation with a mass of $E^{(8)}=1585(8)(2)$ MeV. We also make predictions on the evolution of the two poles over the $m_s=m_{s,\mathrm{phy}}$ trajectory. This can be tested in future LQCD simulations and experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Heavy baryons in the relativized quark model with chromodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the work of Capstick and Isgur [\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.34.2809}{Phys.~Rev.~D~34,~2809~(1986)}], we systematically study the mass spectrum of the heavy baryons in the relativized quark potential model with chromodynamics. Besides the original Godfrey-Isgur (GI) model, we also adopt a modified GI model which replaces the linear confinement by a screened one. The two models give similar results in our work. All heavy baryons observed so far can be explained as three-quark states. In particular, we identify the $\Omega_{c}(3000)$/$\Omega_{b}(6316)$, $\Omega_{c}(3050)$/$\Omega_{b}(6330)$, $\Omega_{c}(3065)$/$\Omega_{b}(6340)$ and $\Omega_{c}(3090)$/$\Omega_{b}(6350)$ states as the $p_{\lambda}$ excitations with quantum numbers $1/2^{-}$, $3/2^{-}$, $3/2^{-}$ and $5/2^{-}$. The $\Omega_{c}(3120)$ is a $3/2^{-}$ state with the $p_{\rho}$ excitation, whose bottom partner is predicted to be $\Omega_{b}(6446/6457,3/2^{-})$. The higher state $\Omega_{c}(3188)$ is the $2s_{\lambda}$ excitation with quantum numbers $1/2^{+}$, and $\Omega_{c}(3327)$ is a $d_{\lambda}$ excitation with quantum numbers $3/2^{+}$ or $5/2^{+}$. In addition, the $\Lambda_{c}(2940)$ with quantum numbers $J^{P}=3/2^{-}$ could be explained as the $p_{\rho}$ excitation.</description>
