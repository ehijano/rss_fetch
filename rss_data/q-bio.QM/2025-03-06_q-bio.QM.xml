      <title>Spatially-Structured Models of Viral Dynamics: A Scoping Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is growing recognition in both the experimental and modelling literature of the importance of spatial structure to the dynamics of viral infections in tissues. Aided by the evolution of computing power and motivated by recent biological insights, there has been an explosion of new, spatially-explicit models for within-host viral dynamics in recent years. This development has only been accelerated in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Spatially-structured models offer improved biological realism and can account for dynamics which cannot be well-described by conventional, mean-field approaches. However, despite their growing popularity, spatially-structured models of viral dynamics are underused in biological applications. One major obstacle to the wider application of such models is the huge variety in approaches taken, with little consensus as to which features should be included and how they should be implemented for a given biological context. Previous reviews of the field have focused on specific modelling frameworks or on models for particular viral species. Here, we instead apply a scoping review approach to the literature of spatially-structured viral dynamics models as a whole to provide an exhaustive update of the state of the field. Our analysis is structured along two axes, methodology and viral species, in order to examine the breadth of techniques used and the requirements of different biological applications. We then discuss the contributions of mathematical and computational modelling to our understanding of key spatially-structured aspects of viral dynamics, and suggest key themes for future model development to improve robustness and biological utility.</description>

      <title>Controlling tissue size by active fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Groups of cells, including clusters of cancerous cells, multicellular organisms, and developing organs, may both grow and break apart. What physical factors control these fractures? In these processes, what sets the eventual size of clusters? We develop a framework for understanding cell clusters that can fragment due to cell motility using an active particle model. We compute analytically how the break rate of cell-cell junctions depends on cell speed, cell persistence, and cell-cell junction properties. Next, we find the cluster size distributions, which differ depending on whether all cells can divide or only the cells on the edge of the cluster divide. Cluster size distributions depend solely on the ratio of the break rate to the growth rate - allowing us to predict how cluster size and variability depend on cell motility and cell-cell mechanics. Our results suggest that organisms can achieve better size control when cell division is restricted to the cluster boundaries or when fracture can be localized to the cluster center. Our results link the general physics problem of a collective active escape over a barrier to size control, providing a quantitative measure of how motility can regulate organ or organism size.</description>

      <title>UnPuzzle: A Unified Framework for Pathology Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pathology image analysis plays a pivotal role in medical diagnosis, with deep learning techniques significantly advancing diagnostic accuracy and research. While numerous studies have been conducted to address specific pathological tasks, the lack of standardization in pre-processing methods and model/database architectures complicates fair comparisons across different approaches. This highlights the need for a unified pipeline and comprehensive benchmarks to enable consistent evaluation and accelerate research progress. In this paper, we present UnPuzzle, a novel and unified framework for pathological AI research that covers a broad range of pathology tasks with benchmark results. From high-level to low-level, upstream to downstream tasks, UnPuzzle offers a modular pipeline that encompasses data pre-processing, model composition,taskconfiguration,andexperimentconduction.Specifically, it facilitates efficient benchmarking for both Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and Region of Interest (ROI) tasks. Moreover, the framework supports variouslearningparadigms,includingself-supervisedlearning,multi-task learning,andmulti-modallearning,enablingcomprehensivedevelopment of pathology AI models. Through extensive benchmarking across multiple datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of UnPuzzle in streamlining pathology AI research and promoting reproducibility. We envision UnPuzzle as a cornerstone for future advancements in pathology AI, providing a more accessible, transparent, and standardized approach to model evaluation. The UnPuzzle repository is publicly available at https://github.com/Puzzle-AI/UnPuzzle.</description>

      <title>PathRWKV: Enabling Whole Slide Prediction with Recurrent-Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pathological diagnosis plays a critical role in clinical practice, where the whole slide images (WSIs) are widely applied. Through a two-stage paradigm, recent deep learning approaches enhance the WSI analysis with tile-level feature extracting and slide-level feature modeling. Current Transformer models achieved improvement in the efficiency and accuracy to previous multiple instance learning based approaches. However, three core limitations persist, as they do not: (1) robustly address the modeling on variable scales for different slides, (2) effectively balance model complexity and data availability, and (3) balance training efficiency and inference performance. To explicitly address them, we propose a novel model for slide modeling, PathRWKV. Via a recurrent structure, we enable the model for dynamic perceptible tiles in slide-level modeling, which novelly enables the prediction on all tiles in the inference stage. Moreover, we employ linear attention instead of conventional matrix multiplication attention to reduce model complexity and overfitting problem. Lastly, we hinge multi-task learning to enable modeling on versatile tasks simultaneously, improving training efficiency, and asynchronous structure design to draw an effective conclusion on all tiles during inference, enhancing inference performance. Experimental results suggest that PathRWKV outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in various downstream tasks on multiple datasets. The code and datasets are publicly available.</description>

      <title>TEDDY: A Family Of Foundation Models For Understanding Single Cell Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the biological mechanism of disease is critical for medicine, and in particular drug discovery. AI-powered analysis of genome-scale biological data hold great potential in this regard. The increasing availability of single-cell RNA sequencing data has enabled the development of large foundation models for disease biology. However, existing foundation models either do not improve or only modestly improve over task-specific models in downstream applications. Here, we explored two avenues for improving the state-of-the-art. First, we scaled the pre-training dataset to 116 million cells, which is larger than those used by previous models. Second, we leveraged the availability of large-scale biological annotations as a form of supervision during pre-training. We trained the TEDDY family of models comprising six transformer-based state-of-the-art single-cell foundation models with 70 million, 160 million, and 400 million parameters. We vetted our models on two downstream evaluation tasks -- identifying the underlying disease state of held-out donors not seen during training and distinguishing healthy cells from diseased ones for disease conditions and donors not seen during training. Scaling experiments showed that performance improved predictably with both data volume and parameter count. Our models showed substantial improvement over existing work on the first task and more muted improvements on the second.</description>

      <title>GeneFEAST: the pivotal, gene-centric step in functional enrichment analysis interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Summary: GeneFEAST, implemented in Python, is a gene-centric functional enrichment analysis summarisation and visualisation tool that can be applied to large functional enrichment analysis (FEA) results arising from upstream FEA pipelines. It produces a systematic, navigable HTML report, making it easy to identify sets of genes putatively driving multiple enrichments and to explore gene-level quantitative data first used to identify input genes. Further, GeneFEAST can compare FEA results from multiple studies, making it possible, for example, to highlight patterns of gene expression amongst genes commonly differentially expressed in two sets of conditions, and giving rise to shared enrichments under those conditions. GeneFEAST offers a novel, effective way to address the complexities of linking up many overlapping FEA results to their underlying genes and data, advancing gene-centric hypotheses, and providing pivotal information for downstream validation experiments.

      <title>Accounting for the geometry of the respiratory tract in viral infections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasingly, experimentalists and modellers alike have come to recognise the important role of spatial structure in infection dynamics. Almost invariably, spatial computational models of viral infections - as with in vitro experimental systems - represent the tissue as wide and flat, which is often assumed to be representative of entire affected tissue within the host. However, this assumption fails to take into account the distinctive geometry of the respiratory tract in the context of viral infections. The respiratory tract is characterised by a tubular, branching structure, and moreover is spatially heterogeneous: deeper regions of the lung are composed of far narrower airways and are associated with more severe infection. Here, we extend a typical multicellular model of viral dynamics to account for two essential features of the geometry of the respiratory tract: the tubular structure of airways, and the branching process between airway generations. We show that, with this more realistic tissue geometry, the dynamics of infection are substantially changed compared to standard computational and experimental approaches, and that the resulting model is equipped to tackle important biological phenomena that do not arise in a flat host tissue, including viral lineage dynamics, and heterogeneity in immune responses to infection in different regions of the respiratory tree. Our findings suggest aspects of viral dynamics which current in vitro systems may be insufficient to describe, and point to several features of respiratory infections which can be experimentally assessed.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Enabled Multidimensional Data Utilization Through Multi-Resonance Architecture: A Pathway to Enhanced Accuracy in Biosensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20245v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel framework is proposed that combines multi-resonance biosensors with machine learning (ML) to significantly enhance the accuracy of parameter prediction in biosensing. Unlike traditional single-resonance systems, which are limited to one-dimensional datasets, this approach leverages multi-dimensional data generated by a custom-designed nanostructure, a periodic array of silicon nanorods with a triangular cross-section over an aluminum reflector. High bulk sensitivity values are achieved for this multi-resonant structure, with certain resonant peaks reaching up to 1706 nm/RIU. The field analysis reveals Mie resonances as the physical reason behind the peaks. The predictive power of multiple resonant peaks from transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) polarizations is evaluated using Ridge Regression modeling. Systematic analysis reveals that incorporating multiple resonances yields up to three orders of magnitude improvement in refractive index detection precision compared to single-peak analyses. This precision enhancement is achieved without modifications to the biosensor hardware, highlighting the potential of data-centric strategies in biosensing. The findings establish a new paradigm in biosensing, demonstrating that the synergy between multi-resonance data acquisition and ML-based analysis can significantly enhance detection accuracy. This study provides a scalable pathway for advancing high-precision biosensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based MRI Reconstruction with Artificial Fourier Transform Network (AFTNet)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10892v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) provide a powerful way to leverage complex number operations and representations and have succeeded in several phase-based applications. However, previous networks have not fully explored the impact of complex-valued networks in the frequency domain. Here, we introduce a unified complex-valued deep learning framework-Artificial Fourier Transform Network (AFTNet)-which combines domain-manifold learning and CVNNs. AFTNet can be readily used to solve image inverse problems in domain transformation, especially for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction and other applications. While conventional methods typically utilize magnitude images or treat the real and imaginary components of k-space data as separate channels, our approach directly processes raw k-space data in the frequency domain, utilizing complex-valued operations. This allows for a mapping between the frequency (k-space) and image domain to be determined through cross-domain learning. We show that AFTNet achieves superior accelerated MRI reconstruction compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, our approach can be applied to various tasks, such as denoised magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) reconstruction and datasets with various contrasts. The AFTNet presented here is a valuable preprocessing component for different preclinical studies and provides an innovative alternative for solving inverse problems in imaging and spectroscopy. The code is available at: https://github.com/yanting-yang/AFT-Net.</description>
