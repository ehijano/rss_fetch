      <title>scMamba: A Scalable Foundation Model for Single-Cell Multi-Omics Integration Beyond Highly Variable Feature Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of single-cell multi-omics technologies has enabled the simultaneous profiling of diverse omics layers within individual cells. Integrating such multimodal data provides unprecedented insights into cellular identity, regulatory processes, and disease mechanisms. However, it remains challenging, as current methods often rely on selecting highly variable genes or peaks during preprocessing, which may inadvertently discard crucial biological information. Here, we present scMamba, a foundation model designed to integrate single-cell multi-omics data without the need for prior feature selection while preserving genomic positional information. scMamba introduces a patch-based cell tokenization strategy that treats genomics regions as words (tokens) and cells as sentences. Building upon the concept of state space duality, scMamba distills rich biological insights from high-dimensional, sparse single-cell multi-omics data. Additionally, our novel contrastive learning approach, enhanced with cosine similarity regularization, enables superior alignment across omics layers compared to traditional methods. Systematic benchmarking across multiple datasets demonstrates that scMamba significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in preserving biological variation, aligning omics layers, and enhancing key downstream tasks such as clustering, cell type annotation, and trajectory inference. Our findings position scMamba as a powerful tool for large-scale single-cell multi-omics integration, capable of handling large-scale atlases and advancing biological discovery.</description>

      <title>Bridging Classical Molecular Dynamics and Quantum Foundations for Comprehensive Protein Structural Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to investigate the structural stability, dynamic properties, and potential interactions among Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), Tau, and Alpha-synuclein through a series of molecular dynamics simulations that integrate publicly available structural data, detailed force-field parameters, and comprehensive analytical protocols. By focusing on these three proteins, which are each implicated in various neurodegenerative disorders, the study aims to elucidate how their conformational changes and interprotein contact sites may influence larger biological processes. Through rigorous evaluation of their folding behaviors, energetic interactions, and residue-specific functions, this work contributes to the broader understanding of protein aggregation mechanisms and offers insights that may ultimately guide therapeutic intervention strategies.</description>

      <title>Properties of Hagen-Poiseuille flow in channel networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the main properties of adaptive Hagen-Poiseuille flows in elastic microchannel networks similar to biological veins found in organisms. We demonstrate that adaptive Hagen-Poiseuille flows effectively simulate key features of \textit{Physarum polycephalum} networks, replicating physiological out-of-equilibrium phenomena such as peristalsis and shuttle streaming, which are associated with the mechanism of nutrient transport in \textit{Physarum}. A new topological steady state has been identified for asynchronous adaptation, supporting out-of-equilibrium laminar fluxes. Adaptive Hagen-Poiseuille flows exhibit saturation effects on the fluxes in contractile veins, as observed in both animal and artificial contractile veins. These results suggest that the non-equilibrium effects observed in \textit{Physarum} have a hydrodynamic origin</description>
