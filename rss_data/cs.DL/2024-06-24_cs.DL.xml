      <title>Analysis of the Publication and Document Types in OpenAlex, Web of Science, Scopus, Pubmed and Semantic Scholar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study compares and analyses publication and document types in the following bibliographic databases: OpenAlex, Scopus, Web of Science, Semantic Scholar and PubMed. The results demonstrate that typologies can differ considerably between individual database providers. Moreover, the distinction between research and non-research texts, which is required to identify relevant documents for bibliometric analysis, can vary depending on the data source because publications are classified differently in the respective databases. The focus of this study, in addition to the cross-database comparison, is primarily on the coverage and analysis of the publication and document types contained in OpenAlex, as OpenAlex is becoming increasingly important as a free alternative to established proprietary providers for bibliometric analyses at libraries and universities.</description>

      <title>The disruption index suffers from citation inflation and is confounded by shifts in scholarly citation practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the rate of innovation in academia and industry is fundamental to monitoring the efficiency and competitiveness of the knowledge economy. To this end, a disruption index (CD) was recently developed and applied to publication and patent citation networks (Wu et al., Nature 2019; Park et al., Nature 2023). Here we show that CD systematically decreases over time due to secular growth in research and patent production, following two distinct mechanisms unrelated to innovation -- one behavioral and the other structural. Whereas the behavioral explanation reflects shifts associated with techno-social factors (e.g. self-citation practices), the structural explanation follows from `citation inflation' (CI), an inextricable feature of real citation networks attributable to increasing reference list lengths, which causes CD to systematically decrease. We demonstrate this causal link by way of mathematical deduction, computational simulation, multi-variate regression, and quasi-experimental comparison of the disruptiveness of PNAS versus PNAS Plus articles, which differ only in their lengths. Accordingly, we analyze CD data available in the SciSciNet database and find that disruptiveness incrementally increased from 2005-2015, and that the negative relationship between disruption and team-size is remarkably small in overall magnitude effect size, and shifts from negative to positive for team size $\geq$ 8 coauthors.</description>

      <title>Network visualization techniques for story charting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visualization techniques have been widely used to analyze various data types, including text. This paper proposes an approach to analyze a controversial text in Portuguese by applying graph visualization techniques. Specifically, we use a story charting technique that transforms the text into a graph. Each node represents a character or main entities, and each edge represents the interactions between characters. We also present several visualization techniques to gain insights into the story's structure, relationships between the characters, the most important events, and how some key terms are used throughout the book. By using this approach, we can effectively reveal complex patterns and relationships that may not be easily discernible from reading the text. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of our technique in Literary Studies and other fields.</description>
