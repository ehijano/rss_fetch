      <title>Thermal Evolution of Lava Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rocky planets are thought to form with a magma ocean that quickly solidifies. The horizontal and vertical extent of this magma ocean depends on the interior thermal evolution of the planet, and possibly exogenous processes such as planet migration. We present a model for simulating the thermal history of tidally locked lava planets. We initiate the model with a completely molten mantle and evolve it for ten billion years. We adopt a fixed surface temperature of 3000 K for the irradiated day-side, but allow the night-side temperature to evolve along with the underlying layers. We simulate planets of radius 1.0$R_{\oplus}$ and 1.5$R_{\oplus}$ with different core mass fractions, although the latter does not significantly impact the thermal evolution. We confirm that the day-side magma ocean on these planets has a depth that depends on the planetary radius. The night-side, on the other hand, begins crystallizing within a few thousand years and completely solidifies within 800 million years in the absence of substantial tidal heating or day-night heat transport. We show that a magma ocean can be sustained on the night-side of a lava planet if at least 20 per cent of absorbed stellar power is transmitted from the day-side to the night-side via magma currents. Such day-night transport could be sustained if the magma has a viscosity of $10^{-3}$ Pa s, which is plausible at these temperatures. Alternatively, the night-side could remain molten if the mush layer is tidally heated at the rate of $8 \times 10^{-4}$ W/kg of mush, which is plausible for orbital eccentricities of $e &gt; 7 \times 10^{-3}$. Night-side cooling is a runaway process, however: the magma becomes more viscous and the mush solidifies, reducing both day-night heat transport and tidal heating. Measurements of the night-sides of lava planets are therefore a sensitive probe of the thermal history of these planets.</description>

      <title>Survey of Orion Disks with ALMA (SODA) III: Disks in wide binary systems in L1641 and L1647</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. The goal of this work is to comprehensively characterize the impact of stellar multiplicity on Class II disks in the L1641 and L1647 regions of Orion A (~1-3 Myr), part of the Survey of Orion Disks with ALMA (SODA). We characterize the protostellar multiplicity using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the ESO-VISTA, and Hubble Space telescopes. The resulting sample of 65 multiple systems represents the largest catalogue of wide binary systems to date (projected separation &gt;1000 AU), allowing a more robust statistical characterization of the evolution and properties of protoplanetary disks. Methods. The disk population was observed in continuum with ALMA at 225 GHz, with a median rms of 1.5 Mearth. Combining these data (resolution ~1.1arcsec ) with the ESO-VISTA near-infrared survey of the Orion A cloud (resolution ~0.7arcsec ), multiple systems are assembled and selected by an iterative inside-out search in projected separation (&gt;1000 AU). Results. We identify 61 binary systems, 3 triple systems, and one quadruple system. The separation range is between 1000 and 10^4 AU. The dust mass distributions inferred with the Kaplan-Meier estimator yield a median mass of 3.23+0.6-0.4 Mearth for primary disks and 3.88+0.3-0.3 Mearth for secondary disks.</description>

      <title>Updated forecast for TRAPPIST-1 times of transit for all seven exoplanets incorporating JWST data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The TRAPPIST-1 system has been extensively observed with JWST in the near-infrared with the goal of measuring atmospheric transit transmission spectra of these temperate, Earth-sized exoplanets. A byproduct of these observations has been much more precise times of transit compared with prior available data from Spitzer, HST, or ground-based telescopes. In this note we use 23 new timing measurements of all seven planets in the near-infrared from five JWST observing programs to better forecast and constrain the future times of transit in this system. In particular, we note that the transit times of TRAPPIST-1h have drifted significantly from a prior published analysis by up to tens of minutes. Our newer forecast has a higher precision, with median statistical uncertainties ranging from 7-105 seconds during JWST Cycles 4 and 5. Our expectation is that this forecast will help to improve planning of future observations of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, whereas we postpone a full dynamical analysis to future work.</description>

      <title>Photothermal Spectroscopy for Planetary Sciences: Mid-IR Absorption Made Easy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The understanding of the formation and evolution of the solar system still has many unanswered questions. Formation of solids in the solar system, mineral and organic mixing, and planetary body creation are all topics of interest to the community. Studying these phenomena is often performed through observations, remote sensing, and in-situ analysis, but there are limitations to the methods. Limitations such as IR diffraction limits, spatial resolution issues, and spectral resolution issues can prevent detection of organics, detection and identification of cellular structures, and the disentangling of granular mixtures. Optical-PhotoThermal InfraRed (O-PTIR) spectroscopy is a relatively new method of spectroscopy currently used in fields other than planetary sciences. O-PTIR is a non-destructive, highly repeatable, and fast form of measurement capable of reducing these limitations. Using a dual laser system with an IR source tuned to the mid-IR wavelength we performed laboratory O-PTIR measurements to compare O-PTIR data to existing IR absorption data and laboratory FTIR measurements for planetary materials. We do this for the purpose of introducing O-PTIR to the planetary science community. The technique featured here would serve to better measurements of planetary bodies during in-situ analysis. We find that, unlike other fields where O-PTIR produces almost one-to-one measurements with IR absorption measurements of the same material, granular materials relevant to planetary science do not. However, we do find that the materials compared were significantly close and O-PTIR was still capable of identifying materials relevant to planetary science.</description>

      <title>SWEET-Cat: A view on the planetary mass-radius relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SWEET-Cat (Stars With ExoplanETs Catalogue) was originally introduced in 2013, and since then, the number of confirmed exoplanets has increased significantly. A crucial step for a comprehensive understanding of these new worlds is the precise and homogeneous characterization of their host stars. We used a large number of high-resolution spectra to continue the addition of new stellar parameters for planet-host stars in SWEET-Cat following the new detection of exoplanets listed both at the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia and at the NASA exoplanet archive. We obtained high-resolution spectra for a significant number of these planet-host stars, either observed by our team or collected through public archives. For FGK stars, the spectroscopic stellar parameters were derived for the spectra following the same homogeneous process using ARES+MOOG as for the previous SWEET-Cat releases. The stellar properties are combined with the planet properties to study possible correlations that could shed more light into the star-planet connection studies. We increase the number of stars with homogeneous parameters by 232 ($\sim$ 25\% - from 959 to 1191). We then focus on the exoplanets with both mass and radius determined to review the mass-radius relation where we find consistent results with the ones previously reported in the literature. For the massive planets we also revisit the radius anomaly where we confirm a metallicity correlation for the radius anomaly already hinted in previous results.</description>

      <title>Drifts of the sub-stellar points of the TRAPPIST-1 planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of tidal interactions is crucial for interpreting recent JWST observations of the thermal emissions of TRAPPIST-1~b and c and for characterizing the surface conditions and potential habitability of the other planets in the system. Indeed, the rotation state of the planets, driven by tidal forces, significantly influences the heat redistribution regime. Due to their proximity to their host star and the estimated age of the system, the TRAPPIST-1 planets are commonly assumed to be in a synchronization state. In this work, we present the recent implementation of the co-planar tidal torque and forces equations within the formalism of Kaula in the N-body code Posidonius. This enables us to explore the hypothesis of synchronization using a tidal model well suited to rocky planets. We studied the rotational state of each planet by taking into account their multi-layer internal structure computed with the code Burnman. Simulations show that the TRAPPIST-1 planets are not perfectly synchronized but oscillate around the synchronization state. Planet-planet interactions lead to strong variations on the mean motion and tides fail to keep the spin synchronized with respect to the mean motion. As a result, the sub-stellar point of each planet experiences short oscillations and long-timescale drifts that lead the planets to achieve a synodic day with periods varying from $55$~years to $290$~years depending on the planet.</description>

      <title>Probing the Possible Causes of the Transit Timing Variation for TrES-2b in TESS Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, transit timing variations (TTVs) are proving to be a very valuable tool in exoplanetary science to detect exoplanets by observing variations in transit times. To study the transit timing variation of the hot Jupiter, TrES-2b, we have combined 64 high-quality transit light curves from all seven sectors of NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) along with 60 best-quality light curves from the ground-based facility Exoplanet Transit Database (ETD) and 106 mid-transit times from the previous works. From the precise transit timing analysis, we have observed a significant improvement in the orbital ephemerides, but we did not detect any short period TTVs that might result from an additional body. The inability to detect short-term TTVs further motivates us to investigate long-term TTVs, which might be caused by orbital decay, apsidal precession, Applegate mechanism, and $R{\phi}$mer effect and the orbital decay appeared to be a better explanation for the observed TTV with $\Delta BIC$ = 4.32. The orbital period of the hot Jupiter TrES-2b appears to be shrinking at a rate of $-5.58 \pm 1.81$ ms/yr. Assuming this decay is primarily caused by tidal dissipation within the host star, we have subsequently calculated the stellar tidal quality factor value to be 9900, which is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the theoretically predicted values for other hot-Jupiter systems and its low value indicates more efficient tidal dissipation within the host star. Additional precise photometric and radial velocity observations are required to pinpoint the cause of the change in the orbital period.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet accretion monitoring spectroscopic survey (ENTROPY) I. Evidence for magnetospheric accretion in the young isolated planetary-mass object 2MASS J11151597+1937266</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion among planets is a poorly understood phenomenon, due to lack of both observational and theoretical studies. Detection of emission lines from accreting gas giants facilitate detailed investigations into this process. This work presents a detailed analysis of Balmer lines from one of the few known young, planetary-mass objects with observed emission, the isolated L2 dwarf 2MASS J11151597+1937266 with a mass 7-21 Mj and age 5-45 Myr, located at 45+-2 pc. We obtained the first high-resolution (R~50,000) spectrum of the target with VLT/UVES, a spectrograph in the near-UV to visible wavelengths (3200-6800 AA). We report resolved H3-H6 and He I (5875.6 AA) emission in the spectrum. Based on the asymmetric line profiles of H3 and H4, 10% width of H3 (199+-1 km/s), tentative He I 6678 AA emission and indications of a disk from MIR excess, we confirm ongoing accretion at this object. Using the Gaia update of the parallax, we revise its temperature to 1816+-63 K and radius to 1.5+-0.1 Rj. Analysis of observed H I profiles using 1D planet-surface shock model implies a pre-shock gas velocity of v0=120(+80,-40) km/s and a pre-shock density of log(n0/cm^-3)=14(+0,-5). Pre-shock velocity points to a mass of 6(+8,-4) Mj for the target. Combining the H I line luminosities and planetary Lline-Lacc scaling relations, we derive a mass accretion rate of 1.4(+2.8,-0.9)x10^-8 Mj/yr.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous precision navigation to land onto the Moon relies on vision sensors. Computer vision algorithms are designed, trained and tested using synthetic simulations. High quality terrain models have been produced by Moon orbiters developed by several nations, with resolutions ranging from tens or hundreds of meters globally down to few meters locally. The SurRender software is a powerful simulator able to exploit the full potential of these datasets in raytracing. New interfaces include tools to fuse multi-resolution DEMs and procedural texture generation. A global model of the Moon at 20m resolution was integrated representing several terabytes of data which SurRender can render continuously and in real-time. This simulator will be a precious asset for the development of future missions.</description>

      <title>A Pileup of Coronal Mass Ejections Produced the Largest Geomagnetic Storm in Two Decades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The largest geomagnetic storm in two decades occurred in 2024 May with a minimum $D_{\rm st}$ of $-412$ nT. We examine its solar and interplanetary origins by combining multipoint imaging and in situ observations. The source active region, NOAA AR 13664, exhibited extraordinary activity and produced successive halo eruptions, which were responsible for two complex ejecta observed at the Earth. In situ measurements from STEREO A, which was $12.6^{\circ}$ apart, allow us to compare the ``geo-effectiveness" at the Earth and STEREO A. We obtain key findings concerning the formation of solar superstorms and how mesoscale variations of coronal mass ejections affect geo-effectiveness: (1) the 2024 May storm supports the hypothesis that solar superstorms are ``perfect storms" in nature, i.e., a combination of circumstances resulting in an event of an unusual magnitude; (2) the first complex ejecta, which caused the geomagnetic superstorm, shows considerable differences in the magnetic field and associated ``geo-effectiveness" between the Earth and STEREO A, despite a mesoscale separation; and (3) two contrasting cases of complex ejecta are found in terms of the geo-effectiveness at the Earth, which is largely due to different magnetic field configurations within the same active region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: orbitize! is a package for Bayesian modeling of the orbital parameters of resolved binary objects from time series measurements. It was developed with the needs of the high-contrast imaging community in mind, and has since also become widely used in the binary star community. A generic orbitize! use case involves translating relative astrometric time series, optionally combined with radial velocity or astrometric time series, into a set of derived orbital posteriors. This paper is published alongside the release of orbitize! version 3.0, which has seen significant enhancements in functionality and accessibility since the release of version 1.0 (Blunt et al., 2020).</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the spectroscopic masses of 249 evolved stars using asteroseismology with TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One way to understand planet formation is through studying the correlations between planet occurrence rates and stellar mass. However, measuring stellar mass in the red giant regime is very difficult. In particular, the spectroscopic masses of certain evolved stars, often referred to as "retired A-stars", have been questioned in the literature. Efforts to resolve this mass controversy using spectroscopy, interferometry and asteroseismology have so far been inconclusive. A recent ensemble study found a mass-dependent mass offset, but the result was based on only 16 stars. With NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we expand the investigation of the mass discrepancy to a total of 92 low-luminosity stars, synonymous with the retired A-stars. We measure their characteristic oscillation frequency, $\mathrm{\nu}_{\mathrm{max}}$, and the large frequency separation, $\mathrm{\Delta\nu}$, from their TESS photometric time series. Using these measurements and asteroseismic scaling relations, we derive asteroseismic masses and compare them with spectroscopic masses from five surveys, to comprehensively study the alleged mass-dependent mass offset. We find a mass offset between spectroscopy and seismology that increases with stellar mass. However, we note that adopting the seismic mass scale does not have a significant effect on the planet occurrence-mass-metallicity correlation for the so-called retired A-stars. We also report seismic measurements and masses for 157 higher luminosity giants (mostly helium-core-burning) from the spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>On the Euler-type gravitomagnetic orbital effects in the field of a precessing body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To the first post-Newtonian order, the gravitational action of mass-energy currents is encoded by the off-diagonal gravitomagnetic components of the spacetime metric tensor. If they are time-dependent, a further acceleration enters the equations of motion of a moving test particle. Let the source of the gravitational field be an isolated, massive body rigidly rotating whose spin angular momentum experiences a slow precessional motion. The impact of the aforementioned acceleration on the orbital motion of a test particle is analytically worked out in full generality. The resulting averaged rates of change are valid for any orbital configuration of the satellite; furthermore, they hold for an arbitrary orientation of the precessional velocity vector of the spin of the central object. In general, all the orbital elements, with the exception of the mean anomaly at epoch, undergo nonvanishing long-term variations which, in the case of the Juno spacecraft currently orbiting Jupiter and the double pulsar PSR J0737-3039 A/B turn out to be quite small. Such effects might become much more relevant in a star-supermassive black hole scenario; as an example, the relative change of the semimajor axis of a putative test particle orbiting a Kerr black hole as massive as the one at the Galactic Centre at, say, 100 Schwarzschild radii may amount up to about $7\%$ per year if the hole's spin precessional frequency is $10\%$ of the particle's orbital one.</description>

      <title>Post-Keplerian perturbations of the hyperbolic motion in the field of a massive, rotating object</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the general relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring components of the gravitational field of a massive, rotating body are analytically worked out to the first post-Newtonian level. To the Newtonian order, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as well. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation in space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the primary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied first to 'Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system along an unbound heliocentric orbit. While its gravitoelectric shifts occurred close to the Sun's flyby are less than some tens of milliarcseconds, those due to the solar oblateness and angular momentum are of the order of microarcseconds throughout the whole trajectory. Comparable values occur for the post-Newtonian shifts of the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) spacecraft during its flyby of the Earth, while those due to the oblateness of the latter are nominally several orders of magnitude larger. The current (formal) uncertainty in the quadrupole mass moment of the geopotential would bring the mismodeling of such classical effects below the nominal value of the predicted relativistic disturbances. The hyperbolic excess velocity is not changed by any of the post--Keplerian accelerations considered. The calculational approach developed can be straightforwardly extended to any alternative models of gravity as well.</description>

      <title>AHKASH: a new Hybrid particle-in-cell code for simulations of astrophysical collisionless plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{A}$strophysical $\texttt{H}$ybrid-$\texttt{K}$inetic simulations with the $\texttt{flASH}$ code ($\texttt{AHKASH}$) -- a new Hybrid particle-in-cell (PIC) code developed within the framework of the multi-physics code $\texttt{FLASH}$. The new code uses a second-order accurate Boris integrator and a predictor-predictor-corrector algorithm for advancing the Hybrid-kinetic equations, using the constraint transport method to ensure that magnetic fields are divergence-free. The code supports various interpolation schemes between the particles and grid cells, with post-interpolation smoothing to reduce finite particle noise. We further implement a $\delta f$ method to study instabilities in weakly collisional plasmas. The new code is tested on standard physical problems such as the motion of charged particles in uniform and spatially varying magnetic fields, the propagation of Alfv\'en and whistler waves, and Landau damping of ion acoustic waves. We test different interpolation kernels and demonstrate the necessity of performing post-interpolation smoothing. We couple the $\texttt{TurbGen}$ turbulence driving module to the new Hybrid PIC code, allowing us to test the code on the highly complex physical problem of the turbulent dynamo. To investigate steady-state turbulence with a fixed sonic Mach number, it is important to maintain isothermal plasma conditions. Therefore, we introduce a novel cooling method for Hybrid PIC codes and provide tests and calibrations of this method to keep the plasma isothermal. We describe and test the `hybrid precision' method, which significantly reduces (by a factor $\sim1.5$) the computational cost, without compromising the accuracy of the numerical solutions. Finally, we test the parallel scalability of the new code, showing excellent scaling up to 10,000~cores.</description>

      <title>The coevolution of migrating planets and their pulsating stars through episodic resonance locking</title>

Abstract: Hot Jupiters are expected to form far from their host star and move toward close-in, circular orbits via a smooth, monotonic decay due to mild and constant tidal dissipation. Yet, three systems have recently been found exhibiting planet-induced stellar pulsations suggesting unexpectedly strong tidal interactions. Here we combine stellar evolution and tide models to show that dynamical tides raised by eccentric gas giants can give rise to chains of resonance locks with multiple modes, enriching the dynamics seen in single-mode resonance locking of circularized systems. These series of resonance locks yield orders-of-magnitude larger changes in eccentricity and harmonic pulsations relative to those expected from a single episode of resonance locking or nonresonant tidal interactions. Resonances become more frequent as a star evolves off the main sequence providing an alternative explanation to the origin of some stellar pulsators and yielding the concept of "dormant migrating giants". Evolution trajectories are characterized by competing episodes of inward/outward migration and spin-up/-down of the star which are sensitive to the system parameters, revealing a new challenge in modeling migration paths and in contextualizing the observed populations of giant exoplanets and stellar binaries. This sensitivity however offers a new window to constrain the stellar properties of planetary hosts via tidal asteroseismology.</description>

      <title>Flows, Circulations, and Energy Transport in the Outer and Deep Atmospheres of Synchronous and Non-synchronous Hot Jupiters</title>

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that vertical enthalpy transport can explain the inflated radii of highly irradiated gaseous exoplanets. They have also shown that rotation can influence this transport, leading to highly irradiated, rapidly rotating, objects that are uninflated. Here we explore the underlying flows, including the impact of (non)synchronous rotation. We use DYNAMICO to run a series of long-timescale, HD209-like, atmospheric models at various surface rotation rates. For models that are tidally-locked, we consider rotation rates between $1/16^\mathrm{th}$ and $40$ times the rotation rate of HD209, whilst for non-synchronous models we consider the range $1/8^\mathrm{th}$ to $4$x. We find that our synchronous models fall into one of three $\Omega$-dependent regimes: at low $\Omega$, we find that the outer atmosphere dynamics are driven by a divergent day-night wind, driving weak vertical transport and the formation of a night-side hot-spot. At intermediate $\Omega$, we find classical hot Jupiter dynamics, whilst at high $\Omega$ we find a strong Coriolis effect that suppresses off-equator dynamics, including the jet-driving standing waves, thus also reducing vertical transport. As for non-synchronicity, when small, we find that it has little effect on dynamics. However as it grows, we find that temporal variations prevents the formation of the persistent structures that drive global dynamics. We find that rotation can significantly impact the atmospheric dynamics of irradiated exoplanets, including vertical advection, which may explain the scatter in the radius-irradiation relation. We have also identified a seemingly robust feature at slow rotation: a night-side hot-spot. As this may have important implications for both the phase curve and atmospheric chemistry, we suggest that this study be followed up with next-generation GCMs that robustly model radiation/chemistry.</description>

      <title>A synchronous moon as a possible cause of Mars' initial triaxiality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14725v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper addresses the possibility of a young Mars having had a massive moon, which synchronised the rotation of Mars, and gave Mars an initial asymmetric triaxiality to be later boosted by geological processes. It turns out that a moon of less than a third of the lunar mass was capable of producing a sufficient initial triaxiality. The asymmetry of the initial tidal shape of the equator depends on timing: the initial asymmetry is much stronger if the synchronous moon shows up already at the magma-ocean stage. From the moment of synchronisation of Mars' rotation with the moon's orbital motion, and until the moon was eliminated (as one possibility, by an impact in the beginning of the LHB), the moon was sustaining an early value of Mars' rotation rate.</description>

      <title>Effect of time-varying X-ray emission from stellar flares on the ionization of protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: X-rays have significant impacts on cold, weakly ionized protoplanetary disks by increasing the ionization rate and driving chemical reactions. Stellar flares are explosions that emit intense X-rays and are the unique source of hard X-rays with an energy of $\gtrsim10$ keV in the protoplanetary disk systems. Hard X-rays should be carefully taken into account in models as they can reach the disk midplane as a result of scattering in the disk atmospheres. However, previous models are insufficient to predict the hard X-ray spectra because of simplifications in flare models. We develop a model of X-ray spectra of stellar flares based on observations and flare theories. The flare temperature and nonthermal electron emissions are modeled as functions of flare energy, which allows us to better predict the hard X-ray photon flux than before. Using our X-ray model, we conduct radiative transfer calculations to investigate the impact of flare hard X-rays on disk ionization, with a particular focus on the protoplanetary disk around a T Tauri star. We demonstrate that for a flare with an energy of $ 10^{35}$ erg, X-ray photons with $\gtrsim 5$ keV increase the ionization rates more than galactic cosmic rays down to $z \approx 0.1R$. The contribution of flare X-rays to the ionization at the midplane depends on the disk parameters such as disk mass and dust settling. We also find that the 10-year-averaged X-rays from multiple flares could certainly contribute to the ionization. These results emphasize the importance of stellar flares on the disk evolution.</description>
