      <title>RNA Dynamics from Experimental and Computational Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ribonucleic acids (RNA) are unique in that they can store genetic information, replicate and perform catalysis. Importantly, RNA molecules are highly dynamic, and thus determining the ensemble of conformations that they populate is crucial not only to elucidate their biological functions, but also for their potential use as therapeutic targets. Computational and experimental techniques provide complementary views on RNA dynamics, and their integration is fundamental to improve the accuracy of computations and the resolution of experiments. Recent exciting developments in this field, were discussed at the CECAM workshop ``RNA dynamics from experimental and computational approaches'', in Paris, June 26-28, 2023. This report outlines key `take-home' messages that emerged during this workshop from the presentations and discussions.</description>

      <title>FraGNNet: A Deep Probabilistic Model for Mass Spectrum Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process of identifying a compound from its mass spectrum is a critical step in the analysis of complex mixtures. Typical solutions for the mass spectrum to compound (MS2C) problem involve matching the unknown spectrum against a library of known spectrum-molecule pairs, an approach that is limited by incomplete library coverage. Compound to mass spectrum (C2MS) models can improve retrieval rates by augmenting real libraries with predicted spectra. Unfortunately, many existing C2MS models suffer from problems with prediction resolution, scalability, or interpretability. We develop a new probabilistic method for C2MS prediction, FraGNNet, that can efficiently and accurately predict high-resolution spectra. FraGNNet uses a structured latent space to provide insight into the underlying processes that define the spectrum. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of prediction error, and surpasses existing C2MS models as a tool for retrieval-based MS2C.</description>
