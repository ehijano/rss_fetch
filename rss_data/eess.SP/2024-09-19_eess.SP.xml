      <title>Robust Attitude Estimation with Quaternion Left-Invariant EKF and Noise Covariance Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of noise parameters is critical for optimal filter performance, especially in systems where true noise parameter values are unknown or time-varying. This article presents a quaternion left-invariant extended Kalman filter (LI-EKF) for attitude estimation, integrated with an adaptive noise covariance estimation algorithm. By employing an iterative expectation-maximization (EM) approach, the filter can effectively estimate both process and measurement noise covariances. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of attitude estimation accuracy and robustness to initial parameter misspecification. The adaptive LI-EKF's ability to adapt to time-varying noise characteristics makes it a promising solution for various applications requiring reliable attitude estimation, such as aerospace, robotics, and autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Decomposition and Error Margin Detection of Homodyned-K Distribution in Quantitative Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homodyned K-distribution (HK-distribution) parameter estimation in quantitative ultrasound (QUS) has been recently addressed using Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). BNNs have been shown to significantly reduce computational time in speckle statistics-based QUS without compromising accuracy and precision. Additionally, they provide estimates of feature uncertainty, which can guide the clinician's trust in the reported feature value. The total predictive uncertainty in Bayesian modeling can be decomposed into epistemic (uncertainty over the model parameters) and aleatoric (uncertainty inherent in the data) components. By decomposing the predictive uncertainty, we can gain insights into the factors contributing to the total uncertainty. In this study, we propose a method to compute epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties for HK-distribution parameters ($\alpha$ and $k$) estimated by a BNN, in both simulation and experimental data. In addition, we investigate the relationship between the prediction error and both uncertainties, shedding light on the interplay between these uncertainties and HK parameters errors.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning via VICReg Enables Training of EMG Pattern Recognition Using Continuous Data with Unclear Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the application of self-supervised learning via pre-trained Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for training surface electromyography pattern recognition models (sEMG-PR) using dynamic data with transitions. While labeling such data poses challenges due to the absence of ground-truth labels during transitions between classes, self-supervised pre-training offers a way to circumvent this issue. We compare the performance of LSTMs trained with either fully-supervised or self-supervised loss to a conventional non-temporal model (LDA) on two data types: segmented ramp data (lacking transition information) and continuous dynamic data inclusive of class transitions. Statistical analysis reveals that the temporal models outperform non-temporal models when trained with continuous dynamic data. Additionally, the proposed VICReg pre-trained temporal model with continuous dynamic data significantly outperformed all other models. Interestingly, when using only ramp data, the LSTM performed worse than the LDA, suggesting potential overfitting due to the absence of sufficient dynamics. This highlights the interplay between data type and model choice. Overall, this work highlights the importance of representative dynamics in training data and the potential for leveraging self-supervised approaches to enhance sEMG-PR models.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Property Sensing and Channel Reconstruction Based on Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge in ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for next-generation wireless systems. In this paper, we present a novel ISAC scheme that leverages the diffusion Schrodinger bridge (DSB) to realize the sensing of electromagnetic (EM) property of a target as well as the reconstruction of the wireless channel. The DSB framework connects EM property sensing and channel reconstruction by establishing a bidirectional process: the forward process transforms the distribution of EM property into the channel distribution, while the reverse process reconstructs the EM property from the channel. To handle the difference in dimensionality between the high-dimensional sensing channel and the lower-dimensional EM property, we generate latent representations using an autoencoder network. The autoencoder compresses the sensing channel into a latent space that retains essential features, which incorporates positional embeddings to process spatial context. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DSB framework, which achieves superior reconstruction of the targets shape, relative permittivity, and conductivity. Moreover, the proposed method can also realize high-fidelity channel reconstruction given the EM property of the target. The dual capability of accurately sensing the EM property and reconstructing the channel across various positions within the sensing area underscores the versatility and potential of the proposed approach for broad application in future ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Sound Event Localization and Detection: Deployment Challenges on Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sound event localization and detection (SELD) is critical for various real-world applications, including smart monitoring and Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Although deep neural networks (DNNs) represent the state-of-the-art approach for SELD, their significant computational complexity and model sizes present challenges for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, especially under real-time conditions. Despite the growing need for real-time SELD, research in this area remains limited. In this paper, we investigate the unique challenges of deploying SELD systems for real-world, real-time applications by performing extensive experiments on a commercially available Raspberry Pi 3 edge device. Our findings reveal two critical, often overlooked considerations: the high computational cost of feature extraction and the performance degradation associated with low-latency, real-time inference. This paper provides valuable insights and considerations for future work toward developing more efficient and robust real-time SELD systems</description>

      <title>Accelerated Algorithms for Source Orientation Detection (AORI) and Spatiotemporal LCMV (ALCMV) Beamforming in EEG Source Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper illustrates the development of two efficient source localization algorithms for electroencephalography (EEG) data, aimed at enhancing real-time brain signal reconstruction while addressing the computational challenges of traditional methods. Accurate EEG source localization is crucial for applications in cognitive neuroscience, neurorehabilitation, and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). To make significant progress toward precise source orientation detection and improved signal reconstruction, we introduce the Accelerated Linear Constrained Minimum Variance (ALCMV) beamforming toolbox and the Accelerated Brain Source Orientation Detection (AORI) toolbox. The ALCMV algorithm speeds up EEG source reconstruction by utilizing recursive covariance matrix calculations, while AORI simplifies source orientation detection from three dimensions to one, reducing computational load by 66% compared to conventional methods. Using both simulated and real EEG data, we demonstrate that these algorithms maintain high accuracy, with orientation errors below 0.2% and signal reconstruction accuracy within 2%. These findings suggest that the proposed toolboxes represent a substantial advancement in the efficiency and speed of EEG source localization, making them well-suited for real-time neurotechnological applications.</description>

      <title>Covert Communications Without Pre-Sharing of Side Information and Channel Estimation Over Quasi-Static Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new covert communication scheme that operates without pre-sharing side information and channel estimation, utilizing a Gaussian-distributed Grassmann constellation for noncoherent detection. By designing constant-amplitude symbols on the Grassmann manifold and multiplying them by random variables, we generate signals that follow an arbitrary probability distribution, such as Gaussian or skew-normal distributions. The mathematical property of the manifold enables the transmitter's random variables to remain unshared with the receiver, and the elimination of pilot symbols that could compromise covertness. The proposed scheme achieved higher covertness and achievable rates compared to conventional coherent Gaussian signaling schemes, without any penalty in terms of complexity.</description>

      <title>User Subgrouping in Scalable Cell-Free Massive MIMO Multicasting Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) is a breakthrough technology for beyond-5G systems, designed to significantly boost the energy and spectral efficiencies of future mobile networks while ensuring a consistent quality of service for all users. Additionally, multicasting has gained considerable attention recently because physical-layer multicasting offers an efficient method for simultaneously serving multiple users with identical service demands by sharing radio resources. Typically, multicast services are delivered either via unicast transmissions or a single multicast transmission. This work, however, introduces a novel subgroup-centric multicast CF-mMIMO framework that divides users into several multicast subgroups based on the similarities in their spatial channel characteristics. This approach allows for efficient sharing of the pilot sequences used for channel estimation and the precoding filters used for data transmission. The proposed framework employs two scalable precoding strategies: centralized improved partial MMSE (IP-MMSE) and distributed conjugate beam-forming (CB). Numerical results show that for scenarios where users are uniformly distributed across the service area, unicast transmissions using centralized IP-MMSE precoding are optimal. However, in cases where users are spatially clustered, multicast subgrouping significantly improves the sum spectral efficiency (SE) of the multicast service compared to both unicast and single multicast transmission. Notably, in clustered scenarios, distributed CB precoding outperforms IP-MMSE in terms of per-user SE, making it the best solution for delivering multicast content.</description>

      <title>User Subgrouping and Power Control for Multicast Massive MIMO over Spatially Correlated Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) is unquestionably a key enabler of the fifth-generation (5G) technology for mobile systems, enabling to meet the high requirements of upcoming mobile broadband services. Physical-layer multicasting refers to a technique for simultaneously serving multiple users, demanding for the same service and sharing the same radio resources, with a single transmission. Massive MIMO systems with multicast communications have been so far studied under the ideal assumption of uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels. In this work, we consider a practical multicast massive MIMO system over spatially correlated Rayleigh fading channels, investigating the impact of the spatial channel correlation on the favorable propagation, hence on the performance. We propose a subgrouping strategy for the multicast users based on their channel correlation matrices' similarities. The proposed subgrouping approach capitalizes on the spatial correlation to enhance the quality of the channel estimation, and thereby the effectiveness of the precoding. Moreover, we devise a max-min fairness (MMF) power allocation strategy that makes the spectral efficiency (SE) among different multicast subgroups uniform. Lastly, we propose a novel power allocation for uplink (UL) pilot transmission to maximize the SE among the users within the same multicast subgroup. Simulation results show a significant SE gain provided by our user subgrouping and power allocation strategies. Importantly, we show how spatial channel correlation can be exploited to enhance multicast massive MIMO communications.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Turbulence-Immune Free Space Optical Communication System based on Discrete-Time Analog Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To effectively mitigate the influence of atmospheric turbulence, a novel discrete-time analog transmission free-space optical (DTAT-FSO) communication scheme is proposed. It directly maps information sources to discrete-time analog symbols via joint source-channel coding and modulation. Differently from traditional digital free space optical (TD-FSO) schemes, the proposed DTAT-FSO approach can automatically adapt to the variation of the channel state, with no need to adjust the specific modulation and coding scheme. The performance of the DTAT-FSO system was evaluated in both intensity modulation/direct detection (IM/DD) and coherent FSO systems for high-resolution image transmission. The results show that the DTAT-FSO reliably transmits images at low received optical powers (ROPs) and automatically enhances quality at high ROPs, while the TD-FSO experiences cliff and leveling effects when the channel state varies. With respect to the TD-FSO scheme, the DTAT-FSO scheme improved receiver sensitivity by 2.5 dB in the IM/DD FSO system and 0.8 dB in the coherent FSO system, and it achieved superior image fidelity under the same ROP. The automatic adaptation feature and improved performance of the DTAT-FSO suggest its potential for terrestrial, airborne, and satellite optical networks, addressing challenges posed by atmospheric turbulence.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Learning of Transmitter and Receiver Filters in Bandwidth Limited Fiber Optic Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of end-to-end (E2E) learning for joint optimization of pulse-shaper and receiver filter to reduce intersymbol interference (ISI) in bandwidth-limited communication systems. We investigate this in two numerical simulation models: 1) an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with bandwidth limitation and 2) an intensity modulated direct detection (IM/DD) link employing an electro-absorption modulator. For both simulation models, we implement a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) scheme to ensure that the learned filters adhere to the bandwidth constraints of the WDM channels. Our findings reveal that E2E learning greatly surpasses traditional single-sided transmitter pulse-shaper or receiver filter optimization methods, achieving significant performance gains in terms of symbol error rate with shorter filter lengths. These results suggest that E2E learning can decrease the complexity and enhance the performance of future high-speed optical communication systems.</description>

      <title>Blind Deconvolution on Graphs: Exact and Stable Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a blind deconvolution problem on graphs, which arises in the context of localizing a few sources that diffuse over networks. While the observations are bilinear functions of the unknown graph filter coefficients and sparse input signals, a mild requirement on invertibility of the diffusion filter enables an efficient convex relaxation leading to a linear programming formulation that can be tackled with off-the-shelf solvers. Under the Bernoulli-Gaussian model for the inputs, we derive sufficient exact recovery conditions in the noise-free setting. A stable recovery result is then established, ensuring the estimation error remains manageable even when the observations are corrupted by a small amount of noise. Numerical tests with synthetic and real-world network data illustrate the merits of the proposed algorithm, its robustness to noise as well as the benefits of leveraging multiple signals to aid the (blind) localization of sources of diffusion. At a fundamental level, the results presented here broaden the scope of classical blind deconvolution of (spatio-)temporal signals to irregular graph domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a minimal power white box adversarial attack for Deep Learning based Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC). The proposed attack uses the Golden Ratio Search (GRS) method to find powerful attacks with minimal power. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method by comparing it with existing adversarial attack approaches. Additionally, we test the robustness of the proposed attack against various state-of-the-art architectures, including defense mechanisms such as adversarial training, binarization, and ensemble methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed attack is powerful, requires minimal power, and can be generated in less time, significantly challenging the resilience of current AMC methods.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Anomaly Detection in Network Flows with Low-Rank Tensor Decompositions and Deep Unrolling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is increasingly recognized as a key component for ensuring the resilience of future communication systems. While deep learning has shown state-of-the-art AD performance, its application in critical systems is hindered by concerns regarding training data efficiency, domain adaptation and interpretability. This work considers AD in network flows using incomplete measurements, leveraging a robust tensor decomposition approach and deep unrolling techniques to address these challenges. We first propose a novel block-successive convex approximation algorithm based on a regularized model-fitting objective where the normal flows are modeled as low-rank tensors and anomalies as sparse. An augmentation of the objective is introduced to decrease the computational cost. We apply deep unrolling to derive a novel deep network architecture based on our proposed algorithm, treating the regularization parameters as learnable weights. Inspired by Bayesian approaches, we extend the model architecture to perform online adaptation to per-flow and per-time-step statistics, improving AD performance while maintaining a low parameter count and preserving the problem's permutation equivariances. To optimize the deep network weights for detection performance, we employ a homotopy optimization approach based on an efficient approximation of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our proposed deep network architecture exhibits a high training data efficiency, outperforms reference methods, and adapts seamlessly to varying network topologies.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Channels in Atmospheric Conditions: Propagation Characteristics and Security Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the growing demand for higher wireless data rates, the interest in extending the carrier frequency of wireless links to the terahertz (THz) range has significantly increased. For long-distance outdoor wireless communications, THz channels may suffer substantial power loss and security issues due to atmospheric weather effects. It is crucial to assess the impact of weather on high-capacity data transmission to evaluate wireless system link budgets and performance accurately. In this article, we provide an insight into the propagation characteristics of THz channels under atmospheric conditions and the security aspects of THz communication systems in future applications. We conduct a comprehensive survey of our recent research and experimental findings on THz channel transmission and physical layer security, synthesizing and categorizing the state-of-the-art research in this domain. Our analysis encompasses various atmospheric phenomena, including molecular absorption, scattering effects, and turbulence, elucidating their intricate interactions with THz waves and the resultant implications for channel modeling and system design. Furthermore, we investigate the unique security challenges posed by THz communications, examining potential vulnerabilities and proposing novel countermeasures to enhance the resilience of these high-frequency systems against eavesdropping and other security threats. Finally, we discuss the challenges and limitations of such high-frequency wireless communications and provide insights into future research prospects for realizing the 6G vision, emphasizing the need for innovative solutions to overcome the atmospheric hurdles and security concerns in THz communications.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces Waste Factor (W) and Waste Figure (WF) to assess power efficiency in any multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) or single-input multiple-output (SIMO) or multiple-input single-output (MISO) cascaded communication system. This paper builds upon the new theory of Waste Factor, which systematically models added wasted power in any cascade for parallel systems such as MISO, SIMO, and MIMO systems, which are prevalent in current wireless networks. Here, we also show the advantage of W compared to conventional metrics for quantifying and analyzing energy efficiency. This work explores the utility of W in assessing energy efficiency in communication channels, within Radio Access Networks (RANs).</description>

      <title>Accelerating Point Cloud Ground Segmentation: From Mechanical to Solid-State Lidars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel parallel processing method for point cloud ground segmentation, aimed at the technology evolution from mechanical to solid-state Lidar (SSL). We first benchmark point-based, grid-based, and range image-based ground segmentation algorithms using the SemanticKITTI dataset. Our results indicate that the range image-based method offers superior performance and robustness, particularly in resilience to frame slicing. Implementing the proposed algorithm on an FPGA demonstrates significant improvements in processing speed and scalability of resource usage. Additionally, we develop a custom dataset using camera-SSL equipment on our test vehicle to validate the effectiveness of the parallel processing approach for SSL frames in real world, achieving processing rates up to 30.9 times faster than CPU implementations. These findings underscore the potential of parallel processing strategies to enhance Lidar technologies for advanced perception tasks in autonomous vehicles and robotics. The data and code will be available post-publication on our GitHub repository: \url{https://github.com/WPI-APA-Lab/GroundSeg-Solid-State-Lidar-Parallel-Processing}</description>
