      <title>The Pandora's Box Problem with Sequential Inspections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pandora's box problem (Weitzman 1979) is a core model in economic theory that captures an agent's (Pandora's) search for the best alternative (box). We study an important generalization of the problem where the agent can either fully open boxes for a certain fee to reveal their exact values or partially open them at a reduced cost. This introduces a new tradeoff between information acquisition and cost efficiency. We establish a hardness result and employ an array of techniques in stochastic optimization to provide a comprehensive analysis of this model. This includes (1) the identification of structural properties of the optimal policy that provide insights about optimal decisions; (2) the derivation of problem relaxations and provably near-optimal solutions; (3) the characterization of the optimal policy in special yet non-trivial cases; and (4) an extensive numerical study that compares the performance of various policies, and which provides additional insights about the optimal policy. Throughout, we show that intuitive threshold-based policies that extend the Pandora's box optimal solution can effectively guide search decisions.</description>

      <title>Meshless projection model-order reduction via reference spaces for smoothed-particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a model-order reduction framework for the meshless weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. The proposed framework introduces the concept of modal reference spaces to overcome the challenges of discovering low-dimensional subspaces from unstructured, dynamic, and mixing numerical topology that is often seen in SPH simulations. The proposed modal reference spaces enable a low-dimensional representation of the SPH field equations while maintaining their inherent meshless qualities. Modal reference spaces are constructed by projecting SPH snapshot data onto a reference space where low-dimensionality of field quantities can be discovered via traditional modal decomposition techniques (e.g., the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)). Modal quantities are mapped back to the meshless SPH space via scattered data interpolation during the online predictive stage. The proposed model-order reduction framework is cast into the \emph{meshless} Galerkin POD (GPOD) and the Adjoint Petrov--Galerkin (APG) projection model-order reduction (PMOR) formulation. The PMORs are tested on three numerical experiments: 1) the Taylor--Green vortex; 2) lid-driven cavity; and 3) flow past an open cavity. Results show good agreement in reconstructed and predictive velocity fields, which showcase the ability of the proposed framework to evolve the unstructured, dynamic, and mixing SPH field equations in a low-dimensional subspace. Results also show that the pressure field is sensitive to the projection error due to the stiff weakly-compressible assumption made in the current SPH framework, but can be alleviated through nonlinear approximations, such as the APG approach. Ultimately, the presented meshless model-order reduction framework marks a step toward enabling drastic cost savings of SPH simulations.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Enhanced Multi-Factor Quantitative Trading: A Cross-Sectional Portfolio Optimization Approach with Bias Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive machine learning framework for quantitative trading that achieves superior risk-adjusted returns through systematic factor engineering, real-time computation optimization, and cross-sectional portfolio construction. Our approach integrates multi-factor alpha discovery with bias correction techniques, leveraging PyTorch-accelerated factor computation and advanced portfolio optimization. The system processes 500-1000 factors derived from open-source alpha101 extensions and proprietary market microstructure signals. Key innovations include tensor-based factor computation acceleration, geometric Brownian motion data augmentation, and cross-sectional neutralization strategies. Empirical validation on Chinese A-share markets (2010-2024) demonstrates annualized returns of $20\%$ with Sharpe ratios exceeding 2.0, significantly outperforming traditional approaches. Our analysis reveals the critical importance of bias correction in factor construction and the substantial impact of cross-sectional portfolio optimization on strategy performance.

      <title>Scalable ADER-DG Transport Method with Polynomial Order Independent CFL Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods are known to suffer from increasingly restrictive time step constraints as the polynomial order increases, limiting their efficiency at high orders. In this paper, we introduce a novel locally implicit, but globally explicit ADER-DG scheme designed for transport-dominated problems. The method achieves a maximum stable time step governed by an element-width based CFL condition that is independent of the polynomial degree. By solving a set of element-local implicit problems at each time step, our approach more effectively captures the domain of dependence. As a result, our method remains stable for CFL numbers up to $1/\sqrt{d}$ in $d$ spatial dimensions. We provide a rigorous stability proof in one dimension, and extend the analysis to two and three dimensions using a semi-analytical von Neumann stability analysis. The accuracy and convergence of the method are demonstrated through numerical experiments on both linear and nonlinear test cases.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Plausibility-Validity Gap by Fine-Tuning a Reasoning-Enhanced LLM for Chemical Synthesis and Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate scientifically plausible but factually invalid information, a challenge we term the "plausibility-validity gap," particularly in specialized domains like chemistry. This paper presents a systematic methodology to bridge this gap by developing a specialized scientific assistant. We utilized the Magistral Small model, noted for its integrated reasoning capabilities, and fine-tuned it using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). A key component of our approach was the creation of a "dual-domain dataset," a comprehensive corpus curated from various sources encompassing both molecular properties and chemical reactions, which was standardized to ensure quality. Our evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model achieves significant improvements over the baseline model in format adherence, chemical validity of generated molecules, and the feasibility of proposed synthesis routes. The results indicate a hierarchical learning pattern, where syntactic correctness is learned more readily than chemical possibility and synthesis feasibility. While a comparative analysis with human experts revealed competitive performance in areas like chemical creativity and reasoning, it also highlighted key limitations, including persistent errors in stereochemistry, a static knowledge cutoff, and occasional reference hallucination. This work establishes a viable framework for adapting generalist LLMs into reliable, specialized tools for chemical research, while also delineating critical areas for future improvement.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Information-Driven Optical Design with Interchanging Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that imaging systems can be evaluated through the information content of their measurements alone, enabling application-agnostic optical design that avoids computational decoding challenges. Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL) was proposed to automate this process through gradient-based. In this work, we study IDEAL across diverse imaging systems and find that it suffers from high memory usage, long runtimes, and a potentially mismatched objective function due to end-to-end differentiability requirements. We introduce IDEAL with Interchanging Optimization (IDEAL-IO), a method that decouples density estimation from optical parameter optimization by alternating between fitting models to current measurements and updating optical parameters using fixed models for information estimation. This approach reduces runtime and memory usage by up to 6x while enabling more expressive density models that guide optimization toward superior designs. We validate our method on diffractive optics, lensless imaging, and snapshot 3D microscopy applications, establishing information-theoretic optimization as a practical, scalable strategy for real-world imaging system design.</description>

      <title>The gradual transformation of inland areas -- human plowing, horse plowing and equity incentives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many modern areas have not learned their lessons and often hope for the wisdom of later generations, resulting in them only possessing modern technology and difficult to iterate ancient civilizations. At present, there is no way to tell how we should learn from history and promote the gradual upgrading of civilization. Therefore, we must tell the history of civilization's progress and the means of governance, learn from experience to improve the comprehensive strength and survival ability of civilization, and achieve an optimal solution for the tempering brought by conflicts and the reduction of internal conflicts. Firstly, we must follow the footsteps of history and explore the reasons for the long-term stability of each country in conflict, including providing economic benefits to the people and means of suppressing them; then, use mathematical methods to demonstrate how we can achieve the optimal solution at the current stage. After analysis, we can conclude that the civilization transformed from human plowing to horse plowing can easily suppress the resistance of the people and provide them with the ability to resist; The selection of rulers should consider multiple institutional aspects, such as exams, elections, and drawing lots; Economic development follows a lognormal distribution and can be adjusted by expected value and variance. Using a lognormal distribution with the maximum value to divide equity can adjust the wealth gap.</description>
