      <title>Limits of the Formal Integrals of Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a formal (approximate) integral of motion in Hamiltonians of the form $H=\frac{1}{2}(X^2+Y^2+\omega_1^2x^2+\omega_2^2y^2)+\epsilon(\eta xy^2+\alpha x^3+\beta x^2y+\gamma y^3)$ generalizing previous cases with $\beta=\gamma=0$. First we give the general form of this integral when $\omega_1/\omega_2$ is irrational and then we consider the case of commensurable frequencies. In particular we study the integrals for the resonances $\omega_1/\omega_2=4/1, 5/1, 3/2, 4/3, 3/1$ and $2/1$. We also calculate the invariant curves and the orbits in the cases $\omega_1/\omega_2=2/1$ and $1/1$ (with $\beta=\gamma=0$) and we compare the exact-numerical and the theoretical results predicted by the formal integral when $\beta\gamma\neq0$. In the special case $\omega_1/\omega_2=1/1$ we find an integral when $\beta=\gamma=0$ and $\eta\alpha\neq0$ or $\eta=\alpha=0$ and $\beta\gamma\neq 0$, but this is not possible when $\eta\alpha\beta\gamma\neq 0$. However, we find that the invariant curves and the orbits can be approximated by a non-resonant integral with $\omega_1/\omega_2=5\sqrt{2}/7=1.010\dots$.</description>

      <title>The phenomenon of resonance in the continuous phase transition of finite-size systems: A passage from Classical World to Quantum World through the resonance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In finite-size systems undergoing a continuous phase transition, the passage from the symmetric phase to the broken-symmetry phase is accomplished through a hysteresis zone, up to spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). In the present work, we find that a resonance phenomenon takes place within this zone. This resonance is manifested as a maximization of the mean waiting time as a function of temperature inside the hysteresis region. An interesting issue concerns how this resonance is connected with the existence of particles (tachyons) or quasiparticles (kink solitons) within the hysteresis zone. Finally, we introduce the idea that this resonance delineates a continuous passage from a "classical" phase to a "quantum" phase for a binary system, such as the three-dimensional Ising model, which belongs to the same universality class as a fermion-antifermion system or, more generally, a matter-antimatter system.</description>

      <title>Theoretical relationship between the macro-texture and micro-structure in dairy processing revealed by the multi-scale simulation of coupled map lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theoretical relationship between the macroscopic textural quality and microscopic structural quality appearing in the phase inversion processes from fresh cream via whipped cream to butter is revealed by the multi-scale simulation of coupled map lattice (CML) based on the mesoscopic elementary processes of the emulsion interfaces. Using the Young-Laplace equation, we derive the microscopic particle quantities of the size and density of air bubbles and butter grains in an emulsion from the macroscopic rheological quantities of the overrun and viscosity of the emulsion. In doing so, we focus on the size determined by the "tug-of-war" between air bubbles and butter grains via their cohesion pressures, and on the density determined by the "costume change" of the emulsion molecular complexes (clad particles, e.g., butter grain-clad air bubbles) to their suitable size. Using the obtained microscopic particle quantities, we now propose a microscopic state diagram, the size-density plane, in addition to the previously proposed macroscopic state diagram, the viscosity-overrun plane. These state diagrams reveal that while the two well-known different phase inversion processes at high and low whipping temperatures appear as the two parallel processes of viscosity dominance and overrun dominance in the viscosity-overrun plane, they appear as the two orthogonal processes of isodensity/size dominance and isosize/density dominance in the size-density plane. This theoretical simulation result is significant for the quality design of butter because it demonstrates that differences in macroscopic textural quality can be easily controlled by differences in microscopic structural quality.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal stability of synchronized coupled map lattice states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the realm of spatiotemporal chaos, unstable periodic orbits play a major role in understanding the dynamics. Their stability changes and bifurcations in general are thus of central interest. Here, coupled map lattice discretizations of nonlinear partial differential equations, exhibiting a variety of behaviors depending on the coupling strength, are considered. In particular, the linear stability analysis of synchronized states is performed by evaluating the Bravais lattice orbit Jacobian in its reciprocal space first Brillouin zone, with space and time treated on equal grounds. The eigenvalues of the orbit Jacobian operator, computed as functions of the coupling strength, tell us about the stability of the periodic orbit under a perturbation of a certain time- and space frequency. Moreover, the stability under aperiodic, that is, incoherent perturbations, is revealed by integrating the sum of the stability exponents over all space-time frequencies.</description>

      <title>Turbulence and far-from-equilibrium equation of state of Bogoliubov waves in Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15163v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bogoliubov waves are fundamental excitations of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs). They emerge from a perturbed ground state and interact nonlinearly, triggering turbulent cascades. Here, we study turbulent BECs theoretically and numerically using the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii model and its associated wave-kinetic equations. We derive a new Kolmogorov-like stationary spectrum for short Bogoliubov waves and find a complete analytical expression for the spectrum in the long-wave acoustic regime. We then use our predictions to explain the BEC equation of state reported in [Dora et al. Nature 620,521 (2023)], and to suggest new experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Computation of attractor dimension and maximal sums of Lyapunov exponents using polynomial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two approaches are presented for computing upper bounds on Lyapunov exponents and their sums, and on the Lyapunov dimension, among all trajectories of a dynamical system governed by ordinary differential equations. The first approach expresses a sum of Lyapunov exponents as a time average in an augmented dynamical system and then applies methods for bounding time averages. This generalizes the method of Oeri \&amp; Goluskin (Nonlinearity 36:5378--5400, 2023) for bounding the single largest Lyapunov exponent. The second approach considers a different augmented dynamical system, where bounds on sums of Lyapunov exponents are implied by stability of certain sets, and such stability is verified using Lyapunov function methods. Both of our approaches also can be adapted to directly compute bounds on Lyapunov dimension, which in turn imply bounds on the fractal dimension of a global attractor. For systems of ordinary differential equations with polynomial right-hand sides, all of our bounding formulations lead to polynomial optimization problems with sum-of-squares constraints. These sum-of-squares problems can be solved computationally for a chosen system to yield numerical bounds, provided the number of variables and degree of polynomials are not prohibitive. Most of our bounding formulations are proved to be sharp under mild assumptions. In the case of the polynomial optimization problems, sharpness means that upper bounds converge to the quantities being bounded as polynomial degrees are raised. Computational examples demonstrate upper bounds that are sharp to several digits, including for a six-dimensional dynamical system where sums of Lyapunov exponents are maximized on periodic orbits.</description>
