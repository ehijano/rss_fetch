      <title>Testing the simplicity of strategy-proof mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper experimentally evaluates four mechanisms intended to achieve the Uniform outcome in rationing problems (Sprumont, 1991). Our benchmark is the dominant-strategy, direct-revelation mechanism of the Uniform rule. A strategically equivalent mechanism that provides non-binding feedback during the reporting period greatly improves performance. A sequential revelation mechanism produces modest improvements despite not possessing dominant strategies. A novel, obviously strategy-proof mechanism, devised by Arribillaga et al. (2023), does not improve performance. We characterize each alternative to the direct mechanism, finding general lessons about the advantages of real-time feedback and sequentiality of play as well as the potential shortcomings of an obviously strategy-proof mechanism.</description>

      <title>Decision making in stochastic extensive form I: Stochastic decision forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general theory of stochastic decision forests reconciling two concepts of information flow -- decision trees and refined partitions on the one hand, filtrations from probability theory on the other -- is constructed. The traditional "nature" agent is replaced with a one-shot lottery draw that determines a tree of a given decision forest, while each "personal" agent is equipped with an oracle providing updates on the draw's result and makes partition refining choices adapted to this information. This theory overcomes the incapacity of existing approaches to extensive form theory to capture continuous time stochastic processes like Brownian motion as outcomes of "nature" decision making in particular. Moreover, a class of stochastic decision forests based on paths of action indexed by time is constructed, covering a large fraction of models from the literature and constituting a first step towards an approximation theory for stochastic differential games in extensive form.</description>

      <title>Central Bank Digital Currency with Collateral-constrained Banks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10359v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the risks to financial stability following the introduction of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The CBDC competes with commercial bank deposits as the household's source of liquidity. We revisit the result in the literature regarding the equivalence of payment systems by introducing a collateral constraint for banks when borrowing from the central bank. When comparing two equilibria with and without the CBDC, the central bank can ensure the same equilibrium allocation and price system by offering loans to banks. However, to access loans, banks must hold government bonds as collateral at the expense of extending credit to firms, and the central bank assumes part of the credit-extension role. Thus, in the equivalence analysis, while the CBDC introduction has no real effects on the economy, it does not guarantee full neutrality as it affects banks' business models. We also analyze the dynamics of an increase in the CBDC and show that the CBDC not only does not cause bank disintermediation and financial instability but may foster an expansion of bank credit to firms.</description>
