      <title>A delay nonlocal quasilinear Chafee-Infante problem: An approach via semigroup theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study a dissipative one dimensional scalar parabolic problem with non-local nonlinear diffusion with delay. We consider the general situation in which the functions involved are only continuous and solutions may not be unique. We establish conditions for global existence and prove the existence of global attractors. All results are presented only in the autonomous since the non-autonomous case follows in the same way, including the existence of pullback attractors. A particularly interesting feature is that there is a semilinear problem (nonlocal in space and in time) from which one can obtain all solutions of the associated quasilinear problem and that for this semilinear problem the delay depends on the initial function making its study more involved.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Free Boundaries in the Incompressible Limit of Tumor Growth Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the general Porous Medium Equations with drift and source terms that model tumor growth. Incompressible limit of such models has been well-studied in the literature, where convergence of the density and pressure variables are established, while it remains unclear whether the free boundaries of the solutions exhibit convergence as well. In this paper, we provide an affirmative result by showing that the free boundaries converge in the Hausdorff distance in the incompressible limit. To achieve this, we quantify the relation between the free boundary motion and spatial average of the pressure, and establish a uniform-in-$m$ strict expansion property of the pressure supports. As a corollary, we derive upper bounds for the Hausdorff dimensions of the free boundaries and show that the limiting free boundary has finite $(d-1)$-dimensional Hausdorff measure.</description>

      <title>Global solutions for stochastically controlled fluid dynamics models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a class of evolution equations that possibly have only local solutions, we introduce a stochastic component that ensures that the solutions of the corresponding stochastically perturbed equations are global. The class of partial differential equations amenable for this type of treatment includes the 3D Navier-Stokes equation, the rotating shallow water equation (viscous and inviscid), 3D Euler equation (in vorticity form), 2D Burgers' equation and many other fluid dynamics models.</description>

      <title>On the first eigenvalue of the generalized laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the energy of minimizers of Rayleigh-type quotients of the form $$ \frac{\int_\Omega A(|\nabla u|)\, dx}{\int_\Omega A(|u|)\, dx}. $$
  These minimizers are eigenfunctions of the generalized laplacian defined as $\Delta_a u = \text{div}\left(a(|\nabla u|)\frac{\nabla u}{|\nabla u|}\right)$ where $a(t)=A'(t)$ and the Rayleigh quotient is comparable to the associated eigenvalue. On the function $A$ we only assume that it is a Young function but no $\Delta_2$ condition is imposed.
  Since the problem is not homogeneous, the energy of minimizers is known to strongly depend on the normalization parameter $\alpha =\int_\Omega A(|u|)\, dx$. In this work we precisely analyze this dependence and show differentiability of the energy with respect to $\alpha$ and, moreover, the limits as $\alpha\to 0$ and $\alpha\to \infty$ of the Rayleigh quotient.
  The nonlocal version of this problem is also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Discrete and Continuum Area-Preserving Mean-Curvature Flow of Rectangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the area-preserving mean-curvature-type motion of a two-dimensional lattice crystal obtained by coupling constrained minimizing movements scheme introduced by Almgren, Taylor and Wang with a discrete-to-continuous analysis. We first examine the continuum counterpart of the model and establish the existence and uniqueness of the flat flow, originating from a rectangle. Additionally, we characterize the governing system of ordinary differential equations. Subsequently, in the atomistic setting, we identify geometric properties of the discrete-in-time flow and describe the governing system of finite-difference inclusions. Finally, in the limit where both spatial and time scales vanish at the same rate, we prove that a discrete-to-continuum evolution is expressed through a system of differential inclusions which does never reduce to a system of ODEs.</description>

      <title>On the Dirichlet-to-Neumann Map for the $p$-Laplacian on a Metric Measure Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we construct a Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, from a Besov space of functions, to the dual of this class. The Besov spaces are of functions on the boundary of a bounded, locally compact uniform domain equipped with a doubling measure supporting a $p$-Poincar\'e inequality so that this boundary is also equipped with a Radon measure that has a codimensional relationship with the measure on the domain. We construct this map via the following recipe. We show first that solutions to Dirichlet problem for the $p$-Laplacian on the domain with prescribed boundary data in the Besov space induce an operator that lives in the dual of the Besov space. Conversely, we show that there is a solution, in the homogeneous Newton-Sobolev space, to the Neumann problem for the $p$-Laplacian with the Neumann boundary data given by a continuous linear functional belonging to the dual of the Besov space. We also obtain bounds on its operator norm in terms of the norms of trace and extension operators that relate Newton-Sobolev functions on the domain to Besov functions on the boundary.</description>

      <title>The Neumann problem of special Lagrangian type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Neumann problem for special Lagrangian type equations with critical and supercritical phases. These equations naturally generalize the special Lagrangian equation and the k-Hessian equation. By establishing uniform a priori estimates up to the second order, we obtain the existence result using the continuity method. The new technical aspect is our direct proof of boundary double normal derivative estimates. In particular, we directly prove the double normal estimates for the 2-Hessian equation in dimension 3. Moreover, we solve the classical Neumann problem by proving the uniform gradient estimate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the problem of finite-time blowup for a multi-dimensional nonlocal transport equation studied in [Dong, Adv. Math. 264 (2014) 747-761]. Inspired by a one-dimensional analogous model considered in [Li-Rodrigo, Adv. Math. 374 (2020) 1-26], we establish a new weighted nonlinear inequality implying the blow-up by a completely real variable based technique.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Cross-Diffusion for Overcrowding Dispersal in Interacting Species System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces and study a novel class of reaction-diffusion systems to model the evolution of two interacting species that disperse to avoid overcrowding. Our approach employs the principle of proximal minimization energy, implemented through a minimum flow proximal algorithm. This framework offers a potential generalization of existing systems commonly used in the theory of segregation for interacting species dynamics. Beyond existence and uniqueness, this approach allows us to capture the dynamic interplay between diffusion rates and concentration gradients of each species, and has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of how cross-diffusion shapes the spatial distribution, coexistence, and pattern formation of multiple species within a system.</description>

      <title>Real eternal PDE solutions are not complex entire: a quadratic parabolic example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In parabolic or hyperbolic PDEs, solutions which remain uniformly bounded for all real times $t=r\in\mathbb{R}$ are often called PDE entire or eternal. For example, consider the quadratic parabolic PDE \begin{equation*} \label{*} w_t=w_{xx}+6w^2-\lambda, \tag{*} \end{equation*} for $0&lt;x&lt;\tfrac{1}{2}$, under Neumann boundary conditions. By its gradient-like structure, all real eternal non-equilibrium orbits $\Gamma(r)$ of \eqref{*} are heteroclinic among equilibria $w=W_n(x)$. All nontrivial real $W_n$ are rescaled and properly translated real-valued Weierstrass elliptic functions $W_n(x)=-n^2 \wp(nx+\tfrac{1}{2}\tau),\ n=1,2,3,\ldots$, with lattice periods 1 and the purely imaginary modular parameter $\tau$, and with Morse index $i(W_n)=n$ at $\lambda=\tfrac{1}{2}n^4 g_2(\tau)$.
  We show that the complex time extensions $\Gamma(r+\mathrm{i}s)$, of the real analytic heteroclinic orbits towards $W_0=-\sqrt{\lambda/6}$, are not complex entire. For any fixed real $r_0$, for example, consider the time-reversible complex-valued solution $\psi(s)$ of the nonlinear and nonconservative quadratic Schr\"odinger equation \begin{equation*} \label{**} \mathrm{i}\psi_s=\psi_{xx}+6\psi^2-\lambda \tag{**} \end{equation*} with real initial condition $\psi_0=\Gamma(r_0)$. Then there exist $r_0$ such that $\psi(s)$ blows up at some finite real times $\pm s^*$.
  Abstractly, our results are formulated in the setting of analytic semigroups. They are based on Poincar\'e non-resonance of unstable eigenvalues at equilibria $W_n$, near pitchfork bifurcation. Technically, we have to except a discrete set of $\lambda&gt;0$, and are currently limited to unstable dimensions $n\leq22$, or to fast unstable manifolds of dimensions $d&lt;1+\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}n$.</description>

      <title>On Asymptotically Almost Periodic Solutions of the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system on real hyperbolic Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we investigate the existence, uniqueness and exponential decay of asymptotically almost periodic solutions of the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system on a real hyperbolic manifold. We prove the existence and uniqueness of such solutions in the linear equation case by using the dispersive and smoothing estimates of the heat semigroup. Then we pass to the well-posedness of semi-linear equation case by using the results of linear equation and fixed point arguments. The exponential decay is proven by using Gronwall's inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a damped wave (or Klein-Gordon) equation on a bounded domain, with a focusing power-like nonlinearity satisfying some growth conditions, we prove that a global solution is bounded in the energy space, uniformly in time. Our result applies in particular to the case of a cubic equation on a bounded domain of dimension 3.</description>

      <title>Fine boundary continuity for degenerate double-phase diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the boundary behavior of solutions to parabolic double-phase equations through the celebrated Wiener's sufficiency criterion. The analysis is conducted for cylindrical domains and the regularity up to the lateral boundary is shown in terms of either its $p$ or $q$ capacity, depending on whether the phase vanishes at the boundary or not. Eventually we obtain a fine boundary estimate that, when considering uniform geometric conditions as density or fatness, leads us to the boundary H\"older continuity of solutions. In particular, the double-phase elicits new questions on the definition of an adapted capacity.</description>

      <title>Unconditional deep-water limit of the intermediate long wave equation in low-regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the unconditional deep-water limit of the intermediate long wave equation (ILW) to the Benjamin-Ono equation (BO) in low-regularity Sobolev spaces on both the real line and the circle. Our main tool is new unconditional uniqueness results for ILW in $H^s$ when $s_0&lt;s\leq \frac 14$ on the line and $s_0&lt;s&lt; \frac 12$ on the circle, where $s_0 = 3-\sqrt{33/4}\approx 0.1277$. Here, we adapt the strategy of Mo\c{s}incat-Pilod (2023) for BO to the setting of ILW by viewing ILW as a perturbation of BO and making use of the smoothing property of the perturbation term.</description>

      <title>Hardy inequalities and uncertainty principles in the presence of a black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we establish Hardy and Heisenberg uncertainty-type inequalities for the exterior of a Schwarzschild black hole. The weights that appear in both inequalities are tailored to fit the geometry, and can both be compared to the related Riemannian distance from the event horizon to yield inequalities for that distance. Moreover, in both cases the classic Euclidean inequalities with a point singularity can be recovered in the limit where one stands ``far enough'' from the black hole, as expected from the asymptotic flatness of the metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $N\geq 3,$ we consider the critical Hardy-Sobolev equation $-\Delta u-\frac{\gamma}{|x|^2}u=\frac{|u|^{2^*(s)-2}u}{|x|^s}$ in $\mathbb{R}^N\setminus \{0\},$ where $0&lt;\gamma&lt;\gamma_{H}:=\left(\frac{N-2}{2}\right)^2,\,s\in (0,2)$ and $2^*(s)=\frac{2(N-s)}{(N-2)}.$ We prove a stability estimate for the corresponding Hardy-Sobolev inequality in the spirit of Bianchi-Egnell (1991). Also, we obtain a Struwe-type decomposition (1984) for the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation. Finally, we prove a quantitative bound for one bubble, namely $\operatorname{dist}(u,\mathcal{M})\lesssim \Gamma(u)$ in the spirit of Ciraolo-Figalli-Maggi (2017).</description>

      <title>Positivity and asymptotic behaviour of solutions to a generalized nonlocal fast diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the positivity and asymptotic behaviour of nonnegative solutions of a general nonlocal fast diffusion equation,
  \[\partial_t u + \mathcal{L}\varphi(u) = 0,\]
and the interplay between these two properties. Here $\mathcal{L}$ is a stable-like operator and $\varphi$ is a singular nonlinearity.
  We start by analysing positivity by means of a weak Harnack inequality satisfied by a related elliptic (nonlocal) equation. Then we use this positivity to establish the asymptotic behaviour: under certain hypotheses on the nonlocal operator and nonlinearity, our solutions behave asymptotically as the Barenblatt solution of the standard fractional fast diffusion equation.
  The main difficulty stems from the generality of the operator, which does not allow the use of the methods that were available for the fractional Laplacian. Our results are new even in the case where $\varphi$ is a power.</description>

      <title>A PDE Framework of Consensus-Based Optimization for Objectives with Multiple Global Minimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consensus-based optimization (CBO) is an agent-based derivative-free method for non-smooth global optimization that has been introduced in 2017, leveraging a surprising interplay between stochastic exploration and Laplace principle. In addition to its versatility and effectiveness in handling high-dimensional, non-convex, and nonsmooth optimization problems, this approach lends itself well to theoretical analysis. Indeed, its dynamics is governed by a degenerate nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation, whose large-time behavior explains the convergence of the method. Recent results provide guarantees of convergence under the restrictive assumption of a unique global minimizer for the objective function. In this work, we proposed a novel and simple variation of CBO to tackle nonconvex optimizations with multiple minimizers. Despite the simplicity of this new model, its analysis is particularly challenging because of its nonlinearity and nonlocal nature. We prove the existence of solutions of the corresponding nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation and we show exponential concentration in time to the set of minimizers made of multiple smooth, convex, and compact components. Our proofs require combining several ingredients, such as delicate geometrical arguments, new variants of a quantitative Laplace principle, ad hoc regularizations and approximations, and regularity theory for parabolic equations. Ultimately, this result suggests that the corresponding CBO algorithm, formulated as an Euler-Maruyama discretization of the underlying empirical stochastic process, tends to converge to global minimizers.</description>

      <title>On the smallness of mean oscillations on metric-measure spaces and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It will be established that the mean oscillation of a function on a metric-measure space $X\times Y$ will be small if its mean oscillation on $X$ is small and some simple information on its (partial $Y$) upper-gradient is given. Applications to the regularity and global existence of bounded solutions to strongly coupled elliptic/parabolic systems on thin domains are also considered.</description>

      <title>A viscoelastic model for skin via homogenization theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out the homogenization of a fluid-structure interaction problem consisting in the periodic inclusions of a viscous fluid in an elastic body. We get a macrostructure model where the body behaves as a viscoelastic material with a long-range memory term. Our aim is not only to get this limit problem but also to study its main properties. Using the micro-structure variables it is simple to check that it satisfies an energy conservation law assuring in particular the existence and uniqueness of solution. The difficulty is to characterize these properties using only the macroscopic system. We prove that the nonlocal term is given through a convolution kernel which exponentially decreases to zero and satisfies some positive conditions which we write in terms of the Laplace transform. These conditions can be used to directly prove the existence and uniqueness of solution. The results apply to modeling the mechanical behavior of skin as an indicator of what kind of models we should use. In a naive interpretation the fluid inclusions represent the cells and the elastic medium the extracellular matrix.</description>

      <title>Minimisers of supremal functionals and mass-minimising 1-currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study vector-valued functions that minimise the $L^\infty$-norm of their derivatives for prescribed boundary data. We construct a vector-valued, mass minimising $1$-current (i.e., a generalised geodesic) in the domain such that all solutions of the problem coincide on its support. Furthermore, this current can be interpreted as a streamline of the solutions. It also has maximal support among all $1$-currents with certain properties.
  The construction relies on a $p$-harmonic approximation. In the case of scalar-valued functions, it is closely related to a construction of Evans and Yu. We therefore obtain an extension of their theory.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of the critical points of solutions to two kinds of semilinear elliptic equations in higher dimensional domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer to the conjecture A for bounded simple rotationally symmetric domains $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n(n\geq 3)$ along $x_n$ axis. Precisely, we use a new simple argument to study the symmetry of positive solutions for two kinds of semilinear elliptic equations. To do this, when $f(\cdot,s)$ is strictly convex with respect to $s$, we show that the nonnegativity of the first eigenvalue of the corresponding linearized operator in somehow symmetric domains is a sufficient condition for the symmetry of $u$. Moreover, we prove the uniqueness of critical points of a positive solution to semilinear elliptic equation $-\triangle u=f(\cdot,u)$ with zero Dirichlet boundary condition for simple rotationally symmetric domains in $\mathbb{R}^n$ by continuity method and a variety of maximum principles.</description>

      <title>A quasilinear Keller-Segel model with saturated discontinuous advection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the singular limit of a chemotaxis model of bacterial collective motion recently introduced in arXiv:2009.11048 [math.AP]. The equation models aggregation-diffusion phenomena with advection that is discontinuous and depends sharply on the gradient of the density itself. The quasi-linearity of the problem poses major challenges in the construction of the solution and complications arise in the proof of regularity. Our method overcomes these obstacle by relying solely on entropy inequalities and the theory of monotone operators. We provide existence, uniqueness and smoothing estimates in any dimensional space.</description>

      <title>Notes on solitary-wave solutions of Rosenau-type equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper is concerned with the existence of solitary wave solutions of Rosenau-type equations. By using two standard theories, Normal Form Theory and Concentration-Compactness Theory, some results of existence of solitary waves of three different forms are derived. The results depend on some conditions on the speed of the waves with respect to the parameters of the equations. They are discussed for several families of Rosenau equations present in the literature. The analysis is illustrated with a numerical study of generation of approximate solitary-wave profiles from a numerical procedure based on the Petviashvili iteration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a model the dynamics of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and chondrocytes evolving in a nonwoven polyethylene terephtalate (PET) scaffold impregnated with hyaluron and supplied with a differentiation medium. The scaffold and the cells are assumed to be contained in a bioreactor with fluid perfusion. The differentiation of hMSCs into chondrocytes favors the production of extracellular matrix (ECM) and is influenced by fluid stress. The model takes deformations of ECM and PET scaffold into account. The scaffold structure is explicitly included by statistical assessment of the fibre distribution from CT images. The effective macroscopic equations are obtained by appropriate upscaling from dynamics on lower (microscopic and mesoscopic) scales and feature in the motility terms an explicit cell diffusion tensor encoding the assessed anisotropic scaffold structure. Numerical simulations show its influence on the overall cell and tissue dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transport twistor spaces are degenerate complex $2$-dimensional manifolds $Z$ that complexify transport problems on Riemannian surfaces, appearing e.g.~in geometric inverse problems. This article considers maps $\beta\colon Z\to \mathbb{C}^2$ with a holomorphic blow-down structure that resolve the degeneracy of the complex structure and allow to gain insight into the complex geometry of $Z$. The main theorems provide global $\beta$-maps for constant curvature metrics and their perturbations and local $\beta$-maps for arbitrary metrics, thereby proving a version of the classical Newlander--Nirenberg theorem for degenerate complex structures.</description>

      <title>Fully discretized Sobolev gradient flow for the Gross-Pitaevskii eigenvalue problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the ground state of the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) eigenvalue problem, we consider a fully discretized Sobolev gradient flow, which can be regarded as the Riemannian gradient descent on the sphere under a metric induced by a modified $H^1$-norm. We prove its global convergence to a critical point of the discrete GP energy and its local exponential convergence to the ground state of the discrete GP energy. The local exponential convergence rate depends on the eigengap of the discrete GP energy. When the discretization is the classical second-order finite difference in two dimensions, such an eigengap can be further proven to be mesh independent, i.e., it has a uniform positive lower bound, thus the local exponential convergence rate is mesh independent. Numerical experiments with discretization by high order $Q^k$ spectral element methods in two and three dimensions are provided to validate the efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of weakly asymmetric continuous microscopic growth models with polynomial smoothing mechanisms, general nonlinearities and a Poisson type noise. We show that they converge to the KPZ equation after proper rescaling and re-centering, where the coupling constant depends nontrivially on all details of the smoothing and growth mechanisms in the microscopic model. This confirms some of the predictions in [HQ18].
  The proof builds on the general discretisation framework of regularity structures ([EH19]), and employs the idea of using the spectral gap inequality to control stochastic objects as developed and systematised in [LOTT21, HS24], together with a new observation on structures of the Malliavin derivatives in our situation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that equality within the Minkowski inequality for asymptotically flat static spaces is achieved only by slices in Schwarzschild space for mean-convex, non-negative scalar curvature boundaries. In order to establish this, we prove uniqueness of quasi-spherical static metrics: any quasi-spherical metric with vanishing shear vector that admits a bounded static vacuum potential is a rotationally symmetric piece of Schwarzschild space. We also observe that the static Minkowski inequality extends to all dimensions when the boundary is connected and to weakly asymptotically flat static spaces. As a result, the uniqueness theorems for photon surfaces and static metric extensions from our prequel extend to this larger class and to all dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study constant Q-curvature metrics conformal to the round metric on the sphere with finitely many point singularities. We show that the moduli space of solutions with finitely many punctures in fixed positions, equipped with the Gromov-Hausdorff topology, has the local structure of a real analytic variety with formal dimension equal to the number of the punctures. If a nondegeneracy hypothesis holds, we show that a neighborhood in the moduli space is actually a real-analytic manifold of the expected dimension. We also construct a geometrically natural set of parameters, construct a symplectic structure on this parameter space and show that in the smooth case a small neighborhood of the moduli space embeds as a Lagrangian submanifold in the parameter space.</description>

Abstract: This paper concerns the simultaneous effect of homogenization and of the small noise limit for a $2^{\textrm {nd}}$ order mean field games (MFG) system with local coupling and quadratic Hamiltonian. We show under some additional assumptions that the solutions of our system converge to a solution of an effective $1^{\textrm {st}}$ order system whose effective operators are defined through a cell problem which is a $2^{\textrm {nd}}$ order system of ergodic MFG type. We provide several properties of the effective operators and we show that in general the effective system looses the MFG structure.</description>

      <title>Solvability for non-smooth Schr\"{o}dinger equations with singular potentials and square integrable data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2001.11901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a holomorphic functional calculus for first-order operators $DB$ to solve boundary value problems for Schr\"{o}dinger equations $-\mathrm{div}\, A \nabla u + a V u = 0$ in the upper half-space $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}_+$ with $n\in\mathbb{N}$. This relies on quadratic estimates for $DB$, which are proved for coefficients $A,a,V$ that are independent of the transversal direction to the boundary, and comprised of a complex-elliptic pair $(A,a)$ that are bounded and measurable, and a singular potential $V$ in either $L^{n/2}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ or the reverse H\"{o}lder class $B^{q}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ with $q\geq\max\{\tfrac{n}{2},2\}$. In the latter case, square function bounds are also shown to be equivalent to non-tangential maximal function bounds. This allows us to prove that the (Dirichlet) Regularity and Neumann boundary value problems with $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$-data are well-posed if and only if certain boundary trace operators defined by the functional calculus are isomorphisms. We prove this property when the principal coefficient matrix $A$ has either a Hermitian or block structure. More generally, the set of all complex coefficients for which the boundary value problems are well-posed is shown to be open.</description>

Abstract: We prove the existence of an open set minimizing the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of an elliptic operator with bounded, measurable coefficients, over all open sets of a given measure. Our proof is based on a free boundary approach: we characterize the eigenfunction on the optimal set as the minimizer of a penalized functional, and derive openness of the optimal set as a consequence of a H\"older estimate for the eigenfunction. We also prove that the optimal eigenfunction grows at most linearly from the free boundary, i.e. it is Lipschitz continuous at free boundary points.</description>

      <title>Quantitative asymptotic stability of the quasi-linearly stratified densities in the IPM equation on the three fundamental domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the asymptotic stability of the quasi-linearly stratified densities in the 2D inviscid incompressible porous medium equation on $\bbR^2$ with respect to the buoyancy frequency $N$. Our target density of stratification is the sum of the large background linear profile with its slope $N$ and the small perturbation that could be both non-linear and non-monotone. Quantification in $N$ will be performed not only on how large the initial density disturbance is allowed to be but also on how much the target densities can deviate from the purely linear density stratification without losing their stability.
  For the purely linear density stratification, our method robustly applies to the three fundamental domains $\bbR^2,$ $\bbT^2,$ and $\bbT\times[-1,1]$, improving both the previous result by Elgindi (On the asymptotic stability of stationary solutions of the inviscid incompressible porous medium equation, Archive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis, 225(2), 573-599, 2017) on $\bbR^2$ and $\bbT^2$, and the study by Castro-C\'ordoba-Lear (Global existence of quasi-stratified solutions for the confined IPM equation. Archive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis, 232(1), 437-471, 2019) on $\bbT\times[-1,1]$. The obtained temporal decay rates to the stratified density on $\bbR^2$ and to the newly found asymptotic density profiles on $\bbT^2$ and $\bbT\times[-1,1]$ are all sharp, fully realizing the level of the linearized system. We require the initial disturbance to be small in $H^m$ for any integer $m\geq 4$, which we even relax to any positive number $m&gt;3$ via a suitable anisotropic commutator estimate.</description>

      <title>Higher order elliptic equations in weighted Banach spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11227v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider higher order linear, uniformly elliptic equations with non-smooth coefficients in Banach-Sobolev spaces generated by weighted general Banach Function Space (BFS). Supposing boundedness of the Hardy-Littlewood Maximal and Calderon-Zygmund singular operators in BFSs we obtain local solvability in the Sobolev-BFS and establish interior Schauder type a priori estimates for the. elliptic operator. These results will be used in order to obtain Fredholmness of the operator under consideration in weighted BFSs with suitable weight. In addition, we analyze some examples of weighted BFS that verify our assumptions and in which the corresponding Schauder type estimates and Fredholmness of the operator hold true.</description>

      <title>Random perturbations for the chemotaxis-fluid model with fractional dissipation: Global pathwise weak solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02131v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a stochastically perturbed Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes (KS-SNS) system arising from the biomathematics in two dimensions, where the diffusion of fluid is expressed by a fractional Laplacian with an exponent in $[1/2,1]$. Our main result demonstrates that, under appropriate assumptions, the Cauchy problem of the KS-SNS system has a unique global probabilistically strong and analytically weak solution, which also confirms that the quadratic logistic source authentically contributes to the global existence of solutions. First, a three-layer approximate system is introduced, this system seems to be new in the studying of chemotaxis-fluid model and it enables one to construct approximate solutions in regular Hilbert spaces $H^s(\mathbb{R}^2)$. Second, to accomplish the convergence progressively, a series of crucial entropy-energy inequalities for the approximations are derived, whose derivation strongly depends on the fine structure of the system and requires a novel strategy to adapt to the appearance of fractional dissipation and the unboundedness of domain. Third, based on these uniform bounds, we establish the existence of global martingale weak solutions by virtue of a stochastic compactness method. Finally, by applying the Littlewood-Paley theory, we show that the pathwise uniqueness holds for these martingale solution. As a by-product, a few interpolation inequalities in Besov spaces are obtained, which seems to be new and may have their own interest.</description>

      <title>Limiting Behavior of Constraint Minimizers for Inhomogeneous Fractional Schr\"{o}dinger Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05834v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the $L^2$-constraint variational problem \begin{equation*}
  We study $L^2$-normalized solutions of the following inhomogeneous fractional Schr\"{o}dinger equation \begin{equation*} (-\Delta)^{s} u(x)+V(x)u(x)-a|x|^{-b}|u|^{2\beta^2}u(x)=\mu u(x)\ \ \mbox{in}\ \ \R^{N}. \end{equation*} Here $s\in(\frac{1}{2},1)$, $N&gt;2s$, $a&gt;0$, $0&lt;b&lt;\min\{\frac{N}{2},1\}$, $\beta=\sqrt{\frac{2s-b}{N}}$ and $V(x)\geq 0$ is an external potential. We get $L^2$-normalized solutions of the above equation by solving the associated constrained minimization problem. We prove that there exists a critical value $a^*&gt;0$ such that minimizers exist for $0&lt;a&lt;a^*$, and minimizers do not exist for any $a&gt;a^*$. In the case of $a=a^*$, one can obtain the classification results of the existence and non-existence for constraint minimizers, which are depended strongly on the value of $V(0)$. For $V(0)=0$, the limiting behavior of nonnegative minimizers is also analyzed when $a$ tend to $a^*$ from below.</description>

      <title>Dyadic partition-based training schemes for TV/TGV denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to their ability to handle discontinuous images while having a well-understood behavior, regularizations with total variation (TV) and total generalized variation (TGV) are some of the best-known methods in image denoising. However, like other variational models including a fidelity term, they crucially depend on the choice of their tuning parameters. A remedy is to choose these automatically through multilevel approaches, for example by optimizing performance on noisy/clean image pairs. In this work, we consider such methods with space-dependent parameters which are piecewise constant on dyadic grids, with the grid itself being part of the minimization. We prove existence of minimizers for fixed discontinuous parameters under mild assumptions on the data, which lead to existence of finite optimal partitions. We further establish that these assumptions are equivalent to the commonly used box constraints on the parameters. On the numerical side, we consider a simple subdivision scheme for optimal partitions built on top of any other bilevel optimization method for scalar parameters, and demonstrate its improved performance on some representative test images when compared with constant optimized parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03498v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a sign-changing free boundary problem, which comes from the boundary regularity of rotating vortex patch. The complete classification of singular points has been obtained through establishing a new Weiss-type monotonicity formular. Upon these results, we prove that only $90^\circ$ corner type of singularity could happen at the boundary of Lipschitz smooth rotating vortex patch, while the other parts are $C^\infty$ smooth.</description>

      <title>Modified Scattering of Solutions to the Relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell System Inside the Light Cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell system in three dimensions and study the limiting asymptotic behavior as $t \to \infty$ of solutions launched by small, compactly supported initial data. In particular, we prove that such solutions scatter to a modification of the free-streaming asymptotic profile. More specifically, we show that the spatial average of the particle distribution function converges to a smooth, compactly-supported limit and establish the precise, self-similar asymptotic behavior of the electric and magnetic fields, as well as, the macroscopic densities and their derivatives in terms of this limiting function. Upon constructing the limiting fields, a modified $L^\infty$ scattering result for the particle distribution function along the associated trajectories of free transport corrected by the limiting Lorentz force is then obtained. When the limiting charge density does not vanish, our estimates are sharp up to a logarithmic correction. However, when this quantity is identically zero in the limit, the limiting current density and fields may also vanish, which gives rise to decay rates that are faster than those attributed to the dispersive mechanisms in the system.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking of extremals for the high order Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg type inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the work of C.-S. Lin [Comm. Partial Differential Equations, 1986], an equivalent second-order Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg type inequality will be established, namely
  \begin{equation*}
  \int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|x|^{-\beta}|\mathrm{div} (|x|^{\alpha}\nabla u)|^2 \mathrm{d}x
  \geq \mathcal{S}\left(\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}
  |x|^{\beta}|u|^{p^*_{\alpha,\beta}} \mathrm{d}x\right)^{\frac{2}{p^*_{\alpha,\beta}}}, \quad \forall u\in C^\infty_0(\mathbb{R}^N),
  \end{equation*}
  for some constant $\mathcal{S}=\mathcal{S}(N,\alpha,\beta)&gt;0$, where
  \begin{align*}
  N\geq 5,\quad \alpha&gt;2-N,\quad \alpha-2&lt;\beta\leq \frac{N}{N-2}\alpha,\quad p^*_{\alpha,\beta}=\frac{2(N+\beta)}{N-4+2\alpha-\beta}.
  \end{align*}
  We obtain a symmetry breaking conclusion: when $\alpha&gt;0$ and $\beta_{\mathrm{FS}}(\alpha)&lt;\beta&lt; \frac{N}{N-2}\alpha$ where $\beta_{\mathrm{FS}}(\alpha):=
  -N+\sqrt{N^2+\alpha^2+2(N-2)\alpha}$, then the extremal function for the best constant $\mathcal{S}$, if it exists, is nonradial. Furthermore, we give a symmetry result of extremal functions when $\beta=\frac{N}{N-2}\alpha$ and $2-N&lt;\alpha&lt;0$, i.e.,
  \begin{equation*}
  \int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|x|^{-\frac{N}{N-2}\alpha}|\mathrm{div} (|x|^{\alpha}\nabla u)|^2 \mathrm{d}x
  \geq \left(1+\frac{\alpha}{N-2}\right)^{4-\frac{4}{N}}\mathcal{S}_0
  \left(\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}
  |x|^{\frac{N}{N-2}\alpha}|u|^{\frac{2N}{N-4}} \mathrm{d}x\right)^{\frac{N-4}{N}}, \quad \forall u\in C^\infty_0(\mathbb{R}^N),
  \end{equation*}
  where $\mathcal{S}_0$ is the sharp constant of second-order Sobolev inequality, and equality holds only for some radial functions of the form $(1+|x|^{2+\frac{2\alpha}{N-2}})
  ^{-\frac{N-4}{2}}$ (up to scalings and multiplications).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09947v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article considers the initial boundary value problem for the heat equation with the time-dependent Sturm-Liouville operator with singular potentials. To obtain a solution by the method of separation of variables, the problem is reduced to the problem of eigenvalues of the Sturm-Liouville operator. Further on, the solution to the initial boundary value problem is constructed in the form of a Fourier series expansion. A heterogeneous case is also considered. Finally, we establish the well-posedness of the equation in the case when the potential and initial data are distributions, also for singular time-dependent coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider an initial/boundary value problem for the Schr\"odinger equation with a right-hand side involving the fractional Sturm-Liouville operator with singular propagation and potential. To construct a solution, first considering the coefficients in a regular sense, the method of separation of variables is used, which leads the solution of the equation to the eigenvalue and eigenfunction problem of the Sturm-Liouville operator. Next, using the Fourier series expansion in eigenfunctions, a solution to the Schr\"odinger equation is constructed. Important estimates related to the Sobolev space are also obtained. In addition, the equation is studied in the case where the initial data, propagation and potential are strongly singular. For this case, the concept of\, ``very weak solutions'' is used. The existence, uniqueness, negligibility and consistency of very weak solution of the Schr\"odinger equation are established.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alexandrov's estimate states that if $\Omega$ is a bounded open convex domain in ${\mathbb R}^n$ and $u:\bar \Omega\to {\mathbb R}$ is a convex solution of the Monge-Ampere equation $\det D^2 u = f$ that vanishes on $\partial \Omega$, then \[ |u(x) - u(y)| \le \omega(|x-y|)(\int_\Omega f)^{1/n} \qquad \mbox{for }\omega(\delta) = C_n\,\mbox{diam}(\Omega)^{\frac{n-1}n} \delta^{1/n}. \] We establish a variety of improvements of this, depending on the geometry of $\partial \Omega$. For example, we show that if the curvature is bounded away from $0$, then the estimate remains valid if $\omega(\delta)$ is replaced by $C_\Omega \delta^{\frac 12 + \frac 1{2n}}$. We determine the sharp constant $C_\Omega$ when $n=2$, and when $n\ge 3$ and $\partial \Omega$ is $C^2$, we determine the sharp asymptotics of the optimal modulus of continuity $\omega_\Omega(\delta)$ as $\delta\to 0$. For arbitrary convex domains, we characterize the scaling of the optimal modulus $\omega_\Omega$. Under very mild nondegeneracy conditions, our results yield the improved Holder estimate, $\omega_\Omega(\delta) \le C \delta^\alpha$ for some $\alpha&gt;1/n$.</description>

Our geometric setting is that of a bounded simply connected domain in the Euclidean space of dimension three or higher. Assuming that the inaccessible portion of the boundary is flat, and we have knowledge of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map on the complement, we prove logarithmic type stability estimates for both the first and the zeroth order perturbation of the biharmonic operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the critical points of Steklov eigenfunctions on a compact, smooth $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$ with boundary $\partial M$. For generic metrics on $M$ we establish an identity which relates the sum of the indexes of a Steklov eigenfunction, the sum of the indexes of its restriction to $\partial M$, and the Euler characteristic of $M$. In dimension $2$ this identity gives a precise count of the interior critical points of a Steklov eigenfunction in terms of the Euler characteristic of $M$ and of the number of sign changes of $u$ on $\partial M$. In the case of the second Steklov eigenfunction on a genus $0$ surface, the identity holds for any metric. As a by-product of the main result, we show that for generic metrics on $M$ Steklov eigenfunctions are Morse functions in $M$.</description>

Abstract: This article studies the $L_p$ Minkowski problem in generalized Gaussian probability space, where this kind of probability space was first proposed in information theory by the remarkable works [47] by Lutwak-Yang-Zhang and [42] by Lutwak-Lv-Yang-Zhang. The main focus of this article is on the existence of this problem. While the variational method is used to consider the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of normalized Minkowski problem when $p\in \mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}$, we mainly focus on the existence of generalized Gaussian Minkowski problem without normalization required in smooth category for $p\geq1$. In addition, there are the Brunn-Minkowski inequalities about the generalized Gaussian volume.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a continuation of our previous research about an oscillatory integral operator $T_{\alpha, \beta}$ on compact manifolds $\mathbb{M}$. We prove the sharp $H^{p}$-$L^{p,\infty}$ boundedness on the maximal operator $T^{*}_{\alpha, \beta}$ for all $0&lt;p&lt;1$. As applications, we first prove the sharp $H^{p}$-$L^{p,\infty}$ boundedness on the maximal operator corresponding to the Riesz means $I_{k,\alpha}(|\mathcal{L}|)$ associated with the Schr\"odinger type group $e^{is\mathcal{L}^{\alpha/2}}$ and obtain the almost everywhere convergence of $I_{k,\alpha}(|\mathcal{L}|)f(x,t)\to f(x)$ for all $f\in H^{p}$. Also, we are able to obtain the convergence speed of a combination operator from the solutions of the Cauchy problem of fractional Schr\"odinger equations. All results are even new on the n-torus $T^{n}$.</description>

      <title>Similarity solutions for a class of Fractional Reaction-Diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.06198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies exact solvability of a class of fractional reaction-diffusion equation with the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivatives on the half-line in terms of the similarity solutions. We derived the conditions for the equation to possess scaling symmetry even with the fractional derivatives. Relations among the scaling exponents are determined, and the appropriate similarity variable introduced. With the similarity variable we reduced the stochastic partial differential equation to a fractional ordinary differential equation. Exactly solvable systems are then identified by matching the resulted ordinary differential equation with the known exactly solvable fractional ones. Several examples involving the three-parameter Mittag-Leffler function (Kilbas-Saigo function) are presented. The models discussed here turn out to correspond to superdiffusive systems.</description>

      <title>Parabolic stochastic quantisation of the fractional $\Phi^4_3$ model in the full subcritical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.18112v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a construction of the fractional $\Phi^4$ Euclidean quantum field theory on $\mathbb{R}^3$ in the full subcritical regime via parabolic stochastic quantisation. Our approach is based on the use of a truncated flow equation for the effective description of the model at sufficiently small scales and on coercive estimates for the non-linear stochastic partial differential equation describing the interacting field.</description>

      <title>Numerical approximation of the solution of Koiter's model for an elliptic membrane shell subjected to an obstacle via the penalty method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07671v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the analysis of a numerical scheme based on the Finite Element Method for approximating the solution of Koiter's model for a linearly elastic elliptic membrane shell subjected to remaining confined in a prescribed half-space. First, we show that the solution of the obstacle problem under consideration is uniquely determined and satisfies a set of variational inequalities which are governed by a fourth order elliptic operator, and which are posed over a non-empty, closed, and convex subset of a suitable space. Second, we show that the solution of the obstacle problem under consideration can be approximated by means of the penalty method. Third, we show that the solution of the corresponding penalised problem is more regular up to the boundary. Fourth, we write down the mixed variational formulation corresponding to the penalised problem under consideration, and we show that the solution of the mixed variational formulation is more regular up to the boundary as well. In view of this result concerning the augmentation of the regularity of the solution of the mixed penalised problem, we are able to approximate the solution of the one such problem by means of a Finite Element scheme. Finally, we present numerical experiments corroborating the validity of the mathematical results we obtained.</description>

      <title>On the Optimality of CVOD-based Column Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While there exists a rich array of matrix column subset selection problem (CSSP) algorithms for use with interpolative and CUR-type decompositions, their use can often become prohibitive as the size of the input matrix increases. In an effort to address these issues, the authors in \cite{emelianenko2024adaptive} developed a general framework that pairs a column-partitioning routine with a column-selection algorithm. Two of the four algorithms presented in that work paired the Centroidal Voronoi Orthogonal Decomposition (\textsf{CVOD}) and an adaptive variant (\textsf{adaptCVOD}) with the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (\textsf{DEIM}) \cite{sorensen2016deim}. In this work, we extend this framework and pair the \textsf{CVOD}-type algorithms with any CSSP algorithm that returns linearly independent columns. Our results include detailed error bounds for the solutions provided by these paired algorithms, as well as expressions that explicitly characterize how the quality of the selected column partition affects the resulting CSSP solution.</description>
