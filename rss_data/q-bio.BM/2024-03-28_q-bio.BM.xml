      <title>Design principles, growth laws, and competition of minimal autocatalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The apparent difficulty of designing simple autocatalysts that grow exponentially in the absence of enzymes, external drives or ingenious internal mechanisms severely constrains scenarios for the emergence of evolution by natural selection in chemical and physical systems. Here, we systematically analyze these difficulties in the context of one of the simplest and most generic autocatalysts: a dimeric molecule that duplicates by templated ligation. We show that despite its simplicity, such an autocatalyst can achieve exponential growth autonomously. This only requires that the rate of the spontaneous dimerization, the interactions between molecules, and the concentrations of substrates and products are in appropriate ranges. We also show, however, that it is possible to design as simple sub-exponential autocatalysts that have an advantage over exponential autocatalysts when competing for a common resource. We reach these conclusions by developing a general theoretical framework based on kinetic barrier diagrams. Besides challenging commonly accepted assumptions in the field of the origin of life, our results provide a blueprint for the experimental realization of elementary autocatalysts exhibiting a form of natural selection, whether on a molecular or colloidal scale.</description>

      <title>When SMILES have Language: Drug Classification using Text Classification Methods on Drug SMILES Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex chemical structures, like drugs, are usually defined by SMILES strings as a sequence of molecules and bonds. These SMILES strings are used in different complex machine learning-based drug-related research and representation works. Escaping from complex representation, in this work, we pose a single question: What if we treat drug SMILES as conventional sentences and engage in text classification for drug classification? Our experiments affirm the possibility with very competitive scores. The study explores the notion of viewing each atom and bond as sentence components, employing basic NLP methods to categorize drug types, proving that complex problems can also be solved with simpler perspectives. The data and code are available here: https://github.com/azminewasi/Drug-Classification-NLP.</description>

      <title>Flipping Out: Role of Arginine in Hydrophobic Polymer Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arginine has been a mainstay in biological formulation development for decades. To date, the way arginine modulates protein stability has been widely studied and debated. Here, we employed a hydrophobic polymer to decouple hydrophobic effects from other interactions relevant to protein folding. While existing hypotheses for the effects of arginine can generally be categorized as either direct or indirect, our results indicate that direct and indirect mechanisms of arginine co-exist and oppose each other. At low concentrations, arginine was observed to stabilize hydrophobic polymer collapse via a sidechain-dominated direct mechanism, while at high concentrations, arginine stabilized polymer collapse via a backbone-dominated indirect mechanism. These findings highlight the modular nature of the widely used additive arginine, with relevance in the design of stable biological formulations.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic approaches for studies of site-specific DNA base and backbone "breathing" using exciton-coupled dimer-labeled DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DNA regulation and repair processes require direct interactions between proteins and DNA at specific sites. Local fluctuations of the sugar-phosphate backbones and bases of DNA (a form of DNA "breathing") play a central role in such processes. Here we review the development and application of novel spectroscopic methods and analyses - both at the ensemble and single-molecule levels - to study structural and dynamic properties of exciton-coupled cyanine and fluorescent nucleobase analogue dimer-labeled DNA constructs at key positions involved in protein-DNA complex assembly and function. The exciton-coupled dimer probes act as "sensors" of the local conformations adopted by the sugar-phosphate backbones and bases immediately surrounding the dimer probes. These methods can be used to study the mechanisms of protein binding and function at these sites.</description>

      <title>CADGL: Context-Aware Deep Graph Learning for Predicting Drug-Drug Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Examining Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs) is a pivotal element in the process of drug development. DDIs occur when one drug's properties are affected by the inclusion of other drugs. Detecting favorable DDIs has the potential to pave the way for creating and advancing innovative medications applicable in practical settings. However, existing DDI prediction models continue to face challenges related to generalization in extreme cases, robust feature extraction, and real-life application possibilities. We aim to address these challenges by leveraging the effectiveness of context-aware deep graph learning by introducing a novel framework named CADGL. Based on a customized variational graph autoencoder (VGAE), we capture critical structural and physio-chemical information using two context preprocessors for feature extraction from two different perspectives: local neighborhood and molecular context, in a heterogeneous graphical structure. Our customized VGAE consists of a graph encoder, a latent information encoder, and an MLP decoder. CADGL surpasses other state-of-the-art DDI prediction models, excelling in predicting clinically valuable novel DDIs, supported by rigorous case studies.</description>
