      <title>The Flat-Space Limit of AdS Coupled to a Bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explain how to take a well-defined flat-space limit of brane models of AdS coupled to a non-gravitating bath. In the dual BCFT this amounts to a triple-scaling limit where both the number of boundary degrees of freedom and the boundary coupling are taken to infinity while the BCFT boundary piecewise approaches a lightcone. We show how this procedure acts on the conformal generators as a Wigner-\.In\"on\"u contraction, reducing the global BCFT symmetry algebra to the global symmetry algebra of flat space.
  We discuss two natural notions of entanglement entropy of the flat-space dual. These are distinguished by whether modes that have left through $\mathcal I^\pm$ are included or not and give rise to a vanishing and non-trivial Page curve, respectively. Taking the flat-space limit of topological black holes we show that the Page time remains finite in two-dimensions. In $d &gt; 2$ the Page time diverges in the flat limit, since AdS topological black holes become flat-space Rindler horizons.</description>

      <title>Viability of perturbative expansion for quantum field theories on neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Network (NN) architectures that break statistical independence of parameters have been proposed as a new approach for simulating local quantum field theories (QFTs). In the infinite neuron number limit, single-layer NNs can exactly reproduce QFT results. This paper examines the viability of this architecture for perturbative calculations of local QFTs for finite neuron number $N$ using scalar $\phi^4$ theory in $d$ Euclidean dimensions as an example. We find that the renormalized $O(1/N)$ corrections to two- and four-point correlators yield perturbative series which are sensitive to the ultraviolet cut-off and therefore have a weak convergence. We propose a modification to the architecture to improve this convergence and discuss constraints on the parameters of the theory and the scaling of N which allow us to extract accurate field theory results.</description>

      <title>A Hidden Permutation Symmetry of Squared Amplitudes in ABJM Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the square amplitudes in planar Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena theory (ABJM), analogous to that in $\mathcal{N}{=}4$ super-Yang-Mills theory (SYM). Surprisingly, the $n$-point $L$-loop integrands with fixed $N{:=}n{+}L$ are unified in a single generating function. Similar to the SYM four-point half-BPS correlator integrand, the generating function enjoys a hidden $S_N$ permutation symmetry in the dual space, allowing us to write it as a linear combination of weight-3 planar $f$-graphs. Remarkably, through Gram identities it can also be represented as a linear combination of bipartite $f$-graphs which manifest the important property that no odd-multiplicity amplitude exists in the theory. The generating function and these properties are explicitly checked against squared amplitudes for all $n$ with $N{=}4,6,8$. By drawing analogies with SYM, we conjecture some graphical rules the generating function satisfy, and exploit them to bootstrap a unique $N{=}10$ result, which provides new results for $n{=}10$ squared tree amplitudes, as well as integrands for $(n,L){=}(4,6),(6,4)$. Our results strongly suggest the existence of a "bipartite correlator" in ABJM theory that unifies all squared amplitudes and satisfies physical constraints underlying these graphical rules.</description>

      <title>From Tensor Algebras to Hyperbolic Kac-Moody Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to study hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebras, and more specifically, the Feingold-Frenkel algebra $\mathfrak{F}$, which is based on considering the tensor algebra of level-one states before descending to the Lie algebra by converting tensor products into multiple commutators. This method enables us to exploit the presence of mutually commuting coset Virasoro algebras, whose number grows without bound with increasing affine level. We present the complete decomposition of the tensor algebra under the affine and coset Virasoro symmetries for all levels $\ell\leq 5$, as well as the maximal tensor ground states from which all elements of $\mathfrak{F}$ up to level five can be (redundantly) generated by the joint action of the affine and coset Virasoro generators, and subsequent conversion to multi-commutators, which are then expressed in terms of transversal and longitudinal DDF states. We outline novel directions for future work.</description>

      <title>A New Action for Superstring Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sen's superstring field theory successfully formulates perturbative superstring theory but has a number of unusual features. The action is not background independent and the resulting effective field theory does not appear to have standard diffeomorphsim symmetry - instead there is an exotic gauge symmetry that acts on some fields but not others. A new action is found that reduces to Sen's action in a certain limit and gives the same results as Sen's theory for physical superstring amplitudes. However, the new theory is background independent: there is a shift symmetry so that a change in the background can be compensated for by a corresponding shift in the string fields. Sen's theory has two string fields leading to the physical interacting superstring plus a free superstring that decouples from the physical superstring. The new terms in the action give self-interactions to the second superstring which remains decoupled from the physical superstring. The two superstrings each have a graviton and the effective action for the two gravitons coupled to a background metric is studied and shown to be background independent and diffeomorphism invariant, and the origin of further diffeomorphism-like symmetries is explained.</description>

      <title>On integrable structure of the null string in (anti-)de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Presently integrability turned the key property in the study of duality between superconformal gauge theories and strings in anti-de Sitter superspaces. Complexity of the study of integrable structure in string theory is caused by complicated dependence of background fields of the Type II supergravity multiplets, with which strings interact, on the superspace coordinates. This explains an interest to study of limiting cases, in which superstring equations simplify. In the present work considered is the limiting case of zero tension corresponding to null string. It is obtained the representation in the form of the Lax equation of null-string equations in (anti-)de Sitter space realized as coset manifold. Proposed is twistor interpretation of the Lagrangian of (null) string in anti-de Sitter space expressed in terms of group variables.</description>

      <title>D-ideal of generic mass banana integrals in dimensional regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a set of $\ell + 3$ simple differential operators and prove that they annihilate an $\ell$-loop generic mass banana integral in dimensional regularization. We study the singular locus of the ideal generated by these operators and show that it is contained in the set of Landau singularities of the first and second type. Through the Macaulay matrix method, we calculate the corresponding holonomic rank up to $\ell = 8$, obtaining $2^{\ell +1}-1$, which agrees with the number of master integrals for the generic mass banana integrals. Based on these findings, we conjecture that the proposed operators generate the annihilating ideal for the generic mass banana integrals in dimensional regularization.</description>

      <title>Almost local integrable models from supersymmetry algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersymmetry algebras can be used to obtain algebraic expressions for constant Yang-Baxter solutions, also known as braid group generators. This was done for non-invertible braid operators in \cite{maity2025non}. In this work we extend this construction for the invertible ones. The resulting expressions are then shown to obey relations analogous to those satisfied by quotients of braid groups. Examples of the latter include the Iwahori-Hecke algebra and the Birman-Murakami-Wenzl (BMW) algebra. As a result, we can Baxterize the constant Yang-Baxter solutions to yield spectral parameter dependent $R$-matrices. The regularity of these $R$-matrices depend on the representation of SUSY generators. In some cases they are regular in the usual sense and in the remaining they are `almost' regular. In the latter case they are also non-invertible. Nevertheless we show that they can still help us construct integrable models in all dimensions of the local Hilbert space. These models can be described by Hamiltonian densities that are either local or non-local, depending on the representation chosen for the SUSY generators. We demonstrate this for all constant $4\times 4$ invertible Yang-Baxter solutions. Apart from finding new nearest-neighbor interaction spin $\frac{1}{2}$ systems, we also find their higher spin analogs due to the algebraic [representation independent] approach.</description>

      <title>Singularity-Free Feynman Integral Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard integration-by-parts (IBP) reduction methods typically yield Feynman integral bases where the reduction of some integrals gives rise to coefficients singular as the dimensional regulator $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$. These singular coefficients can also appear in scattering amplitudes, obscuring their structure, and rendering their evaluation more complicated. We investigate the use of bases in which the reduction of any integral is free of singular coefficients. We present two general algorithms for constructing such bases. The first is based on sequential $D=4$ IBP reduction. It constructs a basis iteratively by projecting onto the finite part of the set of IBP relations. The second algorithm performs Gaussian elimination within a local ring forbidding division by $\epsilon$ while permitting division by polynomials in $\epsilon$ finite at $\epsilon=0$. We study the application of both algorithms to a pair of two-loop examples, the planar and nonplanar double-box families of integrals. We also explore the incorporation of finite Feynman integrals into these bases. In one example, the resulting basis provides a simpler and more compact representation of a scattering amplitude.</description>

      <title>Covariant quantization of field theories on T-Minkowski noncommutative spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a quantization scheme for the quantum theory of a real scalar field on a class of non-commutative spacetime models collectively known as T-Minkowski. Requiring the theory to be covariant under T-Poincar\'e transformations, we find that for a subclass of models the Wightmann functions are equal to their commutative counterparts, and we are able to prove a Wick theorem for Wightmann functions that is structurally equivalent to the one encountered in commutative QFT. For some of these models we further extend the result to Green functions and to N-point functions of interacting QFT, which we also find to be commutative, leaving no space for IR/UV mixing effects advocated in other approaches to noncommutative QFT.</description>

      <title>Perturbations of Black Holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion (EMDA) Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend our earlier work on the linearised perturbations of static black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theories to the case where the black holes are solutions in an enlarged theory including also an axion. We study the perturbations in a 3-parameter family of such EMDA theories. %The analysis is more involved now, because of the %couplings of the gravitational and electromagnetic modes %to both the dilaton and axion fields. The systems of equations describing the linearised perturbations can always be separated, but they can only be decoupled when the three parameters are restricted to a 1-parameter family of EMDA theories, characterised by a parameter $b$ that determines the coupling of the axion to the $\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\, F_{\mu\nu}\, F_{\rho\sigma}$ term. In the specific case when $b=1$, the theory is related to an ${\cal N}=2$ supergravity. In this one case we find that the perturbations in the axial and the polar sectors are related by a remarkable transformation, which generalises one found by Chandrasekhar for the perturbations of Reissner-Nordstr\"om in Einstein-Maxwell theory. This transformation is of a form found in supersymmetric quantum mechanical models. The existence of such mappings between the axial and polar perturbations appears to correlate with those cases where there is an underlying supergravity supporting the solution, even though the black hole backgrounds are non-extremal and therefore not supersymmetric. We prove the mode stability of the static black hole solutions in the supersymmetric EMDA theory. For other values of the parameter $b$ in the EMDA theories that allow decoupling of the modes, we find that one of the radial potentials can be negative outside the horizon if $b$ is sufficiently large, raising the possibility of there being perturbative mode instabilities in such a case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present specialized Large Language Models for theoretical High-Energy Physics, obtained as 20 fine-tuned variants of the 8-billion parameter Llama-3.1 model. Each variant was trained on arXiv abstracts (through August 2024) from different combinations of hep-th, hep-ph and gr-qc. For a comparative study, we also trained models on datasets that contained abstracts from disparate fields such as the q-bio and cs categories. All models were fine-tuned using two distinct Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning approaches and varying dataset sizes, and outperformed the base model on hep-th abstract completion tasks. We compare performance against leading commercial LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek) and derive insights for further developing specialized language models for High-Energy Theoretical Physics.</description>

      <title>Dynamical dark energy parameterizations in VCDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of a theory of minimally modified gravity called VCDM, one can realize any cosmological behavior at the level of the homogeneous and isotropic background without introducing fatal instabilities for perturbations. Therefore, VCDM provides a theoretically-consistent and observationally-testable framework of dynamical dark energy parameterizations with or without phantom behaviors. In this paper, we propose the VCDM realizations of various phenomenological parameterizations present in the literature: the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL), Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), Exponential (EXP), and Logarithmic (LOG) models. Using the VCDM equations for cosmological perturbations, we test them against the recent cosmological datasets, Planck 2018 and DESI BAO DR2, and then discuss their implications.</description>

      <title>Hot New Early Dark Energy: Dark Radiation Matter Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a microscopic model of the dark sector that resolves the Hubble tension within standard current datasets based on well-known fundamental principles, gauge symmetry and spontaneous symmetry breaking. It builds on the Hot New Early Dark Energy (Hot NEDE) setup, featuring a dark $SU(N)$ gauge symmetry broken to $SU(N-1)$ in a supercooled phase transition that creates a thermal bath of self-interacting dark radiation in the epoch between Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and recombination. Adding a fermion multiplet charged under the gauge symmetry provides a naturally stable component of dark matter that interacts with dark radiation. Spontaneous symmetry breaking predicts a decoupling of this interaction once the dark sector cools down, that we refer to as dark radiation matter decoupling (DRMD). We find agreement between the SH${}_0$ES determination of $H_0$ as well as combined Planck 2018, Pantheon+ and DESI baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data at 1.4$\sigma$ level, compared to a 5.7$\sigma$ tension in the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter model. We also provide a simplified three-parameter DRMD model encoding the essential features, while the full model offers additional falsifiable predictions.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole induced gravitational waves in $f(R)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-light primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses $M_\mathrm{PBH}&lt;5\times 10^{8}\mathrm{g}$ can trigger an early matter-dominated (eMD) era before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and reheat the Universe through their evaporation. Notably, the initial isocurvature in nature PBH energy density fluctuations can induce abundantly gravitational waves (GWs) due to second-order gravitational effects. In this work, we study this induced GW signal within the context of $f(R)$ gravity theories investigating the effect of $f(R)$ gravity on the behaviour of scalar perturbations during the PBH-driven eMD era as well as on the source of the second-order induced tensor modes. In particular, we focus on two very minimal $f(R)$ models, that is $R^2$ and $R^{1+\epsilon}$, with $\epsilon\ll 1$, gravity theories as illustrative examples, finding at the end that $R^2$ gravity presents very small deviations from general relativity (GR) at the level of both the scalar and tensor perturbations. However, $R^{1+\epsilon}$ gravity features a different behaviour, exhibiting in particular an exponential growth of scalar perturbations during a matter-dominated era. This unique feature leads ultimately to an enhanced induced GW signal even for very small initial PBH abundances, being characterized by a linear frequency scaling on large infrared scales away from the peak frequency, i.e. $\Omega_\mathrm{GW}(k)\propto f$ for $f\ll f_\mathrm{peak}$, and a spiky behaviour close to the non-linear cut-off scale below which perturbation theory breaks down. Interestingly, one finds as well that the induced GW signal can be well within the sensitivity curves of GW detectors, namely that of LISA, ET, BBO and SKA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study massive charged scalar field perturbations in four- and five- dimensional charged anti-de Sitter soliton spacetimes. Appropriate boundary conditions are established via a local analysis of the perturbation equations. The normal mode spectra are then calculated numerically using the Horowitz-Hubeny method and a collocation method. We reveal scaling laws and asymptotic behaviors governing the normal mode spectra. The reality of the normal mode frequencies indicates the dynamic stability of the soliton, which in turn provides support for the positive energy conjecture in asymptotically locally anti-de Sitter spacetime.</description>

      <title>Graph theory-based automated quantum algorithm for efficient querying of acyclic and multiloop causal configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms provide a promising framework in high-energy physics, in particular, for unraveling the causal configurations of multiloop Feynman diagrams by identifying Feynman propagators with qubits, a challenge analogous to querying directed acyclic graphs in graph theory. In this paper, we present the Minimum Clique-optimised quantum Algorithm (MCA), an automated quantum algorithm designed to efficiently query the causal structures within the Loop-Tree Duality. The MCA quantum algorithm is optimised by exploiting graph theory techniques, specifically, by analogy with the Minimum Clique Partition problem. The evaluation of the MCA quantum algorithm is exhibited by analysing the transpiled quantum circuit depth and quantum circuit area.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and particle production from cosmological perturbations: a quantum optical simulation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a computational framework based on the Gaussian formalism and symplectic circuit representation to explore cosmological perturbations during inflation. These tools offer an efficient means to study entanglement generation and particle production, particularly when analytical methods become insufficient and numerical simulations are essential. By evolving an initial Bunch-Davies vacuum through a two-mode squeezer, we simulate the behavior of the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity across a wide range of cosmological backgrounds, each characterized by a distinct equation of state. The von Neumann entropy obtained via QuGIT simulations is compared with analytic R\'enyi entropy bounds, thereby validating the accuracy of our circuit implementation of the cosmological squeezing Hamiltonian in both accelerating and decelerating scenarios. We further investigate the role of thermal noise and demonstrate how the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity are affected by its presence.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of the charged Higgs boson in the two Higgs doublet type-II seesaw model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenology of the charged Higgs boson within the Two-Higgs-Doublet Type-II Seesaw Model (2HDMcT Type-III) at future $\mu^+ \mu^-$ colliders. Focusing on $2 \to 2$ processes such as $\mu^+ \mu^- \to H^+_1 S^-$ ($S^- = H^-_1, H^-_2$) and $\mu^+ \mu^- \to H^+_1 W^-$, we incorporate both theoretical and experimental constraints to assess their production prospects. We find that $\sigma(\mu^+ \mu^- \to H_1^+ H_1^-)$ can reach or exceed the corresponding $e^+ e^-$ cross section, while $\sigma(\mu^+ \mu^- \to H_1^+ H_2^-)$ is roughly eighteen times smaller but can be enhanced up to 0.62 fb upon relaxing electroweak precision observables constraints. Moreover, we observe that the cross section for $\mu^+ \mu^- \to H^+_1 W^-$ is significantly enhanced due to the large $\tan\beta$ amplification characteristic of the Type-III scenario. Furthermore, we conduct a signal-background analysis and determine the discovery ($5\sigma$) regions at a 3 TeV muon collider for the $\mu^+ \mu^- \to H_1^+ H_1^-$, $\mu^+ \mu^- \to H_1^+ H_2^-$, and $\mu^+ \mu^- \to W^\pm H_1^\mp$ processes.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we employ the Tannaka-Krein reconstruction to compute the quantum double $\mathcal D(\mathcal G)$ of a finite 2-group $\mathcal G$ as a Hopf monoidal category. We also construct a 3+1D lattice model from the Dijkgraaf-Witten TQFT functor for the 2-group $\mathcal G$, generalizing Kitaev's 2+1D quantum double model. Notably, the string-like local operators in this lattice model are shown to form $\mathcal D(\mathcal G)$. Specializing to $\mathcal G = \mathbb{Z}_2$, we demonstrate that the topological defects in the 3+1D toric code model are modules over $\mathcal D(\mathbb{Z}_2)$.</description>

      <title>Bell states for fermions in loop quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fermion fields are fundamental for the description of nature and also fit very naturally into the framework of loop quantum gravity. Motivated partially by proposals to use gravitationally mediated entanglement of matter as a witness for the quantum nature of gravity, we investigate how such entanglement can be defined and investigated in loop quantum gravity. In particular, we ask how a pair of fermions in a Bell state could be described in loop quantum, gravity.
  We demonstrate that the notion of fermionic entanglement in loop quantum gravity is subtle, by showing that some potential ways to define it fail. We then investigate a kinematical observable involving both, fermionic and gravitational degrees of freedom, the component of the fermion spin normal to a surface. We study its properties, and compare it to the standard operator for components of spin in a given direction in quantum mechanics. Using these normal components of spin, we define a kinematical observable that measures the correlation between space-like separated fermions which closely mirrors the CHSH observable. Finally, we exhibit states of the fermions coupled to quantum geometry that violate the Bell-CHSH inequality.</description>

      <title>Scale and Conformal Invariance in Heterotic $\sigma$-Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that all perturbative scale invariant heterotic sigma models with a compact target space $M^D$ are conformally invariant. The proof, presented in detail for up to and including two loops, utilises a geometric analogue of the $c$-theorem based on a generalisation of the Perelman's results on geometric flows. Then, we present examples of scale invariant heterotic sigma models with target spaces that exhibit special geometry, which is characterised by the holonomy of the connection with torsion a 3-form, and explore the additional conditions that are necessary for such sigma models to be conformally invariant. For this, we find that the geometry of the target spaces is further restricted to be either conformally balanced or the a priori holonomy of the connection with torsion reduces. We identify the pattern of holonomy reduction in the cases that the holonomy is $SU(n)$ $(D=2n)$, $Sp(k)$ $D=4k)$, $G_2$ $(D=7)$ and $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$ $(D=8)$. We also investigate the properties of these geometries and present some examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The free graviton theory given by linearising Einstein's theory has a dual formulation in terms of a dual graviton field. The dual graviton theory has two gauge invariances giving rise to two conserved charges, while the ADM charges of the graviton theory become magnetic charges for the dual graviton theory. These charges can be ill-defined in topologically non-trivial settings and we find improvement terms that can be added to these to give gauge-invariant conserved charges. These gauge-invariant charges, which have local expressions in both the graviton and dual graviton formulation, give topological operators of the theory that should be considered as the generators of the genuine symmetries of the theory.</description>

      <title>A Non-Relativistic Limit for Heterotic Supergravity and its Gauge Lagrangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08711v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the $D=10$ heterotic supergravity in a non-relativistic (NR) limit has a finite Lagrangian due to non-trivial cancellations of divergent parts arising from the Chern-Simons terms in the curvature of the $\hat B$-field and the Yang-Mills Lagrangian. This is similar to what happens in bosonic supergravity between the Ricci scalar, $\hat R$, and the $- \frac{1}{12} \hat H^2$ term, under the same limit. In this work we present the explicit form of the gauge transformations and curvatures after considering a NR limit and we compute the full finite Lagrangian in its covariant form. Particularly, we address both the ungauged part and the gauged part, and we write it using covariant derivatives and curvatures for the gauge fields. These results constitute the first computation of a finite Lagrangian for heterotic supergravity under these kinds of limits. As an interesting feature of the expansion implemented, the Green-Schwarz mechanism for the two-form can be trivialized and terms equivalent to Chern-Simons contributions naturally arise from the previous property.</description>

Abstract: We construct non-relativistic quantum strings from gauged Wess--Zumino--Witten (WZW) models. We depart from the fact that Lie groups with a bi-invariant galilean structure can be seen as the quotient by a null central subgroup of a generalised Nappi--Witten group. We implement the quotient by a chiral null gauging. We use a particular free field realisation of the Nappi--Witten current algebra to compute the Virasoro BRST cohomology of the gauged WZW model, resulting in a closed string theory reminiscent of the bosonic Gomis--Ooguri string, but whose spectrum differs slightly between the holomorphic and antiholomorphic sectors.</description>

      <title>Surface Gauge Invariance, Soft Limits and the Transmutation of Gluons into Scalars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past year, the "scalar-scaffolding" formalism has revealed a number of new features of gluon amplitudes. In this paper, we leverage these developments to study two distinct but related questions, linked by the scaffolding statement of gauge invariance. We start by revisiting the soft expansion of gluon amplitudes. The scaffolding picture allows for a precise definition of the soft limit and a canonical way to expand the amplitude. At tree-level, this reproduces the classic Weinberg soft theorem, and at one-loop, using surface kinematics, we derive an extension of this theorem valid at the level of the loop integrand. We then switch gears and describe a new relationship between gluon and scalar amplitudes. The expression of surface gauge invariance naturally suggests a certain differential operator acting on individual external gluons. Remarkably, we find that, both for the tree-level amplitude and the surface one-loop integrand, repeated applications of this operator transmutes gluon amplitudes/integrands into those of Tr$(\phi^3)$ scalars. This is an interesting counterpart to the $\delta$-shift connection that lifts "stringy" Tr$(\phi^3)$ amplitudes to those of gluons.</description>

Abstract: We study the twisted partition function of quarter BPS states in CHL models and show that for a large class of single-centered black holes, the degeneracy of microstates is given by the Fourier coefficients of mock Jacobi forms. Our analysis is a continuation of the programme initiated by Dabholkar, Murthy and Zagier (DMZ) for $1/4$-BPS dyons in $\mathcal{N} = 4$ string theory and further extended by Bhand, Sen and Singh (BSS) to quarter BPS states in CHL models. We also present the multiplicative lift construction of the partition function and comment on the additive lift of the same.</description>

Abstract: Quasi-characters are solutions of simple modular differential equations that form an explicit basis for the space of all admissible characters that can potentially describe rational CFT. They were classified for rank-$2$ in arXiv:1810.09472 [hep-th], where it was conjectured that their $q$-series has coefficients of alternating sign that stabilise to a fixed sign at order $\frac{c}{12}$ and sometimes undergo more exotic behaviour -- where $c$ is the central charge. Here we prove some of these conjectures and estimate the growth of coefficients near the stabilisation point. We also explain what role the signs play in the construction of admissible characters from quasi-characters.</description>

Abstract: In this brief note we present the off-shell superspace formalism for Ali-Ilahi's $(0, 4)$ supersymmetric ADHM instanton linear sigma model in harmonic superspace. Ali-Ilahi's model is dual to the $(0, 4)$ supersymmetric ADHM instanton linear sigma model constructed by Witten in 1995.</description>

      <title>Symmetry, Symmetry Topological Field Theory and von Neumann Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the additivity and Haag duality of the von Neumann algebra of a quantum field theory $\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{F}$ with 0-form (and the dual $(d-2)$-form) (non)-invertible global symmetry $\mathcal{F}$. We analyze the symmetric (uncharged) sector von Neumann algebra of $\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{F}$ with the inclusion of bi-local and bi-twist operators in it. We establish the connection between the existence of these non-local operators in $\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{F}$ and certain properties of the Lagrangian algebra $\mathcal{L}$ of the extended operators in the corresponding symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). We prove that additivity or Haag duality of the symmetric sector von Neumann algebra is violated when $\mathcal{L}$ satisfies specific criteria, thus generalizing the result of Shao, Sorce and Srivastava to arbitrary dimensions. We further demonstrate the SymTFT construction via concrete examples in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>The holographic $\textrm{T}\overline{\textrm{T}}$ deformation of the CFT$_2$ with gravitational anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the holographic framework for the $\textrm{T}\overline{\textrm{T}}$ deformation of two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFT$_2$) with gravitational anomalies, characterized by unequal left and right central charges and holographically dual to topological massive gravity (TMG). Utilizing the mixed boundary condition prescription, we construct the deformed BTZ black hole geometry and derive the corresponding deformed energy spectrum, confirming that the universal flow equation remains valid despite the presence of gravitational anomalies. From the boundary perspective, we compute leading-order corrections to entanglement entropy and reflected entropy induced by the $\textrm{T}\overline{\textrm{T}}$ deformation, as well as the balanced partial entanglement entropy non-perturbatively. On the gravity side, these quantities are evaluated using spinning worldlines in the deformed bulk geometry, with results matching their field-theoretic counterparts in the high-temperature limit. We further analyze the reality condition for holographic entanglement entropy, which constrains the deformation parameter and reveals a generalized Hagedorn behavior. This Hagedorn-like transition is also independently reproduced from the asymptotic density of states in the deformed anomalous CFT$_2$, providing additional evidence for its universality.</description>

      <title>Solution of all quartic matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04600</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.04600v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the quartic analogue of the Kontsevich model, which is defined by a measure $\exp(-{N}\,\mathrm{Tr}(E\Phi^2+(\lambda/4)\Phi^4)) d\Phi$ on Hermitian ${N}\times{N}$-matrices, where $E$ is any positive matrix and $\lambda$ a scalar. It was previously established that the large-$N$ limit of the second moment (the planar two-point function) satisfies a non-linear integral equation. By employing tools from complex analysis, in particular the Lagrange-B\"urmann inversion formula, we identify the exact solution of this non-linear problem, both for finite $N$ and for a large-${N}$ limit to unbounded operators $E$ of spectral dimension $\leq 4$. For finite $N$, the two-point function is a rational function evaluated at the preimages of another rational function $R$ constructed from the spectrum of $E$. Subsequent work has constructed from this formula a family $\omega_{g,n}$ of meromorphic differentials which obey blobbed topological recursion. For unbounded operators $E$, the renormalised two-point function is given by an integral formula involving a regularisation of $R$. This allowed a proof, in subsequent work, that the $\lambda\Phi^4_4$-model on noncommutative Moyal space does not have a triviality problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the $L^2$ metric on the moduli space of hyperbolic monopoles, defined using the Coulomb gauge-fixing condition, diverges. This article shows that an alternative gauge-fixing condition inspired by supersymmetry cures this divergence. The resulting geometry is a hyperbolic analogue of the hyperk\"ahler geometry of Euclidean monopole moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>A simple gravitational self-decoherence model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14155v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most significant debates of our time is whether our macroscopic world (i) naturally emerges from quantum mechanics or (ii) requires new physics. We argue for the latter and propose a simple gravitational self-decoherence mechanism. For this purpose, we postulate the existence of a Heisenberg cut such that particles with masses $m$ much smaller and larger than a critical mass $M_{\rm C}$ (of the order of the Planck mass $M_{\rm P}$) would be necessarily treated according to quantum and classical rules, respectively. Our effective model is designed to capture the new physics that free quantum particles would experience as their masses approach $M_{\rm C}$. The purity loss for free quantum particles is evaluated and shown to be highly inefficient for quantum particles with $m \ll M_{\rm C}$ but very effective for those with $m \sim M_{\rm C}$. The physical picture behind it is that coherence would (easily) leak from heavy enough particles to (non-observable) spacetime quantum degrees of freedom. Finally, we contextualize our proposal with state-of-the-art experiments and show how it can be tested in a future Stern-Gerlach-like experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09685v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the relationship between reduced and thermal density matrices in conformal field theory (CFT), we show that the entanglement spectrum of a conformal critical chain with exponentially decaying terms consists of conformal towers of the associated chiral CFT, with only weak finite-size effects. Through free-fermion and interacting examples, we show that these entanglement spectra present a reliable method to extract detailed CFT spectra from single wave functions without access to the parent Hamiltonian. We complement our method with a Wilsonian numerical renormalisation group algorithm for solving interacting, exponentially decaying chain Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Continuous majorization in quantum phase space for Wigner-positive states and proposals for Wigner-negative states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum resource theory, one is often interested in identifying which states serve as the best resources for particular quantum tasks. If a relative comparison between quantum states can be made, this gives rise to a partial order, where states are ordered according to their suitability to act as a resource. In the literature, various different partial orders for a variety of quantum resources have been proposed. In discrete variable systems, vector majorization of Wigner functions in discrete phase space provides a natural partial order between quantum states. In the continuous variable case, a natural counterpart would be continuous majorization of Wigner functions in quantum phase space. Indeed, this concept was recently proposed and explored (mostly restricting to the single-mode case) in Van Herstraeten, Jabbour, Cerf, Quantum 7, 1021 (2023). In this work, we develop the theory of continuous majorization in the general $N$-mode case. In addition, we propose extensions to include states with finite Wigner negativity. For the special case of the convex hull of $N$-mode Gaussian states, we prove a conjecture made by Van Herstraeten, Jabbour and Cerf. We also prove a phase space counterpart of Uhlmann's theorem of majorization.</description>

      <title>Photon Rings in Three-Dimensional Bonnor-Melvin Magnetic Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous analysis of the relativistic dynamics of vector bosons propagating in a $(2+1)$-dimensional Bonnor-Melvin magnetic spacetime, characterized by an out-of-plane aligned magnetic field and a nonzero cosmological constant $\Lambda$. To achieve this, we derive the exact solution of the fully covariant vector boson equation corresponding to the spin-1 sector of the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau equation in $2+1$ dimensions. The magnetic background arises naturally as the $2+1+0$-brane configuration within the Bonnor-Melvin solution to gravity coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics. By deriving the radial wave equation that is mathematically equivalent to the Helmholtz equation governing massless vector bosons, we obtain exact eigenvalue spectra applicable to both massive and massless vector bosons (photons). Remarkably, our results reveal that photons exhibit a finite, nonzero ground-state energy, with their quantum states manifesting solely as rotating ring-like modes.</description>

      <title>Simulating lattice fermion doubling with a Floquet drive</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a recently discovered mathematical correspondence between the spectra of a naively discretized lattice fermion and that of a periodically driven (i.e., Floquet) quantum system and turn it into an infrared equivalence between the two systems. The equivalence can be framed as a duality relation, allowing us to simulate a two-flavor discrete-time fermion theory on the lattice side, where the two flavors arise from time discretization, using a single-flavor fermion theory on the Floquet side. Our demonstration establishes an equivalence between (i) the fermion content, (ii) the correlation functions, and consequently (iii) observables of the two theories in the infrared. We also show how interactions may be incorporated into this equivalence.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Phase Transition and Bubble Wall Velocity in Local Thermal Equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of the electroweak phase transition in the early universe has profound implications for cosmology and particle physics. We systematically study the steady-state dynamics of bubble walls in scenarios where the transition is first order within three representative beyond the Standard Model frameworks, characterised by the presence of an additional scalar in different electroweak representations. Focusing on the local thermal equilibrium regime, we numerically solve the coupled scalar and hydrodynamic equations to extract key properties of the phase transition front: the wall velocity, width, plasma and field profiles. Remarkably, we find a near-universal behaviour across models when expressed in terms of thermodynamic quantities, that can be captured by simple fitting functions, useful for phenomenological applications. These results also provide an upper bound on the bubble velocity and represent the first necessary step for the full inclusion of out-of-equilibrium effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a nonlinear electrodynamics model within the framework of $f(R,T)$ gravity. We begin by outlining the general features of the theory and analyzing the event horizon under conditions ensuring its real and positive definiteness. We then examine light trajectories, focusing on critical orbits, shadow radii, and geodesics of massless particles. The parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, associated with the nonlinear extension of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime, are constrained using observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Subsequently, we analyze the thermodynamic properties of the system, including Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity. Quasinormal modes are computed for scalar, vector, tensor, and spinorial perturbations, with the corresponding time-domain profiles explored as well. Gravitational lensing is then studied in both weak and strong deflection limits, along with the stability of photon spheres. Finally, we examine additional topological aspects, including topological thermodynamics and the topological photon sphere.</description>

      <title>RGE effects on new physics searches via gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13074v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations offer a promising probe of new physics associated with a first-order electroweak phase transition. Precision studies of the Higgs potential, including Fisher matrix analyses, have been extensively conducted in this context. However, significant theoretical uncertainties in the GW spectrum, particularly those due to renormalization scale dependence in the conventional daisy-resummed approach, have cast doubt on the reliability of such precision measurements. These uncertainties have been highlighted using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) as a benchmark. To address these issues, we revisit Fisher matrix analyses based on the daisy-resummed approach, explicitly incorporating renormalization scale uncertainties. We then reassess the prospects for precise new physics measurements using GW observations. Adopting the SMEFT as a benchmark, we study the effects of one-loop RGE running of dimension-six operators on the Higgs effective potential via the Higgs self-couplings, top Yukawa coupling, and gauge couplings, in addition to the SMEFT tree-level effects. We find that future GW observations can remain sensitive to various dimension-six SMEFT effects, even in the presence of renormalization scale uncertainties, provided that the SMEFT $(H^{\dagger}H)^3$ operator is precisely measured, e.g., by future collider experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the ground-state entanglement entropy in inhomogeneous free-boson models in one spatial dimension. We develop a powerful method to extract the leading term in the entanglement scaling, based on the analytic properties of the inhomogeneous potential. This method is applicable to a broad class of models with smooth spatial inhomogeneities. As a case study, we apply this approach for a family of exactly-solvable models characterized by orthogonal polynomials of the Askey scheme, finding a perfect match between the numerical and analytical results.</description>
