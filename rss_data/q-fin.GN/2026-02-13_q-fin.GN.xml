      <title>Exact Value Solution to the Equity Premium Puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to provide the solution to the equity premium puzzle without using calibrated values. Calibrated values of subjective time discount factor were used in the prior derived models because 4 variables were determined from 3 different equations. Furthermore, calculated values and risk behavior determination of prior models were compatible with empirical literature. 4 unknown variables are now calculated from 4 different equations in the new derived model in this article. Subjective time discount factor and coefficient of relative risk aversion are found 0.9581 and 1.0319, respectively from the system of equations which are compatible with empirical studies. Micro and macro studies about CRRA value affirm each other for the first time in the literature. Furthermore, equity and risk-free asset investors are pinned down to be insufficient risk-loving, which can be considered a type of risk-averse behavior. Hence it can be said that calculated values and risk attitude determination align with empirical literature. This shows that derived model is valid and make CCAPM work under the same assumptions with those of prior derived models.</description>
