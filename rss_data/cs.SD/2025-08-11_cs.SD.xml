      <title>Training chord recognition models on artificially generated audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the challenging problems in Music Information Retrieval is the acquisition of enough non-copyrighted audio recordings for model training and evaluation. This study compares two Transformer-based neural network models for chord sequence recognition in audio recordings and examines the effectiveness of using an artificially generated dataset for this purpose. The models are trained on various combinations of Artificial Audio Multitracks (AAM), Schubert's Winterreise Dataset, and the McGill Billboard Dataset and evaluated with three metrics: Root, MajMin and Chord Content Metric (CCM). The experiments prove that even though there are certainly differences in complexity and structure between artificially generated and human-composed music, the former can be useful in certain scenarios. Specifically, AAM can enrich a smaller training dataset of music composed by a human or can even be used as a standalone training set for a model that predicts chord sequences in pop music, if no other data is available.</description>

      <title>DAFMSVC: One-Shot Singing Voice Conversion with Dual Attention Mechanism and Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singing Voice Conversion (SVC) transfers a source singer's timbre to a target while keeping melody and lyrics. The key challenge in any-to-any SVC is adapting unseen speaker timbres to source audio without quality degradation. Existing methods either face timbre leakage or fail to achieve satisfactory timbre similarity and quality in the generated audio. To address these challenges, we propose DAFMSVC, where the self-supervised learning (SSL) features from the source audio are replaced with the most similar SSL features from the target audio to prevent timbre leakage. It also incorporates a dual cross-attention mechanism for the adaptive fusion of speaker embeddings, melody, and linguistic content. Additionally, we introduce a flow matching module for high quality audio generation from the fused features. Experimental results show that DAFMSVC significantly enhances timbre similarity and naturalness, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both subjective and objective evaluations.</description>

      <title>MeanAudio: Fast and Faithful Text-to-Audio Generation with Mean Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in diffusion- and flow- based models have significantly advanced Text-to-Audio Generation (TTA). While achieving great synthesis quality and controllability, current TTA systems still suffer from slow inference speed, which significantly limits their practical applicability. This paper presents MeanAudio, a novel MeanFlow-based model tailored for fast and faithful text-to-audio generation. Built on a Flux-style latent transformer, MeanAudio regresses the average velocity field during training, enabling fast generation by mapping directly from the start to the endpoint of the flow trajectory. By incorporating classifier-free guidance (CFG) into the training target, MeanAudio incurs no additional cost in the guided sampling process. To further stabilize training, we propose an instantaneous-to-mean curriculum with flow field mix-up, which encourages the model to first learn the foundational instantaneous dynamics, and then gradually adapt to mean flows. This strategy proves critical for enhancing training efficiency and generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that MeanAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-step audio generation. Specifically, it achieves a real time factor (RTF) of 0.013 on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090, yielding a 100x speedup over SOTA diffusion-based TTA systems. Moreover, MeanAudio also demonstrates strong performance in multi-step generation, enabling smooth and coherent transitions across successive synthesis steps.</description>

      <title>Llasa+: Free Lunch for Accelerated and Streaming Llama-Based Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-speech (TTS) has achieved impressive naturalness and flexibility, especially with the development of large language model (LLM)-based approaches. However, existing autoregressive (AR) structures and large-scale models, such as Llasa, still face significant challenges in inference latency and streaming synthesis. To deal with the limitations, we introduce Llasa+, an accelerated and streaming TTS model built on Llasa. Specifically, to accelerate the generation process, we introduce two plug-and-play Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) modules following the frozen backbone. These modules allow the model to predict multiple tokens in one AR step. Additionally, to mitigate potential error propagation caused by inaccurate MTP, we design a novel verification algorithm that leverages the frozen backbone to validate the generated tokens, thus allowing Llasa+ to achieve speedup without sacrificing generation quality. Furthermore, we design a causal decoder that enables streaming speech reconstruction from tokens. Extensive experiments show that Llasa+ achieves a 1.48X speedup without sacrificing generation quality, despite being trained only on LibriTTS. Moreover, the MTP-and-verification framework can be applied to accelerate any LLM-based model. All codes and models are publicly available at https://github.com/ASLP-lab/LLaSA_Plus.</description>

      <title>EmoAugNet: A Signal-Augmented Hybrid CNN-LSTM Framework for Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recognizing emotional signals in speech has a significant impact on enhancing the effectiveness of human-computer interaction (HCI). This study introduces EmoAugNet, a hybrid deep learning framework, that incorporates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers with one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNN) to enable reliable Speech Emotion Recognition (SER). The quality and variety of the features that are taken from speech signals have a significant impact on how well SER systems perform. A comprehensive speech data augmentation strategy was used to combine both traditional methods, such as noise addition, pitch shifting, and time stretching, with a novel combination-based augmentation pipeline to enhance generalization and reduce overfitting. Each audio sample was transformed into a high-dimensional feature vector using root mean square energy (RMSE), Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC), and zero-crossing rate (ZCR). Our model with ReLU activation has a weighted accuracy of 95.78\% and unweighted accuracy of 92.52\% on the IEMOCAP dataset and, with ELU activation, has a weighted accuracy of 96.75\% and unweighted accuracy of 91.28\%. On the RAVDESS dataset, we get a weighted accuracy of 94.53\% and 94.98\% unweighted accuracy for ReLU activation and 93.72\% weighted accuracy and 94.64\% unweighted accuracy for ELU activation. These results highlight EmoAugNet's effectiveness in improving the robustness and performance of SER systems through integated data augmentation and hybrid modeling.</description>

      <title>SpeakerLM: End-to-End Versatile Speaker Diarization and Recognition with Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Speaker Diarization and Recognition (SDR) task aims to predict "who spoke when and what" within an audio clip, which is a crucial task in various real-world multi-speaker scenarios such as meeting transcription and dialogue systems. Existing SDR systems typically adopt a cascaded framework, combining multiple modules such as speaker diarization (SD) and automatic speech recognition (ASR). The cascaded systems suffer from several limitations, such as error propagation, difficulty in handling overlapping speech, and lack of joint optimization for exploring the synergy between SD and ASR tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce SpeakerLM, a unified multimodal large language model for SDR that jointly performs SD and ASR in an end-to-end manner. Moreover, to facilitate diverse real-world scenarios, we incorporate a flexible speaker registration mechanism into SpeakerLM, enabling SDR under different speaker registration settings. SpeakerLM is progressively developed with a multi-stage training strategy on large-scale real data. Extensive experiments show that SpeakerLM demonstrates strong data scaling capability and generalizability, outperforming state-of-the-art cascaded baselines on both in-domain and out-of-domain public SDR benchmarks. Furthermore, experimental results show that the proposed speaker registration mechanism effectively ensures robust SDR performance of SpeakerLM across diverse speaker registration conditions and varying numbers of registered speakers.</description>

      <title>Improved Dysarthric Speech to Text Conversion via TTS Personalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a case study on developing a customized speech-to-text system for a Hungarian speaker with severe dysarthria. State-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) models struggle with zero-shot transcription of dysarthric speech, yielding high error rates. To improve performance with limited real dysarthric data, we fine-tune an ASR model using synthetic speech generated via a personalized text-to-speech (TTS) system. We introduce a method for generating synthetic dysarthric speech with controlled severity by leveraging premorbidity recordings of the given speaker and speaker embedding interpolation, enabling ASR fine-tuning on a continuum of impairments. Fine-tuning on both real and synthetic dysarthric speech reduces the character error rate (CER) from 36-51% (zero-shot) to 7.3%. Our monolingual FastConformer_Hu ASR model significantly outperforms Whisper-turbo when fine-tuned on the same data, and the inclusion of synthetic speech contributes to an 18% relative CER reduction. These results highlight the potential of personalized ASR systems for improving accessibility for individuals with severe speech impairments.</description>

      <title>Robust Target Speaker Diarization and Separation via Augmented Speaker Embedding Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional speech separation and speaker diarization approaches rely on prior knowledge of target speakers or a predetermined number of participants in audio signals. To address these limitations, recent advances focus on developing enrollment-free methods capable of identifying targets without explicit speaker labeling. This work introduces a new approach to train simultaneous speech separation and diarization using automatic identification of target speaker embeddings, within mixtures. Our proposed model employs a dual-stage training pipeline designed to learn robust speaker representation features that are resilient to background noise interference. Furthermore, we present an overlapping spectral loss function specifically tailored for enhancing diarization accuracy during overlapped speech frames. Experimental results show significant performance gains compared to the current SOTA baseline, achieving 71% relative improvement in DER and 69% in cpWER.</description>

      <title>NanoCodec: Towards High-Quality Ultra Fast Speech LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing by leveraging audio codecs to discretize audio into tokens, enabling the application of language modeling techniques to speech data. However, existing audio codecs often operate at high frame rates, leading to slow training and inference, particularly for autoregressive models. To address this, there is growing interest in low frame-rate audio codecs, which reduce the number of autoregressive steps required to generate one second of audio. In this paper, we conduct ablation studies to examine the impact of frame rate, bitrate, and causality on codec reconstruction quality. Based on our findings, we introduce NanoCodec, a state-of-the-art audio codec that achieves high-quality compression at just 12.5 frames per second (FPS). NanoCodec outperforms related works across various bitrate ranges, establishing a new benchmark for low-latency and efficient Speech LLM training and inference.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Data Generation for Enhanced Intent Recognition in German Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intent recognition (IR) for speech commands is essential for artificial intelligence (AI) assistant systems; however, most existing approaches are limited to short commands and are predominantly developed for English. This paper addresses these limitations by focusing on IR from speech by elderly German speakers. We propose a novel approach that combines an adapted Whisper ASR model, fine-tuned on elderly German speech (SVC-de), with Transformer-based language models trained on synthetic text datasets generated by three well-known large language models (LLMs): LeoLM, Llama3, and ChatGPT. To evaluate the robustness of our approach, we generate synthetic speech with a text-to-speech model and conduct extensive cross-dataset testing. Our results show that synthetic LLM-generated data significantly boosts classification performance and robustness to different speaking styles and unseen vocabulary. Notably, we find that LeoLM, a smaller, domain-specific 13B LLM, surpasses the much larger ChatGPT (175B) in dataset quality for German intent recognition. Our approach demonstrates that generative AI can effectively bridge data gaps in low-resource domains. We provide detailed documentation of our data generation and training process to ensure transparency and reproducibility.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a lightweight latent diffusion model for vocal-conditioned musical accompaniment generation that addresses critical limitations in existing music AI systems. Our approach introduces a novel soft alignment attention mechanism that adaptively combines local and global temporal dependencies based on diffusion timesteps, enabling efficient capture of multi-scale musical structure. Operating in the compressed latent space of a pre-trained variational autoencoder, the model achieves a 220 times parameter reduction compared to state-of-the-art systems while delivering 52 times faster inference. Experimental evaluation demonstrates competitive performance with only 15M parameters, outperforming OpenAI Jukebox in production quality and content unity while maintaining reasonable musical coherence. The ultra-lightweight architecture enables real-time deployment on consumer hardware, making AI-assisted music creation accessible for interactive applications and resource-constrained environments.</description>
