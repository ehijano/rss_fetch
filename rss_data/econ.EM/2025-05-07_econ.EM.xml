      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Causal Inference Under Network Confounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07823v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies causal inference with observational data from a single large network. We consider a nonparametric model with interference in potential outcomes and selection into treatment. Both stages may be the outcomes of simultaneous equation models, which allow for endogenous peer effects. This results in high-dimensional network confounding where the network and covariates of all units constitute sources of selection bias. In contrast, the existing literature assumes that confounding can be summarized by a known, low-dimensional function of these objects. We propose to use graph neural networks (GNNs) to adjust for network confounding. When interference decays with network distance, we argue that the model has low-dimensional structure that makes estimation feasible and justifies the use of shallow GNN architectures.</description>

      <title>Change-Point Detection in Time Series Using Mixed Integer Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use cutting-edge mixed integer optimization (MIO) methods to develop a framework for detection and estimation of structural breaks in time series regression models. The framework is constructed based on the least squares problem subject to a penalty on the number of breakpoints. We restate the $l_0$-penalized regression problem as a quadratic programming problem with integer- and real-valued arguments and show that MIO is capable of finding provably optimal solutions using a well-known optimization solver. Compared to the popular $l_1$-penalized regression (LASSO) and other classical methods, the MIO framework permits simultaneous estimation of the number and location of structural breaks as well as regression coefficients, while accommodating the option of specifying a given or minimal number of breaks. We derive the asymptotic properties of the estimator and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive numerical experiments, confirming a more accurate estimation of multiple breaks as compared to popular non-MIO alternatives. Two empirical examples demonstrate usefulness of the framework in applications from business and economic statistics.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning and the Yield Curve: Tree-Based Macroeconomic Regime Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore tree-based macroeconomic regime-switching in the context of the dynamic Nelson-Siegel (DNS) yield-curve model. In particular, we customize the tree-growing algorithm to partition macroeconomic variables based on the DNS model's marginal likelihood, thereby identifying regime-shifting patterns in the yield curve. Compared to traditional Markov-switching models, our model offers clear economic interpretation via macroeconomic linkages and ensures computational simplicity. In an empirical application to U.S. Treasury yields, we find (1) important yield-curve regime switching, and (2) evidence that macroeconomic variables have predictive power for the yield curve when the federal funds rate is high, but not in other regimes, thereby refining the notion of yield curve ''macro-spanning''.</description>

      <title>Method-of-Moments Inference for GLMs and Doubly Robust Functionals under Proportional Asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the estimation of regression coefficients and signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio in high-dimensional Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), and explore their implications in inferring popular estimands such as average treatment effects in high-dimensional observational studies. Under the ``proportional asymptotic'' regime and Gaussian covariates with known (population) covariance $\Sigma$, we derive Consistent and Asymptotically Normal (CAN) estimators of our targets of inference through a Method-of-Moments type of estimators that bypasses estimation of high dimensional nuisance functions and hyperparameter tuning altogether. Additionally, under non-Gaussian covariates, we demonstrate universality of our results under certain additional assumptions on the regression coefficients and $\Sigma$. We also demonstrate that knowing $\Sigma$ is not essential to our proposed methodology when the sample covariance matrix estimator is invertible. Finally, we complement our theoretical results with numerical experiments and comparisons with existing literature.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Risk Minimization Approach for Offline Inverse RL and Dynamic Discrete Choice Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14131v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating Dynamic Discrete Choice (DDC) models, also known as offline Maximum Entropy-Regularized Inverse Reinforcement Learning (offline MaxEnt-IRL) in machine learning. The objective is to recover reward or $Q^*$ functions that govern agent behavior from offline behavior data. In this paper, we propose a globally convergent gradient-based method for solving these problems without the restrictive assumption of linearly parameterized rewards. The novelty of our approach lies in introducing the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) based IRL/DDC framework, which circumvents the need for explicit state transition probability estimation in the Bellman equation. Furthermore, our method is compatible with non-parametric estimation techniques such as neural networks. Therefore, the proposed method has the potential to be scaled to high-dimensional, infinite state spaces. A key theoretical insight underlying our approach is that the Bellman residual satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition -- a property that, while weaker than strong convexity, is sufficient to ensure fast global convergence guarantees. Through a series of synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms benchmark methods and state-of-the-art alternatives.</description>

      <title>Asset Pricing in Pre-trained Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an innovative Transformer model, Single-directional representative from Transformer (SERT), for US large capital stock pricing. It also innovatively applies the pre-trained Transformer models under the stock pricing and factor investment context. They are compared with standard Transformer models and encoder-only Transformer models in three periods covering the entire COVID-19 pandemic to examine the model adaptivity and suitability during the extreme market fluctuations. Namely, pre-COVID-19 period (mild up-trend), COVID-19 period (sharp up-trend with deep down shock) and 1-year post-COVID-19 (high fluctuation sideways movement). The best proposed SERT model achieves the highest out-of-sample R2, 11.2% and 10.91% respectively, when extreme market fluctuation takes place followed by pre-trained Transformer models (10.38% and 9.15%). Their Trend-following-based strategy wise performance also proves their excellent capability for hedging downside risks during market shocks. The proposed SERT model achieves a Sortino ratio 47% higher than the buy-and-hold benchmark in the equal-weighted portfolio and 28% higher in the value-weighted portfolio when the pandemic period is attended. It proves that Transformer models have a great capability to capture patterns of temporal sparsity data in the asset pricing factor model, especially with considerable volatilities. We also find the softmax signal filter as the common configuration of Transformer models in alternative contexts, which only eliminates differences between models, but does not improve strategy-wise performance, while increasing attention heads improve the model performance insignificantly and applying the 'layer norm first' method do not boost the model performance in our case.</description>
