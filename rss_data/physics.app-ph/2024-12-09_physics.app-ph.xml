      <title>Unveiling hole-facilitated amorphisation in pressure-induced phase transformation of silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pressure-induced phase transformation occurs during silicon (Si) wafering processes. \b{eta}-tin (Si-II) phase is formed at high pressures, followed by the transformation to Si-XII, Si-III or/and amorphous Si ({\alpha}-Si) phases during the subsequent decompression. While the imposed pressure and its release rate are known to dictate the phase transformation of Si, the effect of charge carriers are ignored. Here, we experimentally unveil that the increased hole concentration facilitates the amorphization in the pressure-induced phase transformation of Si. The underlying mechanism is elucidated by the theoretical calculations based on machine-learning interatomic potentials. The hole-facilitated amorphization is also experimentally confirmed to occur in the indented Ge, GaAs or SiC. We discover that hole concentration is another determining factor for the pressure-induced phase transformations of the industrially important semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Analytical assessment of the total loss in tubular hollow-core fibers during their fabrication process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hollow-core photonic crystal fibers (HCPCFs) have become a key enabling technology for addressing a broad spectrum of fundamental and applied needs. Indeed, recent advancements achieved by the HCPCF research community have led to significant progress, establishing these fibers as the lowest-loss optical fibers currently available for use in the visible and ultraviolet ranges. However, the fabrication process of HCPCFs demands costly infrastructure, and achieving ultralow-loss fibers remains a complex technical challenge as numerous fabrication attempts are typically required to optimize their performances. Therefore, predicting these fibers' performances before experimental fabrication is highly desirable. In this work, we tackle this task by analytically assessing the total loss in tubular-lattice HCPCFs during their fabrication process. By considering the variation in the microstructure's geometrical parameters during fabrication and the different sources of loss, we estimate expected loss levels and identify the conditions for loss minimization. We understand that our research provides valuable insights into the fabrication process of hollow-core fibers, offering a predictive approach to evaluate the fibers' performance before their experimental realization. By determining optimal conditions considering geometry, fabrication constraints, and loss figures, we believe that our work contributes to the ongoing efforts to further reduce the loss levels in HCPCFs.</description>

      <title>Exploiting the combined dynamic and geometric phases for optical vortex beam generation using metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of optical vortex beams is pivotal for a myriad of applications, encompassing optical tweezing, optical communications, and quantum information, among others. The metasurface-based approach has realized significant advancements in vortex production, utilizing either dynamic or geometric phases. The dynamic design exhibits indifference to the polarization state of incident light, while the geometric design is inextricably tied to it. In the study, we put forth the proposition that combining dynamic and geometric phases could unlock the potential of metasurface design in generating optical vortices. A hybrid design that harnesses the combined dynamic and geometric phases can attain the same objective while offering tunable functional control over the polarization of light. We establish a correlation between the structural parameters of metasurface and the topological charge of the resulting vortices. The experimental results fully demonstrate the design's flexibility and its effective control over the polarization constraints of incident light. Our research uncovers the capacity for vortex generation through the manipulation of hybrid phases introduced by metasurfaces, indicating significant potential for the design of optical devices and the future advancement of innovative optical applications.</description>

      <title>Ultra-thin transistors and circuits for conformable electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02442v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adapting electronics to perfectly conform to non-planar and rough surfaces, such as human skin, is a very challenging task which, if solved, could open up new applications in fields of high economic and scientific interest ranging from health to robotics, wearable electronics, human machine interface and Internet of Things. The key to success lies in defining a technology that can lead to the fabrication of ultra-thin devices while exploiting materials that are ultimately thin, with high mechanical flexibility and excellent electrical properties. Here, we report a hybrid approach for the definition of high-performance, ultra-thin and conformable electronic devices and circuits, based on the integration of ultimately thin semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC), i.e., MoS2, with organic gate dielectric material, i.e., polyvinyl formal (PVF) combined with the ink-jet printing of conductive PEDOT:PSS ink for electrodes definition. Through this cost-effective, fully bottom-up and solution-based approach, transistors and simple digital and analogue circuits are fabricated by a sequential stacking of ultrathin (nanometer) layers on a few micron thick polyimide substrate, which guarantees the high flexibility mandatory for the targeted applications.</description>

      <title>Architecting mechanisms of damage in topological metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Architecting mechanisms of damage in metamaterials by leveraging lattice topology and geometry poses a vital yet complex challenge, essential for engineering desirable mechanical responses. Of these metamaterials, Maxwell lattices, which are on the verge of mechanical stability, offer significant potential for advanced functionality. By leveraging their robust topological features, they enable precise control of effective elastic properties, manipulation of stress localisation and delocalisation across specific domains, and targeted global damage that follows local fracture events. In this work, we identify topology and geometry-dependent parameters that establish a simple, yet precise, framework for designing the behaviour of non-idealised Maxwell lattices and their damage processes. We numerically explore the underlying phenomenology to demonstrate how this framework can guide or arrest damage in lattices, both with and without domain walls and additional boundary constraints. Our approach uncovers a robust way to manipulate the mechanisms of damage and the path they follow in metamaterials, with further insight into crack arrest, diversion, and shielding.</description>

      <title>How polarization fields can be beneficial in nitride emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the prevailing notion that spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization fields are inherently detrimental to light emission in polar semiconductor heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate that polarization can actually enhance the overlap of electron and hole wave functions in III-nitride quantum wells, which are being considered for polychromatic micron-scale pixels in extended-reality and biomedical applications. By systematically exploring the design space of AlInGaN heterostructures with machine learning, we uncover that larger electric fields globally correlate with higher wave-function overlaps for red emitters. The key is the quantum-confined Stark effect, which enables a reduction in well width while avoiding the associated increase in In composition. Our work demonstrates the use of machine learning to reveal unexpected trends for informing the design of semiconductor heterostructures.</description>
