      <title>New water oxidation mechanism in Photosystem II resolves major experimental controversies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light driven oxygen formation in Photosystem II protein is a fundamental process that sustains our biosphere and serves as a blue print to future clean energy solutions due to its high energy conversion efficiency. Last decade of intense research by advanced physical techniques delivered new insights on the structure and function of the Mn4CaO5 cluster a center of the oxygen evolving complex (OEC). However, discrepancies in experimental observations and computational models persist impeding the understanding of the O-O bond formation and the role of the protein environment in the process. Here we show that i) assignment of the OEC unique oxygen O3 ligated by histidine (His337) via dynamic H-bond as a slow exchanging substrate and ii) its coupling with O6 oxygen generated at Mn1 in the S2 to S3 transition give the O-O bond formation mechanism most consistent with all currently available experimental data. Proposal shows how protein environment can steer the O-O bond formation by charge control via H-bond and open coordination of Mn1. Obtained O3-O6 peroxide is at lower energy than peroxides in the most studied O5-O6 bond formation pathway. His337 appears to be similar to distal His in globins used for management of the O2 and H2O2 intermediates. The new mechanism breaks the prior impasse and will undoubtedly invigorate future detailed studies uncovering its further details.</description>

      <title>De novo design of protein binders targeting the human sweet taste receptor as potential sweet proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excessive consumption of dietary sugars is a major contributor to metabolic disorders, driving global interest in finding alternative sweeteners with reduced caloric impact. Natural sweet proteins, such as brazzein, offer exceptional sweetness intensity with little caloric contribution. However, their widespread use is limited by restricted natural diversity, low stability, and high production costs. Recent advances in structural biology and de novo protein design provide new opportunities to overcome these limitations through rational engineering. In this study, we report an integrated computational pipeline for the de novo design of protein binders targeting the human sweet taste receptor subunit TAS1R2, a key component of the heterodimeric class C G protein-coupled receptor mediating sweetness perception. The workflow combines diffusion-based backbone generation (RFdiffusion), neural network-guided sequence design (ProteinMPNN), structure-based filtering using Boltz-1, and binding energy evaluation via MM/GBSA calculations. Using the recently resolved cryo-EM structure of the TAS1R2 receptor, protein binders were designed to target both the Venus Flytrap Domain and the cysteine-rich domain of TAS1R2. A few designed binders exhibited favorable structural confidence and predicted binding energetics. In particular, Binder2 exhibited brazzein-like structural plausibility through specific short-range CRD contacts, while Binder1 displayed the strongest predicted binding affinity. Structural analyses of the binder-receptor complex revealed distinct binding modes and secondary structure profiles among the designs. This study demonstrates the feasibility of de novo designing protein binders that emulate key functional properties of natural sweet proteins, establishing a computational framework for the rational development of next-generation protein-based sweeteners.</description>
