      <title>Detecting the signature of helium reionization through 3HeII 3.46cm line-intensity mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helium reionization is the most recent phase change of the intergalactic medium, yet its timing and main drivers remain uncertain. Among the probes to trace its unfolding, the 3.46 cm hyperfine line of singly-ionized helium opens the study of helium reionization to upcoming radio surveys. We aim to evaluate the detectability of the 3.46,cm signal with radio surveys and the possible constraints it can place on helium reionization, in particular whether it can distinguish between early and late helium reionization scenarios. Moreover, we perform a comprehensive study of the advantages of single-dish vs. interferometric setup. Using hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with radiative transfer, we construct mock data cubes for two models of helium reionization. We compute the power spectrum of the signal and forecast the signal-to-noise ratio for SKA-1 MID, DSA-2000, and a PUMA-like survey, in both observational setups. The two scenarios produce distinct power spectra, but the faintness of the signal, largely caused by weak coupling between the spin temperature and the kinetic temperature in low-density regions of the IGM, combined with high instrumental noise, makes detection very difficult within realistic integration times for current surveys. A PUMA-like survey operating in single-dish mode could, however, detect the 3.46 cm signal with an integrated signal-to-noise ratio of a few in &lt; 1000 h in both scenarios. Distinguishing helium reionization scenarios with 3.46 cm line-intensity mapping therefore remains challenging for current facilities. Our results, however, indicate that next-generation, high-sensitivity surveys with optimized observing strategies, especially when combined with complementary probes of the IGM, could begin to place meaningful constraints on the timing and morphology of helium reionization.</description>

      <title>Neural posterior estimation of the line-of-sight and subhalo populations in galaxy-scale strong lensing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful probe for studying the fundamental properties of dark matter on sub-galactic scales. Detailed analyses of galaxy-scale lenses have revealed localized gravitational perturbations beyond the smooth mass distribution of the main lens galaxy, largely attributed to dark matter subhalos and intervening line-of-sight halos. Recent studies suggest that, in contrast to subhalos, line-of-sight halos imprint distinct anisotropic features on the two-point correlation function of the effective lensing deflection field. These anisotropies are particularly sensitive to the collisional nature of dark matter, offering a potential means to test alternatives to the cold dark matter paradigm. In this study, we explore whether a neural density estimator can directly identify such anisotropic signatures from galaxy-galaxy strong lens images. We model the multipoles of the two-point function using a power-law parameterization and train a neural density estimator to predict the corresponding posterior distribution of lensing parameters, alongside parameter distributions for dark matter substructure. Our results show that recovering the dark matter substructure mass functions and mass-concentration parameters remains challenging, owing to difficulties in generating uniform training data set while using physically motivated priors. We also unveil an important degeneracy between the line-of-sight halo mass-function amplitude and the subhalo mass-function normalization. Furthermore, the network exhibits limited accuracy in predicting the two-point function multipole parameters, suggesting that both the training data and the adopted power-law fitting function may inadequately represent the true underlying structure of the anisotropic signal.</description>

      <title>Prospects for measuring the Doppler magnification dipole with LSST and DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We forecast the detectability of the Doppler magnification dipole with a joint analysis of galaxy spectroscopic redshifts and size measurements. The Doppler magnification arises from an apparent size variation caused by galaxies' peculiar velocities when mapping them from redshift space to real space. This phenomenon is the dominant contribution to the convergence at low redshifts ($\lesssim$ 0.5). A practical observational strategy is to cross-correlate a galaxy number count tracer, e.g. from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Bright Galaxy Survey, with the convergence field reconstructed from galaxy size measurements obtained by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). To assess the achievable precision of galaxy size measurements, we simulate LSST Y1-quality galaxy images with Galsim and measure them with the Galight profile fitting package. Our investigations, based on galaxy populations from LSST's synthetic galaxy catalogue cosmoDC2, show that the variance due to intrinsic galaxy size variation dominates over size measurement errors as expected, but may be lower than previous studies have suggested. Under our analysis assumptions, the Doppler magnification dipole would be detectable with a signal-to-noise ratio $\geq 10$ in multiple redshift bins between $0.1 \leq z \leq 0.5$ with DESI spectroscopic redshifts and LSST imaging.</description>

      <title>A stringent constraint on the fractional change of proton g-factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a constraint on the cosmological variation of the proton g-factor, $g_p$. By comparing the measured redshifts between \mbox{H\,{\sc i}} 21 cm and OH 18 cm lines observed with the newly commissioned Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) toward PKS 1413+135 at $z$ = 0.24671, we obtain $\Delta g_{p}/g_{p} = (-4.3\pm2.5)\times10^{-5}$, which is more than two orders of magnitude more sensitive than previous constraints. In addition, we obtain sensitive constraints of $\Delta (\mu\alpha^{2})/(\mu\alpha^{2}) = (2.0\pm1.2)\times10^{-5}$ and $\Delta (\mu\alpha^{2}g_{p}^{0.64})/(\mu\alpha^{2}g_{p}^{0.64}) = (-4.7\pm1.9)\times10^{-6}$.</description>

      <title>Full calibration of the tomographic redshift distribution from the HSC PDR3 Shape Catalog with DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calibration of tomographic redshift distributions is essential for cosmological analysis of weak lensing data. In this work, we calibrate all four tomographic bins of the Hyper Suprime Camera (HSC) weak lensing catalog with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1 and 2 using the clustering redshifts technique. We include $z&gt;1.2$ redshift sources such as emission line galaxies (ELG) and quasars (QSO) sources in our calibration, which were not available in the previous HSC calibration (Rau et al. 2022, arXiv:2211.16516), allowing a complete calibration of all the redshift bins. We find the first tomographic bin exhibits a small shift towards low redshifts. The second bin is in good agreement with the photometric calibration, while third and fourth bin exhibit a shift towards higher redshifts. However, these shifts are considerably smaller than the shifts obtained in the HSC Year 3 cosmic shear analyses. We evaluate the impact of galaxy bias and magnification effects from all the samples on the measurements, finding them to be small, and we propose corrections to reduce them further. We model the redshift distributions with splines and compare our results to previous analyses as well as to other parameterizations found in literature. For the two high-redshift tomographic bins, we find the shifts to higher redshifts with respect to the measurements performed in Rau+2022 to be $\Delta z_3=-0.039^{+0.020}_{-0.021}$ and $\Delta z_4=-0.048^{+0.012}_{-0.012}$.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Shear constraints from HSC Year 3 with clustering calibration of the tomographic redshift distributions from DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reanalyze cosmological constraints from Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Y3 shear-shear correlation function using new calibration of the tomographic redshift distribution via the clustering redshifts method with DESI spectroscopy presented in Choppin de Janvry et al. (2025a). We present both importance sampling of the original MCMC chains by HSC, applying the weights of our newly calibrated $\Delta z$ priors, as well as full MCMC analysis with new photometric redshift distributions, finding consistent results between the two. We obtain the growth of structure parameter $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}=0.805\pm{0.018}$, compared to previous HSC Y3 result of $S_8=0.769^{+0.031}_{-0.034}$, which is a 1.8 reduction of error due to the improved clustering redshift calibrations, with the central value shifting considerably higher towards Planck cosmology. With the new photometric redshift calibration, HSC Y3 has comparable constraining power to the recent KIDS Legacy and DES Y3. Combining all three gives $S_8=0.813^{+0.009}_{-0.010}$, which can be compared to $S_8=0.828\pm 0.012$ from CMB lensing. Overall there is no evidence for deviation from Planck on $S_8$ in any of the weak lensing analyses, and combining galaxy lensing with CMB lensing gives a sub-percent constraint $S_8=0.818\pm 0.007$, comparable in both precision and value to the most recent Planck+ACT+DESI constraint $S_8=0.812\pm 0.007$.</description>

      <title>Curvature Perturbations from Higgs Modulated Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate curvature perturbations and non-Gaussianity arising from Higgs modulated reheating in the early Universe. We employ three different methods -- the period-averaging (PA) method, the exact method, and the non-perturbative $\delta N$ formalism -- to compute the power spectrum and bispectrum of curvature perturbations. Our results show that the non-perturbative $\delta N$ method provides a reliable estimate across a wide range of reheating time and Higgs field values, including regimes where the Higgs field oscillates significantly after inflation. We find that a smaller Higgs self-coupling ($\lambda$) leads to a larger curvature perturbation, with the non-Gaussianity predominantly taking a local shape. This highlights the importance of considering non-perturbative effects in calculating the curvature perturbation during Higgs modulated reheating, especially for smaller values of $\lambda$. Our findings offer valuable insights into the dynamics of reheating and the generation of primordial perturbations in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>On the bin sensitivity of the transverse BAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BAO characteristic scale is a useful tool for understanding the evolution of the universe, especially the influence of dark energy on this evolution. In this work, we study the projection effect in transverse BAO, namely the mixing of BAO signals from different epochs caused by $z_c$ uncertainty within a chosen bin. We focus our forecast on two surveys of interest: the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) HI galaxy redshift survey and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)'s final Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample. We test the sensitivity in finding the transverse BAO depending of three bin configurations: a Gaussian, a top-hat and an intermediate of them semi-Gaussian. We also analyse the precision the bin widths $\sigma_z$ from smaller to wider bins $0.01&lt;\sigma_z&lt;0.1$. In order to correct these deviations, we propose a correction based on adjacent redshift to $z_c$, this would provide a semi-statistical correction instead of only relying on fiducial cosmology. Finally, we conclude that despite the higher shot-noise than the top-hat bin separation, the semi-Gaussian bin is the most accurate case to find the BAO signal and to constrain parameters through the angular power spectrum. A Gaussian binning gives the least precise parameter constraints compared to the other two cases.</description>

      <title>Prospects for cosmological research using hundred-meter-class radio telescopes: 21-cm intensity mapping survey strategies with QTT, JRT, and HRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding dark energy requires precision measurements of the expansion history of the universe and the growth of large-scale structure. The 21 cm intensity mapping (21 cm IM) technique enables rapid large-area surveys that can deliver these measurements. China is constructing three hundred-meter-class single-dish radio telescopes, including the QiTai 110 m Radio Telescope (QTT), the 120 m Jingdong Radio Telescope (JRT), and the 120 m Huadian Radio Telescope (HRT), whose designs are well suited for 21 cm IM cosmology. We use a Fisher-to-MCMC forecasting framework to evaluate the baryon acoustic oscillations / redshift space distortions (BAO/RSD) measurement capabilities of QTT, JRT, and HRT and propagate them to dark-energy constraints in the $w_0w_a$CDM model. Our results show that achieving a redshift coverage up to $z_{\mathrm{max}} = 1$ is crucial for fully realising the potential of hundred-meter-class single-dish telescopes for 21 cm cosmology. If all three telescopes carry out 21 cm IM surveys over the same redshift range up to $z_{\mathrm{max}}=1$ and combine their BAO/RSD measurements, QTT+JRT+HRT yield $\sigma(w_0)=0.094$ and $\sigma(w_a)=0.487$, providing tighter constraints than DESI DR2 results.</description>

      <title>How Primordial Black Holes Change BBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) provide a powerful probe of early-universe physics, linking inflationary fluctuations to observable cosmological phenomena. In this work, we use a bottom-up approach to study how PBHs with masses in the range $10^{8} \leq M \leq 10^{13}\,\mathrm{g}$ modify Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) through Hawking radiation. We incorporate PBH evaporation into a reaction-network code to evaluate its impact on light-element abundances. Our analysis shows that PBH evaporation acts as an entropy injection mechanism, increasing the comoving entropy density. To reproduce the observed comoving entropy density per baryon $(s/n_{\mathrm{b}})$ from the CMB, BBN simulations must therefore begin with a smaller initial entropy than in the standard scenario without PBHs. The results also reveal a threshold near $M \approx 10^{10}\,\mathrm{g}$ that separates two distinct regimes of BBN behavior. As an example, for $M \geq 10^{10}\,\mathrm{g}$, the $^4{\mathrm{He}}$ mass fraction $Y_{\mathrm{P}}$ increases monotonically with $\beta$, driven by the enhanced Hubble expansion from PBH energy density. In contrast, for $M \leq 10^{10}\,\mathrm{g}$, $Y_{\mathrm{P}}$ exhibits non-monotonic behavior shaped by the timing of PBH evaporation and its influence on nuclear reaction rates. These findings highlight the sensitivity of BBN to PBH evaporation and establish a framework for understanding how PBH populations influence the thermal history of the early universe.</description>

      <title>How Complex is Dark Energy? A Bayesian Analysis of CPL Extensions with Recent DESI BAO Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of dark energy is one of the big puzzling issues in cosmology. While $\Lambda$CDM provides a good fit to the observational data, evolving dark energy scenarios, such as the CPL parametrization, offer a compelling alternative. In this paper, we present a Bayesian model comparison of various dark energy parametrizations using a joint analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background data, DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements, and the PantheonPlus (or Union3) Supernovae type Ia sample. We find that while the $\Lambda$CDM model is initially favored over a constant $w$CDM model, the CPL parametrization is significantly preferred over $w$CDM, reinforcing recent evidence for an evolving dark energy component, consistent with DESI collaboration findings. Crucially, when testing higher-order CPL extensions, the so-called CPL$^+$ and CPL$^{++}$, our Bayesian analysis shows that the observational data do not favor these more complex scenarios compared to the standard CPL. This result indicates that adding excessive complexity to the CPL form is unwarranted by current observations. Interestingly, similar to the CPL parametrization, alternative two-parameter forms, specifically $w_{de}(a) = w_0 + w_b(1-a)^2$ and $w_{de}(a) = w_0 + w_c(1-a)^3$, yield a better fit to observational data than the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Our results challenge the necessity for overly complex CPL extensions and confirm that well-chosen two-parameter $w_0w_a$ parametrizations effectively capture DE evolution with current cosmological data, supporting the recent signals for dynamical dark energy by DESI collaboration.</description>

      <title>Improved constraints on ultralight axions using latest observations of the early and late Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight axions (ULAs) are hypothetical particles which can behave like dark matter (DM) or dark energy (DE) depending on masses generated at the symmetry-breaking scale. It remains a mystery whether the ULAs can make up a fraction of DM or DE. Although theoretical predictions indicate that the ULAs may leave distinct imprints on cosmological signals, these signatures may exist in a broad spatial and temporal scales, and may be degenerate with the known effects of the standard model. The ULA signatures are extremely subtle and the observational evidence of the ULAs remain elusive. In this work, we infer the ULA properties using both the early and late universe observations from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). We validate modeling of the ULA effects using the CMB and BAO mock data and perform different tests to cross-check the results. By analyzing the Planck 2018 CMB measurements and the BAO measurements from the Data Release 2 of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we constrain the energy density fraction ratio of the ULAs to total dark matter $\Omega_a/\Omega_d$ and obtain a new upper bound of $\Omega_a/\Omega_d$. Future CMB and BAO measurements will achieve unprecedented precision and will be crucial for understanding the nature of the ULAs.</description>

      <title>Separating the Inseparable: Constraining Arbitrary Primordial Bispectra with Cosmic Microwave Background Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To efficiently probe primordial non-Gaussianity using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, we require theoretical predictions that are factorizable, \textit{i.e.}\ those whose kinematic dependence can be separated. This property does not hold for many models, hindering their application to data. In this work, we introduce a general framework for constructing separable approximations to primordial bispectra, enabling direct CMB constraints on arbitrary models including those computed using numerical tools. In contrast to other approaches such as modal decompositions, we learn the basis functions directly from the data, allowing high-fidelity representations with just a handful of terms. This is practically implemented using machine-learning techniques, utilizing neural network basis functions and a loss function designed to mimic the CMB cosine similarity. We validate our pipeline using a variety of input bispectra, demonstrating that the approximations are $&gt;99.5\%$ correlated with the truth with just three terms. By incorporating the neural basis into the \textsc{PolySpec} code, we derive KSW-type CMB estimators, which reproduce local- and equilateral-type non-Gaussianity to within $0.1\sigma$. As a proof-of-concept, we constrain two inflationary bispectra from the `cosmological collider' scenario; these feature an additional strongly-mixed particle sector and cannot be computed analytically. By combining the numerical predictions from \textsc{CosmoFlow} with our factorizable approach (with just three terms), we place novel constraints on the collider models using \textit{Planck} PR4 data, finding no detection of non-Gaussianity. Our method facilitates detailed studies of the inflationary paradigm, connecting modern theoretical tools with high-resolution observational data.</description>

      <title>Towards testing gravity with LSST using $E_G$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $E_G$ is a summary statistic that combines cosmological observables to achieve a test of gravity that is relatively model-independent. Here, we consider the power of a measurement of $E_G$ using galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering with sources from the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), and lenses from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We first update the theoretical framework for the covariance of $E_G$ to accommodate this Stage IV scenario. We then demonstrate that $E_G$ offers in principle a model-agnostic test of gravity using only linear-scale information, with the caveat that a careful treatment of galaxy bias is required. We finally address the persistent issue of $E_G$'s theoretical dependence on the measured value of $\Omega_{\rm M}^0$. We propose a framework that takes advantage of the posterior predictive test to consistently incorporate uncertainty on $\Omega_{\rm M}^0$ in tests of gravity with $E_G$, which should be of general use beyond the LSST+DESI scenario. Our forecasting study using this method shows that the prior information available for $\Omega_{\rm M}^0$ is instrumental in determining the power of $E_G$ in the LSST+DESI context. For the full survey dataset, with priors on $\Omega_{\rm M}^0$ from existing CMB data, we find that for some modified gravity scenarios considered, we are likely to be able to reject the GR null hypothesis.</description>

      <title>The Non-universal Pseudo Phase-Space Density Profiles of Symphony Host Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological N-body simulations have long suggested that the pseudo phase-space density (PPSD), $\rho/\sigma^3$, of cold dark matter halos follows the universal relation $\rho/\sigma^3 \propto r^{\chi}$, with $\chi \approx -1.875$, as predicted by spherical secondary-infall similarity solutions. This power law appears to hold despite the fact that neither the density $\rho(r)$ nor velocity dispersion $\sigma(r)$ follow universal power law relations individually, even at fixed mass. We analyze 246 host halos from the Symphony suite of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations, to consistently measure PPSD profiles across host masses from $10^{11}$ to $10^{15} M_\odot$. We find that the PPSD systematically deviates from a power law, and that halos with larger deviations from Jeans equilibrium systematically develop steeper average PPSD slopes. This result suggests that the PPSD is not universal; instead, it is linked to a halo's degree of dynamical equilibrium, which is ultimately set by halo formation history. As a result, we show that secondary halo properties such as concentration and accretion rate inherit significant correlations with the PPSD slope. Moreover, our hosts' PPSD profiles are remarkably consistent with predictions from 1D self-similar fluid collapse models, indicating that three-dimensional structure, velocity anisotropy, and cosmological environment all play negligible roles in shaping the PPSD. These findings imply that the PPSD does not follow a universal power law, but is instead determined by halo mass assembly history alone.</description>

      <title>Revisiting model-independent constraints on spatial curvature and cosmic ladders calibration: updated and forecast analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-independent approaches have gained increasing attention as powerful tools to investigate persistent tensions between cosmological observations and the predictions of $\Lambda$CDM. Notably, recent DESY5 Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) and DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data challenge the validity of the cosmological constant, and they remain in tension with SH0ES local distance ladder measurements under standard pre-recombination physics. Building on our previous work, MNRAS 523 (2023) 3, 3406-3422, we present a follow-up analysis of the model-independent calibration of the local and inverse distance ladders using cosmic chronometers (CCH) data and Gaussian Processes. We jointly constrain the SNIa absolute magnitude, $M$, the comoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch, $r_d$, and the spatial curvature parameter, $\Omega_k$, using CCH with DESY5 and DESI DR1/DR2. We find this data combination compatible with a flat universe at $\sim1.7\sigma$, with $\Omega_k=-0.143\pm0.085$, showing weaker compatibility than with Pantheon+, while the ladder calibrators read $M=-19.324_{-0.095}^{+0.092}$ and $r_d=(144.00^{+5.38}_{-4.88}$) Mpc. Although current uncertainties limit the precision of our constraints and prevent us from arbitrating the Hubble tension, it is nevertheless instructive to explore the constraining power of our methodology with future SNIa, CCH, and BAO from surveys such as LSST, Euclid, and DESI. We present the first forecast analysis for the triad $(M,\Omega_k,r_d)$, finding that, in an optimistic scenario, upcoming data will improve agnostic constraints on $M$ by $\sim$54% and on $r_d$ by $\sim$66%, enabling a $\sim2$% determination of $H_0$. Precision on $\Omega_k$ will increase by $\sim50$%. Our analysis outlines which improvements in future data - whether in quality, quantity, or redshift coverage - are likely to most effectively tighten these constraints.[abridged]</description>

      <title>Systematic assessment of the Hubble tension via Bayesian jackknife testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistically-significant differences in the value of the Hubble parameter are found depending on the measurement method that is used, a result known as the Hubble tension. A variety of ways of comparing, grouping, and excluding measurements have been used to try to explain this, either in terms of physical effects or systematic errors. We present a systematic 'Bayesian jackknife' analysis of 16 independent measurements of the Hubble parameter in an attempt to identify whether the measurements fall into meaningful clusters that would help explain the origin of the tension. After evaluating evidence ratios for the commonly-used split into early- vs late-time measurements, we then study a range of simplified alternative physical scenarios that reflect different physical origins of an apparent bias or shift in the value of $H_0$, assigning phenomenological population parameters to each subset. These include scenarios where specific subsets are biased (e.g. due to unrecognised experimental systematics in the local distance ladder or cosmic microwave background measurements), as well as more cosmologically-motivated cases involving modifications to the expansion history. Many of these scenarios have similar marginal likelihood, but the model where no measurements are biased is strongly disfavoured. Finally, we marginalise over all these scenarios to estimate the 'model agnostic' posterior distribution of $H_0$. The resulting distribution is mildly multi-modal, but modestly favours values near $H_0=68$ km/s/Mpc, with a 95\% credible region of $66.7 &lt; H_0 &lt; 72.7$ km/s/Mpc.</description>

      <title>The odd primordial halo of the Milky Way implied by Gaia. A shallow core, but a steep decline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial dark matter halos are well understood from cold dark matter-only simulations. Since they can contract significantly as baryons settle into their centers, direct comparisons with observed galaxies are complicated. We present an approach to reversing the halo contraction by numerically calculating the halo response to baryonic infall and iterating the initial condition. This allowed us to derive spherically averaged primordial dark matter halos for observed galaxies. We applied this approach to the Milky Way and found that the latest Gaia measurements for the rotation velocities imply an odd primordial Galactic halo: Its concentration and total mass differ by more than 3$\sigma$ from the predictions, and the density profile presents an inner core that is too shallow and an outer decline that is too steep to be compatible with the cold dark matter paradigm.</description>

      <title>The $\mu$-deformed Einstein field equations with $\mu$-dependent effective cosmological constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the $\mu$-deformed Einstein field equations from the generalized thermodynamic functions of the $\mu$-deformed analog of Bose gas model, applying the (adapted) Verlinde's approach. The basic role of deformation parameter is shown: it provides the possibility to vary the value of the cosmological constant. Due to this, we suggest an interesting treatment of the cosmological constant (CC) problem within the framework of $\mu$-deformation. Namely, viewing the derived $\mu$-deformed CC as an effective one and varying the parameter $\mu$ appropriately, we gain the possibility to drastically reduce the CC, so as to get for it the realistic value. Also, the relation with dark matter is discussed.</description>

      <title>Hawking-radiation-ignited autocatalytic formation of primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze an autocatalytic mechanism in which bursts of Hawking radiation from evaporating micro-primordial black holes (PBHs) trigger the collapse of near-critical plasma overdensities. In a primordial plasma seeded with such patches, this feedback self organizes into a traveling ignition front that successively forms new PBHs and then self-quenches as the Universe expands. A minimal reaction-diffusion model yields conservative criteria for ignition and freeze-out and predicts a stochastic gravitational-wave background with a sharp causal low-frequency edge set by the freeze-out correlation length and largely insensitive to Planck-scale PBH endpoint microphysics. The resulting sub-Hz-to-audio band and amplitudes satisfy cosmological energy-injection bounds, providing a clean, testable target for forthcoming gravitational-wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Verifying the failing supernova constraint on dark photons with two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies on the dark photon (DP) production in collapsing stars argue that the cooling effect induced by DPs can hinder supernova explosions and lead to a ``failing supernova" constraint on the photon-DP mixing parameter $\epsilon$. In order to verify the idea, we perform two-dimensional neutrino-radiation hydrodynamic simulations coupled with the DP production with the mass of 0.3 MeV. We find that the shock revival does not happen until the end of the simulations when $\epsilon\gtrsim3\times10^{-9}$. The photon-DP mixing parameter above this value can be excluded by the failing supernova argument. Interestingly, our constraint is close to the one reported by the previous studies which adopted the post-processing framework. This result motivates one to investigate a wider parameter range of DPs with self-consistent simulations and evaluate uncertainties in the constraint.</description>

      <title>Detection prospects for the Cosmic Neutrino Background using matter interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss how the Cosmic Neutrino Background can affect the measured phase difference in a matter interferometer. This phase is proportional to a difference in potential energies along the two interferometer paths. The relevant potentials here are the well-known neutrino matter potential and a potential related to the Stodolsky effect. We show how they can be rewritten in terms of scalar potentials, pseudo magnetic fields and spin-spin interactions. Unfortunately, current technology is unlikely to detect this effect and we discuss prospects for the future. We also briefly comment on fermionic Dark Matter which can give rise to very similar effects which can easily be larger than the neutrino case.</description>

      <title>Kinematic Mapping of Giant Arcs: A New Method to Locate Lensing Critical Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proximity of lensing critical curves features highly magnified portions of lensed galaxies. Accurate knowledge of the location and shape of the critical curve will be useful for understanding the nature of highly magnified stellar sources near critical curves and for revealing sub-galactic dark matter structures within the lens. In galaxy-cluster lenses, however, prediction of critical curves can be uncertain due to complexity in global mass modeling. Bracketing the critical curve with sparse lensed image pairs of compact continuum sources may not be sufficient as additional information available throughout the extended arc is not used. We explore and validate a kinematics-based method for locating the critical curve. This method leverages the continuous line-of-sight velocity profile of the lensed galaxy mapped through integral field spectroscopy of nebular emission lines, and combines an agnostic local lens model and a disk rotation model. Applying our method to a highly magnified region of the Dragon Arc in the Abell 370 cluster lensing field using archival VLT/MUSE IFU mapping of the H$\beta$ line, we constrain the critical curve to an uncertainty band with a half-width of 0.23" ($1\sigma$). This reveals locations of recently detected extremely magnified stars biased toward the negative-parity side of the critical curve, as predicted for intracluster microlensing. With future JWST/NIRSpec IFU mapping of the H$\alpha$ line at SNR $\simeq$ 10 (20), uncertainty may improve to 0.12" (0.08"). A measurement of this type with sufficiently small uncertainty may reveal small-scale wiggles in the shape of the critical curve where it crosses the giant arc, which can arise from the lensing perturbation of sub-galactic dark matter substructure. Our approach is generally applicable to caustic-crossing giant arcs in extragalactic lensing fields and can be incorporated into global lens modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a novel cosmological model based on coupled fields in the framework of scalar tensor theories, considering the specific interplay between gravity and scalar fields. The model further extends a recent axion-dilaton system by introducing viable couplings with the space--time geometry encoded into the scalar curvature. After briefly introducing the action and the corresponding field equations, we employ linear stability theory to investigate the physical properties. The analysis showed the compatibility of the current theoretical model with the recent history of the Universe, obtaining viable constraints for the model's parameters in some specific cases. In the present setup, the axion--dilaton system is non--minimally coupled with gravity in an independent manner, leading to distinct physical features in the phase-space structure, possible alleviating the cosmic coincidence problem.</description>

      <title>Milky Way galaxy-analogs and isolated galaxies with bars: environmental density in the Local Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The environmental density of galaxies within the cosmic web constrains their 3D locations in filaments, voids, groups, and clusters. It traces the distribution of baryons and the influence of dark-matter halos on galaxy evolution, and helps diagnose external processes such as supernova and AGN feedback, tidal interactions, ram-pressure stripping, and large-scale flows. We focus on isolated barred galaxies, the parent population that includes Milky Way analogs. To measure local environmental density and verify isolation (|Delta v| &lt;= 500 km s^-1), we built a Python pipeline that works in two redshift regimes: low (z0 &lt; 0.02) and high (z0 &gt;= 0.02). Densities were estimated with k-nearest neighbors and Voronoi tessellations and classified as void (Sigma &lt; 0.05), filament (0.05 &lt;= Sigma &lt; 0.5), group (0.5 &lt;= Sigma &lt; 2.0), and cluster (Sigma &gt;= 2.0). Our northern-sky sample contains 311 isolated barred galaxies from 2MIG plus Milky Way analog systems (z &lt; 0.07). We find 157 void, 84 filament, 27 group, and 11 cluster galaxies; 30 have no detected neighbors. Sixty-seven lie in extremely low-density regions (Sigma_3D &lt; 0.01 gal Mpc^-3), and 22 have the nearest companion beyond 5 Mpc, indicating residence in extended voids. The Milky Way (Sigma_5NN ~ 0.13 gal Mpc^-3, R ~ 2.1 Mpc) and its close analog NGC 3521 both lie in filamentary environments at the edge of a nearby void. For z &gt; 0.02 we identify three additional Milky Way analog candidates from the density metrics: CGCG 208-043 (3D Voronoi) and NGC 5231 and CGCG 047-026 (5th-nearest neighbor). These results show that local environmental density is an effective, physically motivated criterion for selecting Milky Way analogs.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the framework of Newer General Relativity, defined by all independent quadratic invariants of the non-metricity tensor, including the unique quadratic parity-violating term. We analyze linear perturbations around a flat FLRW background and find that the theory generically exhibits ghost instabilities, except for the special case of Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (STEGR) supplemented by the parity-violating operator. Using both the Dirac-Bergmann procedure and the Cartan-Kuranishi algorithm, we show that this remaining case propagates eight degrees of freedom at the fully non-linear level. This result implies that the parity-violating extension of STEGR is strongly coupled around FLRW and therefore lies beyond the regime of validity of standard linear perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Inflation in theories with broken diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the impact of breaking diffeomorphism invariance in the inflaton sector. In particular, we consider inflaton models which are invariant under the subgroup of transverse diffeomorphisms and address the possibility of implementing a slow-roll phase. We obtain the corresponding expressions for relevant quantities such as the slow-roll parameters and the number of $e$-folds, and derive the primordial power-spectrum of curvature perturbations. The scalar spectral index features modifications which are confronted with CMB data from Planck and ACT. We study in detail the quadratic potential model, combining asymptotic and numerical analysis. We show that the post-inflationary behavior can be drastically different from the diffeomorphism-invariant case, exhibiting novel dynamical regimes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Probe of Singlet-Doublet Dark Matter Induced Radiative Neutrino Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an one loop radiative neutrino mass model, where the loop particles, notably a singlet fermion ($\chi$), a doublet fermion ($\Psi$) and three generations of singlet scalars ($\phi_i, i=\{1,2,3\}$) are assumed to be odd under an additional $\mathcal{Z}_2$-symmetry. In this setup, the singlet fermion mixes with the neutral component of the doublet to give rise singlet-doublet Majorana dark matter. The addition of $\mathcal{Z}_2$ odd scalars in the model provides rich phenomenological implications. We find that the quartic interaction terms between the SM Higgs and $\phi_i$s play a significant role in modifying the scalar potential to have a first-order phase transition (FOPT) leading to observable gravitational waves (GWs) spectra. We also examine the non-trivial role played by the singlet-doublet fermion DM and the scalars in loop-induced neutrino mass, $(g-2)_\mu$, and lepton flavor violation. We find that the model is predictive due to the combined constraints and can be verified at different terrestrial experiments.</description>

      <title>Probing the Formation Environment of Strongly Lensed Black Hole Mergers: Implications for the AGN-disk Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of multiple images from a strongly lensed gravitational wave (GW) source provides the observer with a stereoscopic view of the source. This allows for a measure of its relative proper motion by comparing the induced GW Doppler shifts between the different images. In addition, if the GW source is in a dynamical environment it will be subject to an acceleration, which will show up as a time dependent Doppler shift in each individual image. In this work we quantify for the first time how a joint detection of these effects can be used to constrain the underlying dynamics and environment of the lensed GW source. We consider a range of different astrophysical environments, from massive clusters to stellar triples, and find that binary black hole (BBH) mergers in Active Galactic Nuclei disks (AGN-disks) are particularly likely to have orbital parameters that can be constrained through our considered lensing setup. Applying these methods to the upcoming catalog of cosmologically strongly lensed GW sources will open up new possibilities for probing their origin and underlying formation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Axion Cosmology with Multi-Branch Yang-Mills</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that Yang-Mills theories, especially in the large-$N$ limit, exhibit a $\theta$-vacuum structure with a multi-branched vacuum energy. In this work, we demonstrate that this multi-branch structure can play a crucial role in axion cosmology when the axion acquires its mass from the Yang-Mills sector, even when that sector is never reheated by the inflaton. The key observation is that the axion potential is directly tied to the tunneling rate between adjacent branches. We find qualitatively new phenomena, including a new class of first-order phase transitions, bouncing bubbles, and nested "bubbles-within-bubbles." When the axion has a decay constant around the Planck scale, as motivated by the string Axiverse, the axion can be driven near the hilltop by inflationary dynamics, allowing the phase transition to be triggered. The associated energy release can be large enough to generate a significant stochastic gravitational-wave background, produce primordial black holes, or populate the Yang-Mills sector with particles. These phenomena represent novel predictions of the Axiverse and should be taken into account when assessing the cosmological impact of axions or axion-like particles. To recover conventional axion cosmology, one must suppress or avoid the dynamics discussed in this work.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from dark domain walls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For most of cosmic history, the evolution of our Universe has been governed by the physics of a 'dark sector', consisting of dark matter and dark energy, whose properties are only understood in a schematic way. The influence of these constituents is mediated exclusively by the force of gravity, meaning that insight into their nature must be gleaned from gravitational phenomena. The advent of gravitational-wave astronomy has revolutionised the field of black hole astrophysics, and opens a new window of discovery for cosmological sources. Relevant examples include topological defects, such as domain walls or cosmic strings, which are remnants of a phase transition. Here we present the first simulations of cosmic structure formation in which the dynamics of the dark sector introduces domain walls as a source of stochastic gravitational waves in the late Universe. We study in detail how the spectrum of gravitational waves is affected by the properties of the model, and extrapolate the results to scales relevant to the recent evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background. Our relativistic implementation of the field dynamics paves the way for optimal use of the next generation of gravitational experiments to unravel the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Hubble and matter density parameters with and without modelling the CMB anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00804v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider constraints on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{\mathrm{M}}$ from: (i) the age of the Universe based on old stars and stellar populations in the Galactic disc and halo (Cimatti &amp; Moresco 2023); (ii) the turnover scale in the matter power spectrum, which tells us the cosmological horizon at the epoch of matter-radiation equality (Philcox et al. 2022); and (iii) the shape of the expansion history from supernovae (SNe) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) with no absolute calibration of either, a technique known as uncalibrated cosmic standards (UCS; Lin, Chen, &amp; Mack 2021). A narrow region is consistent with all three constraints just outside their $1\sigma$ uncertainties. Although this region is defined by techniques unrelated to the physics of recombination and the sound horizon then, the standard $Planck$ fit to the CMB anisotropies falls precisely in this region. This concordance argues against early-time explanations for the anomalously high local estimate of $H_0$ (the 'Hubble tension'), which can only be reconciled with the age constraint at an implausibly low $\Omega_{\mathrm{M}}$. We suggest instead that outflow from the local KBC supervoid (Keenan, Barger, &amp; Cowie 2013) inflates redshifts in the nearby universe and thus the apparent local $H_0$. Given the difficulties with solutions in the early universe, we argue that the most promising alternative to a local void is a modification to the expansion history at late times, perhaps due to a changing dark energy density.</description>

      <title>DESI 2024 V: Full-Shape Galaxy Clustering from Galaxies and Quasars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12021v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the measurements and cosmological implications of the galaxy two-point clustering using over 4.7 million unique galaxy and quasar redshifts in the range $0.1&lt;z&lt;2.1$ divided into six redshift bins over a $\sim 7,500$ square degree footprint, from the first year of observations with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI Data Release 1). By fitting the full power spectrum, we extend previous DESI DR1 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements to include redshift-space distortions and signals from the matter-radiation equality scale. For the first time, this Full-Shape analysis is blinded at the catalogue-level to avoid confirmation bias and the systematic errors are accounted for at the two-point clustering level, which automatically propagates them into any cosmological parameter. When analysing the data in terms of compressed model-agnostic variables, we obtain a combined precision of 4.7\% on the amplitude of the redshift space distortion signal reaching similar precision with just one year of DESI data than with 20 years of observation from previous generation surveys. We analyse the data to directly constrain the cosmological parameters within the $\Lambda$CDM model using perturbation theory and combine this information with the reconstructed DESI DR1 galaxy BAO. Using a Big Bang Nucleosynthesis Gaussian prior on the baryon density parameter, and a Gaussian prior on the spectral index, we constrain the matter density is $\Omega_m=0.296\pm 0.010 $ and the Hubble constant $H_0=(68.63 \pm 0.79)[{\rm km\, s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}]$. Additionally, we measure the amplitude of clustering $\sigma_8=0.841 \pm 0.034$. The DESI DR1 results are in agreement with the $\Lambda$CDM model based on general relativity with parameters consistent with those from Planck. The cosmological interpretation of these results in combination with external datasets are presented in a companion paper.</description>

Abstract: The stochastic gravitational-wave background originating from cosmic sources contains vital information about the early universe. In this work, we comprehensively study the cross-correlations between the energy-density anisotropies in scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) and the temperature anisotropies and polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In our analysis of the angular power spectra for these cross-correlations, we consider all contributions of the local-type primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ and $g_{\mathrm{NL}}$ that can lead to large anisotropies. We show that the angular power spectra are highly sensitive to primordial non-Gaussianity. Furthermore, we project the sensitivity of future gravitational-wave detectors to detect such signals and, consequently, measure the primordial non-Gaussianity.</description>

      <title>Constraining Axion Dark Matter with Galactic-Centre Resonant Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the influence of fuzzy-dark-matter cores on the orbits of stars at the Galactic centre. This dark matter candidate condenses into dense, solitonic cores, and, if a super-massive black hole is present at the centre of such a core, its central part forms a `gravitational atom'. Here, we calculate the atom's contribution to the gravitational potential felt by a Galactic-centre star, for a general state of the atom. We study the angular-momentum dynamics this potential induces, and show that it is similar to vector resonant relaxation. Its influence is found to be potentially sufficiently strong that such a dynamical component should be accounted for in Galactic-centre modelling. For the Milky Way, the atom is expected to have some spherical asymmetry, and we use this to derive a stability condition for the disc of young, massive stars at the Galactic centre - if the atom's mass is too large, then the disc would be destroyed. Thus, the existence of this disc constrains the mass of the particles comprising the solitonic core. We study an example model of the core, where all of the rotation of the core's inner region is assumed to come from an $l=1$ state, and its amplitude is determined by the halo's spin parameter; such a core is found to be in tension with the stability of the clockwise stellar disc for $4.2\times 10^{-20}\,\textrm{eV} \leq m_a \leq 5.4\times 10^{-20}\,\textrm{eV}$ at $2\sigma$. Other core models would vary the constrained values of $m_a$ somewhat. These constraints will tighten significantly with future, improved data.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Hubble Constant with a Simulated Full Covariance Matrix Using Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hubble parameter, $H(z)$, plays a crucial role in understanding the expansion history of the universe and constraining the Hubble constant, $\mathrm{H}_0$. The Cosmic Chronometers (CC) method provides an independent approach to measuring $H(z)$, but existing studies either neglect off-diagonal elements in the covariance matrix or use an incomplete covariance matrix, limiting the accuracy of $\mathrm{H}_0$ constraints. To address this, we use a Positive-Definite Covariance Network (PD-CovNet) to simulate the full $33 \times 33$ covariance matrix based on a previously published $15 \times 15$ covariance matrix. Hyperparameters are chosen via leave-one-z-out validation, and performance is benchmarked against a Gaussian-process (GP) baseline. Under identical five-fold cross-validation over redshift groups, we prove that PD-CovNet is a reliable generator of the full covariance compared to the GP baseline. Using this full PD-CovNet-simulated covariance alongside three comparators with different covariance specifications, we constrain $\mathrm{H}_0$ with two independent methods (EMCEE and GP). Across all covariance specifications and both constraint methods, standardized differences and two-sided p-values show no statistically meaningful shift in the central value of the constrained $\mathrm{H}_0$. However, the precision of the constrained $\mathrm{H}_0$ depends on both covariance and method: EMCEE is uniformly more precise than GP once covariance is modeled; within a fixed method, incorporating more covariance reduces precision; and PD-CovNet hyperparameters have a modest effect on uncertainty. These results indicate the importance of accurate covariance modeling in CC-based $\mathrm{H}_0$ constraints.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Impact of LSST $u$-band Survey Strategy on Photometric Redshift Estimation and the Detection of Lyman-break Galaxies</title>

Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will conduct the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), promising to discover billions of galaxies out to redshift 7, using six photometric bands ($ugrizy$) spanning the near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared. The exact number of and quality of information about these galaxies will depend on survey depth in these six bands, which in turn depends on the LSST survey strategy: i.e., how often and how long to expose in each band. $u$-band depth is especially important for photometric redshift (photo-$z$) estimation and for detection of high-redshift Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs). In this paper we use a simulated galaxy catalog and an analytic model for the LBG population to study how recent updates and proposed changes to Rubin's $u$-band throughput and LSST survey strategy impact photo-$z$ accuracy and LBG detection. We find that proposed variations in $u$-band strategy have a small impact on photo-$z$ accuracy for $z &lt; 1.5$ galaxies, but the outlier fraction, scatter, and bias for higher redshift galaxies varies by up to 50%, depending on the survey strategy considered. The number of $u$-band dropout LBGs at $z \sim 3$ is also highly sensitive to the $u$-band depth, varying by up to 500%, while the number of $griz$-band dropouts is only modestly affected. Under the new $u$-band strategy recommended by the Rubin Survey Cadence Optimization Committee, we predict $u$-band dropout number densities of $110$ deg$^{-2}$ (3200 deg$^{-2}$) in year 1 (10) of LSST. We discuss the implications of these results for LSST cosmology.</description>

      <title>Over-Luminous Type Ia Supernovae and Standard Candle Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe\,Ia) serve as crucial cosmological distance indicators because of their empirical consistency in peak luminosity and characteristic light curve decline rates. These properties facilitate them to be standardized candles for the determination of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) within late-time universe cosmology. Nevertheless, a statistically significant difference persists between $H_0$ values derived from early and late-time measurements, a phenomenon known as the Hubble tension. Furthermore, recent observations have identified a subset of over-luminous SNe\,Ia, characterized by peak luminosities exceeding the nominal range and faster decline rates. These discoveries raise questions regarding the reliability of SNe\,Ia as standard candles for measuring cosmological distances. In this article, we present the Bayesian analysis of 15 over-luminous SNe\,Ia and show that they yield a lower $H_0$ estimate due to the increase in their absolute magnitude. This investigation potentially represents a step toward addressing the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the lepton asymmetry from DESI DR2 BAO data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is important to explore the potential existence of lepton asymmetry in the neutrino sector. Conducting a joint analysis of DESI DR2 BAO data and \emph{Planck} 2018 CMB data, we obtain the upper limits on the neutrino degeneracy parameter, i.e., $\xi&lt;0.56$ for the normal mass hierarchy while $\xi&lt;0.62$ for the inverted mass hierarchy, at 95\% confidence level. Considering the influence of the dynamical dark energy, we find that these upper limits remain to be robust. This work may provide helpful implications for model buildings of the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes with mass ratio-modulated initial clustering: merger suppression and projected constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06648v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a modification of the expected local primordial black hole (PBH) count $N(y)$, typically seen in the context of the early PBH binary merger rate as a term in the merger rate suppression. We utilize recent results in small-scale PBH clustering to formulate $N(y)$ in such a way that accounts for variations in the binary mass ratio $q$. We then examine how this change affects the projected constraints on PBH abundance from simulated Einstein Telescope (ET) and LISA mergers. Our results indicate that for broadly extended mass distributions, the merger suppression is greatly reduced for binaries with $q \gg 1$. This leads to an enhanced merger rate for binary distributions favoring a lighter average mass. This change is best reflected by an extension of the low mass end of the constraint windows derived from the resolvable merger channel, although this result is present as well in the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) constraints. Our results imply that the assumption of PBH clustering is testable at abundances and mass ranges much lower than anticipated. Note however that we have only considered the two-body merger channel in this work; a more thorough analysis of our scenario will require a study on the dynamics involved in the three-body merger channel for broad mass distributions, which we leave to future work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that there are no scale-invariant one-loop corrections to the superhorizon tensor perturbations from small-scale (potentially enhanced) scalar perturbations, irrespective of the details of inflationary background time evolution. For this purpose we derive a soft tensor effective field theory at leading order in the gradient expansion by integrating out small-scale scalar fluctuations in a general time-dependent background over the Schwinger-Keldysh contour, i.e., we perform loop calculations in the soft limit of external momentum. The absence of scale-invariant corrections originates from the diffeomorphism invariance of general relativity and is therefore unavoidable.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of the redshifted 21 cm signal from the Dark Ages to parameters of primordial magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the impact of the decaying magnetic turbulence of primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) and ambipolar diffusion on the ionisation and thermal history of the Dark Ages Universe ($30\le z\le300$), and its imprint on the spectral profile of the global signal in the redshifted 21 cm hydrogen line. The heating function caused by decaying magnetic turbulence monotonically decreases after cosmological recombination, its amplitude strongly depends on the strength of the PMFs $B_0$ and weakly depends on the spectral index of the initial power spectrum of PMFs $n_{\rm B}$. The heating function caused by ambipolar diffusion, in contrast, noticeably depends on the spectral index in the range $-3\lesssim n_{\rm B}\lesssim4$, but is subdominant in the Dark Ages epoch for PMF models with $B_0\lesssim0.5$ nG. We computed the ionisation and thermal history of intergalactic gas from the cosmological recombination up to the end of the Dark Ages epoch for a range of PMF parameters, $0.05\lesssim B_0\lesssim0.5$ nG, $-2.9\lesssim n_{\rm B}\lesssim4$ and show the essentially distinguished thermal evolution from one in the $\Lambda$CDM model. We also show that the profile of the redshifted 21 cm hydrogen line is very sensitive to the PMF parameters from this range and can be used for their constraints in conjunction with other observational data.</description>

      <title>A theoretical prediction for the dipole in nearby distances using cosmography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmography is a widely applied method to infer kinematics of the Universe at small cosmological scales while remaining agnostic about the theory of gravity at play. Usually cosmologists invoke the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric in cosmographic analyses, however generalised approaches allow for analyses outside of any assumed geometrical model. These methods have great promise to be able to model-independently map the cosmic neighborhood where the Universe has not yet converged to isotropy. In this regime, anisotropies can bias parameter inferences if they are not accounted for, and thus must be included for precision cosmology analyses, even when the principle aim is to infer the background cosmology. In this paper, we develop a method to predict the dipole in luminosity distances that arises due to nearby inhomogeneities. This is the leading-order correction to the standard isotropic distance-redshift law. Within a very broad class of general-relativistic universe models, we provide an interpretation of the dipole in terms of the gradients in expansion rate and density which is free from any underlying background cosmology. We use numerical relativity simulations, with improved initial data methods, alongside fully relativistic ray tracing to test the power of our prediction. We find our prediction accurately captures the dipole signature in our simulations to within ~10% for redshifts $z\lesssim 0.07$ in reasonably smooth simulations. In the presence of more non-linear density fields, we find this reduces to $z\lesssim 0.02$. This represents up to an order of magnitude improvement with respect to what is achieved by naive, local cosmography-based predictions. Our paper thus addresses important issues regarding convergence properties of anisotropic cosmographic series expansions that would otherwise limit their applicability to very narrow redshift ranges.</description>

      <title>Testing signatures of phantom crossing through full-shape galaxy clustering analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, when combined with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae (SNIa), provide compelling evidence for a phantom crossing at late times, along with statistically significant deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In this work, we investigate the role of redshift-space galaxy clustering data by employing the pre-reconstruction full-shape (FS) galaxy power spectrum from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) data release 12 (DR12) sample. This dataset is analyzed in combination with BAO measurements from DESI data release 2 (DR2) and various SNIa samples. Our analysis demonstrates that the joint combination of these datasets can yield deviations from $\Lambda$CDM at a significance level of up to $\sim 5\sigma$, suggesting strong indications that the dark energy equation of state parameter $w(z)$ may have crossed the phantom divide ($w = -1$) in the redshift range $z \sim 0.4$-$0.5$. The precise location and strength of this crossing depend on the adopted theoretical parameterizations. Importantly, our results reveal that this trend persists even in the absence of CMB data, underscoring the robustness of the FS power spectrum as a powerful and independent probe for testing dark energy models and for distinguishing between competing cosmological scenarios.</description>

      <title>Analytic Model for Scattered Ly$\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ Emission in the Post-reionization Intergalactic Medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ly$\alpha$ intensity mapping is emerging as a new probe of faint galaxies consisting the cosmic web that elude traditional surveys. However, the resonant nature of Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer complicates the interpretation of observed data. In this study, we develop a fast and accurate analytic prescription for computing the Ly$\alpha$ intensity field on Mpc scales in the post-reionization Universe. Motivated by insights from Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) experiments, we exploit the fact that in a highly ionized intergalactic medium (IGM) with negligible damping-wing opacity, cosmological redshifting quickly drives Ly$\alpha$ photons out of resonance, terminating the scattering process and simplifying their large-scale behavior. Photons emitted blueward of the Ly$\alpha$ line center tend to scatter on a thin, nearly spherical surface of last scattering, with a radius determined by the redshifting distance to resonance. Based on this behavior, we derive closed-form expressions for the scattered emissivity and projected surface brightness that depend only on the source spectrum, the HI density, and the peculiar velocity field. When applied to a source in a realistically simulated IGM at $z = 3$, our model shows mild discrepancies with MCRT results within a physical Mpc of the host halo, where strong gravitational infall redistributes the scattered photons, but achieves better than 5% accuracy beyond that distance in angle-averaged radial surface brightness profile. Our prescription offers a computationally efficient alternative to MCRT for forward-modeling Ly$\alpha$ intensity maps from cosmological simulations, enabling the inference of underlying cosmological and astrophysical parameters from future observations</description>

      <title>Precise Measurement of the Absolute Sky Brightness at 60 to 350 MHz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise measurement of the sky radio brightness below 1 GHz and estimation of any unaccounted-for extragalactic brightness is required to understand the Galactic cosmic ray electron spectrum, to constrain populations of nanojansky radio sources, and to constrain dark matter annihilation or decay. The foreground radio brightness must also be accurately accounted for when measuring the cosmic background radiation and departures from its Planck spectrum that trace astrophysical processes in the early Universe, cosmic dark ages, cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionisation. Here we report a new, precision measurement of the sky spectral brightness over radio frequencies from 60 MHz to 350 MHz. Our measurement motivates a significant correction to previous all-sky images made in this band and the Global Sky Model (GSM) that is constructed from these and other sky images made at radio wavelengths. We find that the GSM requires subtraction of an offset exceeding 100K below 100 MHz and scaling up by a factor of approximately 1.2 below 200 MHz rising to a factor of 1.5 at 350 MHz, thus significantly enhancing previous estimates of unaccounted excess in radio sky brightness. Our measurements were made with a new receiver architecture that dynamically self-calibrates for receiver noise and bandpass in situ, while connected to an antenna. We used a single, accurately modelled, wideband logperiodic antenna placed on a 40m diameter ground mesh. Our accurate measurement requires upward revision of sky brightness and motivates revisiting models for source populations and dark matter decay. Additionally, sky models scaled to our measurements serve as a stable reference in calibrating the absolute flux density scale for low-frequency radio telescopes. This will be important for calibration accuracy of the SKA-Low telescope, that will operate at the frequencies of our measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a two-field model where the inflaton $\chi$ is non-minimally coupled to the instanton $\phi$. By choosing an appropriate coupling function, we realize the scenario where the difference of the values of potential between false vacuum (FV) and true vacuum (TV) is maximized during inflation. Most of the bubbles are created at this time. After inflation ends, the potential value of FV drops below that of TV so that these bubbles collapse to form primordial black holes (PBHs). By tuning the parameters of our model, we analyze the Coleman-de Luccia (CDL) and Hawking-Moss (HM) process, finding that the corresponding mass function of PBHs is sharply peaked, implying that we can realize either PBHs as cold dark matter, sub-solar PBHs, or supermassive PBHs in this scenario without enhancement of primordial curvature perturbations.</description>

      <title>Systematics mitigation for catalogue-based angular power spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has developed a formalism for computing angular power spectra directly from catalogues containing field values at discrete positions on the sky, thereby circumventing the need to create pixelised maps of the fields, as well as avoiding aliasing and finite-resolution effects. We adapt this formalism to incorporate template deprojection for mitigating systematic biases in the measured angular power spectra. We also introduce an alternative method of mitigating the `deprojection bias' - the loss of modes induced by deprojection - employing simple simulations to compute a transfer function. We find that this approach performs at least as well as existing methods, and is relatively insensitive to how well one can guess the true power spectrum of the observed field, except at the largest scales ($\ell \lesssim 3$). Additionally, we develop exact expressions for the bias introduced by deprojection in the shot-noise component, which further improves the accuracy of this approach. We test our formalism on simulated datasets, demonstrating its applicability both to discretely sampled fields, and to the special case of galaxy clustering, with the survey selection function defined in terms of a random catalogue or as a continuous sky map. After removing the bias in the shot noise and correcting for the remaining mode loss using a transfer function, our formalism produces unbiased measurements of the angular power spectrum in all scenarios tested here. Finally, we apply our formalism to real data and show it produces results consistent with the standard map-based pseudo-$C_\ell$ formalism. We implement our method in the public code NaMaster.</description>

      <title>Where Galaxies Point: First Measurement of the Large-Scale Axial Intrinsic Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Applying a new estimator to the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y3 weak lensing shape catalog, we map the galaxies' orientation field and report the first detection of a large-scale axial intrinsic alignment (LAIA) on dipolar angular scales. Ellipticals' semi-major axes and spirals' semi-minor axes coherently point toward a common direction, (RA,Dec)=$(306^{+6}_{-4},52^{+3}_{-3})^\circ$ and $(296^{+10}_{-18},50^{+6}_{-2})^\circ$, respectively, with amplitudes in the expected tidal-torquing hierarchy. This pattern could be produced by a horizon-scale tidal field imprinted by primordial inhomogeneities during galaxy assembly and, if confirmed, would signal a statistically significant preferred direction in the Universe, thereby probing deviations from statistical isotropy. The signal persists across spatial and redshift splits and is difficult to attribute to survey systematics. LAIA offers a new sky-wide compass linking galaxy evolution and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Dark Energy Constraint from Strongly Lensed AGN at LSST-Scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strongly lensed Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) with an observable time delay can be used to constrain the expansion history of the Universe through time-delay cosmography (TDC). As the sample of time-delay lenses grows to statistical size, with $\mathcal{O}$(1000) lensed AGN forecast to be observed by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), there is an emerging opportunity to use TDC as an independent probe of dark energy. To take advantage of this statistical sample, we implement a scalable hierarchical inference tool which computes the cosmological likelihood for hundreds of strong lenses simultaneously. With this new technique, we investigate the cosmological constraining power from a simulation of the full LSST sample. We start from individual lenses, and emulate the full joint hierarchical TDC analysis, including image-based modeling, time-delay measurement, velocity dispersion measurement, and external convergence prediction. We fully account for the mass-sheet and mass-anisotropy degeneracies. We assume a sample of 800 lenses, with varying levels of follow-up fidelity based on existing campaigns. With our baseline assumptions, within a flexible $w_0w_a$CDM cosmology, we simultaneously forecast a $\sim$2.5% constraint on H0 and a dark energy figure of merit (DE FOM) of 6.7. We show that by expanding the sample from 50 lenses to include an additional 750 lenses with plausible LSST time-delay measurements, we improve the forecasted DE FOM by nearly a factor of 3, demonstrating the value of incorporating this portion of the sample. We also investigate different follow-up campaign strategies, and find significant improvements in the DE FOM with additional stellar kinematics measurements and higher-precision time-delay measurements. We also demonstrate how the redshift configuration of time-delay lenses impacts constraining power in $w_0w_a$CDM.</description>

Abstract: Dark matter heating in planets has been proposed as a potential probe for dark matter detection. Assuming near-equilibrium conditions, we find that the energy input from dark matter raises planetary temperatures and accelerates rotation. The distribution of energy between heating and rotational acceleration depends on both planetary properties and external inputs, suggesting that previous studies may have overestimated the heating contribution. At high dark matter densities, planetary rotation stabilizes earlier and becomes primarily governed by dark matter effects.</description>

      <title>Diverse reddening distributions in sight lines to type Ia supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22216v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise cosmological constraints from type Ia supernovae require adequately accurate corrections for host-galaxy extinction. Modelling these corrections is challenged by the problem of disentangling supernova intrinsic colours from host-galaxy interstellar reddening. The latter is commonly modelled in a probabilistic way assuming an exponential distribution exp(-E(B-V)/\tau) as a universal prior which is applied across all types of supernova host galaxies. We test the robustness of the exponential model and its universality against predictions based on simulating dust and type Ia supernova distributions in host galaxies of different morphological types. We find substantial differences between predicted interstellar reddening in late- and early-type host galaxies, primarily driven by the stellar-to-dust mass ratios. The mean simulated reddening in late-type galaxies matches well those derived from type Ia supernova observations, but it is significantly lower for early-type host galaxies. The reddening distributions exhibit an excess of sight lines with vanishing reddening with respect to the exponential model, although the difference is quite mild for late-type galaxies. On the other hand, the distribution may peak at E(B-V)&gt;0 when considering a population of young type Ia supernovae originating from lower heights within the dust disc. We demonstrate that assuming a universal reddening prior distribution for modeling peak magnitude-colour relation, which is currently a common practice, gives rise to a spurious scatter in the derived extinction properties. It may also bias relative distances between supernovae originating from different host-galaxy populations. The discrepancy between the simulated reddening in average early-type host galaxies and the observed occurrence of reddened supernovae suggests that reddening does not originate from interstellar dust expected in these galaxies.</description>

      <title>A black hole in a near-pristine galaxy 700 million years after the Big Bang</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22567v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of a large number of massive black holes within the first two billion years after the Big Bang, as well as their peculiar properties, have been largely unexpected based on the extrapolation of the properties of luminous quasars. These findings have prompted the development of several theoretical models for the early formation and growth of black holes, which are, however, difficult to differentiate. We report the metallicity measurement around a gravitationally lensed massive black hole at redshift 7.04 (classified as a Little Red Dot), hosted in a galaxy with very low dynamical mass. The weakness of the [OIII]5007 emission line relative to the narrow H$\beta$ emission indicates extremely low metallicity, about $4\times 10^{-2}$ solar, and even more metal poor in the surrounding few 100 pc. We argue that such properties cannot be uncommon among accreting black holes around this early cosmic epoch. Explaining such a low chemical enrichment in a system that has developed a massive black hole is challenging for most theories. Models assuming heavy black hole seeds (such as Direct Collapse Black Holes) or super-Eddington accretion scenarios struggle to explain the observations, although they can potentially reproduce the observed properties in some cases. Models invoking "primordial black holes" (i.e. putative black holes formed shortly after the Big Bang) may potentially explain the low chemical enrichment associated with this black hole, although this class of models also requires further developments for proper testing.</description>

      <title>The Pandora project. II: how non-thermal physics drives bursty star formation and temperate mass-loaded outflows in dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies provide powerful laboratories for studying galaxy formation physics. Their early assembly, shallow gravitational potentials, and bursty, clustered star formation histories make them especially sensitive to the processes that regulate baryons through multi-phase outflows. Using high-resolution, cosmological zoom-in simulations of a dwarf galaxy from \textit{the Pandora suite}, we explore the impact of stellar radiation, magnetic fields, and cosmic ray feedback on star formation, outflows, and metal retention. We find that our purely hydrodynamical model without non-thermal physics - in which supernova feedback is boosted to reproduce realistic stellar mass assembly - drives violent, overly enriched outflows that suppress the metal content of the host galaxy. Including radiation reduces the clustering of star formation and weakens feedback. However, the additional incorporation of cosmic rays produces fast, mass-loaded, multi-phase outflows consisting of both ionized and neutral gas components, in better agreement with observations. These outflows, which entrain a denser, more temperate ISM, exhibit broad metallicity distributions while preserving metals within the galaxy. Furthermore, the star formation history becomes more bursty, in agreement with recent JWST findings. These results highlight the essential role of non-thermal physics in galaxy evolution and the need to incorporate it in future galaxy formation models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration has reported a scalar spectral index $ n_s~=~0.9743~\pm~0.0034 $. This is substantially larger than the classical prediction of non-minimally coupled inflation models such as Higgs Inflation, $n_s \approx 0.965$. Here we revisit the unitarity-conserving non-minimally coupled inflation model proposed in [1]. We show that when the inflaton is a complex non-minimally coupled gauge singlet scalar with additional interactions in the Jordan frame to maintain unitarity, the model predicts $n_s = 0.9730$ and $r \approx 9 \times 10^{-6}$ for scalar self-coupling $\lambda = 0.1$.</description>

      <title>Ring formation from black hole superradiance through repeated particle production on bound orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosonic fields around a rotating black hole can extract energy and angular momentum through the superradiant instability and form a dense cloud. We investigate the scenario involving two scalar fields, $\phi$ and $\chi$, with a coupling term $\frac{1}{2}\lambda\phi\chi^2$, which is motivated by the multiple-axion framework. The ultralight scalar $\phi$ forms a cloud that efficiently produces $\chi$ particles nonperturbatively via parametric resonance, with a large mass hierarchy, $\mu_\chi \gg \mu_\phi$. Rather than escaping the system as investigated by previous studies, these $\chi$ particles remain bound, orbiting the black hole. Moreover, the particle production occurs primarily at the peak of the cloud's profile, allowing $\chi$ particles in quasicircular orbits to pass repeatedly through resonant regions, leading to cumulative amplification. This selective process naturally forms a dense ring of $\chi$ particles, with a mass ratio to the cloud fixed by $(\mu_\phi/\mu_\chi)^2$. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism for generating bound-state particles via parametric resonance, which also impacts the evolution of the cloud. This process can be probed through its imprint on binary dynamics and its gravitational-wave signatures.</description>

      <title>20 GeV halo-like excess of the Galactic diffuse emission and implications for dark matter annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07209v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fifteen years of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data in the halo region of the Milky Way (MW) are analyzed to search for gamma rays from dark matter annihilation. Gamma-ray maps within the region of interest ($|l| \le 60^\circ$, $10^\circ \le |b| \le 60^\circ$) are modeled using point sources, the GALPROP models of cosmic-ray interactions, isotropic background, and templates of Loop I and the Fermi bubbles, and then the presence of a halo-like component is further examined. A statistically significant halo-like excess is found with a spectral peak around 20 GeV, while its flux is consistent with zero below 2 GeV and above 200 GeV. Examination of the fit residual maps indicates that a spherically symmetric halo component fits the map data well. The radial profile agrees with annihilation by the smooth NFW density profile, and may be slightly shallower than this, especially in the central region. Various systematic uncertainties are investigated, but the 20 GeV peak remains significant. In particular, the halo excess with a similar spectrum is detected even relative to the LAT standard background model, which contains non-template patches adjusted to match the observed map. The halo excess spectrum can be fitted by annihilation with a particle mass $m_\chi \sim$ 0.5-0.8 TeV and cross section $\langle \sigma \upsilon \rangle \sim$ (5-8)$\times 10^{-25} \ \rm cm^3 \, s^{-1}$ for the $b\bar{b}$ channel. This cross section is larger than the upper limits from dwarf galaxies and the canonical thermal relic value, but considering various uncertainties, especially the density profile of the MW halo, the dark matter interpretation of the 20 GeV ``Fermi halo'' remains feasible. The prospects for verification through future observations are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Generation of axions and axion-like particles through mass parametric resonance induced by scalar perturbations in the early universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles can be generated in the early universe through mechanisms such as misalignment production, thermal processes, and the decay of topological defects. In this study, we show that scalar perturbations in the early universe can produce a significant amount of these particles primarily through mass parametric resonance effects. Scalar perturbations induce temperature fluctuations during the particle mass transition era, e.g., during the QCD phase transition. These temperature fluctuations modulate the particle mass, transferring energy into the field through parametric mass resonance, a nonlinear process. This mechanism exhibits substantially unstable regions that could lead to explosive particle production. Notably, it does not generate additional isocurvature perturbations.</description>

Abstract: Galaxy mergers are among the most energetic astrophysical phenomena, driving intense star formation and potentially fueling cosmic ray acceleration, which can produce high energy $\gamma$-ray emission through hadronic processes. We present a targeted search for $\gamma$-ray emission from five prominent galaxy merger systems, NGC~3256, NGC~660, UGC~813/816, UGC~12914/12915, and VV~114 using 16.9 years of Fermi-LAT data in the 1--300~GeV energy range. Employing a binned maximum likelihood analysis, we model the emission with power-law spectra and derive spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to constrain $\gamma$-ray fluxes and spectral indices. Marginal detections are found for NGC~3256 (TS = 15.4, $\sim$3.51$\sigma$) and NGC~660 (TS = 8.16, $\sim$2.39$\sigma$), with photon fluxes of $(7.21 \pm 3.17) \times 10^{-11}$ and $(8.28 \pm 3.56) \times 10^{-11}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively, suggesting merger driven star formation contributes to $\gamma$-ray emission. The remaining systems yield non-detections (TS $&lt; 5$). This is the first targeted study of $\gamma$-ray emission from these aforementioned galaxy merger systems.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic Dance: Observational Detection of Coherent Spin in Galaxy Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin of galaxy clusters encodes key information about their formation, dynamics, and the influence of large-scale structure. However, whether clusters possess statistically significant spin and how to measure it observationally remain open questions. Here, we present the first observational, statistical detection of coherent spin in galaxy clusters, using two samples of 2,170 and 1,329 systems with $M &gt; 10^{14}\,M_\odot$, selected from two publicly available group catalogs (\citet{2017A&amp;A...602A.100T} and \citet{2012ApJ...752...41Y}) constructed with two different algorithms and but both based primarily on SDSS galaxies. Cluster spin is quantified by identifying the orientation in the projected plane that maximizes the redshift difference ($\Delta Z_{\rm max}$) between member galaxies in two regions divided by a trial axis. We find compelling statistical evidence for coherent rotation, as the observed $\Delta Z_{\rm max}$ distribution departs markedly from the randomized controls, exhibiting pronounced deviations near $380\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. Stacked visualizations confirm the spatial segregation of redshifted and blueshifted galaxies across the rotation axis. The radial profile of the rotational velocity indicates that it increases as a function of radius. The cluster rotation speed increases with mass, from $\sim360~\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ at $10^{14} M_\odot$ to $\sim693~\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ at $10^{15} M_\odot$. Additionally, cluster spin tends to align parallel with the central galaxy spin and perpendicular to the nearest cosmic filament, particularly in richer systems. These results reveal significant coherent spin in galaxy clusters, shaped by both internal dynamics and large-scale structure.</description>

      <title>Machine learning classification of black holes in the mass--spin diagram</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14316v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the mass--spin diagram for classifying black holes and studying their formation pathways providing an analogue to the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. This allows for black hole evolutionary tracks as a function of redshift, combining formation, accretion, and merger histories for the variety of black hole populations. A realistic black hole continuum constructed from initial mass and spin functions and approximate redshift evolution reveals possible black hole main sequences, such as sustained coherent accretion through cosmic time or hierarchical merger trees. In the stellar-mass regime, we use a binary population synthesis software to compare three spin prescriptions for tidal evolution of Wolf-Rayet progenitors, showing how the mass--spin diagram exposes interesting modeling differences. We then classify black hole populations by applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning clustering methods to mass--spin datasets. While bare unsupervised clustering can nearly recover canonical population boundaries (stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive), a more sophisticated approach utilizing deep learning via variational autoencoders for latent space representation learning aids in clustering of realistic datasets with subclasses that highly overlap in mass--spin space. We find that a supervised random forest can accurately recover the correct clusters from the learned latent space representation depending on the complexity of the underlying dataset, semi-supervised methods show potential for further development, and the performance of unsupervised classifiers is a great challenge. Our findings motivate future machine learning applications and demonstrate that the mass--spin diagram can be used to connect gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations with theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Bouncing Cosmologies in modified gravity with space time torsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of realizing a non-singular bounce in the early universe within the framework of modified gravity with spacetime torsion. In Einstein Cartan theory, torsion is embedded in the spacetime by adding an antisymmetric part in affine connection . We consider generalized version of the framework as $f(\bar{R})$, $\bar{R}$ being the scalar of the modified curvature tensor. $f(\bar{R})$ gravity is recast in Einstein frame as non-minimally coupled scalar tensor theory where the scalar field gets coupled with a rank 2 antisymmetric torsion field through derivative couplings. We investigate whether the introduction of three additional torsion-dependent terms in Einstein frame help to realize a bounce. We first explore this cosmological system in the background of a homogeneous and isotropic FRW spacetime but inclusion of the torsion terms are insufficient to produce a bounce in this symmetric setting. Motivated by this limitation, we relax the symmetry and generalize the background to include inhomogeneity and anisotropy. In this setup, the dynamics is modified in such a way that a bouncing solution is possible without invoking phantom fields or energy condition violations. We have found the exact solutions of all the fields and reconstructed the modified gravity form. We have addressed the behaviour of the fields under perturbation and investigated the stability of the solutions. Constraints on the model parameters have also been derived based on cosmological observations.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel equivalence between scale-dependent gravity and scalar-tensor theories that have only a single scalar field with a canonical kinetic term in the Einstein frame and a conformal coupling to the metric tensor. In particular, we show that the set of well-behaved scale-dependent gravity theories can be fully embedded into scalar-tensor theories in a unique way. Conversely, there are multiple ways to write a scalar-tensor theory as a scale-dependent theory. This equivalence is established both on the level of the actions and on the level of field equations. We find that, in the context of this equivalence, the scale-setting relation $k(x)$ is naturally promoted to a dynamical field, which is made manifest by including a corresponding kinetic term in the scale-dependent action. In addition, we demonstrate that the new equivalence fits well into the framework of existing equivalences involving the aforementioned theories and $f(R)$-gravity. Finally, we apply the equivalence relations to explicit examples from both scale-dependent gravity and scalar-tensor theories.</description>
