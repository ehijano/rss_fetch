      <title>Legendre transforms for type $A_{n}$ and $B_{n}$ $\vee$-systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde (WDVV) equations have a rich structure related to the theory of Frobenius manifolds, with many known families of solutions. A Legendre transformation is a symmetry of the WDVV equations, introduced by Dubrovin. We explicitly compute the results of a Legendre transformation applied to $A_n$- and $B_n$-type multi-parameter rational solutions, relating them to known and new trigonometric solutions.</description>

      <title>Abstract semiclassical analysis of the van Hove model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the semiclassical limit $\hslash\to 0$ of a completely solvable model in quantum field theory: the van Hove model, describing a scalar field created and annihilated by an immovable source. Despite its simplicity, the van Hove model possesses many characterizing features of quantum fields, especially in the infrared region. In particular, the existence of non-Fock ground and equilibrium states in the presence of infrared singular sources makes a representation-independent algebraic approach of utmost importance. We make use of recent representation-independent techniques of infinite dimensional semiclassical analysis to establish the Bohr correspondence principle for the dynamics, equilibrium states, and long-time asymptotics in the van Hove model.</description>

      <title>On crystallization in the plane for pair potentials with an arbitrary norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate two-dimensional crystallization phenomena, i.e. minimality of a lattice's patch for interaction energies, with pair potentials of type $(x,y)\mapsto V(\|x-y\|)$ where $\|\cdot\|$ is an arbitrary norm on $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $V:\mathbb{R}_+^*\to \mathbb{R}$ is a function. For the Heitmann-Radin sticky disk potential $V=V_{\text{HR}}$, we prove, using Brass' key result from [Computational Geometry, 6:195--214, 1996], that crystallization occurs for any fixed norm, with a classification of minimizers and minimal energies according to the kissing number associated to $\|\cdot\|$. The minimizer is proved to be, up to affine transform, a patch of the triangular or the square lattice, which shows how to easily get anisotropy in a crystallization phenomenon. We apply this result to the $p$-norms $\|\cdot\|_p$, $p\geq 1$, which allows us to construct an explicit family of norms for which crystallization holds on any given lattice. We also solve part of a crystallization problem studied in [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 240:987--1053] where points are constrained to be on $\mathbb{Z}^2$. Moreover, we numerically investigate the minimization problem for the energy per point among lattices for the Lennard-Jones potential $V=V_{\text{LJ}}:r\mapsto r^{-12}-2r^{-6}$ as well as the Epstein zeta function associated to a $p$-norm $\|\cdot\|_p$, i.e. when $V=V_s:r\mapsto r^{-s}$, $s&gt;2$. Our simulations show a new and unexpected phase transition for the minimizers with respect to $p$.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analyses of the Type D ASEP: Stochastic Fusion and Crystal Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Type D asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) is a particle system involving two classes of particles that can be viewed from both a probabilistic and an algebraic perspective (arXiv:2011.13473). From a probabilistic perspective, we perform stochastic fusion on the Type D ASEP and analyze the outcome on generator matrices, limits of drift speed, stationary distributions, and Markov self-duality. From an algebraic perspective, we construct a fused Type D ASEP system from a Casimir element of $U_q(so_6)$, using crystal bases to analyze and manipulate various representations of $U_q(so_6)$. We conclude that both approaches produce different processes and therefore the previous method of arXiv:1908.02359, which analyzed the usual ASEP, does not generalize to all finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study plasmonic time crystals, which constitute an extension of the dielectric-based photonic time crystals to plasmonic media. A salient feature of plasmonic time crystals is their ability to support amplification of both longitudinal and transverse modes. In particular, we show that such systems support collective resonances of longitudinal modes, independently of the wave vector $k$. These resonances originate from the interaction between the positive and negative frequency branches of the plasmonic dispersion relation of the unmodulated system, and from the divergence of the density of states near the plasma frequency $\omega_p$. The strongest resonance occurs at a modulation frequency of $\Omega = 2 \omega_p$, associated with a direct inter-band transition. Higher-order resonances are associated with related mechanisms but at lower modulation frequencies. We demonstrate these resonances for various periodic modulation profiles, and also provide a generic perturbative formula for resonance widths in the limit of weak modulation amplitude, in the absence of losses. Our findings offer insights into using time-modulated plasmonic media to enhance optical gain.</description>

      <title>Wormhole Renormalization: The gravitational path integral, holography, and a gauge group for topology change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Factorization Paradox from the bottom up by adapting methods from perturbative renormalization. Just as quantum field theories are plagued with loop divergences that need to be cancelled systematically by introducing counterterms, gravitational path integrals are plagued by wormhole contributions that spoil the factorization of the holographic dual. These wormholes must be cancelled by some stringy effects in a UV complete, holographic theory of quantum gravity. In a simple model of two-dimensional topological gravity, we outline a gravitational analog of the recursive BPHZ procedure in order to systematically introduce ``counter-wormholes" which parametrize the unknown stringy effects that lead to factorization. Underlying this procedure is a Hopf algebra of symmetries which is analogous to the Connes--Kreimer Hopf algebra underlying perturbative renormalization. The group dual to this Hopf algebra acts to reorganize contributions from spacetimes with distinct topology, and can be seen as a gauge group relating various equivalent ways of constructing a factorizing gravitational path integral.</description>

      <title>Optimal Algorithms for Quantifying Spectral Size with Applications to Quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce computational strategies for measuring the ``size'' of the spectrum of bounded self-adjoint operators using various metrics such as the Lebesgue measure, fractal dimensions, the number of connected components (or gaps), and other spectral characteristics. Our motivation comes from the study of almost-periodic operators, particularly those that arise as models of quasicrystals. Such operators are known for intricate hierarchical patterns and often display delicate spectral properties, such as Cantor spectra, which are significant in studying quantum mechanical systems and materials science. We propose a series of algorithms that compute these properties under different assumptions and explore their theoretical implications through the Solvability Complexity Index (SCI) hierarchy. This approach provides a rigorous framework for understanding the computational feasibility of these problems, proving algorithmic optimality, and enhancing the precision of spectral analysis in practical settings. For example, we show that our methods are optimal by proving certain lower bounds (impossibility results) for the class of limit-periodic Schr\"odinger operators. We demonstrate our methods through state-of-the-art computations for aperiodic systems in one and two dimensions, effectively capturing these complex spectral characteristics. The results contribute significantly to connecting theoretical and computational aspects of spectral theory, offering insights that bridge the gap between abstract mathematical concepts and their practical applications in physical sciences and engineering. Based on our work, we conclude with conjectures and open problems regarding the spectral properties of specific models.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Grassmannian Sigma Models in Gross-Neveu Formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the classical aspects of $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ supersymmetric sigma models with Hermitian symmetric target spaces, using the so-called Gross-Neveu (first-order GLSM) formalism. We reformulate these models for complex Grassmannians in terms of simple supersymmetric Lagrangians with polynomial interactions. For maximal isotropic Grassmannians we propose two types of equivalent Lagrangians, which make either supersymmetry or the geometry of target space manifest. These reformulations can be seen as current-current deformations of curved $\beta \gamma$ systems. The $\mathsf{CP}^{1}$ supersymmetric sigma model is our prototypical example.</description>

      <title>Approximating electromagnetic fields in discontinuous media using a single physics-informed neural network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a new family of numerical methods, based on deep learning, for modeling boundary value problems. They offer an advantage over traditional numerical methods for high-dimensional, parametric, and data-driven problems. However, they perform poorly on problems where the solution exhibits high frequencies, such as discontinuities or sharp gradients. In this work, we develop a PINN-based solver for modeling three-dimensional, transient and static, parametric electromagnetic problems in discontinuous media. We use the first-order Maxwell's equations to train the neural network. We use a level-set function to represent the interface with a continuous function, and to enrich the network's inputs with high-frequencies and interface information. Finally, we validate the proposed methodology on multiple 3D, parametric, static, and transient problems.</description>

      <title>Orthodiagonal Maps, Tilings of Rectangles, and their Convergence to Conformal Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classic result of Brooks, Smith, Stone and Tutte \cite{BSST40} associates to any finite planar network with distinguished source and sink vertices, a tiling of a rectangle by smaller subrectangles whose aspect ratios are given by the conductances of corresponding edges in the network. This tiling can be viewed as a discrete analogue of the uniformizing conformal map that maps a simply connected domain with four distinguished prime ends to a rectangle, so that the four prime ends are mapped to the four corners of the rectangle. We make this intuition precise by showing that if $\Omega$ is a simply connected domain with four distinguished prime ends $A,B,C,D$ in counterclockwise order and $(\Omega_{n})_{n\geq{1}}$ is a sequence of orthodiagonal maps with distinguished boundary vertices $A_{n}, B_{n}, C_{n}, D_{n}$ in counterclockwise order, that are finer and finer approximations of $\Omega$ with its distinguished boundary points $A,B,C,D$, then the corresponding "rectangle tiling maps" converge uniformly on compacts to the aforementioned conformal map on $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of a 2x2 Keyfitz-Kranzer Type Balance System with Varying Generalized Chaplygin Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of two balance laws of Keyfitz-Kranzer type with varying generalized Chaplygin gas, which exhibits negative pressure and is a product of a function of time and the inverse of a power of the density. The Chaplygin gas is a fluid designed to accommodate measurements for the early universe and late-time universal expansion while obeying the pressure-density-time relation. We produce an explanation and description of the non-self-similar Riemann solutions, including the non-classical singular solutions. We also find that due to a direct dependence on time, a change in the regions allowing for combinations of classical and non-classical singular solutions occurs, therefore a Riemann solution can have different solutions over several time intervals. Our findings are confirmed numerically using the local Lax-Friederichs scheme.</description>

      <title>2D Skyrmion topological charge of spin textures with arbitrary boundary conditions: a two-component spinorial BEC as a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the most general expression for the Skyrmion topological charge for a two-dimensional spin texture, valid for any type of boundary conditions or for any arbitrary spatial region within the texture. It reduces to the usual one $Q = 1/4\pi \iint \vec f \cdot \left(\partial_x \vec f \times \partial_y \vec f\right)$ for the appropriate boundary conditions, with $\vec f$ the spin texture. The general expression resembles the Gauss-Bonet theorem for the Euler-Poincar\'e characteristic of a 2D surface, but it has definite differences, responsible for the assignment of the proper signs of the Skyrmion charges. Additionally, we show that the charge of a single Skyrmion is the product of the value of the normal component of the spin texture at the singularity times the Index or winding number of the transverse texture, a generalization of a Poincar\'e theorem. We illustrate our general results analyzing in detail a two-component spinor Bose-Einstein condensate in 2D in the presence of an external magnetic field, via the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The condensate spin textures present Skyrmions singularities at the spatial locations where the transverse magnetic field vanishes. We show that the ensuing superfluid vortices and Skyrmions have the same value for their corresponding topological charges, in turn due to the structure of the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Generating new gravitational solutions by matrix multiplication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.01702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explicit solutions to the non-linear field equations of some gravitational theories can be obtained, by means of a Riemann-Hilbert approach, from a canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation of certain matrix functions called monodromy matrices. In this paper we describe other types of factorisation from which solutions can be constructed in a similar way. Our approach is based on an invariance problem, which does not constitute a Riemann-Hilbert problem and allows to construct solutions that could not have been obtained by Wiener-Hopf factorisation of a monodromy matrix. It gives rise to a novel solution generating method based on matrix multiplications. We show, in particular, that new solutions can be obtained by multiplicative deformation of the canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation, provided the latter exists, and that one can superpose such solutions. Examples of applications include Kasner, Einstein-Rosen wave and gravitational pulse wave solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.00320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a recent conjecture of Borot et al. that a particular universal closed algebraic formula recovers the correlation differentials of topological recursion after the swap of $x$ and $y$ in the input data. We also show that this universal formula can be drastically simplified (as it was already done by Hock).
  As an application of this general $x-y$ swap result, we prove an explicit closed formula for the topological recursion differentials for the case of any spectral curve with unramified $y$ and arbitrary rational $x$.</description>

      <title>Analyticity for locally stable hard-core gases via recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In their recent works [Comm. Math. Phys. 399:1 (2023)] and [arXiv:2109.01094], Michelen and Perkins proved that the pressure of a system of particles with repulsive pair interactions is analytic for activities up to $e\Delta_{\phi}(\beta)^{-1}$, where $\Delta_{\phi}(\beta)\in(0,C_{\phi}(\beta)]$ is a constant they called the potential-weighted connective constant. This paper extends their method to locally stable, tempered, and hard-core pair potentials. Our main result is that the pressure of such a system is analytic for activities up to $e^{2-2W(eA_{\phi}(\beta)/\Delta_{\phi}(\beta))}\Delta_{\phi}(\beta)^{-1}e^{-(\beta C+1)}$, where $C\ge0$ is the local stability constant, $W(\cdot)$ the Lambert $W$-function, $A_{\phi}(\beta)$ the contribution from the attraction in the pair potential to the temperedness constant, and $\Delta_{\phi}(\beta)\in[A_{\phi}(\beta),C_{\phi}(\beta)]$ a counterpart of the constant defined by Michelen and Perkins. The main ingredients in the proof include a recursive identity for the one-point density tailored to locally stable hard-core potentials and a corresponding notion of modulations of an activity function. In the high-temperature regime, our result surpasses the classical Penrose-Ruelle bound of $C_{\phi}(\beta)^{-1}e^{-(\beta C+1)}$ by at least a factor of $e^{2}$.</description>

      <title>Ruijsenaars duality for B, C, D Toda chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Hamiltonian reduction method to construct the Ruijsenaars dual systems to generalized Toda chains associated with the classical Lie algebras of types $B, C, D$. The dual systems turn out to be the $B, C$ and $D$ analogues of the rational Goldfish model, which is, as in the type $A$ case, the strong coupling limit of rational Ruijsenaars systems. We explain how both types of systems emerge in the reduction of the cotangent bundle of a Lie group and provide the formulae for dual Hamiltonians. We compute explicitly the higher Hamiltonians of Goldfish models using the Cauchy--Binet theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the discrete Schr\"odinger operators with potentials whose values are read along the orbits of a shift of finite type. We study a certain subset of the collection of energies at which the Lyapunov exponent is zero and prove monotonicity of this set with respect to the shift embeddings. Then we introduce a certain function ${\mathcal J}(A,\mu)$ determined by the position of these zeros and prove monotonicity of ${\mathcal J}(A,\mu)$ with respect to embeddings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2004.07547v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we prove that the completeness of the Hamilton flow and essential self-adjointness are equivalent for real principal type operators on the circle. Moreover, we study spectral properties of these operators. The proof is based on the construction of eigenfunctions with non-real eigenvalues which is well-known in scattering theory. Moreover, the relationship between scattering theory and the essential self-adjointness is explained.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algebra of Chern-Simons Matrix Model and Large $N$ Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14046v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the algebra of quantum observables of the Chern-Simons matrix model which was originally proposed by Susskind and Polychronakos to describe electrons in fractional quantum Hall effects. We establish the commutation relations for its generators and study the large $N$ limit of its representation. We show that the large $N$ limit algebra is isomorphic to the uniform in $N$ algebra studied by Costello, which is isomorphic to the deformed double current algebra studied by Guay. Under appropriate scaling limit, we show that the large $N$ limit algebra degenerates to a Lie algebra which admits a surjective map to the affine Lie algebra of $\mathfrak{u}(p)$. This leads to a complete proof of the large $N$ emergence of the $\mathfrak{u}(p)$ current algebra as proposed by Dorey, Tong and Turner. This also suggests a rigorous derivation of edge excitation of a fractional quantum Hall droplet.</description>

      <title>On the degrees of freedom count on singular phase space submanifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10690v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I discuss singular loci in the phase spaces of theories which lack globally well-defined numbers of dynamical modes. This is a topic which appears quite often in the recent literature on modified gravity. In particular, there were discussions about $R^2$ gravity around Minkowski space. It is a relatively simple case, and still there were some confusions. It clearly shows that one should be very accurate when trying to understand a potentially problematic theory through perturbations around a simply looking background. At the same time, many modern teleparallel approaches are laden with even more severe issues. Therefore, it is a topic which is certainly worth carefully thinking about.</description>

      <title>Buffon-Laplace Needle Problem as a geometric probabilistic approach to filtration process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06670v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Buffon-Laplace Needle Problem considers a needle of a length $l$ randomly dropped on a large plane distributed with vertically parallel lines with distances $a$ and $b$ ($a \geqslant b$), respectively. As a classical problem in stochastic probability, it serves as a mathematical basis of various physical literature, such as the efficiency of a filter and the emergence of clogging in filtration process. Yet its potential application is limited by previous focus on its original form of the `short' needle case of $l &lt; b$ and its analytical difficulty in a general sense. Here, rather than a `short' two-dimensional needle, we analytically solve the problems with two- and three-dimensional needles and spherocylinders of arbitrary length and radius dropped on a grid with any rectangular shape. We further confirm our analytical theory with Monte Carlo simulation. Our framework here helps to provide a geometric analytical perspective to filtration process, and also extend the analytical power of the needle problem into unexplored parameter regions for physical problems involving stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>Exploring Self-Gravitating Cylindrical Structures in Modified Gravity: Insights from Scalar-Vector-Tensor Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09852v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate static cylindrical solutions within an extended theory of modified gravity. By incorporating various coupling functions through a straightforward boost symmetry approach, we establish the equations of motion in a self-consistent manner and subsequently determine the linear scalar field profile. Utilizing analytical methods, we solve the system of equations for the metric functions and the $U(1)$ gauge field, revealing their dependence on Bessel's functions. To comprehend gravito-objects exhibiting cylindrical symmetry, we develop a perturbative framework aimed at identifying all nontrivial solutions for the scalar profiles. Introducing first-order truncated perturbation equations for the gauge field, synchronized with metric gauges and electromagnetic field considerations, we demonstrate their integrability and obtain solutions through quadrature. Our findings suggest the feasibility of obtaining self-gravitating cylindrical structures within the scalar-vector-tensor theory.</description>

      <title>Spectral representation in Klein space: simplifying celestial leaf amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the spectral representation in Klein space, which is the split $(2,2)$ signature flat spacetime. The Klein space can be foliated into Lorentzian $\mathrm{AdS}_3 /\mathbb{Z}$ slices, and its identity resolution has continuous and discrete parts. We calculate the identity resolution and the Plancherel measure in these slices. Using the foliation of Klein space into the slices, the identity resolution, and the Plancherel measure in each slice, we compute the spectral representation of the massive bulk-to-bulk propagator in Klein space. It can be expressed as the sum of the product of two massive (or tachyonic) conformal primary wavefunctions, with both continuous and discrete parts, and sharing a common boundary coordinate. An interesting point in Klein space is that, since the identity resolution has discrete and continuous parts, a new type of conformal primary wavefunction naturally arises for the massive (or tachyonic) case. For the conformal primary wavefunctions, both the discrete and continuous parts involve integrating over the common boundary coordinate and the real (or imaginary) mass. The conformal dimension is summed in the discrete part, whereas it is integrated in the continuous part. The spectral representation in Klein space is a computational tool to derive conformal block expansions for celestial amplitudes in Klein space and its building blocks, called celestial leaf amplitudes, by integrating the particle interaction vertex over a single slice of foliation.</description>

      <title>Stationary reduction method based on nonisospectral deformation of orthogonal polynomials, and discrete Painlev\'{e}-type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new approach called ``stationary reduction method based on nonisospectral deformation of orthogonal polynomials" for deriving discrete Painlev\'{e}-type (d-P-type) equations. We successfully apply this approach to (bi)orthogonal polynomials satisfying ordinary orthogonality, $(1,m)$-biorthogonality, generalized Laurent biorthogonality, Cauchy biorthogonality and partial-skew orthogonality. As a result, several seemingly novel classes of high order d-P-type equations, along with their particular solutions and respective Lax pairs, are derived. Notably, the d-P-type equation related to the Cauchy biorthogonality can be viewed as a stationary reduction of a nonisospectral generalization involving the first two flows of the Toda hierarchy of CKP type. Additionally, the d-P-type equation related to the partial-skew orthogonality is associated with the nonisospectral Toda hierarchy of BKP type, and this equation is found to admit a solution expressed in terms of Pfaffians.</description>

      <title>A Relationship Between Nonphysical Quasi-probabilities and Nonlocality Objectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density matrices are the most general descriptions of quantum states, covering both pure and mixed states. Positive semidefiniteness is a physical requirement of density matrices, imposing nonnegative probabilities of measuring physical values. Separately, nonlocality is a property shared by some bipartite quantum systems, indicating a correlation of the component parts that cannot be described by local classical variables. In this work, we show that breaking the positive-semidefinite requirement and allowing states with a negative minimal eigenvalue arbitrarily close to zero, allows for the construction of states that are nonlocal under one component labelling but local when the labelling is interchanged. This is an observer-dependent nonlocality, showing the connection between nonlocal objectivism and negative quasi-probabilities.</description>
