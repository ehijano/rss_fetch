      <description>arXiv:2507.19507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the structure and properties of Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) Stars as alternatives to conventional neutron stars. The work focuses on the thermodynamic study of gases composed of charged scalar bosons and fermions (electrons, protons, and neutrons) under a uniform magnetic field, paying particular attention to the low-temperature limit. Expressions are derived for the thermodynamic potential, particle densities, energies, anisotropic pressures, and magnetization, including both statistical and vacuum contributions, with the latter separated into the contribution from the Lowest Landau Level (LLL) and excited levels. Based on these results, anisotropic equations of state (EoS) are constructed that incorporate chemical equilibrium and charge neutrality conditions for a mixed \textit{npe}+$\pi^-$ gas. These EoS are then implemented in a system of anisotropic structure equations based on an axisymmetric metric, allowing for the analysis of how the magnetic field modifies the structure of BEC stars, including their masses, radii, deformations, gravitational redshifts, and mass quadrupole moments. Numerical results are presented showing the influence of the magnetic field on the global properties of these stars, including potential observable signatures.</description>

      <title>Luminous Late-time Radio Emission from Supernovae Interacting with Circumbinary Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) exhibit signatures of interaction with circumstellar material (CSM). Bright radio emission years after the SN is one such indication of dense CSM at large distances from the star, which may be generated via binary interactions. In this work, we use forward modeling to study the radio emission produced by interaction between the SN ejecta and CSM formed by non-conservative stable mass transfer from stripped-envelope stars in short-period binaries. The donors are among the likely progenitors of hydrogen-poor CCSNe that significantly expand $10^3$-$10^4$ years before core-collapse. We identify that non-conservative stable mass transfer from lower-mass stripped stars can create a detached shell-like CSM, whereas for our higher-mass stars the CSM is wind-like. In our models, mass transfer rates of $\sim 10^{-4} M_\odot$ $\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ lead to dense CSM extending to $\sim 10^{18}$ $\mathrm{cm}$. The predicted radio emission is luminous at late times, reaching $L_{\nu}\sim10^{26}$-$10^{29}$ $\mathrm{erg}$ $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ $\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}$ at years to decades after core-collapse, which is as bright as late-time radio emission observed for a sample of hydrogen-poor SNe. However, the light curves of events with early-time data show more complex behavior in the weeks to months after core-collapse. We qualitatively demonstrate that similar early-time emission can manifest for CSM that is accelerated to speeds of $\sim10^3$ $\mathrm{km}$ $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ upon ejection, as well as for different viewing angles in case of an asymmetric CSM distribution.</description>

      <title>The Timing Evolution of the Magnetar Swift J1818.0-1607 During a Period of Reduced Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report results from an observational campaign of the radio-loud magnetar Swift J1818.0-1607 using the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) at 2.0 GHz, which began in November 2021 during a period of reduced activity approximately 20 months after its March 2020 outburst. Over the 60-day duration reported here, the integrated pulse profile remained consistently stable, exhibiting a single, narrow peak with with a small precursor component and no evidence of a postcursor one. This pulse profile is in sharp contrast to the double-peaked morphology observed during an observing campaign approximately 120 days preceding ours. Along with this change in the integrated pulse profile shape, we also measure a slower spin-down rate compared to the end of that preceding campaign. Together, these differences suggest that a mode-switching event likely occurred between the end of that campaign and the start of ours. Finally, we derived a phase-connected timing solution from our data, from which we inferred a characteristic age of approximately 2500 years, about 2.5 times older than the most recent published estimate, and a surface dipole magnetic field strength of roughly 1 x 10^14 G, nearly three times weaker. These updated estimates reflect the short-term variations in the magnetar's spin-down rate, from which both its age and magnetic field strength are inferred, rather than intrinsic changes in the magnetar itself.</description>

      <title>The First Day of a Type Ia Supernova from a Double-Degenerate Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernovae in binary star systems involve a hydrodynamical interaction between the ejecta and a binary companion. This collision results in shock heating and a modified density structure for the ejecta, both of which affect the light curve. As highlighted by Kasen, these considerations are particularly relevant for type Ia supernovae, as the companion is expected to be Roche-lobe filling at the time of the explosion. We simulate here the interaction between type Ia supernova ejecta and a white dwarf donor using Athena++, finding the formation of a low-density wake extending to higher velocities than the unperturbed ejecta. Radiation hydrodynamics is then used to generate synthetic light curves for the first day after the explosion for a range of viewing angles. We find that the hot, high-velocity, shocked ejecta yields $L&gt;10^{40}$ ergs/s over half the sky in the first few hours. The photosphere within the shock-heated ejecta cools and recedes in velocity space, partially obscuring it from view, as heating from radioactive nickel becomes increasingly important in driving the supernova's luminosity. By one day after the explosion, the luminosity measured by observers looking directly into the wake is dimmer than that of a normal type Ia supernova by 15 percent due to the modified density structure.</description>

      <title>Possible Neutrino Emission from the Pulsar Wind Nebula G63.7+1.1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on our finding of an excess of $54^{+16}_{-15}$ neutrinos at the location of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) G63.7+1.1. By analyzing the IceCube track-like neutrino data for a group of 14 PWNe, which are selected as the targets because of their reportedly association with molecular clouds, G63.7+1.1 is found to be the only one detected with neutrino emission and the post-trail significance for the detection is 3.2$\sigma$. Previously, this PWN was estimated to have an age of $\gtrsim$8\,kyr, contain a candidate pulsar detected in X-rays, and have a distance of $\sim$6\,kpc. More importantly and related to the PWN's possible neutrino emission, surrounding molecular materials are seen to interact with the PWN. On the basis of these properties, we examine the proton-proton interactions as the process for the neutrino production. The PWN (or the pulsar) can collectively provide sufficient energy to power the required high-energy (HE) protons. This possibly first neutrino-emitting case in our Galaxy, with problems or other possibilities to be solved or examined, may reveal to us that PWNe are the significant Galactic HE neutrino sources.</description>

      <title>Perseus cluster in its X-ray entirety with SRG/eROSITA et al. I. Merger and Radio-Uroboroses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Perseus cluster (Abell 426) is a nearby massive galaxy cluster that spans several degrees. We combined SRG/eROSITA, XMM-Newton, and Chandra data to get a complete coverage of this cluster in X-rays up to $R_{\rm 200c}$ and beyond, although at the largest radii, spatial non-uniformities of X-ray background and foreground dominate. While the Perseus central part represents a canonical cool-core structure with clear signs of AGN Feedback, the outskirts, in turn, serve as a convincing example of a merger-perturbed system. X-ray data suggest that IC310 is the main galaxy of a subcluster that merges with Perseus over the past $\sim 4\,{\rm Gyr}$. Overall, this configuration resembles the merger between the Coma cluster and the NGC4839 group. It is statistically more likely to find a merging group near the apocenter of its orbit. Therefore, it is not surprising that IC310 in Perseus has a relatively small velocity relative to the main cluster, similarly to NGC4839 in Coma.
  Perseus also hosts a high-velocity radio galaxy, NGC1265 (line-of-sight velocity is almost twice the virial velocity of the main cluster), which is known for its spectacular radio tail. Unless this galaxy has been accelerated by a time-variable potential associated with the merger, it has to move almost along the line of sight through the entire cluster, which would be a rare, but not a truly exceptional configuration. Both galaxies, IC310 and NGC1265, have remarkable radio tails with sharp bends that are reminiscent of a "snake biting its tail". We speculate that these curious shapes are natural consequences of their (different) orbits in Perseus. For IC310, the proximity to the apocenter and the reversal of its radial velocity might play a role. For NGC1265, the nearly line-of-sight motion coupled with the gas motions in the merging system might be important.</description>

      <title>Constraints on extra charges in dyonic Kerr-Newman-Kasuya-Taub-NUT black hole from the observations of quasi-periodic oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the influence of the dimensionless electric charge ($Q/M$), magnetic charge ($P/M$), and Taub-NUT parameter ($n/M$) of a dyonic Kerr-Newman-Kasuya-Taub-NUT black hole on quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in X-ray binaries. Using the relativistic precession model, we calculate the three fundamental frequencies arising from particle motion in the accretion disk around the black hole. These theoretical predictions are then confronted with observational QPO data from five X-ray binaries (GRO J1655-40, XTE J1859$+$226, XTE J1550-564, GRS 1915$+$105, and H1743-322), and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique is used to constrain the black hole parameters. Our analysis reveals no significant evidence for nonzero values of $Q/M$ and $P/M$ across all sources, thereby allowing us to place several stringent upper limits on electric charge ($Q/M$) and magnetic charge ($P/M$) of the black hole in these systems. Similarly, no compelling indication of a nonzero Taub-NUT parameter is found in QPOs from GRO J1655-40, XTE J1859$+$226, XTE J1550-564, and H1743-322. In contrast, the posterior distribution derived from GRS 1915$+$105 data suggests a nonzero Taub-NUT parameter, i.e., gravitomagnetic monopole moment. This result indicates a potential deviation from the Kerr metric in this astrophysical black hole.</description>

      <title>Multi-band optical variability of the blazar OP 313 in the outburst state during 2024-2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the analysis results of flux and spectral variability of the blazar OP 313 across intra-night to short-term timescales using BVRI photometric data, gathered over 25 nights from Nov 2024 to May 2025, using two optical telescopes in ARIES, India. The source was in an outburst state during this period. We searched for intraday variations (IDV), using two powerful statistical tests: the Power Enhanced F-test and the Nested ANOVA test. The source displayed IDV in the R band for five of the ten nights, yielding a duty cycle of 34$\%$. During the entire monitoring of the source, it showed variations of over two mag in all B, V, R, and I data bands. We obtained a variability timescale for a variable light curve, giving us an upper limit for the size of the emission region. We generated optical SEDs of the blazar for these 25 nights, fitted a power law of form $(F_\nu \propto \nu^{-\alpha_{o}})$ and found the weighted mean spectral index to be 1.471$\pm$0.004. An analysis of the color-magnitude diagram shows that, contrary to the redder-when-brighter (RWB) trend typically observed in FSRQs, this source exhibits a bluer-when-brighter (BWB) trend on short-term variability (STV) timescales - a behavior more commonly associated with BL Lac object. We explore potential physical mechanisms responsible for the observed spectral variability.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Search for AGN Flares in ZTF Data Release 23</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to exhibit stochastic variability across a wide range of timescales and wavelengths. AGN flares are extreme outbursts that deviate from this typical behavior and may trace a range of energetic physical processes. Using six years of data from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Data Release 23, we conduct a systematic search for AGN flares among a sample of well-sampled AGNs and AGN candidates. We construct two catalogs: the AGN Flare Coarse Catalog (AGNFCC), containing 28,504 flares identified via Bayesian blocks and Gaussian Processes, and the AGN Flare Refined Catalog (AGNFRC), comprising 1,984 high-confidence flares selected using stricter criteria. We analyze their spatial distribution, temporal characteristics, host AGN type and potential origins. Some flares can be associated with known supernovae, tidal disruption events, or blazars, and a few may be linked to binary black hole mergers or microlensing events. These catalogs provide a valuable resource for studying transient phenomena in AGNs and are publicly available at https://github.com/Lyle0831/AGN-Flares.</description>

      <title>Binary Neutron Star Mergers: Multi-Messenger Systematics and Prospects with Next-Generation Facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-messenger astronomy was galvanized by the detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 and electromagnetic (EM) emission from the subsequent kilonova and short gamma ray burst. Maximizing multi-messenger constraints on these systems requires combining models of the progenitors and products of BNS mergers within a single framework in anticipation of future GW and EM detectors. We demonstrate how combining models of different aspects of the BNS progenitor-merger-remnant system into a full multi-messenger modeling pipeline reveals insight into modeling challenges that will need to be addressed in the coming decade of multi-messenger astronomy. Motivated by GW170817, this combined model relates the progenitor astrophysics of a BNS population with their GW observability and localizability, kilonova light curves, gamma-ray burst afterglow flux, and kilonova remnant evolution. We find joint correlations between the GW and EM observables that depend on a complicated interplay between modeling assumptions and theoretical uncertainties. Next generation detectors will generically provide multi-messenger constraints on BNSs with median GW network signal-to-noise ratio $\approx 10$, median of the 90$^{\rm th}$ percentile sky area $\approx 10$ sq. deg., and kilonova $i$-band apparent magnitudes ranging from $\approx 33$ to $23$. We find no more than 4\% of the BNSs are simultaneously detectable by a network of two Cosmic Explorers and one Einstein Telescope and by the Roman and Rubin telescopes for 55 and 180 sec. exposures in a $K$-like band and $i$ and $g$ bands, respectively. We discuss key modeling assumptions that will be transmitted as multi-messenger systematics in the analysis of future datasets, such as uncertain astrophysical processes of binary populations and the nuclear equation of state for tests of nuclear physics and dark matter.</description>

      <title>Predicting the X-ray signatures of the imminent T Coronae Borealis outburst through 3D hydrodynamic modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: T Coronae Borealis (T CrB) is a symbiotic recurrent nova with eruptions in 1866 and 1946. Mounting evidence suggests an imminent outburst, offering a rare opportunity to observe a nearby nova in detail. We constrain the circumbinary medium (CBM) by modeling inter-eruption radio observations and simulate the hydrodynamic evolution of the upcoming outburst to predict its X-ray signatures, focusing on the roles of the red giant companion, accretion disk, and equatorial density enhancement (EDE). We model thermal radio emission from a CBM composed of a spherical wind and a torus-like EDE to estimate its density. We then perform 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the nova outburst, varying explosion energy, ejecta mass, and CBM configuration. From these, we synthesize X-ray light curves and spectra as they would appear to XMM-Newton and XRISM. The CBM in T CrB is significantly less dense than in other symbiotic novae, with a mass-loss rate of $\dot{M} \approx 4 \times 10^{-9}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for a 10 km s$^{-1}$ wind. Despite the low-density EDE, the blast is collimated along the poles by the accretion disk and EDE, producing a bipolar shock. The red giant partially shields the ejecta, forming a bow shock and hot wake. X-ray evolution proceeds through three phases: an early phase (first few hours) dominated by shocked disk material; an intermediate phase ($\sim 1$ week-1 month) driven by reverse-shocked ejecta; and a late phase dominated by shocked EDE. Soft X-rays trace shocked ejecta, hard X-rays arise from shocked ambient gas, and synthetic spectra show asymmetric, blueshifted lines due to absorption by expanding ejecta. The X-ray evolution resembles that of RS Oph and V745 Sco, with a peak luminosity of $L_\mathrm{X} \approx 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$, but features a more prolonged soft X-ray phase, reflecting the lower CBM density and distinct ejecta-environment interaction.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamical modeling of SN 2025kg associated with the Fast X-ray Transient EP250108a</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernovae (SNe) associated with X-Ray Flashes (XRFs) are extremely rare. Therefore, the discovery of each new object in this class offers a unique opportunity to improve our understanding about their origins and potential connection with other high-energy phenomena. SN 2025kg is one of the most recent events discovered in this category, and exhibits a double-peaked light curve, with an initial cooling phase followed by the main peak. Here, we investigate the possible mechanisms powering its bolometric light curve and expansion velocities, using numerical calculations to simulate the explosion. We found that low ejecta masses (Mej ~ 2 Msun) and moderate explosion energies (E ~ 2e51 erg) are required to reproduce the data. Our models also show that a large amount of nickel (M_Ni = 0.85 Msun) is needed to achieve the high luminosity of SN 2025kg, which makes this scenario difficult to sustain. As an alternative, we explore a model in which a millisecond magnetar serves as the primary energy source. A magnetar with a spin period of 3 ms, approximately, and a magnetic field of 28e14 G gives an adequate match to the data. To account for the early cooling phase, we assume the presence of a dense circumstellar material surrounding the progenitor, with a mass of 0.27 Msun and an extension of 500 Rsun. A comparison and modeling of a select group of SNe--SN 2006aj, SN 2020bvc and SN 2023pel--is also presented. A remarkable similarity emerges between SN 2025kg and SN 2023pel. As SN 2023pel was recently proposed to be powered by a magnetar, this further supports the magnetar scenario for SN 2025kg.</description>

      <title>Fast and "lossless" propagation of relativistic electrons along magnetized non-thermal filaments in galaxy clusters and the Galactic Center region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic leptons in galaxy clusters lose their energy via radiation (synchrotron and inverse Compton losses) and interactions with the ambient plasma. At z~0, pure radiative losses limit the lifetime of electrons emitting at ~GHz frequencies to t&lt;100 Myr. Adiabatic losses can further lower Lorentz factors of electrons trapped in an expanding medium. If the propagation speed of electrons relative to the ambient weakly magnetized (plasma $\beta\sim10^2$) Intracluster Medium (ICM) is limited by the Alfv\'en speed, $v_{a,ICM}=c_{s,ICM}/\beta^{1/2}\sim 10^7\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$, GHz-emitting electrons can travel only $l \sim v_{a,ICM}t_r\sim 10\,kpc$ relative to the underlying plasma. Yet, elongated structures spanning hundreds of kpc or even a few Mpc are observed, requiring either a re-acceleration mechanism or another form of synchronization, e.g., by a large-scale shock. We argue that filaments with ordered magnetic fields supported by non-thermal pressure have $v_{a}\gg v_{a,{\rm ICM}}$ and so can provide such a synchronization even without re-acceleration or shocks. In particular, along quasi-stationary filaments, electrons can propagate without experiencing adiabatic losses, and their velocity is not limited by the Alfv\'en or sound speeds of the ambient thermal plasma. This model predicts that along filaments that span significant pressure gradients, e.g., in the cores of galaxy clusters, the synchrotron break frequency $\nu_b\propto B$ should scale with the ambient gas pressure as $P^{1/2}$, and the emission from such filaments should be strongly polarized. While some of these structures can be observed as "filaments", i.e., long and narrow bright structures, others can be unresolved and have a collective appearance of a diffuse structure, or be too faint to be detected, while still providing channels for electrons' propagation.</description>

      <title>Rotating Proto-Neutron Stars Admixed with Mirror Dark Matter: A two fluid approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the impact of mirror dark matter (DM) on the global properties of rotating neutron stars (NSs) across evolutionary stages, from hot, lepton-rich proto-neutron stars (PNSs) to cold, catalyzed NSs along the Kelvin--Helmholtz timescale. The baryonic matter (BM) is modeled using a relativistic mean-field (RMF) approach with density-dependent couplings, while the dark sector mirrors the visible sector with analogous thermodynamic conditions. Using a two-fluid formalism with purely gravitational DM-BM interaction, we find that rotation enlarges the star, whereas DM admixture increases compactness and enhances gravitational stability. However, increased compactness due to DM lowers the threshold for rotational instabilities, making DM-admixed stars more susceptible. Rotation decreases temperature profiles by redistributing thermal energy over a larger volume and reducing central density, while DM raises temperatures by deepening the gravitational potential and increasing thermal energy. Stars become more prone to collapse and rotational instabilities as frequency ($\nu$) rises and the polar-to-equatorial radius ratio ($r_p/r_e$) decreases, especially near the Keplerian limit ($\nu_K$). DM-admixed stars also show higher surface gravitational redshifts due to their compactness. Our results qualitatively agree with universal relations primarily derived for rotating cold stars. These findings highlight competing effects of rotation and DM on NS thermal evolution, structure, and observables, potentially offering indirect probes of DM within NSs.</description>

      <title>Millimeter VLBI constraints on the central magnetic field and symmetric jet production in the twin-jet galaxy NGC 1052</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the symmetry and magnetic field properties of the jets in the radio galaxy NGC 1052, with particular attention to the impact of the ionized torus that surrounds the central region on the emitted radiation. Our study is based on three new 43 GHz Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations and one 86 GHz observation conducted between April 2021 and April 2022. We derive key jet parameters, such as speed, width, and flux density for both jets at the two frequencies and compare them with those obtained from previous VLBI campaigns. Additionally, we present the first (43-86) GHz spectral index image of NGC 1052, which is crucial to assess the role of the torus at high frequencies. Finally, we leverage the derived observational parameters to constrain the magnetic field strength and configuration in the launched jets. We observe variability in the jet morphology at 43 GHz across the three epochs, which can be associated with the propagation of jet knots launched from the nuclear region. The stacked 43 GHz image reveals that the western and receding jet is approximately three times fainter than its eastern (approaching) counterpart in the sub-mas region. This asymmetry, together with the (43-86) GHz spectral index map, suggests that free-free absorption may affect the 43 GHz emission. On the contrary, the jets appear highly symmetric at 86 GHz. From the stacked images at 43 GHz and 86 GHz, we extract the jet width, which is consistent with previous VLBI studies and supports the presence of a parabolic jet profile on very compact scales. Overall, our results suggest that the jets are intrinsically launched symmetrically, and that the observed time-dependent asymmetries may result from free-free absorption by the torus and the downstream propagation of jet components, a scenario supported by previous theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>The role of magnetic fields in shaping $\gamma$-ray emission from the Fermi bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their discovery fifteen years ago, the nature and origin of the Fermi bubbles remain unclear. We here investigate the effect a magnetic field can have on a subsonic breeze outflow emanating from the Galactic centre region. The presence of this magnetic field allows anisotropic diffusion of cosmic rays within the outflow, shaping the resultant cosmic ray distribution obtained out at large distances within the Galactic halo. We show that our magnetohydrodynamic Galactic breeze model, in combination with an opening angle for the injection of cosmic rays, leads to $\gamma$-ray emission from the Fermi bubble region with relatively sharp edges.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Perseus Cluster I: Resolving the Si/S/Ar/Ca ratios by Stellar Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical abundance measurements from stars in the Milky Way to the intragalactic medium in the Perseus Cluster have challenged the spherical explosion models. Models in the literature cannot closely match the observed element ratios, where Si, S are overproduced and Ar, Ca are underproduced. In this article, we explore the impact of the model parameters during the evolution of massive stars on the final explosive nucleosynthesis. We investigate the effects of a parametrized model of the convective process, including the mixing length parameter and the semi-convection parameter, on the production of Si-group elements. We search for the value pair that can reduce the discrepancy in the models. We conclude that a mixing length parameter of 2.2 and semi-convection parameter of 0.03 are required to fit these criteria. Using this updated value pair, we compute a sequence of massive star models from $M_{\rm ZAMS} = $ 15 -- 40 $M_{\odot}$. The high resolution data from future observations such as XRISM will provide further details on less constrained processes in stellar evolution and supernova explosion. Future comparison with supernova models of various progenitor metallicity will further shed light on the supernova population and their relative rates on cosmological scales.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Triggered Type Ia Supernovae I: Impact on Explosion Dynamics and Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid-mass window are compelling dark matter candidates, made plausible by the existence of black holes and by the variety of mechanisms of their production in the early universe. If a PBH falls into a white dwarf (WD), the strong tidal forces can generate enough heat to trigger a thermonuclear runaway explosion, depending on the WD mass and the PBH orbital parameters. In this work, we investigate the WD explosion triggered by the passage of PBH. We perform 2D simulations of the WD undergoing thermonuclear explosion in this scenario, with the predicted ignition site as the parameter assuming the deflagration-detonation transition model. We study the explosion dynamics and predict the associated light curves and nucleosynthesis. We find that the model sequence predicts the light curves which align with the Phillip's relation ($B_{\max}$ vs. $\Delta M_{15}$). Our models hint at a unifying approach in triggering Type Ia supernovae without involving two distinctive evolutionary tracks.</description>

      <title>Galactic Super-Accreting X-ray Binaries as Super-PeVatron Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extension of the cosmic-ray (CR) spectrum well beyond 1~PeV necessitates the existence of a population of accelerators in the Milky Way, which we refer to as Super PeVatrons. Identifying the nature of these sources remains a challenge to the paradigm of galactic CRs. Galactic super-accreting X-ray binaries, where the compact object accretes at a rate near or above the Eddington limit, can meet the energy requirement to supply the high-energy population of galactic CRs. We demonstrate that the trans-relativistic jets and/or winds of these powerful objects with kinetic energy luminosity exceeding $10^{39} \, \rm erg/s$, can accelerate protons to energies above several PeV. Detection of such super-accreting X-ray binaries through their ultra-high-energy $\gamma$-ray ``halos" and large-scale nebulae is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Relativistic scalar dark matter drag forces on a black hole binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter around black holes can induce drag forces through dynamical friction and accretion, potentially affecting the orbital evolution and gravitational wave emission of binary systems. While dynamical friction from scalar field dark matter has been studied in the relativistic regime for single black holes, the case of a binary black hole (BBH) has remained unexplored. As a first step, we present a series of two-dimensional general-relativistic simulations of BBH in a wind tunnel for an asymptotically homogeneous scalar field background. We extract the drag forces, torque, mass and charge accretion acting on the binary, and analyze their dependence on the binary separation, velocity and the scalar field parameters. We find that the binary's drag is not a simple superposition of two isolated black holes; the presence of a companion modifies the gravitational wake and yields significant nonlinearities. This additional force and torque can (in principle) modify the inspiral and induce a dephasing of the gravitational wave signal.</description>

      <title>Radio signatures of AGN-wind-driven shocks in elliptical galaxies: From simulations to observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the synchrotron emission signatures of shocks driven by active galactic nucleus (AGN) wind in elliptical galaxies based on our two-dimensional axisymmetric hydrodynamic $\textit{MACER}$ numerical simulations. Using these simulation data, we calculate the synchrotron radiation produced by nonthermal electrons accelerated at shocks, adopting reasonable assumptions for the magnetic field and relativistic electron distribution (derived from diffusive shock acceleration theory), and predict the resulting observational signatures. In our fiducial model, shocks driven by AGN winds produce synchrotron emission with luminosities of approximately $10^{29}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}\,Hz^{-1}}$ in the radio band (0.5-5 GHz), with spectral indices of $\alpha \approx -0.4$ to $-0.6$ during the strongest shock phases, gradually steepening to about $-0.8$ to $-1.4$ as the electron population ages. Spatially, the emission is initially concentrated in regions of strong shocks, later expanding into more extended, diffuse structures. We also apply our model to the dwarf elliptical galaxy Messier 32 (M32), and find remarkable consistency between our simulated emission and the observed nuclear radio source, suggesting that this radio component likely originates from hot-wind-driven shocks. Our results indicate that AGN winds not only influence galaxy gas dynamics through mechanical energy input but also yield direct observational evidence via nonthermal radiation. With the advent of next-generation radio facilities such as the FAST Core Array, SKA, and ngVLA, these emission signatures will serve as important probes for detecting and characterizing AGN feedback.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of SN 2023ixf II: The Panchromatic Evolution Between 250 and 720 Days After the Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the nebular phase spectroscopic and photometric observations of the nearby hydrogen-rich core-collapse supernova (CC-SN) 2023ixf, obtained through our JWST programs. These observations, combined with ground-based optical and near-infrared spectra, cover +252.67 - 719.96 d, creating a comprehensive, panchromatic time-series dataset spanning 0.32 - 30$\mu$m. In this second paper of the series, we focus on identifying key spectral emission features and tracking their evolution through the nebular phase. The JWST data reveal hydrogen emission from the Balmer to Humphreys series, as well as prominent forbidden lines from Ne, Ar, Fe, Co, and Ni. NIRSpec observations display strong emission from the first overtone and fundamental bands of carbon monoxide, which weaken with time as the ejecta cools and dust emission dominates. The spectral energy distribution shows a clear infrared excess emerging by +252.67 d peaking around 10.0$\mu$m, with a secondary bump at 18.0$\mu$m developing by +719.96 d. We suggest that this evolution could arises from multiple warm dust components. In upcoming papers in this series, we will present detailed modeling of the molecular and dust properties. Overall, this dataset significantly advances our understanding of the mid-infrared properties of CC-SNe, providing an unprecedented view of their late-time line, molecule, and dust emission.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic stability of superflows in General Relativity and Newtonian gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Landau's criterion for superfluidity is a special case of a broader principle: A moving fluid cannot be stopped by frictional forces if its state of motion is a local minimum of the grand potential. We employ this general thermodynamic criterion to derive a set of inequalities that any superfluid mixture (with an arbitrary number of order parameters) must satisfy for a certain state of motion to be long-lived and unimpeded by friction. These macroscopic constraints complement Landau's original criterion, in that they hold at all temperatures, and remain valid even for gapless superfluids. Unfortunately, they are only necessary conditions for the existence of a frictionless hydrodynamic motion, since they presuppose the validity of a fluid description. However, they do provide sufficient conditions for stability against stochastic hydrodynamic fluctuations. We first formulate our analysis within the framework of General Relativity, and then we take the Newtonian limit.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear causality of Israel-Stewart theory with diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first fully nonlinear causality constraints in $D = 3 + 1$ dimensions for Israel-Stewart theory in the presence of energy and number diffusion in the Eckart and Landau hydrodynamic frames, respectively. These constraints are algebraic inequalities that make no assumption on the underlying geometry of the spacetime, or the equation of state. In order to highlight the distinct physical and structural behavior of the two hydrodynamic frames, we discuss the special ultrarelativistic ideal gas equation of state considered in earlier literature in $D = 1 + 1$ dimensions, and show that our general $D = 3 + 1$ constraints reduce to their results upon an appropriate choice of angles. For this equation of state in both $D = 1 + 1$ and $D = 3 + 1$ dimensions one can show that: (i) there exists a region allowed by nonlinear causality in which the baryon current transitions into a spacelike vector in the Landau frame, and (ii) an analogous argument shows that the solutions of the Eckart frame equations of motion never violate the dominant energy condition, assuming nonlinear causality holds. We then compare our results with those from linearized Israel-Stewart theory and show that the linear causality bounds fail to capture the new physical constraints on energy and number diffusion that are successfully obtained</description>

Abstract: We provide a method to calculate the evolution of an eccentric and inclined orbit under the magnetic effect. Taking the unipolar interaction as an example, we study both coplanar and inclined orbits. We calculate the Lorentz force and then the changes in orbital energy and angular momentum. Combined with the total energy dissipation we write down the evolution equations of semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination and spin. This set of equations can be used to study the orbital and spin evolution under the magnetic interaction.</description>

      <title>Directional Neutrino Bursts from Spinning and Moving Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that primordial black holes (PBHs) with significant spin and bulk motion produce sharply collimated neutrino bursts from Hawking evaporation, arising from the interplay of spin-induced angular anisotropy and relativistic Doppler boosting. This effect shifts the neutrino spectrum into the multi-GeV to hundreds of GeV range, where atmospheric backgrounds drop steeply, and enhances the flux by orders of magnitude within a narrow forward cone. We compute the full lab-frame neutrino distribution and derive updated constraints on PBH number density from non-observation of such bursts in IceCube and KM3NeT. Our results identify directional high-energy neutrino bursts as a distinctive, testable signature of spinning PBHs, providing a complementary probe of the PBH dark matter hypothesis and Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>X-ray Emission from Type Ia Supernova Remnants Interacting With Isotropic Progenitor Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The parameter space for mass loss in Type Ia supernova progenitors is large, with different progenitor scenarios favoring different mass loss regimes. Here we focus on the impact that uniform and isotropic outflows have on the circumstellar environment of Type Ia supernova progenitors. We vary mass loss rate, wind velocity, and outflow duration, and evolve supernova remnant (SNR) models in this grid of circumstellar structures in order to compare the bulk properties of these models (ages, radii, and \feka\ centroids and luminosities) to observations. We find that roughly 50\% of young Type Ia SNRs in the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud had progenitors that did not substantially modify their surroundings on $\sim$pc scales. This group includes SN Ia with a range of luminosities, and at least some likely products of double detonation explosions in sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs. The other half of our sample can be divided in two distinct classes. A small subset of SNRs ($\sim$15\%) have large radii and low \feka\ centroids and are likely expanding into large cavities excavated by fast ($\sim$1000 km/s), sustained progenitor outflows. The majority of the SNRs that are expanding into a modified medium ($\sim35\%$) show evidence for dense material, likely associated with slow ($\sim$10 km/s) progenitor outflows, possibly a byproduct of accretion processes in near-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs spawned by younger stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Ultralight boson constraints from gravitational wave observations of spinning binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the presence of an ultralight scalar or vector boson, a spinning black hole will be spun down through the superradiant instability. We use spin measurements from gravitational wave observations of binary black holes, in particular the heavy binary black hole merger event GW231123, along with the lower-mass GW190517 event, to constrain the existence of ultralight bosons. We disfavor scalars with masses in the range of $[0.55, 11]\times 10^{-13}$ eV and vectors in the range of $[0.11, 18]\times 10^{-13}$ eV, making only a conservative assumption that the black hole lifetimes are greater than $10^5$ years. The lower ends of these ranges, where the exclusion confidence is the highest, were not previously excluded by spin measurements from electromagnetic or gravitational wave observations. We map these constraints to axion and dark photon models with interactions.</description>

      <title>A neutrino flare potentially associated with X-ray emission from tidal disruption event ATLAS17jrp</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06440v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs), in which stars are disrupted by supermassive black holes, have been proposed as potential sources of high-energy neutrinos through hadronic interactions. X-ray-bright TDEs provide dense photon fields conducive to neutrino production via proton-photon ($p\gamma$) processes. We conducted a time-dependent unbinned likelihood analysis of ten years (2008-2018) of IceCube muon-track data, focusing on ten TDEs with confirmed spatially and temporally coincident with the TDE ATLAS17jrp, occurring 19 days after the onset of its X-ray activity and lasting for 56 days, with a post-trial $p$-value of 0.01. This result is consistent with a scenario in which X-ray photons serve as target fields for hadronic interactions. Although constrained by the sample size of X-ray-detected TDEs, these results underscore the need for high-cadence X-ray monitoring and future neutrino observatories to further explore the connection between TDEs and high-energy neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Maximum possible energies of electrons accelerated in magnetospheres of rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our aim is to evaluate the maximum attainable energies of electrons accelerated by means of the magneto-centrifugal mechanism. We examine how the range of maximum possible energies, as well as the primary limiting factors, vary with black hole mass. Additionally, we analyse the dependence of the maximum relativistic factor on the initial distance from the black hole and its spin factor in the range 0.1 - 0.2. We model the acceleration of electrons on rotating magnetic field lines and apply several constraining mechanisms: the inverse Compton scattering, curvature radiation, and the breakdown of the bead-on-the-wire approximation. As a result, the maximum Lorentz factors for electron acceleration vary with the type of black hole. For stellar-mass black holes, electrons can be accelerated up to the Lorentz factors 1.3 * 10^3 - 1.3 * 10^4 with only co-rotation constrain affecting the maximum relativistic factor; In intermediate-mass black holes, the Lorentz factors are in the interval 1.3 * 10^4 - 1.1 * 10^5; For the supermassive black holes the Lorentz factors range from 7 * 10^4 to 1.7 * 10^5; while the ultra-massive black hole located at the center of Abell 1201 can accelerate electrons up to 10^6 with both the co-rotation and Inverse Compton in Thomson regime determining the final Lorentz factor for the last three categories.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Magnetic Field Amplification in Neutron Star Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of a binary neutron stars merger is governed by physics under the most extreme conditions, including strong spacetime curvature, ultra-high matter densities, luminous neutrino emission and the rapid amplification of the initial neutron star magnetic fields. Here we systematically explore how sensitive the magnetic field evolution is to the total mass of the merging binary, to the mass ratio of its components, the stellar spins and to the equation of state. For this purpose, we analyze 16 state-of-the-art GRMHD simulations that employ a subgrid-scale model to account for the unresolved small-scale turbulence. We find that strong and rapid amplification of the magnetic field to volume-averaged values of $\sim 10^{16}$~G in the high-density regions is a very robust outcome of a neutron star merger and this result is only marginally impacted by either mass, mass ratio, spin or equation of state.</description>

      <title>Continuum optical-UV and X-ray variability of AGN: current results and future challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are believed to be powered by accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole. A fundamental ingredient in shaping our understanding of AGN is their variability across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Variability studies have the potential to help us understand the geometry of the emitting regions (in various energy bands), their causal relations, and the physics of the accretion processes. This review focuses on the observational properties of AGN variability in the optical/UV/X-ray bands (where most of the AGN luminosity is emitted) and their dependence on the AGN physical parameters (i.e. mass, luminosity, accretion rate). We also discuss possible interpretations in the context of accreting compact systems, and we review the use of variability as a tool to discover AGN and trace their properties across cosmic time, using both ground and space facilities. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges provided by current and next-generation optical/X-ray surveys, to use variability as an effective tool to probe the growth of super massive black holes in the Universe.</description>

      <title>XRISM Observation of the Ophiuchus Galaxy Cluster: Quiescent Velocity Structure in the Dynamically Disturbed Core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the high-resolution X-rayspectroscopic observations of the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster core using the XRISM satellite. Despite previous observations revealing multiple cold fronts and dynamical disturbances in the cluster core, our XRISM observations show low gas velocity dispersions of sigma_v = 115 +/- 7 km s^-1 in the inner region (~&lt; 25 kpc) and sigma_v = 186 +/- 9 km s^-1 in the outer region (~ 25-50 kpc). The gas temperatures are kT = 5.8 +/- 0.2 keV and 8.4 +/- 0.2 keV for the inner and outer regions, respectively, with metal abundances of Z = 0.75 +/- 0.03 Z_sun (inner) and 0.44 +/- 0.02 Z_sun (outer). The measured velocity dispersions correspond to nonthermal pressure fractions of only 1.4 +/- 0.2% (inner) and 2.5 +/- 0.2% (outer), indicating highly subsonic turbulence. Our analysis of the bulk gas motion indicates that the gas in the inner region is nearly at rest relative to the central galaxy (|v_bulk| = 8 +/- 7 km s^-1), while the outer region exhibits a moderate motion of |v_bulk| = 104 +/- 7 km s^-1. Assuming the velocity dispersion arises from turbulent motions, the turbulent heating rate is ~ 40\% of the radiative cooling rate, although there is some uncertainty. This suggests that the heating and cooling of the gas are not currently balanced. The activity of the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) has apparently weakened. The sloshing motion that created the cold fronts may now be approaching a turning point at which the velocity is minimum. Alternatively, the central galaxy and the associated hot gas could be moving nearly parallel to the plane of the sky.</description>

      <title>Transient MeV radiation from a relativistic tidal disruption candidate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On July 2, 2025, the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray space telescope detected three short-duration MeV transients with overlapping sky locations. These events, named as GRB 250702D, B, and E (collectively referred to as DBE), triggered the detector with delays of approximately 1-2 hours between each burst. Follow-up observations of this unusually long MeV transient (lasting &gt;3 hours) by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array over a period of 10 days revealed a steep temporal decline in soft X-rays ($\propto t^{-1.9 \pm 0.1}$). These characteristics are consistent with the scenario in which DBE arises from a relativistic jet launched after the tidal disruption of a star by a compact object. In the relativistic Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) scenario, DBE is the first one with detected MeV $\gamma$-ray emission. We show that the time-resolved MeV spectra during the outbursts are best described by a single power-law, $dN_{\gamma}/dE \propto E^{-1.5}$, extending from 10 keV to 40 MeV. The upper limits at higher energies ($&gt;$ 100 MeV) indicate that the spectrum breaks at $10-100$ MeV. From standard MeV $\gamma$-ray transparency arguments, we derive a lower limit on the jet bulk Lorentz factor. These constraints place DBE in the same category as four previously reported relativistic TDEs in terms of outburst luminosity and energetics. We argue that the observed spectra are most likely produced by synchrotron radiation from sub-TeV electrons.</description>

      <title>Thermonuclear explosion criteria for direct and indirect collisions of CO white dwarfs: a study of the impact-parameter threshold for detonation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physical collisions of two white dwarfs (WDs) (i.e. not slow mergers) have been shown to produce type-Ia-like supernovae (SNe) explosions. Most studies of WD collisions have focused on zero impact-parameter (direct) collisions, which can also be studied in 2D. However, the vast majority of WD collisions arising from any evolutionary channels suggested to date are expected to be indirect, i.e. have a non-negligible impact parameter upon collision. Here, we use one of the highest resolution 3D simulations to date (making use of the AREPO code) in order to explore both direct and indirect collisions and the conditions in which they give rise to a detonation and the production of a luminous SNe. Using our simulations, we find a detonation criterion that can provide the critical impact parameter for an explosion to occur, depending on the density profile of the colliding WDs, their composition, and their collision velocities. We find that the initial velocity has a significant impact on the amount of 56Ni production from the explosion. Furthermore, the production of the 56Ni also depends on numerical modeling aspects.</description>

      <title>Assessment of universal relations among second-order moments of relativistic stars via reformulated perturbation equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We assess the universal relations among second-order moments of relativistic stars, namely the moment of inertia, tidal deformability, and spin-induced quadrupole moment, via reformulated perturbation equations. After constructing the spherical background configuration by solving two ordinary differential equations as usual, these three moments are obtained by solving four additional ordinary differential equations. They are solved numerically from the stellar center to the surface, and we do not need to derive homogeneous solutions for obtaining the quadrupole moment. This small number of ordinary differential equations to be solved enables us to identify the primary variable for each second-order moment. Investigating the profile of these variables in the star, we speculate that their nonmonotonic behavior, enhanced typically for soft equations of state and/or high compactnesses, introduces the variety to the relations among these second-order moments unless the black-hole limit is approached. Because realistic relativistic stars are widely believed to be characterized by stiff equations of state, they enjoy the universal relation to a great extent.</description>

      <title>Unified QMF equation of state for neutron star matter: Static and dynamic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a set of unified equations of state based on the quark mean field (QMF) model, calibrated to different values of nuclear symmetry energy slope at the saturation density ($L_0$), with the aim of exploring both the static properties and dynamical behavior of neutron stars (NSs), and building a coherent picture of their internal structure. We assess the performance of these QMF models in describing the mass-radius relation, the cooling evolution of isolated NSs and X-ray transients, and the instabilities (e.g., the r-mode). In comparison to relativistic mean field (RMF) models formulated at the hadronic level, the QMF model predicts heavier nuclear clusters and larger Wigner-Seitz cell sizes in the NS crust, while the density of the free neutron gas remains largely similar between the two approaches. For the cooling of isolated NSs, the thermal evolution is found to be insensitive to both the many-body model and the symmetry energy slope in the absence of the direct Urca (dUrca) process. However, when rapid cooling via the dUrca process is allowed, in the case of large $L_0$ values (e.g., $L_0 \gtrsim 80$ MeV) in our study, the QMF model predicts a longer thermal relaxation time. Both the QMF and RMF models can reproduce cooling curves consistent with observations of X-ray transients (e.g., KS 1731--260) during their crustal cooling phase, although stellar parameters show slight variations depending on the model and symmetry energy slope. Within our unified framework, a larger $L_0$ value generally results in a wider instability window, while increasing the stellar mass tends to suppress the instability window. We also provide simple power-law parameterizations that quantify the dependence of bulk and shear viscosities on the symmetry energy slope for nuclear matter at saturation density.</description>

      <title>New avenues for the neutrino dipole portal exploration at the energy frontier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive and gauge-invariant study of the neutrino dipole portal at the energy frontier. Assuming negligible active-sterile mixing, we analyze sterile neutrino production via dimension-6 dipole operators coupling to the electroweak field strengths. The analysis incorporates both single- and double-gauge-boson effective interactions. We investigate novel collider signatures at the HL-LHC, the FCC-hh -- studied here in this context for the first time -- and a 10 TeV muon collider. Particular emphasis is placed on electroweak boson-initiated processes, which dominate in the high-mass regime above $\sim$1 TeV. At the muon collider, these VBF-like topologies enable production even when the dipole couples to non-muonic flavors, offering a unique and sensitive probe for different flavor scenarios. We derive sensitivity projections for various theoretical benchmarks, reaching dipole couplings down to $d_{\gamma}\sim 6\times10^{-7}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at FCC-hh and $d_{\gamma}\sim 2\times10^{-7}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at the muon collider.</description>

Abstract: We present a theoretical study of axion echoes in the context of multiple ALP models. We begin by reviewing the single ALP case, deriving the conditions for resonance and echo formation. Starting from a set of N ALPs coupling to the photon, we then derive the relevant echo equations for both coherent and incoherent configurations. In the former case, we show that the echo power scales with N leading to sharper amplification and potentially improving projected bounds discussed earlier in literature. Small mass splittings between the ALPs further increase this amplification, even for a N = 2 case. We also outline the potential experimental implications of our results and discuss prospects for detecting these echoes in a wide range of ALP masses. In the incoherent scenario, we show that the random phases lead to a suppression of the echo power, eventually resulting in observable signals akin to or even weaker than the single ALP case.</description>
