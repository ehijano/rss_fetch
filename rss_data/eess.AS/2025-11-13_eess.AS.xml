      <title>ParaS2S: Benchmarking and Aligning Spoken Language Models for Paralinguistic-aware Speech-to-Speech Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech-to-Speech (S2S) models have shown promising dialogue capabilities, but their ability to handle paralinguistic cues--such as emotion, tone, and speaker attributes--and to respond appropriately in both content and style remains underexplored. Progress is further hindered by the scarcity of high-quality and expressive demonstrations. To address this, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework for paralinguistic-aware S2S, ParaS2S, which evaluates and optimizes both content and speaking style directly at the waveform level. We first construct ParaS2SBench, a benchmark comprehensively evaluates S2S models' output for content and style appropriateness from diverse and challenging input queries. It scores the fitness of input-output pairs and aligns well with human judgments, serving as an automatic judge for model outputs. With this scalable scoring feedback, we enable the model to explore and learn from diverse unlabeled speech via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments show that existing S2S models fail to respond appropriately to paralinguistic attributes, performing no better than pipeline-based baselines. Our RL approach achieves a 11% relative improvement in response content and style's appropriateness on ParaS2SBench over supervised fine-tuning (SFT), surpassing all prior models while requiring substantially fewer warm-up annotations than pure SFT.</description>

      <title>Towards Effective and Efficient Non-autoregressive decoders for Conformer and LLM-based ASR using Block-based Attention Mask</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems often rely on autoregressive (AR) Transformer decoder architectures, which limit efficient inference parallelization due to their sequential nature. To this end, non-autoregressive (NAR) approaches aim primarily to achieve significant decoding speedup while the maintaining recognition accuracy that is comparable to AR baselines. This paper proposes a novel NAR block-based attention mask decoder (AMD) that effectively improves decoding efficiency while maintaining ASR accuracy, and also offering flexibility in balancing the performance-efficiency trade-off on both Conformer and large language model (LLM)-based ASR systems. The proposed AMD performs parallel inference within contiguous blocks of output labels while maintaining monotonic left-to-right prediction between blocks. A one-pass beam search algorithm is designed to dynamically fuse Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC), AR decoder, and AMD probabilities. Experiments are conducted on normal speech LS960 and DBank elderly speech across: a) The Conformer encoder-decoder ASR system with filterbank input features; b) its integration with WavLM features; and c) further advancement by integrating an LLM-based decoder. On the LS960 task, the proposed AMD empowered tripartite decoder achieves decoding speedup ratios of up to 1.44x, 1.55x, and 2.31x under the three model configurations over the CTC + AR baselines, without statistically significant WER increases. When operating with real-time factors (RTFs) comparable to the baselines, the tripartite decoder produces statistically significant WER reductions of 0.19%, 0.62% and 0.13% absolute (4.3%, 16.3%, and 3.8% relative). Similar improvements are also obtained on the DBank task.</description>

      <title>Diff-V2M: A Hierarchical Conditional Diffusion Model with Explicit Rhythmic Modeling for Video-to-Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video-to-music (V2M) generation aims to create music that aligns with visual content. However, two main challenges persist in existing methods: (1) the lack of explicit rhythm modeling hinders audiovisual temporal alignments; (2) effectively integrating various visual features to condition music generation remains non-trivial. To address these issues, we propose Diff-V2M, a general V2M framework based on a hierarchical conditional diffusion model, comprising two core components: visual feature extraction and conditional music generation. For rhythm modeling, we begin by evaluating several rhythmic representations, including low-resolution mel-spectrograms, tempograms, and onset detection functions (ODF), and devise a rhythmic predictor to infer them directly from videos. To ensure contextual and affective coherence, we also extract semantic and emotional features. All features are incorporated into the generator via a hierarchical cross-attention mechanism, where emotional features shape the affective tone via the first layer, while semantic and rhythmic features are fused in the second cross-attention layer. To enhance feature integration, we introduce timestep-aware fusion strategies, including feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) and weighted fusion, allowing the model to adaptively balance semantic and rhythmic cues throughout the diffusion process. Extensive experiments identify low-resolution ODF as a more effective signal for modeling musical rhythm and demonstrate that Diff-V2M outperforms existing models on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of objective metrics and subjective comparisons. Demo and code are available at https://Tayjsl97.github.io/Diff-V2M-Demo/.</description>

      <title>SeniorTalk: A Chinese Conversation Dataset with Rich Annotations for Super-Aged Seniors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While voice technologies increasingly serve aging populations, current systems exhibit significant performance gaps due to inadequate training data capturing elderly-specific vocal characteristics like presbyphonia and dialectal variations. The limited data available on super-aged individuals in existing elderly speech datasets, coupled with overly simple recording styles and annotation dimensions, exacerbates this issue. To address the critical scarcity of speech data from individuals aged 75 and above, we introduce SeniorTalk, a carefully annotated Chinese spoken dialogue dataset. This dataset contains 55.53 hours of speech from 101 natural conversations involving 202 participants, ensuring a strategic balance across gender, region, and age. Through detailed annotation across multiple dimensions, it can support a wide range of speech tasks. We perform extensive experiments on speaker verification, speaker diarization, speech recognition, and speech editing tasks, offering crucial insights for the development of speech technologies targeting this age group.</description>

      <title>SteerMusic: Enhanced Musical Consistency for Zero-shot Text-Guided and Personalized Music Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Music editing is an important step in music production, which has broad applications, including game development and film production. Most existing zero-shot text-guided editing methods rely on pretrained diffusion models by involving forward-backward diffusion processes. However, these methods often struggle to preserve the musical content. Additionally, text instructions alone usually fail to accurately describe the desired music. In this paper, we propose two music editing methods that improve the consistency between the original and edited music by leveraging score distillation. The first method, SteerMusic, is a coarse-grained zero-shot editing approach using delta denoising score. The second method, SteerMusic+, enables fine-grained personalized music editing by manipulating a concept token that represents a user-defined musical style. SteerMusic+ allows for the editing of music into user-defined musical styles that cannot be achieved by the text instructions alone. Experimental results show that our methods outperform existing approaches in preserving both music content consistency and editing fidelity. User studies further validate that our methods achieve superior music editing quality.</description>

      <title>Two-stage Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction System for Real-Time Processing On Edge Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction (AVTSE) aims to isolate a target speaker's voice in a multi-speaker environment with visual cues as auxiliary. Most of the existing AVTSE methods encode visual and audio features simultaneously, resulting in extremely high computational complexity and making it impractical for real-time processing on edge devices. To tackle this issue, we proposed a two-stage ultra-compact AVTSE system. Specifically, in the first stage, a compact network is employed for voice activity detection (VAD) using visual information. In the second stage, the VAD results are combined with audio inputs to isolate the target speaker's voice. Experiments show that the proposed system effectively suppresses background noise and interfering voices while spending little computational resources.</description>

      <title>HQ-SVC: Towards High-Quality Zero-Shot Singing Voice Conversion in Low-Resource Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot singing voice conversion (SVC) transforms a source singer's timbre to an unseen target speaker's voice while preserving melodic content without fine-tuning. Existing methods model speaker timbre and vocal content separately, losing essential acoustic information that degrades output quality while requiring significant computational resources. To overcome these limitations, we propose HQ-SVC, an efficient framework for high-quality zero-shot SVC. HQ-SVC first extracts jointly content and speaker features using a decoupled codec. It then enhances fidelity through pitch and volume modeling, preserving critical acoustic information typically lost in separate modeling approaches, and progressively refines outputs via differentiable signal processing and diffusion techniques. Evaluations confirm HQ-SVC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot SVC methods in conversion quality and efficiency. Beyond voice conversion, HQ-SVC achieves superior voice naturalness compared to specialized audio super-resolution methods while natively supporting voice super-resolution tasks.</description>
