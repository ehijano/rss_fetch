      <title>Revisiting Nishimori multicriticality through the lens of information measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum error correction threshold is closely related to the Nishimori physics of random statistical models. We extend quantum information measures such as coherent information beyond the Nishimori line and establish them as sharp indicators of phase transitions. We derive exact inequalities for several generalized measures, demonstrating that each attains its extremum along the Nishimori line. Using a fermionic transfer matrix method, we compute these quantities in the 2d $\pm J$ random-bond Ising model-corresponding to a surface code under bit-flip noise-on system sizes up to $512$ and over $10^7$ disorder realizations. All critical points extracted from statistical and information-theoretic indicators coincide with high precision at $p_c=0.1092212(4)$, with the coherent information exhibiting the smallest finite-size effects. We further analyze the domain-wall free energy distribution and confirm its scale invariance at the multicritical point.</description>

      <title>Integrability of a family of clean SYK models from the critical Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the integrability of a family of SYK models with uniform $p$-body interactions. We derive the R-matrix and mutually commuting transfer matrices that generate the Hamiltonians of these models, and obtain their exact eigenspectra and eigenstates. Remarkably, the R-matrix is that of the critical transverse-field Ising chain. This work reveals an unexpected connection between the SYK model, central to many-body quantum chaos, and the critical Ising chain, a cornerstone of statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Burgers dynamics for Poisson point process initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the statistical properties of one-dimensional Burgers dynamics evolving from stochastic initial conditions defined by a Poisson point process for the velocity potential, with a power-law intensity. Thanks to the geometrical interpretation of the solution in the inviscid limit, in terms of first-contact parabolas, we obtain explicit results for the multiplicity functions of shocks and voids, and for velocity and density one- and two-point correlation functions and power spectra. These initial conditions gives rise to self-similar dynamics with probability distributions that display power-law tails. In the limit where the exponent $\alpha$ of the Poisson process that defines the initial conditions goes to infinity, the power-law tails steepen to Gaussian falloffs and we recover the spatial distributions obtained in the classical study by Kida (1979) of Gaussian initial conditions with vanishing large-scale power.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature entropies and possible states in geometrically frustrated magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entropy that an insulating magnetic material releases upon cooling can reveal important information about the properties of spin states in that material. In many geometrically frustrated (GF) magnetic compounds, the heat capacity exhibits a low-temperature peak that comes from the spin states continuously connected to the ground states of classical models, such as the Ising model, on the same GF lattice, which manifests in the amount of entropy associated with this heat-capacity peak. In this work, we simulate numerically the values of entropy released by higher-spin triangular-lattice layered systems and materials on SCGO lattices. We also compare the experimentally measured values of entropy in several strongly GF compounds, $NiGa_2S_4$, $FeAl_2Se_4$ and SCGO/BSZCGO, with possible theoretical values inferred from the classical models to which the quantum states of those materials may be connected. This comparison suggests that the lowest-energy states of higher-spin layered triangular-lattice compounds can be described in terms of doublet states on individual magnetic sites. Our analyses demonstrate how the values of entropy can reveal the structure of low-energy magnetic states in GF compounds and call for more accurate thermodynamic measurement in GF magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Classical shadows for sample-efficient measurements of gauge-invariant observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical shadows provide a versatile framework for estimating many properties of quantum states from repeated, randomly chosen measurements without requiring full quantum state tomography. When prior information is available, such as knowledge of symmetries of states and operators, this knowledge can be exploited to significantly improve sample efficiency. In this work, we develop three classical shadow protocols tailored to systems with local (or gauge) symmetries to enable efficient prediction of gauge-invariant observables in lattice gauge theory models which are currently at the forefront of quantum simulation efforts. For such models, our approaches can offer exponential improvements in sample complexity over symmetry-agnostic methods, albeit at the cost of increased circuit complexity. We demonstrate these trade-offs using a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory, where a dual formulation enables a rigorous analysis of resource requirements, including both circuit depth and sample complexity.</description>

      <title>Universal first-passage time statistics for quantum diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-passage phenomena play a fundamental role in classical stochastic processes. We here exactly solve a quantum first-passage time problem for quantum diffusion driven by measurement noise, a generalization of classical Brownian motion. Such continuous monitoring may trap the measured quantum system in a decoherence-free subspace, a fraction of the available state space that is isolated from the surroundings, and thus plays an important role in quantum information science. We analytically determine the first-passage time distribution, whose form neither depends on the system Hamiltonian nor on the measurement operator, and is therefore universal. These results provide a general framework to investigate the first-passage statistics of diffusive quantum trajectories.</description>

      <title>Directional quantum walks of two bosons on the Hatano-Nelson lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the interplay of interactions and non-Hermiticity in the dynamics of two bosons on the one-dimensional Hatano-Nelson lattice with non-reciprocal tunneling. We find that the non-reciprocity in the tunneling leads to the formation of an asymmetric density cone during the time-evolution of the system; the degree of asymmetry can be tuned by tuning the non-reciprocity parameter, $\delta$. Next, we analyze the dynamics of this system in the presence of a static external force and demonstrate that non-Hermiticity leads to asymmetric two-particle Bloch oscillations. Interestingly, when $F=0$ ($F \ne 0$), strong interactions leads to the formation of an inner density-cone (density-hourglass) structure; this inner structure also becomes asymmetric in the presence of non-Hermiticity. We further analyze the spatial correlations and establish that the system exhibits non-reciprocal bunching (anti-bunching) in the presence of weak (strong) interactions. Finally, we examine the growth of the Quantum Fisher Information, $F_Q$, with time, and demonstrate that $F_Q \propto t^{\alpha}$ where $\alpha \sim 3$. This feature persists for both one- and two-particle walks, thereby demonstrating that this system can be employed as a quantum-enhanced sensor for detecting weak forces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equalities are generally more suitable for experimental verification than inequalities. In this work, I derive valid equalities from the Euler-Lagrange equation for the optimization of macroscopic thermodynamic averages in weakly driven classical open systems. These equalities show that optimization occurs when work and heat become path-independent. I illustrate their applicability by employing them as a convergence criterion in the global optimization technique of genetic programming. Moreover, due to fluctuation-dissipation relations for internal energy, work, and heat, analogous results hold for their variances.</description>

      <title>A Thermodynamic Model for Thermomigration in Metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms involved in the thermomigration of interstitial hydrogen in metals. Using irreversible thermodynamics, we develop a comprehensive mechanistic model to capture the controlling effects. Crucially, through validation against published experimental data, our results demonstrate that an electron-wind effect plays a significant role, particularly for materials in which the thermomigration direction matches the heat flux. These findings provide new insights into the factors that affect the localisation of solutes in metals. Moreover, our results indicate that atomistic models may be inadequate for detailed thermomigration studies due to the omission of electronic effects.</description>

Abstract: We provide an overview of studies of hysteresis in models of magnets. We discuss the shape of the hysteresis loop, dynamical symmetry breaking, and the dependence of the area of the loop on the amplitude and frequency of the driving field. We also discuss Barkhausen noise in the hysteresis loops, where the wide distribution of sizes of magnetization jumps may be modeled by the random-field Ising model. We discuss the distribution of sizes of these jumps in the random field Ising model on the Bethe lattice.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Criticality of Absorbing State Transition toward Jamming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The jamming transition is traditionally regarded as a geometric transition governed by static contact networks. Recently, dynamic phase transitions of athermal particles under periodic shear provide a new lens on this problem, leading to a conjecture that jamming transition corresponds to an absorbing-state transition within the Manna (conserved directed percolation) universality class. Here, by re-examining the biased random organization model, a minimal model for particles under periodic shearing that the conjecture is based on, we uncover several criticality anomalies at high density at odds with Manna universality class. In three-dimensional monodisperse systems, we find crystallization disrupts the absorbing transition, while in dense binary mixtures, a distinct transition from absorbing to active-glass states emerges, signifying a new universality class of dynamic phase transition. Closer to the jamming point, the quenched heterogeneity in the contact network smears the dynamic transition via Griffiths effects and drives the system toward heterogeneous directed percolation. We propose a field theory with fractional time dynamics that unifies these phenomena, establishing a theoretical framework linking jamming, disorder, and dynamic criticality.</description>

      <title>When Heating Isn't Cooling in Reverse: Nos\'e-Hoover Thermostat Fluctuations from Equilibrium Symmetry to Nonequilibrium Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25747v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent laboratory experiments suggest an intrinsic asymmetry between heating and cooling, with heating occurring more efficiently. Two decades earlier, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations had examined a related setup - heating one side of a computational cell while cooling the other via distinct thermostats. We revisit those calculations, recapitulating the underlying theory and showing that earlier MD results already hinted at the observed laboratory asymmetry. Recent realizations of a simple two-dimensional single-particle model, thermostatted in $x$ and $y$ at different temperatures, reproduces key features: at equilibrium, thermostat variables were identical, but under nonequilibrium conditions, the heating variable is weaker than the cooling one. At the same time, MD simulations from four decades ago by Evans and Holian reported a surprising skew in the Nose--Hoover thermostat variable $\xi$ under equilibrium - indicating a statistical bias in energy injection versus extraction. We revisit those results with exact reproduction of their setup. We show that when (1) the center-of-mass velocity is set to zero, (2) integration is done carefully with finite differencing, and (3) sampling is sufficiently long, the distribution of $\xi$ is symmetric and Gaussian with zero mean, as predicted by theory and validated by two independent error estimates. However, in the two-temperature cell, the distribution of thermostat variables become asymmetric, the cold bath requires significantly stronger damping than the hot bath requires anti-damping, with $\langle \xi_x \rangle / \langle \xi_y \rangle = -T_y/T_x$. This exact analytic relation links thermostat effort to thermal bias and the negative rate of change in the entropy of the system. These results identify the microscopic origin of heating-cooling asymmetry as a genuine nonequilibrium effect, consistent with experimental findings.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of thermal active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active matter concerns many-body systems comprised of living or self-driven agents that collectively exhibit macroscopic phenomena distinct from conventional passive matter. Using Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory, we develop a novel hydrodynamic framework for thermal active matter that accounts for energy balance, local temperature variations, and the ensuing stochastic effects. By modelling active matter as a driven open system, we show that the source of active contributions to hydrodynamics, violations of fluctuation-dissipation theorems, and detailed balance is rooted in the breaking of time-translation symmetry due to the presence of fuel consumption and an external environmental bath. In addition, our framework allows for non-equilibrium steady states that produce entropy, with a well-defined notion of steady-state temperature. We use our framework of active hydrodynamics to develop effective field theory actions for active superfluids and active nematics that offer a first-principle derivation of various active transport coefficients and feature activity-induced phase transitions. We also show how to incorporate temperature, energy and noise in fluctuating hydrodynamics for active matter. Our work suggests a broader perspective on active matter that can leave an imprint across scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum conductors attached to metallic reservoirs have been demonstrated to overcome the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR), a trade-off relation between the amount of dissipation and the absence of charge and heat current fluctuations. Here, we report large TUR violations when superconducting reservoirs replace metallic ones. The coexistence of different transport processes, namely (multiple) Andreev reflection, where electrons and their retro-reflected holes create Cooper pairs, in addition to the normal quasiparticle transport is identified as the source for such TUR breakdowns. The large TUR violation is a remarkable advantage for building low dissipative and highly stable quantum thermal machines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the large-order behavior of the functional renormalization group (FRG). For a model in dimension zero, we establish Borel-summability for a large class of microscopic couplings. Writing the derivatives of FRG as contour integrals, we express the Borel-transform as well as the original series as integrals. Taking the strong-coupling limit in this representation, we show that all short-ranged microscopic disorders flow to the same universal fixed point. Our results are relevant for FRG in disordered elastic systems.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Dynamics of Superparamagnetic Colloidal Microrobots with Tailored Statistics</title>

Abstract: Living organisms have developed advanced motion strategies for efficient space exploration, serving as inspiration for the movements of microrobots. These real-life strategies often involve anomalous dynamics displaying random movement patterns that deviate from Brownian motion. Despite their biological inspiration, autonomous stochastic navigation strategies of current microrobots remain much less versatile than those of their living counterparts. Supported by theoretical reasoning, this work demonstrates superparamagnetic colloidal microrobots with fully customizable stochastic dynamics displaying the entire spectrum of anomalous diffusion, from subdiffusion to superdiffusion, across statistically significant spatial and temporal scales (covering at least two decades). By simultaneously tuning microrobots' step-length distribution and, critically, their velocity autocorrelation function with magnetic fields, fundamental anomalous dynamics are reproduced with tailored properties mimicking L\'evy walks and fractional Brownian motion. These findings pave the way for programmable microrobotic systems that replicate optimal stochastic navigation strategies found in nature for applications in medical robotics and environmental remediation.</description>

      <title>Surmise for random matrices' level spacing distributions beyond nearest-neighbors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20134</link>

Abstract: Correlations between energy levels can help distinguish whether a many-body system is of integrable or chaotic nature. The study of short-range and long-range spectral correlations generally involves quantities which are very different, unless one uses the $k$-th nearest neighbor ($k$NN) level spacing distributions. For nearest-neighbor (NN) spectral spacings, the distribution in random matrices is well captured by the Wigner surmise. This well-known approximation, derived exactly for a 2$\times$2 matrix, is simple and satisfactorily describes the NN spacings of larger matrices. There have been attempts in the literature to generalize Wigner's surmise to further away neighbors. However, as we show, the current proposal in the literature fails to accurately capture numerical data. Using the known variance of the distributions from random matrix theory, we propose a corrected surmise for the $k$NN spectral distributions. This surmise better characterizes spectral correlations while retaining the simplicity of Wigner's surmise. We test the predictions against numerical results and show that the corrected surmise is systematically more accurate at capturing data from random matrices. Using the XXZ spin chain with random on-site disorder, we illustrate how these results can be used as a refined probe of many-body quantum chaos for both short- and long-range spectral correlations.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Ion Conduction Enabled by Site Percolation in Random Substitutional Crystals</title>

Abstract: Efficient and safe energy storage technologies are essential for realizing a sustainable and electrified society. Among the key challenges, the design of superionic conductors for all-solid-state batteries often faces a fundamental trade-off between stability and ionic conductivity. Random substitutional crystals, where atomic species are randomly distributed throughout a crystal lattice, present a promising route to overcome this trade-off. Although the importance of cooperative motion in ion conduction has been pointed out, there is a lack of understanding of the relationship between mesoscale structural organization and macroscopic conductivity, limiting the rational design of optimal compositions. Here, we systematically investigate the ionic conductivity of rock salt random substitutional ionic crystals Li$_x$Pb$_{1-2x}$Bi$_x$Te as a function of Li concentration $x$ using molecular dynamics simulations. We find that ionic conductivity increases sharply once the $x$ exceeds a critical threshold, without disrupting the underlying crystal structure. Strikingly, this threshold aligns with the site-percolation threshold predicted by percolation theory. Our findings establish ion percolation as a universal design principle that reconciles the trade-off between conductivity and stability, offering a simple and broadly applicable strategy for the development of robust, high-performance solid electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Anomalous grain dynamics and grain locomotion of odd crystals</title>

Abstract: Crystalline or polycrystalline systems governed by odd elastic responses are known to exhibit complex dynamical behaviors involving self-propelled dynamics of topological defects with spontaneous self-rotation of chiral crystallites. Unveiling and controlling the underlying mechanisms require studies across multiple scales. We develop such a type of approach that bridges between microscopic and mesoscopic scales, in the form of a phase field crystal model incorporating transverse interactions. This continuum density field theory features two-dimensional parity symmetry breaking and odd elasticity, and generates a variety of interesting phenomena that agree well with recent experiments and particle-based simulations of active and living chiral crystals, including self-rotating crystallites, dislocation self-propulsion and proliferation, and fragmentation in polycrystals. We identify a distinct type of surface cusp instability induced by self-generated surface odd stress that results in self-fission of single-crystalline grains. This mechanism is pivotal for the occurrence of various anomalous grain dynamics for odd crystals, particularly the predictions of a transition from normal to reverse Ostwald ripening for self-rotating odd grains, and a transition from grain coarsening to grain self-fragmentation in the dynamical polycrystalline state with an increase of transverse interaction strength. We also demonstrate that the single-grain dynamics can be maneuvered through the variation of interparticle transverse interactions. This allows to steer the desired pathway of grain locomotion and to control the transition between grain self-rotation, self-rolling, and self-translation. Our results provide insights for the design and control of structural and dynamical properties of active odd elastic materials.</description>

      <title>Shape-Determined Kinetic Pathways in 2D Solid-Solid Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solid-solid phase transitions are ubiquitous in nature, but the kinetic pathway of anisotropic particle systems remains elusive, where the coupling between translational and rotational motions plays a critical role in various kinetic processes. Here we investigate this problem by molecular dynamics simulation for two-dimensional ball-stick polygon systems, where pentagon, hexagon, and octagon systems all undergo an isostructural solid-solid phase transition. During heating, the translational motion exhibits merely a homogeneous expansion, whereas the time evolution of body-orientation is shape-determined. The local defects of body-orientation self-organize into a vague stripe for pentagon, a random pattern for hexagon, while a distinct stripe for octagon. The underlying kinetic pathway of octagon adheres to the quasi-equilibrium assumption, whereas the pathways of hexagon and pentagon are governed by translational and rotational motion, respectively. This diversity is originated from different kinetic coupling modes determined by the anisotropy of molecules, and can affect the phase transition rates. The reverse process in terms of cooling follows the same mechanism, with more diverse kinetic pathways attributed to the possible kinetic traps. Our findings promote the theoretical understanding of microscopic kinetics of solid-solid phase transitions as well as provide direct guidance for the rational design of materials utilizing desired kinetic features.</description>

      <title>Perfect quantum state transfer through a chaotic spin chain via many-body scars</title>

Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) offer a mechanism for weak ergodicity breaking, enabling non-thermal dynamics to persist in a chaotic many-body system. While most studies of QMBS focus on anomalous eigenstate properties or long-lived revivals of local observables, their potential for quantum information processing remains largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that \emph{perfect quantum state transfer} can be achieved in a strongly interacting, quantum chaotic spin chain by exploiting a sparse set of QMBS eigenstates embedded within an otherwise thermal spectrum. These results show that QMBS in chaotic many-body systems may be harnessed for information transport tasks typically associated with integrable models.</description>

      <title>Response function as a quantitative measure of consciousness in brain dynamics</title>

Abstract: Understanding the neural correlates of consciousness remains a central challenge in neuroscience. In this study, we investigate the relationship between consciousness and neural responsiveness by analyzing intracranial ECoG recordings from non-human primates across three distinct states: wakefulness, anesthesia, and recovery. Using a nonequilibrium recurrent neural network (RNN) model, we fit state-dependent cortical dynamics to extract the neural response function as a dynamics complexity indicator. Our findings demonstrate that the amplitude of the neural response function serves as a robust dynamical indicator of conscious state, consistent with the role of a linear response function in statistical physics. Notably, this aligns with our previous theoretical results showing that the response function in RNNs peaks near the transition between ordered and chaotic regimes -- highlighting criticality as a potential principle for sustaining flexible and responsive cortical dynamics. Empirically, we find that during wakefulness, neural responsiveness is strong, widely distributed, and consistent with rich nonequilibrium fluctuations. Under anesthesia, response amplitudes are significantly suppressed, and the network dynamics become more chaotic, indicating a loss of dynamical sensitivity. During recovery, the neural response function is elevated, supporting the gradual re-establishment of flexible and responsive activity that parallels the restoration of conscious processing. Our work suggests that a robust, brain-state-dependent neural response function may be a necessary dynamical condition for consciousness, providing a principled framework for quantifying levels of consciousness in terms of nonequilibrium responsiveness in the brain.</description>

      <title>Emergent Topology of Optimal Networks for Synchrony</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world networks, whether shaped by evolution or intelligent design, are typically optimized for functionality while adhering to physical, geometric, or budget constraints. Yet tools to identify such structures remain limited. We develop a gradient-based optimization framework to identify synchrony-optimal weighted networks under a constrained coupling budget. The resulting networks exhibit counterintuitive features: they are sparse, bipartite, elongated, and extremely monophilic (i.e., the neighbors of any node are similar to one another while differing from the node itself). These findings are matched by "constructive" theory: a nonlinear differential equation identifies which pairs of nodes are coupled, while a variational principle prescribes the budget allocated to each node. Dynamics unfolding over optimal networks provably lack a synchronization threshold; instead, as the budget exceeds a calculable critical value, the system globally phase-locks, exhibiting critical scaling at the transition. Our results have implications for power grids, neuromorphic computing, and other coupled oscillator technologies.</description>
