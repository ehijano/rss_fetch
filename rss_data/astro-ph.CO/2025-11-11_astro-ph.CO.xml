      <title>Probing Dark Energy Microphysics with kSZ Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accelerated expansion of the Universe is well established by geometric probes, yet its physical origin remains poorly understood. Most constraints on dark energy arise from background observables -- supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the cosmic microwave background -- which mainly test the homogeneous expansion history. To move beyond this limitation, we examine how kinetic Sunyaev--Zel'dovich (kSZ) tomography, combined with galaxy clustering, can probe perturbative effects of dark energy and improve constraints on its background parameters. Using a Fisher-matrix analysis of the joint power spectra for LSST- and CMB-S4-like surveys, we quantify the additional information kSZ tomography contributes to dark-energy inference. Including kSZ data tightens constraints on $w_0$ by 15 % and on $w_a$ by 32 %, with parameter degeneracies distinct from those of geometric probes. We also assess the detectability of dark-energy perturbations through a two-parameter model, finding that for canonical sound speed ($c_s=1$) the effects are sub-percent and confined to horizon scales, while smaller sound speeds shift them to accessible $k$-ranges. Near-term kSZ measurements will primarily serve to test the consistency between background and perturbative signals, while future low-noise, high-resolution surveys may begin to uncover the microphysical properties of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Grand Unification Higgs-$\mathcal{R}^2$ Inflation: Complementarity between Proton Decay and CMB Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a predictive $SO(10)$ Grand Unified Theory (GUT) framework for cosmic inflation in the Palatini $\mathcal{R}^2$ formulation of gravity. In this model, a GUT Higgs field both drives inflation and induces intermediate-scale symmetry breaking, thereby linking primordial cosmology, gauge unification, and topological defect formation. A partial inflationary phase of $N_I \sim 10$--$17$ $e$-folds following monopole formation can dilute magnetic monopoles to abundances $Y_M \sim 10^{-35}$--$10^{-27}$. The model yields Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) predictions of $0.955 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.974$, accommodating the tensions between Planck-BICEP ($n_s \approx 0.965$) and Planck+ACT ($n_s \approx 0.971$) via $\phi &lt; M$ and $\phi &gt; M$ branches repectively. The predicted tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \lesssim 8\times10^{-4}$ lies within current observational constraints and is accessible to forthcoming experiments, including the Simons Observatory and LiteBIRD. The resulting correlations between the unification scale $M_U$, the inflationary observables $(n_s, r)$, and proton-decay lifetimes highlight a complementarity between CMB measurements and proton-decay searches, with regions of parameter space testable in forthcoming experiments such as Hyper-Kamiokande and DUNE.</description>

      <title>Particle loads for cosmological simulations with equal-mass dark matter and baryonic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional cosmological hydrodynamical simulations usually assume equal-numbered but unequal-mass dark matter and baryonic particles, which can lead to spurious collisional heating due to energy equipartition. To avoid such a numerical heating effect, a simulation setup with equal-mass dark matter and baryonic particles, which corresponds to a particle number ratio of $N_{\rm DM}:N_{\rm gas} = \Omega_{\rm cdm} / \Omega_{\rm b}$, is preferred. However, previous studies have typically used grid-based particle loads to prepare such initial conditions, which can only reach specific values for $N_{\rm DM}:N_{\rm gas}$ due to symmetry requirements. In this study, we propose a method based on the glass approach that can generate two-component particle loads with more general $N_{\rm DM}:N_{\rm gas}$ ratios. The method simultaneously relaxes two Poisson particle distributions by introducing an additional repulsive force between particles of the same component. We show that the final particle load closely follows the expected minimal power spectrum, $P(k) \propto k^{4}$, exhibits good homogeneity and isotropy properties, and remains sufficiently stable under gravitational interactions. Both the dark matter and gas components individually also exhibit uniform and isotropic distributions. We apply our method to two-component cosmological simulations and demonstrate that an equal-mass particle setup effectively mitigates the spurious collisional heating that arises in unequal-mass simulations. Our method can be extended to generate multi-component uniform and isotropic distributions. Our code based on Gadget-2 is available at https://github.com/liaoshong/gadget-2glass .</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a transcript of the joint talk we gave at the Sixth Gruber Cosmology Conference at Yale University on 3 October 2025. We describe the key role played by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) in today's `Precision Cosmology', focusing in particular on the precise determination of the primordial abundance of deuterium. We describe the development of the ideas and methods of BBN research from their beginnings more than 75 years ago to the latest developments, and conclude with a forward look to likely advances expected towards the end of the current decade.</description>

      <title>Starobinsky Inflation and the Latest CMB Data: A Subtle Tension?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the Starobinsky inflation model and the impact of curvature corrections, particularly a cubic $R^3$ term, to assess their behavior in light of the latest observational results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). With the recent sixth data release (DR6), the scalar spectral index was measured to be $n_s=0.9743 \pm 0.0034$, which appears to exclude the pure Starobinsky model at approximately the $2\sigma$ level. In this paper, we implement the Starobinsky inflationary potential directly into the CLASS code, without relying on the slow-roll approximation, and we constrain the number of e-folds of inflation $N_k$ using a theoretically motivated range derived from reheating considerations and standard couplings between matter fields and gravity. We show that it is still possible to identify a significant region of parameter space where the Starobinsky model remains highly consistent with the latest observational data. While the pure Starobinsky model remains a compelling candidate for cosmic inflation, we explore how including a cubic $R^3$ term can shift its predictions to better align with the Planck and ACT measurements.</description>

      <title>Redshift-Frame Systematics and Their Impact on the Hubble Constant from Pantheon+ Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a full-sky covariance-weighted analysis of redshift-frame consistency in the Pantheon+ Type~Ia supernova sample. Using 1,543 unique objects with heliocentric ($z_{\rm HEL}$) and cosmic microwave background ($z_{\rm CMB}$) redshifts, we quantify residual differences between frames. A statistically significant but physically small mean offset $\langle z_{\rm CMB} - z_{\rm HEL} \rangle = (-3.8 \pm 0.1)\times10^{-4}$ is found, exhibiting a sign reversal between low- and high-redshift subsets ($p = 3.8\times10^{-15}$). A dipole fit to the residuals yields an amplitude $A = (1.5 \pm 0.1)\times10^{-3}$ directed toward $(\mathrm{RA},\mathrm{Dec}) = (167.1^\circ, -1.6^\circ)$, consistent within $1^\circ$ of the CMB dipole. When propagated through a covariance-weighted Hubble fit, these effects shift the inferred Hubble constant by only $\Delta H_0 = 0.07~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ (about $1.3\%$ of the current Hubble tension). The recovered dipole aligns with the known solar motion relative to the CMB, validating the kinematic frame corrections in Pantheon+ and establishing a systematic floor for future bulk-flow searches.</description>

      <title>Turnover detection using the power spectrum and bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The turnover at the peak of the Fourier matter power spectrum encodes a fundamental signature of matter-radiation equality in the early Universe. This delivers a potential standard ruler, independent of baryon acoustic oscillations and therefore able to break parameter degeneracies and improve precision. Furthermore, the turnover scale is independent of redshift and clustering bias, allowing for stacking of the signals from redshift bins. In practice, the very large scale of the turnover means that sample variance and systematics are serious impediments to its detection. Detections of the turnover and measurements of its scale have been made in the WiggleZ, eBOSS, Quaia, and DESI surveys. Upcoming surveys should improve the detection significance and reduce errors on the turnover scale. We use MCMC forecasts for turnover detection in a spectroscopic Euclid-like survey and a futuristic MegaMapper-like survey. In addition to the power spectrum, we include the signal from the bispectrum in equilateral configurations. These surveys are forecast to detect the turnover at $\sim\! 6\sigma$ (Euclid-like) and $\sim\! 15\sigma$ (MegaMapper-like), with precision on the turnover scale of $\sim\! 4\%$ and $\sim\! 2\%$. The inclusion of the bispectrum delivers a modest improvement of $\sim\! 10-17\%$ in the constraints on the turnover scale.</description>

      <title>The poltergeist mechanism -- Enhancement of scalar-induced gravitational waves with early matter-dominated era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves induced by primordial density perturbations provide a powerful probe of the Universe's thermal history, which may include an early matter-dominated (eMD) era predicted by well-motivated particle-physics models. The induced GWs can be significantly enhanced when the Universe undergoes a sudden transition from an eMD era to an era with pressure, such as a radiation or kination era. This enhancement arises from the growth of density perturbations during the eMD era and their rapid oscillations during the era with pressure. This phenomenon is called the poltergeist mechanism. In this review, we explain the essence of the poltergeist mechanism and explore concrete scenarios in which such an enhancement can occur.</description>

      <title>On the Evidence for Violation of the Equivalence Principle in Disk Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the claimed observations of a gravitational external field effect (EFE) reported in Chae et al. We show that observations suggestive of the EFE can be interpreted without violating Einstein's equivalence principle, namely from known correlations between morphology, environment and dynamics of galaxies. While Chae et al's analysis provides a valuable attempt at a clear test of Modified Newtonian Dynamics, an evidently important topic, a re-analysis of the observational data does not permit us to confidently assess the presence of an EFE or to distinguish this interpretation from that proposed in this article.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Protected $\alpha$-Attractor Hybrid Inflation in Supergravity and Constraints from ACT DR6 and DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a symmetry-protected supergravity realization of hybrid $\alpha$-attractor inflation with a constant sequestered uplift. The model achieves an exact analytic embedding of the attractor geometry while maintaining vacuum stability and radiative control. The uplift, generated by a hidden St\"uckelberg $U(1)_D$ sector, preserves the inflaton dynamics and provides an independent handle on the post-inflationary vacuum energy. The framework yields precise next-to-leading-order predictions for the scalar spectral tilt and tensor amplitude, fully consistent with current ACT DR6, DESI DR2, and Planck data. Radiative and geometric corrections remain exponentially suppressed, ensuring the robustness of the inflationary trajectory. This construction offers a minimal, UV-complete, and testable benchmark for embedding $\alpha$-attractor inflation in supergravity, with tensor modes potentially observable by LiteBIRD and CMB-S4.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Inflation RIDES Again</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) results, we revisit chaotic inflation based on a single complex scalar field with mass term $M^2 |\Phi|^2$, which usually predicts a spectra index $n_s\approx 0.96$ but a too-large tensor to scalar ratio $r\approx 0.16$. With radiative corrections, the potential $M^2 |\Phi|^2 \ln \left( |\Phi|^2/\Lambda^2 \right)$ induces spontaneous symmetry breaking near the scale $\Lambda$, yielding a Pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson which can play the role of a quintessence field, hence radiative inflation and dark energy (RIDE). Including a non-minimal coupling to gravity
  $\xi |\Phi|^2 R^2$ reduces $r$, allowing a good fit of the RIDE model to Planck data. Allowing a small additional quartic coupling correction $\lambda |\Phi|^4$ increases both $n_s$ and $r$, with a good fit to ACT data sets achieved for $\xi \approx 1$.</description>

      <title>Hunting for Extragalactic Axion-like Dark Matter in a Decade-long Blazar Optical Polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) are well-motivated dark matter (DM) candidates whose coupling to photons induces periodic oscillations in the polarization angle of astrophysical light. This work reports the first search for such a signature using ten years of optical polarimetric monitoring of the blazar 1ES 1959+650. No statistically significant periodicity is detected using a Lomb-Scargle periodogram and Monte Carlo analysis. Assuming a central DM density in the host galaxy, this null result places tight upper limits on the ALP-photon coupling constant at $g_{a\gamma}&lt;(5.8 \times 10^{-14}-1.8\times 10^{-10})\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ across a broad ALP mass range of $m_a \sim (1.4\times10^{-23}-5.2\times10^{-20})\,\mathrm{eV}$. Our constraints surpass those from Very Long Baseline Array polarimetry of active galactic jets and are competitive with those from long-term Galactic pulsar timing of PSR J0437-4715 over the same ALP mass window. These results establish long-term blazar polarimetry as a competitive and complementary approach for probing axion-like DM on extragalactic scales.</description>

      <title>Symmetry of Bounce Solutions at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The seminal work of Coleman, Glaser, and Martin established that, at zero temperature, any non-trivial solution to the equations of motion with the least Euclidean action is $O(D)$-symmetric. This paper extends their foundational analysis to finite temperature. We rigorously prove that for a broad class of scalar potentials, any saddle-point configuration with the least action is necessarily $O(D\!-\!1)$-symmetric and monotonic in the spatial directions. This result provides a firm mathematical justification for the symmetry properties widely assumed in studies of thermal vacuum decay and cosmological phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe highlighted General Relativity's inability to naturally account for dark energy without invoking a finely tuned cosmological constant. In response, a wide range of alternative paradigms have been proposed. Among these, Teleparallel Gravity and Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity, which depart from the Riemannian framework of General Relativity and instead rely on torsion or non-metricity to describe gravitational interactions, have gained increasing attention in recent years. We explore extensions of these non-Riemannian approaches, aiming to replicate the observed late-time acceleration of the universe by emulating the cosmological constant's role. We also evaluate the consistency of these theories with local gravity constraints by studying their static, spherically symmetric solutions. We show that although some models can reproduce the desired cosmological behavior, they often fail to meet Solar System observational bounds, particularly through deviations in the predicted Eddington parameter. Our findings underscore the need for a unified approach that tests modified gravity theories across both cosmological and local scales.</description>

      <title>Nearly forgotten results in development of physical cosmology</title>

Abstract: It would be reasonable to recall some critical issues in physical cosmology development. GR was created by A. Einstein in 1915. In 1917 Einstein proposed the first (static) cosmological model. Soon after the A. Eddington proved that the model is unstable therefore it can not be realizable in nature. In 1922 and 1924 A. A. Friedmann found non-stationary solutions for cosmological equations written in the framework of GR. In 1927 G. Lemaitre obtained very similar results and, in addition, he derived the Hubble law (E. Hubble obtained this law from observations). Unfortunately, G. Lemaitre published his paper in not very popular Belgium journal. In 1931 Lemaitre proposed the first version of hot Universe model (he called it hypothesis of the primeval atom). In his book Lemaitre predicted even a background radiation as a signature of his model.
  One of the important property of the Lemaitre -- Gamow model was a prediction of CMB radiation with a temperature around a few K. It was recalled that the discovery of CMB radiation was done by T. Shmaonov in 1956 and his paper was published in 1957 (several years before Penzias and Wilson).
  In 1965, 1970 E. B. Gliner proposed vacuum like equation of matter which could correspond to exponential explosion of the Universe which was later called inflation. For decades in USSR, Friedmann's cosmological non-stationary models were treated as purely mathematical results without cosmologocal applications. On September 16, 1925 passed away untimely and it would be reasonable to remind today his great contribution in physical cosmology since the authors of book on Friedmann wrote that "similarly to Copernicus who forced the Earth to move Friedmann forced the Universe to expand".</description>

      <title>A JWST/NIRSpec Integral Field Unit Survey of Luminous Quasars at z ~ 5-6 (Q-IFU): Rest-frame Optical Nuclear Properties and Extended Nebulae</title>

Abstract: It remains debatable how billion-solar-mass supermassive black holes (SMBHs) form and evolve within the first billion years. We report results from a James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/NIRSpec integral field unit (IFU) survey of 27 luminous quasars at $z \sim 5$-$6$, enabling a systematic investigation of their key physical properties and the associated, extended line emission. Our sample hosts SMBHs with $\log(M_{\mathrm{BH}}/M_\odot) \sim 8.6$-$9.7$ and Eddington ratios of $\sim 0.1$-$2.6$ based on H$\beta$, and the H$\beta$-based and H$\alpha$-based BH mass are broadly consistent with each other. Our sample may have a slightly smaller median BH mass and larger median Eddington ratio than lower-redshift quasars within the same luminosity range, although the difference could still be explained by statistical uncertainties. They generally follow the empirical correlations between [O III] $\lambda$5007 equivalent width and bolometric luminosities or Eddington ratios formed by lower-redshift quasars. The majority of them fall within the Eigenvector~1 planes formed by lower-redshift quasars. Nevertheless, a subset of the sample shows enhanced, blueshifted [O III] emission associated with fast outflows. Spatially extended [O III] line emission is detected in 6 objects and shows morphologies and kinematics consistent with merging activities and/or turbulent and clumpy interstellar media (ISM). Tentative evidence of quasar radiative feedback shaping the ISM of a merging companion galaxy is seen in the object with the most extended [O III] emission. Our results provide crucial insight into the rapid growth of SMBHs and the gaseous environments they reside in at z$\sim$5-6.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Limit of Growing Gravitational Wave Memory from Sources in the Early Universe and Astrophysical Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the stochastic background of gravitational wave memory of growing type leads to a fractional Brownian motion increasing at the order of $t^{H}$ for large $t$ where $\frac{1}{2} &lt; H &lt;1$. This beats the scaling law of Brownian motion. In this article we investigate sources of gravitational waves in the early universe as well as in astrophysical settings. Cosmological sources may include primordial black holes or other sources immediately after the Big Bang when there were pockets of hot material, and large density fluctuations. Gravitational waves from mergers of primordial black holes produce memory. We show that due to the conditions in which these are taking place the gravitational wave memory will be increasing in time following a certain power law. Corresponding results hold for any gravitational wave memory from a cosmological source where the surrounding conditions are similar. The stochastic limit of these memories is a stochastic process growing in time faster than the $\sqrt{t}$ scaling law of Brownian motion. The latter is also typical for noise and for the limit of memory events as they have been mostly considered in the literature. In an expanding universe, the memory is enhanced by the expansion itself. Our results provide a tool to extract gravitational wave sources of this type from data using this memory signature. This would be particularly useful for the PTA data that has been already observed, answering the long-standing question on how to extract memory signals from the data. Further, the new results open up a new door to explore the conditions right after the Big Bang using the long-range dependence and further probability analysis.</description>

      <title>Mock Observations for the CSST Mission: Main Surveys--An Overview of Framework and Simulation Suite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) is a flagship space-based observatory. Its main survey camera is designed to conduct high spatial resolution near-ultraviolet to near-infrared imaging and low-resolution spectroscopic surveys. To maximize the scientific output of CSST, we have developed a comprehensive, high-fidelity simulation pipeline for reproducing both imaging and spectroscopic observations. This paper presents an overview of the simulation framework, detailing its implementation and components. Built upon the GalSim package and incorporating the latest CSST instrumental specifications, our pipeline generates pixel-level mock observations that closely replicate the expected instrumental and observational conditions. The simulation suite integrates realistic astrophysical object catalogs, instrumental effects, point spread function (PSF) modeling, and observational noises to produce accurate synthetic data. We describe the key processing stages of the simulation, from constructing the input object catalogs to modeling the telescope optics and detector responses. Furthermore, we introduce the most recent release of simulated datasets, which provide a crucial testbed for data processing pipeline developments, calibration strategies, and scientific analyses, ensuring that CSST will meet its stringent requirements. Our pipeline serves as a vital tool for optimizing CSST main survey strategies and ensuring robust cosmological measurements.</description>

      <title>Deep imaging of the very isolated dwarf galaxy NGC6789</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present deep optical imaging of the extremely isolated dwarf galaxy NGC 6789, obtained with the new 2-meter Two-meter Twin Telescope (TTT3) at Teide Observatory. Despite its location in the Local Void, NGC 6789 exhibits surprising recent central star formation equivalent to approximately 4% of its total stellar mass. The origin of the gas necessary for this level of star formation remains unknown. Our data reach surface brightness limits of 29.8, 29.4, and 28.9 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in the Sloan g, r, and i filters, respectively, and reveal no evidence of tidal features or merger remnants down to $\sim$30 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ (or equivalently, at a radial distance larger than 1.6 kpc). The galaxy's undisturbed outer elliptical morphology suggests that its recent central star formation was likely produced by either in-situ residual gas or by the accretion of external pristine gas not associated with a minor merging activity.</description>

      <title>Dynamical friction and measurements of the splashback radius in galaxy clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The splashback radius is one popular method of constraining the size of galaxy clusters, often measured through the logarithmic derivative of the galaxy number density profile. However, measuring the splashback radius through the galaxy number density has consistently produced smaller values of the splashback radius than those inferred from the underlying gravitational potential in simulations. Dynamical friction has been posited as one possible reason that splashback radii measured through galaxy number densities are reduced, since it decays the orbits of subhaloes within the halo. Dynamical friction is an emergent process, and as such, cannot be isolated or removed within N-body simulations. Here, we present simulations starting with isolated galaxy clusters drawn from the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation, where we explicitly control dynamical friction through an idealized model. We show that although dynamical friction can reduce measurements of the splashback radius, it does not have a significant effect on clusters with $M_\mathrm{200,mean} &gt; 10^{14} \mathrm{M_\odot}$, and thus cannot account for previously measured discrepancies.</description>

      <title>Spectral Imaging with QUBIC: building frequency maps from Time-Ordered-Data using Bolometric Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18698v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for relics from the inflation era in the form of B-mode polarization of the CMB is a major challenge in cosmology. The main obstacle appears to come from the complexity of Galactic foregrounds that need to be removed. Multi-frequency observations are key to mitigating their contamination and mapping primordial fluctuations. We present spectral-imaging, a method to reconstruct sub-frequency maps of the CMB polarization within the instrument's physical bandwidth, a unique feature of Bolometric Interferometry that could be crucial for foreground mitigation as it provides an increased spectral resolution. Our technique uses the frequency evolution of the shape of the Bolometric Interferometer's synthesized beam to reconstruct frequency information from the time domain data. We reconstruct sub-frequency maps using an inverse problem approach based on detailed modeling of the instrument acquisition. We use external data to regularize the convergence of the estimator and account for bandpass mismatch and varying angular resolution. The reconstructed maps are unbiased and allow exploiting the spectral-imaging capacity of QUBIC. Using end-to-end simulations of the QUBIC instrument, we perform a cross-spectra analysis to extract a forecast on the tensor-to-scalar ratio constraint of $\sigma(r)= 0.0225$ after component separation.</description>

Abstract: We provide an accurate forecast of the expected constraining power from the main void statistics -- the void size function and the void-galaxy cross-correlation function -- to be measured by the Roman reference High Latitude Spectroscopic Survey from the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Relying on a realistic galaxy mock lightcone, covering 2000 square degrees, we find more than $8\times 10^4 $ voids and explore their constraining power in the framework of three different cosmological models: $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0 w_{\rm a}$CDM. This work confirms the strong complementarity of different void statistics and showcases the constraining power to be expected from Roman voids thanks to the combination of its high tracer density and large observed volume.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Neural Ratio and Posterior Estimators to Distributional Shifts for Population-Level Dark Matter Analysis in Strong Gravitational Lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the robustness of Neural Ratio Estimators (NREs) and Neural Posterior Estimators (NPEs) to distributional shifts in the context of measuring the abundance of dark matter subhalos using strong gravitational lensing data. While these data-driven inference frameworks can be accurate on test data from the same distribution as the training sets, in real applications, it is expected that simulated training data and true observational data will differ in their distributions. We explore the behavior of a trained NRE and trained sequential NPEs to estimate the population-level parameters of dark matter subhalos from a large sample of images of strongly lensed galaxies with test data presenting distributional shifts within and beyond the bounds of the training distribution in the nuisance parameters (e.g., the background source morphology). While our results show that NREs and NPEs perform well when tested perfectly in distribution, they exhibit significant biases when confronted with slight deviations from the examples seen in the training distribution. This indicates the necessity for caution when applying NREs and NPEs to real astrophysical data, where high-dimensional underlying distributions are not perfectly known.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, a single field inflationary model driven by a mutated hilltop potential, a subclass of the hilltop models of inflation, is investigated. To constrain the parameter space, we employ the latest $r-n_{\rm s}$ constraints from Planck 2018, BICEP/Keck 2018, and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data, alongside reheating parameters $N_{\rm{re}}$, $T_{\rm{re}}$, and $\omega_{\rm{re}}$, and the model independent bound on the radiation dominated (RD) era $N_{\rm{rd}}$. Furthermore, the relic gravitational wave (GW) spectrum within the sensitivity domains of future GW detectors are analyzed. By combining CMB, reheating, RD era, and GW constraints, we find for the Planck+BK18 data that the inflationary duration is confined to $46 \leq N \leq 56$ (95\% CL) and $48.1 \leq N \leq 56$ (68\% CL). Moreover, the model parameter $\alpha$ is confined to $0.161 \leq \alpha \leq 0.890$ (95\% CL) and $0.217 \leq \alpha \leq 0.815$ (68\% CL). Inclusion of the ACT data further tighten the constraints to $54 \leq N \leq 56$ (95\% CL) and $0.29 \leq \alpha \leq 0.62$ (95\% CL), thereby enhancing the precision and robustness of the model predictions.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of dark energy and late-time cosmic expansion using the Weighted Function Regression method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11758v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent data from multiple supernova catalogs and DESI, when combined with CMB, suggest a non-trivial evolution of dark energy (DE) at the $2.5-4\sigma$ CL. This evidence is typically quantified using the CPL parametrization of the DE equation-of-state parameter which corresponds to a first-order Taylor expansion around $a = 1$. However, this truncation is to some extent arbitrary and may bias our interpretation of the data, potentially leading us to mistake spurious features of the best-fit CPL model for genuine physical properties of DE. In this work, we apply the Weighted Function Regression (WFR) method to eliminate the subjectivity associated with the choice of truncation order. We assign Bayesian weights to the various orders and compute weighted posterior distributions of the quantities of interest. Using this model-agnostic approach, we reconstruct some of the most relevant background quantities, examining the robustness of our results against variations in the CMB and SNIa likelihoods. Furthermore, we extend our analysis by allowing for negative DE. Our results corroborate previous indications of dynamical DE, now confirmed for the first time using the WFR method. The combined analysis of CMB, BAO, and SNIa data favors a DE component that transitions from phantom to quintessence at redshift $z_{\rm cross}\sim 0.4$. The probability of phantom crossing lies between 96.21% and 99.97%, depending on the SNIa data set used, and hence a simple monotonic evolution of the DE density is excluded at the $\sim 2-4\sigma$ CL. Moreover, we find no significant evidence for a negative dark energy density below $z\sim 2.5-3$. Our reconstructions do not address the Hubble tension, yielding values of $H_0$ consistent with the Planck/$\Lambda$CDM range. If SH0ES measurements are not affected by systematic biases, the evidence for dynamical dark energy may need to be reassessed. [abridged]</description>

      <title>Modeling of the High Column Density systems in The Lyman-Alpha Forest</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lyman-$\alpha$ forests observed in the spectra of high-redshift quasars can be used as a tracer of the cosmological matter density to study baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the Alcock-Paczynski effect. Extraction of cosmological information from these studies requires modeling of the forest correlations. While the models depend most importantly on the bias parameters of the intergalactic medium (IGM), they also depend on the numbers and characteristics of high-column-density systems (HCDs) ranging from Lyman-limit systems with column densities $\log_{10}\!\bigl(N_{\mathrm{HI}}/\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\bigr)&gt;17$ to damped Lyman-$\alpha$ systems (DLAs) with $\log_{10}\!\bigl(N_{\mathrm{HI}}/\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\bigr)&gt;20.2$. These HCDs introduce broad damped absorption characteristic of a Voigt profile. Consequently they imprint a component on the power spectrum whose modes in the radial direction are suppressed, leading to a scale-dependent bias. Using mock data sets of known HCD content, we test a model that describes this effect in terms of the distribution of column densities of HCDs, the Fourier transforms of their Voigt profiles and the bias of the halos containing the HCDs. Our results show that this physically well-motivated model describes the effects of HCDs with an accuracy comparable to that of the ad-hoc models used in published forest analyses. We also discuss the problems of applying the model to real data, where the HCD content and their bias is uncertain.</description>

      <title>The validity of separate-universe approach in transient ultra-slow-roll inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23571v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the breakdown of the separate-universe approximation during transitions in transient ultra-slow-roll inflation by analyzing the evolution of the comoving curvature perturbation ${\cal R}$ and its conjugate momentum $\Pi$. It is well known that spatial gradient terms lead to a failure of this approximation, particularly at the transition from slow-roll to ultra-slow-roll phase. We show that a similar breakdown also occurs during the second transition back to slow-roll when considering the evolution of $\Pi$. Interestingly, while the homogeneous solution for $\Pi$ accurately captures the dynamics across the first transition, it is the homogeneous solution for ${\cal R}$ that becomes valid across the second. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the spatial curvature term introduced in the extended $\delta N$ formalism of \cite{Artigas:2024ajh} can be interpreted as arising from the contribution of $\Pi$ to the energy density perturbation. Importantly, this modification of the local Hubble parameter is valid only when the first slow-roll parameter is both small and strictly constant.</description>

      <title>Wiener filtering and multi-tracer techniques for dark matter cross-correlations between gamma-ray emission and galaxy catalogs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cross-correlations between a gravitational tracer of dark matter and the contribution to the unresolved gamma-ray background (UGRB) from the radiation produced by the annihilation of the particles responsible for the dark matter, have been established as a powerful tool to investigate the particle physics nature of dark matter. Cross-correlations of the UGRB with galaxy catalogs, cluster catalogs and weak lensing have indeed been measured. In this paper we study statistical techniques that could improve the sensitivity of the cross-correlation techniques on the bounds that can be set to the particle dark matter physical properties. The two methods that we investigate are the application of a Wiener filter and the exploitation of the full multi-tracer information. After identifying the optimal strategies, we show that the adoption of a Wiener filter in the cross-correlation analysis can improve the sensitivity to the dark matter annihilation rate by a factor of 2/2.5 as compared to the standard analysis where no filter is applied. The inclusion of the full multi-tracer information can improve the sensitivity up to a factor of 5 for dark matter masses below about 50 GeV, the Wiener filter remaining the best option for heavier dark matter.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Evolving Dark Energy from LRG1-2 and Low-$z$ SNe Ia Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10514v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present evidence for evolving dark energy using baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2), combined with different Type Ia supernova calibrations (Pantheon$^+$, DES-SN5YR, and Union3) and the CMB compressed likelihood. In our analysis, we examined several dark energy models, including the Logarithmic, Exponential, CPL, BA, JBP, Thawing, Mirage, and GEDE parameterizations. We found that the evidence for evolving dark energy in the DESI measurements is primarily driven by the LRG1 and LRG2 tracers, as their combination yields a preferred value of $\omega_0 &gt; -1$. Further extending our analysis by combining other measurements, we find that all evolving dark energy models favor evolving dark energy scenario characterized by $\omega_0 &gt; -1$, $\omega_a &lt; 0$, and $\omega_0 + \omega_a &lt; -1$ (Quintom-B). Indeed, our results show a departure from the $\Lambda$CDM model at a significance level of up to $3$-$3.6\sigma$, with the DES-SN5YR sample showing the most significant deviation. When we exclude low-$z$ SNe Ia measurements from the DES-SN5YR sample, we find that the preference for evolving dark energy is significantly biased by the low-redshift ($z &lt; 0.01$) supernova sample. The evolution of $\omega(z)$ shows a phantom crossing around $z \sim 0.5$ in most of the dynamical dark energy models, and the evolution of $f_{DE}(z)$ further supports the evolving nature of dark energy. Bayesian analysis of model evidence shows that the inclusion of low-$z$ supernovae data significantly strengthens the support for evolving dark energy models such as JBP and Mirage, while models revert to inconclusive or weak support when low-$z$ data are excluded.</description>

      <title>Constraining deviations from $\Lambda$CDM in the Hubble expansion rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\Lambda$CDM cosmolgical model has long been regarded as highly successful in accurately describing a wide range of astronomical observations. However, numerous observational findings have also provided hints of discrepancies from the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM framework. We explore a phenomenological model that quantifies the deviation of the Hubble expansion rate from the standard scenario, which is expressed as $H^{2}(z) = H^{2}_{\rm \Lambda CDM}(\Omega_m, z)[1+\delta(z)]$. We consider three distinct forms for the deviation parameter $\delta(z)$: in model I, $\delta(z)=\delta_c$; in model II, $\delta(z)=\delta_{c}z/(1+z)$, and in model III, $\delta(z)=\delta_{c}{\rm ln}(1+z)$. Here, $\delta_c$ represents a constant value. We utilize a comprehensive set of observational data to constrain the models. Our results show that for most combined datasets, $\delta_c$ tends to take on negative values for models I and II, while consistently taking positive values in model III. Furthermore, we find that both models I and II remain consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model across all datasets examined. In contrast, model III exhibits a significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model, exceeding $2\sigma$ for the full combined datastes. The AIC indicates that models I and II are consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model, whereas model III is preferred over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, with the $\Lambda$CDM model being disfavored for the combined datasets DESI BAO + CMB + CC + DESY5. These results suggest that the Hubble expansion rate likely deviates from the standard $\Lambda$CDM prediction.</description>

      <title>Unified dark fluid with null sound speed as an alternative to phantom dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent BAO measurements from DESI, when combined with CMB and supernovae data, suggest evolving dark energy and in particular point to a possible phantom regime, with an equation of state parameter $w&lt;-1$.
  We explore an alternative phenomenological way to model dark matter and dark energy based on a unified dark fluid (UDF). By construction, our model reproduces the same background expansion history as DESI's best-fit using the CPL parametrization, but assumes a vanishing rest-frame sound speed and no anisotropic stress. This simple prescription ensures a consistent and physical treatment of perturbations and, in our case, the use of a unified dark sector avoids phantom behaviour. We model CMB, LSS, and redshift-space distortion observables, and find mostly small differences with CPL, suggesting that while stage IV CMB and galaxy surveys will be able to test these models, achieving a decisive distinction between them may prove challenging on linear scales. At the non-linear level, we study spherical collapse in the UDF and show that within this framework, structure formation proceeds very similarly to standard scenarios.
  Using Planck, DESI BAO DR2, and DES Y5 supernovae data, we demonstrate that this simple UDF model fits current observations nearly as well as CPL, while treating perturbations consistently. Because most cosmological observations are not sensitive to how the dark sector is split, the unified framework can also approximate the phenomenology of interacting dark energy-dark matter scenarios or evolving dark matter, making it a general way to model the data, at least as long as the dark components have a vanishing sound speed, which is the most distinctive feature of our analysis. Our results highlight that a unified dark fluid with evolving equation of state and null sound speed is sufficient to pass current constraints without invoking a phantom component.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Early Universe with Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22018v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogen is the most abundant element in our Universe. The first generation of stars and galaxies produced photons that ionized hydrogen gas, driving a cosmological event known as the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The upcoming Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) will map the distribution of neutral hydrogen during this era, aiding in the study of the properties of these first-generation objects. Extracting astrophysical information will be challenging, as SKAO will produce a tremendous amount of data where the hydrogen signal will be contaminated with undesired foreground contamination and instrumental systematics. To address this, we develop the latest deep learning techniques to extract information from the 2D power spectra of the hydrogen signal expected from SKAO. We apply a series of neural network models to these measurements and quantify their ability to predict the history of cosmic hydrogen reionization, which is connected to the increasing number and efficiency of early photon sources. We show that the study of the early Universe benefits from modern deep learning technology. In particular, we demonstrate that dedicated machine learning algorithms can achieve more than a $0.95$ $R^2$ score on average in recovering the reionization history. This enables accurate and precise cosmological and astrophysical inference of structure formation in the early Universe.</description>

Abstract: We present results from a high-resolution interstellar turbulence simulation and show that it closely reproduces recent $Planck$ measurements. Our model captures the scaling of $EE$ and $BB$ spectra, and the $EE/BB$ ratio in the inertial range. The probability density function of the dust polarization fraction is also consistent with observations. The $TE$ cross-correlation is in broad agreement with the $Planck$ sky. This simulation provides new insights into the physical origins of the observed $E/B$ asymmetry and positive $TE$ signal, facilitating the development of advanced Galactic dust emission models for current and future cosmic microwave background experiments.</description>

      <title>Regulating Sommerfeld resonances for multi-state systems and higher partial waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18168v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-range attractive interactions between dark matter particles can significantly enhance their annihilation, particularly at low velocities. This ``Sommerfeld enhancement'' is typically computed by evaluating the deformation of the two-particle wavefunction due to the long-range potential, while ignoring the physics associated with the annihilation, and then scaling the appropriate annihilation matrix elements by factors that depend on the wavefunction in the limit where the particles approach zero relative separation. It has long been recognized that this approach is a valid approximation only in the limit where the annihilation rate is small, and breaks down in the regime where the enhanced annihilation rate approaches the unitarity bound, in which case ignoring the impact of the annihilation physics on the two-particle wavefunction cannot be justified and leads to apparent violations of unitarity. In the case where the physics relevant to annihilation occurs at a parametrically shorter distance scale (higher energy scale) compared with the long-range potential, we provide a simple prescription for correcting the Sommerfeld enhancement for the effects of the short-range physics, valid for all partial waves and for systems where multiple states are coupled by the long-range potential.</description>

      <title>Microlensing of lensed supernovae Zwicky &amp; iPTF16geu: constraints on the lens galaxy mass slope and dark compact object fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To date, only two strongly lensed type Ia supernovae (SNIa) have been discovered with an isolated galaxy acting as the lens: iPTF16geu and SN Zwicky. The observed image fluxes for both lens systems were inconsistent with predictions from a smooth macro lens model. A potential explanation for the anomalous flux ratios is microlensing: additional (de)magnification caused by stars and other compact objects in the lens galaxy. In this work, we combine observations of iPTF16geu and SN Zwicky with simulated microlensing magnification maps, leveraging their standardizable candle properties to constrain the lens galaxy mass slope, $\eta$, and the fraction of dark compact objects, $f_{\rm dc}$. The resulting mass slopes are $\eta = 1.70 \pm 0.07$ for iPTF16geu and $\eta = 1.81 \pm 0.10$ for SN Zwicky. Our results indicate no evidence for a population of dark compact objects, placing upper limits at the $95\%$ confidence level of $f_{\rm dc} &lt; 0.25$ for iPTF16geu and $f_{\rm dc} &lt; 0.47$ for SN Zwicky (for compact objects with masses above $ 0.02 M_{\odot}$). Assuming a constant fraction of dark compact objects for both lensed SNe, we obtain $f_{\rm dc} &lt; 0.19$. These results highlight the potential of strongly lensed SNIa to probe the innermost parts of lens galaxies and learn about compact matter.</description>

      <title>PAC in DESI. I. Galaxy Stellar Mass Function into the $10^{6}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ Frontier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01948v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Photometric Objects Around Cosmic Webs (PAC) method integrates cosmological photometric and spectroscopic surveys, offering valuable insights into galaxy formation. PAC measures the excess surface density of photometric objects, $\bar{n}_2w_{\rm{p}}$, with specific physical properties around spectroscopic tracers. In this study, we improve the PAC method to make it more rigorous and eliminate the need for redshift bins. We apply the enhanced PAC method to the DESI Y1 BGS Bright spectroscopic sample and the deep DECaLS photometric sample, obtaining $\bar{n}_2w_{\rm{p}}$ measurements across the complete stellar mass range, from $10^{5.3}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ to $10^{11.5}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ for blue galaxies, and from $10^{6.3}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ to $10^{11.9}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ for red galaxies. We combine $\bar{n}_2w_{\rm{p}}$ with $w_{\rm{p}}$ measurements from the BGS sample, which is not necessarily complete in stellar mass. Assuming that galaxy bias is primarily determined by stellar mass and colour, we derive the galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) down to $10^{5.3}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ for blue galaxies and $10^{6.3}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ for red galaxies, while also setting lower limits for smaller masses. The blue and red GSMFs are well described by single and double Schechter functions, respectively, with low-mass end slopes of $\alpha_{\rm{blue}}=-1.54^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ and $\alpha_{\rm{red}}=-2.50^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$, resulting in the dominance of red galaxies below $10^{7.6}{\rm M}_{\odot}$. Stage-IV cosmological photometric surveys, capable of reaching 2-3 magnitudes deeper than DECaLS, present an opportunity to explore the entire galaxy population in the local universe with PAC. This advancement allows us to address critical questions regarding the nature of dark matter, the physics of reionization, and the formation of dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>Probing Reionization-Era Galaxies with JWST UV Luminosity Functions and Large-Scale Clustering</title>

Abstract: JWST has transformed our understanding of early galaxy formation, providing an unprecedented view of the first billion years of cosmic history. In this work, we build upon our previously developed semi-analytical framework that self-consistently models the evolving UVLF of galaxies and the global reionization history while incorporating the effects of radiative feedback. Comparing our predictions with JWST and HST data, we identify a fundamental tension: models that match the UVLF fail to reproduce the observed evolution of galaxy clustering (bias) with redshift, and vice versa. To resolve this, we introduce a redshift- and mass-dependent duty cycle linked to the duration of star formation. This duty cycle increases towards higher redshifts, requiring either an enhanced production of UV radiation or increased star formation efficiency at z&gt;10 to match the JWST UVLFs, but declines at lower redshifts (5&lt;z&lt;=9) and towards low-mass halos to remain consistent with the bias and HST UVLF measurements. Reconciling theory with observations requires the characteristic star formation timescale to be longer in massive halos, and to decrease with redshift at fixed halo mass, evolving from ~ 85 Myr at z=6 to ~ 45 Myr at z=14 for $10^{10} M_\odot$ halos. Finally, our extended model, assuming a halo mass-dependent escaping ionizing efficiency ($\varepsilon_{\rm esc} \equiv f_{\rm esc} \times \xi_{\rm ion}$), whose population-averaged value gradually increases with redshift and corresponds to $\langle f_{\rm esc} \rangle \sim$ 15% at z=5 for a fixed value of $\xi_{\rm ion} = 10^{25.23}$ erg$^{-1}$ Hz across all galaxies, produces a reionization history consistent with current constraints. These findings underscore the importance of jointly constraining high-redshift galaxy models using both UVLF and bias statistics to accurately interpret JWST data and refine our understanding of early cosmic evolution.</description>

Abstract: The gas density profile around galaxies, shaped by feedback and affecting the galaxy lensing signal, is imprinted on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (kSZ). We precisely measure this effect ($S/N\approx 10$) via velocity stacking with more than 800,000 spectroscopically confirmed luminous red galaxies (LRG) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Y1 survey, which overlap with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 temperature maps over $\geq$ 4,000 deg$^2$. We explore the kSZ dependence with various galaxy parameters and find no significant trend with redshift, but clear trends with stellar mass and absolute magnitude in $g$, $r$, and $z$ bands. Our analysis suggests that the gas extends beyond the dark matter halo (99.5\% confidence, i.e. PTE = 0.005). We find a tentative preference for hydrodynamical simulation models with stronger feedback that drives gas further out (Illustris $z=0.5$, PTE = 0.37) over weaker-feedback cases (IllustrisTNG $z=0.8$, PTE = 0.045), though with limited statistical significance. In all cases, a free multiplicative amplitude was fit to the simulated profiles, and further modeling work is required to firm up these conclusions. We find consistency between kSZ profiles around spectroscopic and photometric LRG, with comparable statistical power, thus increasing our confidence in the photometric analysis. Additionally, we present the first kSZ measurement around DESI Y1 bright galaxy sample (BGS) and emission-line galaxies (ELG), whose features match qualitative expectations. Finally, we forecast $S/N \sim 50$ for future stacked kSZ measurements using data from ACT, DESI Y3, and Rubin Observatory. These measurements will serve as an input for galaxy formation models and baryonic uncertainties in galaxy lensing.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes from EFT of Black Hole Perturbations in Vector-Tensor Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of odd-parity perturbations on a static and spherically symmetric black hole background with a timelike vector field based on the effective field theory (EFT) approach. We derive the quadratic Lagrangian written in terms of two master variables, corresponding to the tensor and vector gravitons, which are coupled in general, while they can be decoupled on a stealth Schwarzschild(-de Sitter) background. For the stealth Schwarzschild background, we find that the quasinormal mode frequencies for both degrees of freedom are obtained from those in general relativity by simple scaling. Nonetheless, due to the fact that the metric perturbation is a non-trivial linear combination of the two degrees of freedom with different QNM spectra, the ringdown gravitational waves may exhibit characteristic modulation that can in principle be a signature of vector-tensor gravity.</description>

      <title>Opening up New Parameter Space for Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22463v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos are compelling dark matter (DM) candidates, yet the minimal production mechanism solely based on active ($\nu_a$)-sterile ($\nu_s$) oscillations is excluded by astrophysical observations. Non-standard self-interactions in either active ($\nu_a-\nu_a$) or sterile ($\nu_s-\nu_s$) sector are known to alter the sterile neutrino DM production in the early Universe, which could alleviate the tension with astrophysical constraints to some extent. Here we propose a novel solution where scalar-mediated non-standard interactions between active and sterile neutrinos ($\nu_a-\nu_s$) generate new production channels for $\nu_s$, independent of the active-sterile mixing and without the need for any fine-tuned resonance or primordial lepton asymmetry. This framework enables efficient sterile neutrino DM production even at vanishingly small mixing angles and opens up new viable regions of parameter space that can be tested with future $X$-ray and gamma-ray observations.</description>

      <title>A Mid-Thirties Crisis: Dissecting the Properties of Gravitational Wave Sources Near the 35 Solar Mass Peak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One striking feature of binary black hole (BBH) mergers observed in the first decade of gravitational-wave astronomy is an excess of events with component masses around $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Multiple formation channels have been proposed to explain this excess. To distinguish among these channels, it is essential to examine their predicted population-level distributions across additional parameters. In this work, we focus on BBH mergers near the $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak and infer the population distributions of primary mass ($m_1$), mass ratio ($q$), effective spin ($\chi_{\rm eff}$), and redshift ($z$). We observe a gradual increase in the merger rate with $m_1$, rising by a factor of $3$ from $20\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ to a peak around $34\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, followed by a sharp, order-of-magnitude decline by $50\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. This population also shows a weak preference for equal-mass mergers and has a $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution skewed toward positive values, with a median of zero excluded at approximately $90\%$ confidence. We find no significant $q-\chi_{\rm eff}$ correlation in the $35\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak population, suggesting that lower-mass systems ($m_1&lt;20\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) likely drive the $q-\chi_{\rm eff}$ anti-correlation observed in the full BBH merger catalog. The redshift evolution of the merger rate is consistent with the cosmic star formation rate. We compare our findings with predictions from a wide range of formation channels. We find that common variants of the pair-instability supernova scenario, as well as hierarchical mergers, are incompatible with the observed features of the $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ population. Ultimately, none of the formation channels we consider can explain all or even most of the features observed in this population. The ''mid-thirties'' of black hole mergers are in crisis.</description>

      <title>Matter-antimatter asymmetry in a rotating universe: Dirac spinors in axisymmetric Bianchi IX cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard $\Lambda$CDM model, based on a highly symmetric FLRW geometry, successfully explains many observations but faces unresolved issues, motivating the exploration of alternative cosmological frameworks. We investigate the influence of spacetime geometry on the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe within the Bianchi IX cosmological model. Motivated by early-universe dynamics, potential contributions to cosmological angular momentum, and the axisymmetric Bianchi IX model's relevance to certain CMB anomalies, we formulate the Dirac field in this background. Starting with a Lagrangian formalism, we derive the Dirac equation and develop the harmonic analysis of spinor fields, extending previous treatments in the Mixmaster universe. We solve the Dirac equations for non-rotating and rotating axisymmetric Bianchi IX spacetimes using a fixed-background approximation. We find that spatial anisotropy induces spin-dependent energy splittings, while global rotation produces particle-antiparticle asymmetries in the energy spectra, effects absent in FLRW models. These results demonstrate that spacetime geometry alone can imprint nontrivial structure on particle spectra, suggesting that geometric effects may contribute to the matter-antimatter asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Sommerfeld Enhancement from Quantum Forces for Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum forces are long-range interactions that arise only at the loop level. In this work, we study the Sommerfeld enhancement of dark matter (DM) annihilation cross sections caused by quantum forces. One notable feature of quantum forces is that they are subject to coherent enhancement in the presence of a background of mediator particles, which occurs in many situations in cosmology. We show that this effect has important implications for the Sommerfeld enhancement and DM physics. For the first time, we calculate the Sommerfeld factor induced by quantum forces for both bosonic and fermionic mediators, including the background corrections. We observe several novel features of the Sommerfeld factor that do not exist in the case of the Yukawa potential, such as temperature-induced resonance peaks for massless mediators, and having both enhancement and suppression effects in the same model with different DM masses. As direct applications, we discuss the DM phenomenology affected by the Sommerfeld enhancement from quantum forces, including thermal freeze-out, CMB spectral distortion from DM annihilation, and DM indirect detection. We highlight one particularly interesting effect relevant to indirect detection caused by the Sommerfeld enhancement in a non-thermal background of bosonic mediators in the galaxy, in which case the DM mass is shifted due to the background correction and the effective cross section for DM annihilation can be either enhanced or suppressed. This may be important for DM searches in the Milky Way or its satellite galaxies.</description>

      <title>The causal structure of galactic astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven astrophysics currently relies on the detection and characterisation of correlations between objects' properties, which are then used to test physical theories that make predictions for them. This process fails to utilise information in the data that forms a crucial part of the theories' predictions, namely which variables are directly correlated (as opposed to accidentally correlated through others), the directions of these determinations, and the presence or absence of confounders that correlate variables in the dataset but are themselves absent from it. We propose to recover this information through causal discovery, a well-developed methodology for inferring the causal structure of datasets that is however almost entirely unknown to astrophysics. We develop a causal discovery algorithm suitable for large astrophysical datasets and illustrate it on $\sim$5$\times10^5$ low-redshift galaxies from the Nasa Sloan Atlas, demonstrating its ability to distinguish physical mechanisms that are degenerate on the basis of correlations alone.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic properties in soliton field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The crucial role of hydrodynamic instabilities in soliton field theory is revealed. We demonstrate that the essential of soliton formation mechanism is the sound mode instability induced by thermodynamic instability. This instability triggers phase separation, where new thermal phases are generated to produce solitons. These solitons can be regarded as a coexistence state composed of a matter phase and a vacuum phase, with an interface providing surface tension to maintain dynamical equilibrium. The phase separation mechanism naturally allows the existence of vacuum bubbles, characterized by a vacuum phase surrounded by a matter phase with negative pressure. Furthermore, we show that the soliton interface resembles a fluid membrane, whose interface pressure satisfies a Young-Laplace-type relation, resulting in the emergence of the membrane instability induced by surface tension. In the thin-wall limit, the dispersion relation is analytically derived. This instability triggers topological transition of the interface, splitting a cylindrical interface into multiple spheres with a smaller total surface area. Such results highlight the duality between solitons and fluids, providing a field theory description for hydrodynamics with interfaces.</description>

      <title>The AGORA High-resolution Galaxy Simulations Comparison Project. X: Formation and Evolution of Galaxies at the High-redshift Frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations from JWST have revealed unexpectedly luminous galaxies, exhibiting stellar masses and luminosities significantly higher than predicted by theoretical models at Cosmic Dawn. In this study, we present a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations targeting high-redshift ($z \geq 10$) galaxies with dark matter halo masses in the range $10^{10} - 10^{11}\ {\rm M}_{\odot}$ at $z=10$, using state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulation codes (Enzo, Ramses, Changa, Gadget-3, Gadget-4, and Gizmo). This study aims to evaluate the convergence of the participating codes and their reproducibility of high-redshift galaxies with the galaxy formation model calibrated at relatively low redshift, without additional physics for high-redshift environments. The subgrid physics follows the AGORA CosmoRun framework, with adjustments to resolution and initial conditions to emulate similar physical environments in the early universe. The participating codes show consistent results for key galaxy properties (e.g., stellar mass), but also reveal notable differences (e.g., metallicity), indicating that galaxy properties at high redshifts are highly sensitive to the feedback implementation of the simulation. Massive halos (${\rm M}_{\rm halo}\geq5\times10^{10}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ at $z=10$) succeed in reproducing observed stellar masses, metallicities, and UV luminosities at $10\leq z\leq12$ without requiring additional subgrid physics, but tend to underpredict those properties at higher redshift. We also find that varying the dust-to-metal ratio modestly affects UV luminosity of simulated galaxies, whereas the absence of dust significantly enhances it. In future work, higher-resolution simulations will be conducted to better understand the formation and evolution of galaxies at Cosmic Dawn.</description>

      <title>Effective matter sectors from modified entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general formalism linking modified entropy functions directly to a modified spacetime metric and, subsequently, to an effective matter sector of entropic origin. In particular, within the framework of general relativity, starting from the first law of black-hole thermodynamics we establish an explicit correspondence between the entropy derivative and the metric function, which naturally leads to an emergent stress-energy tensor representing an anisotropic effective fluid. This backreaction effect of horizon entropy may resolve possible inconsistencies recently identified in black hole physics with modified entropies. As specific examples, we apply this procedure to a wide class of modified entropies, such as Barrow, Tsallis-Cirto, Renyi, Kaniadakis, logarithmic, power-law, loop-quantum-gravity, and exponential modifications, and we derive the associated effective matter sectors, analyzing their physical properties and energy conditions.</description>
