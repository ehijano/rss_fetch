      <title>When Agents are Powerful: Black Hole Search in Time-Varying Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A black hole is a harmful node in a graph that destroys any resource entering it, making its identification a critical task. In the \emph{Black Hole Search (BHS)} problem, a team of agents operates on a graph $G$ with the objective that at least one agent must survive and correctly identify an edge incident to the black hole. Prior work has addressed BHS in arbitrary dynamic graphs under the restrictive \emph{face-to-face} communication, where agents can exchange information only when co-located. This constraint significantly increases the number of agents required to solve the problem. In this work, we strengthen the capabilities of agents in two ways: (i) granting them \emph{global communication}, enabling interaction regardless of location, and (ii) equipping them with \emph{1-hop visibility}, allowing each agent to observe its immediate neighborhood. These enhancements lead to more efficient solutions for the BHS problem in dynamic graphs.</description>

      <title>Separation of Unconscious Robots with Obstructed Visibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a recently introduced \textit{unconscious} mobile robot model, where each robot is associated with a \textit{color}, which is visible to other robots but not to itself. The robots are autonomous, anonymous, oblivious and silent, operating in the Euclidean plane under the conventional \textit{Look-Compute-Move} cycle. A primary task in this model is the \textit{separation problem}, where unconscious robots sharing the same color must separate from others, forming recognizable geometric shapes such as circles, points, or lines. All prior works model the robots as \textit{transparent}, enabling each to know the positions and colors of all other robots. In contrast, we model the robots as \textit{opaque}, where a robot can obstruct the visibility of two other robots, if it lies on the line segment between them. Under this obstructed visibility, we consider a variant of the separation problem in which robots, starting from any arbitrary initial configuration, are required to separate into concentric semicircles. We present a collision-free algorithm that solves the separation problem under a semi-synchronous scheduler in $O(n)$ epochs, where $n$ is the number of robots. The robots agree on one coordinate axis but have no knowledge of $n$.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Inference Placement for Deep Learning across Edge and Cloud Platforms: A Multi-Objective Optimization Perspective and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge intelligent applications like VR/AR and language model based chatbots have become widespread with the rapid expansion of IoT and mobile devices. However, constrained edge devices often cannot serve the increasingly large and complex deep learning (DL) models. To mitigate these challenges, researchers have proposed optimizing and offloading partitions of DL models among user devices, edge servers, and the cloud. In this setting, users can take advantage of different services to support their intelligent applications. For example, edge resources offer low response latency. In contrast, cloud platforms provide low monetary cost computation resources for computation-intensive workloads. However, communication between DL model partitions can introduce transmission bottlenecks and pose risks of data leakage. Recent research aims to balance accuracy, computation delay, transmission delay, and privacy concerns. They address these issues with model compression, model distillation, transmission compression, and model architecture adaptations, including internal classifiers. This survey contextualizes the state-of-the-art model offloading methods and model adaptation techniques by studying their implication to a multi-objective optimization comprising inference latency, data privacy, and resource monetary cost.</description>

      <title>Bayes-Split-Edge: Bayesian Optimization for Constrained Collaborative Inference in Wireless Edge Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile edge devices (e.g., AR/VR headsets) typically need to complete timely inference tasks while operating with limited on-board computing and energy resources. In this paper, we investigate the problem of collaborative inference in wireless edge networks, where energy-constrained edge devices aim to complete inference tasks within given deadlines. These tasks are carried out using neural networks, and the edge device seeks to optimize inference performance under energy and delay constraints. The inference process can be split between the edge device and an edge server, thereby achieving collaborative inference over wireless networks. We formulate an inference utility optimization problem subject to energy and delay constraints, and propose a novel solution called Bayes-Split-Edge, which leverages Bayesian optimization for collaborative split inference over wireless edge networks. Our solution jointly optimizes the transmission power and the neural network split point. The Bayes-Split-Edge framework incorporates a novel hybrid acquisition function that balances inference task utility, sample efficiency, and constraint violation penalties. We evaluate our approach using the VGG19 model on the ImageNet-Mini dataset, and Resnet101 on Tiny-ImageNet, and real-world mMobile wireless channel datasets. Numerical results demonstrate that Bayes-Split-Edge achieves up to 2.4x reduction in evaluation cost compared to standard Bayesian optimization and achieves near-linear convergence. It also outperforms several baselines, including CMA-ES, DIRECT, exhaustive search, and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), while matching exhaustive search performance under tight constraints. These results confirm that the proposed framework provides a sample-efficient solution requiring maximum 20 function evaluations and constraint-aware optimization for wireless split inference in edge computing systems.</description>

      <title>A Feature Engineering Approach for Business Impact-Oriented Failure Detection in Distributed Instant Payment Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instant payment infrastructures have stringent performance requirements, processing millions of transactions daily with zero-downtime expectations. Traditional monitoring approaches fail to bridge the gap between technical infrastructure metrics and business process visibility. We introduce a novel feature engineering approach based on processing times computed between consecutive ISO 20022 message exchanges, creating a compact representation of system state. By applying anomaly detection to these features, we enable early failure detection and localization, allowing incident classification. Experimental evaluation on the TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) system, using both real-world incidents and controlled simulations, demonstrates the approach's effectiveness in detecting diverse anomaly patterns and provides inherently interpretable explanations that enable operators to understand the business impact. By mapping features to distinct processing phases, the resulting framework differentiates between internal and external payment system issues, significantly reduces investigation time, and bridges observability gaps in distributed systems where transaction state is fragmented across multiple entities.</description>

      <title>Simopt-Power: Leveraging Simulation Metadata for Low-Power Design Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excessive switching activity is a primary contributor to dynamic power dissipation in modern FPGAs, where fine-grained configurability amplifies signal toggling and associated capacitance. Conventional low-power techniques -- gating, clock-domain partitioning, and placement-aware netlist rewrites - either require intrusive design changes or offer diminishing returns as device densities grow. In this work, we present Simopt-power, a simulator-driven optimisation framework that leverages simulation analysis to identify and selectively reconfigure high-toggle paths. By feeding activity profiles back into a lightweight transformation pass, Simopt-power judiciously inserts duplicate truth table logic using Shannon Decomposition principle and relocates critical nets, thereby attenuating unnecessary transitions without perturbing functional behaviour. We evaluated this framework on open-source RTLLM benchmark, with Simopt-power achieves an average switching-induced power reduction of ~9\% while incurring only ~9\% additional LUT-equivalent resources for arithmetic designs. These results demonstrate that coupling simulation insights with targeted optimisations can yield a reduced dynamic power, offering a practical path toward using simulation metadata in the FPGA-CAD flow.</description>

      <title>Heaven &amp; Hell II: Scale Laws and Robustness in One-Step Heaven-Hell Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Heaven-Hell dynamics, a model for network consensus. A known result establishes an exact one-step convergence threshold for systems with a single uniform hub: the per-node inbound hub weight W suffices if and only if W &gt;= maxrest, the maximum non-hub inbound mass. We develop scale laws and operational refinements that make this threshold robust to tie-breaking policies, node-specific tolerances, targeted seeding, multiple hubs, and asynchronous updates. Our contributions include a conservation-law perspective, parameterized tie policies, tighter pointwise bounds improving on classical worst-case guarantees, one-pass fairness for asynchronous updates, and sufficient conditions for seeded convergence. All proofs are mechanized in Coq, with experiments on rings, grids, scale-free graphs, and heterogeneous weighted graphs validating tightness and gap closures</description>

      <title>Power to the Clients: Federated Learning in a Dictatorship Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for decentralized model training, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared model without exchanging their local data. However, the decentralized nature of FL also introduces vulnerabilities, as malicious clients can compromise or manipulate the training process. In this work, we introduce dictator clients, a novel, well-defined, and analytically tractable class of malicious participants capable of entirely erasing the contributions of all other clients from the server model, while preserving their own. We propose concrete attack strategies that empower such clients and systematically analyze their effects on the learning process. Furthermore, we explore complex scenarios involving multiple dictator clients, including cases where they collaborate, act independently, or form an alliance in order to ultimately betray one another. For each of these settings, we provide a theoretical analysis of their impact on the global model's convergence. Our theoretical algorithms and findings about the complex scenarios including multiple dictator clients are further supported by empirical evaluations on both computer vision and natural language processing benchmarks.</description>

      <title>CodeAD: Synthesize Code of Rules for Log-based Anomaly Detection with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Log-based anomaly detection (LogAD) is critical for maintaining the reliability and availability of large-scale online service systems. While machine learning, deep learning, and large language models (LLMs)-based methods have advanced the LogAD, they often suffer from limited interpretability, high inference costs, and extensive preprocessing requirements, limiting their practicality for real-time, high-volume log analysis. In contrast, rule-based systems offer efficiency and transparency, but require significant manual effort and are difficult to scale across diverse and evolving environments. In this paper, We present CodeAD, a novel framework that automatically synthesizes lightweight Python rule functions for LogAD using LLMs. CodeAD introduces a hierarchical clustering and anchor-grounded sampling strategy to construct representative contrastive log windows, enabling LLMs to discern discriminative anomaly patterns. To ensure robustness and generalizability, CodeAD employs an agentic workflow that iteratively generates, tests, repairs, and refines the rules until it meets correctness and abstraction requirements. The synthesized rules are interpretable, lightweight, and directly executable on raw logs, supporting efficient and transparent online anomaly detection. Our comprehensive experiments on three public datasets (BGL, Hadoop, Thunderbird) demonstrate that CodeAD achieves an average absolute improvement of 3.6% F1 score over the state-of-the-art baselines, while processing large datasets up to 4x faster and at a fraction of the cost (total LLM invocation cost under 4 USD per dataset). These results highlight CodeAD as a practical and scalable solution for online monitoring systems, enabling interpretable, efficient, and automated LogAD in real-world environment.</description>

      <title>Sentinel: Dynamic Knowledge Distillation for Personalized Federated Intrusion Detection in Heterogeneous IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving paradigm for machine learning, but its application in intrusion detection systems (IDS) within IoT networks is challenged by severe class imbalance, non-IID data, and high communication overhead.These challenges severely degrade the performance of conventional FL methods in real-world network traffic classification. To overcome these limitations, we propose Sentinel, a personalized federated IDS (pFed-IDS) framework that incorporates a dual-model architecture on each client, consisting of a personalized teacher and a lightweight shared student model. This design effectively balances deep local adaptation with efficient global model consensus while preserving client privacy by transmitting only the compact student model, thus reducing communication costs. Sentinel integrates three key mechanisms to ensure robust performance: bidirectional knowledge distillation with adaptive temperature scaling, multi-faceted feature alignment, and class-balanced loss functions. Furthermore, the server employs normalized gradient aggregation with equal client weighting to enhance fairness and mitigate client drift. Extensive experiments on the IoTID20 and 5GNIDD benchmark datasets demonstrate that Sentinel significantly outperforms state-of-the-art federated methods, establishing a new performance benchmark, especially under extreme data heterogeneity, while maintaining communication efficiency.</description>

      <title>AirFed: Federated Graph-Enhanced Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Multi-UAV Cooperative Mobile Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) cooperative Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) systems face critical challenges in coordinating trajectory planning, task offloading, and resource allocation while ensuring Quality of Service (QoS) under dynamic and uncertain environments. Existing approaches suffer from limited scalability, slow convergence, and inefficient knowledge sharing among UAVs, particularly when handling large-scale IoT device deployments with stringent deadline constraints. This paper proposes AirFed, a novel federated graph-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations. First, we design dual-layer dynamic Graph Attention Networks (GATs) that explicitly model spatial-temporal dependencies among UAVs and IoT devices, capturing both service relationships and collaborative interactions within the network topology. Second, we develop a dual-Actor single-Critic architecture that jointly optimizes continuous trajectory control and discrete task offloading decisions. Third, we propose a reputation-based decentralized federated learning mechanism with gradient-sensitive adaptive quantization, enabling efficient and robust knowledge sharing across heterogeneous UAVs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AirFed achieves 42.9% reduction in weighted cost compared to state-of-the-art baselines, attains over 99% deadline satisfaction and 94.2% IoT device coverage rate, and reduces communication overhead by 54.5%. Scalability analysis confirms robust performance across varying UAV numbers, IoT device densities, and system scales, validating AirFed's practical applicability for large-scale UAV-MEC deployments.</description>

      <title>The First Star-by-star $N$-body/Hydrodynamics Simulation of Our Galaxy Coupling with a Surrogate Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major goal of computational astrophysics is to simulate the Milky Way Galaxy with sufficient resolution down to individual stars. However, the scaling fails due to some small-scale, short-timescale phenomena, such as supernova explosions. We have developed a novel integration scheme of $N$-body/hydrodynamics simulations working with machine learning. This approach bypasses the short timesteps caused by supernova explosions using a surrogate model, thereby improving scalability. With this method, we reached 300 billion particles using 148,900 nodes, equivalent to 7,147,200 CPU cores, breaking through the billion-particle barrier currently faced by state-of-the-art simulations. This resolution allows us to perform the first star-by-star galaxy simulation, which resolves individual stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. The performance scales over $10^4$ CPU cores, an upper limit in the current state-of-the-art simulations using both A64FX and X86-64 processors and NVIDIA CUDA GPUs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data pipelines are essential in stream processing as they enable the efficient collection, processing, and delivery of real-time data, supporting rapid data analysis. In this paper, we present AutoStreamPipe, a novel framework that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the design, generation, and deployment of stream processing pipelines. AutoStreamPipe bridges the semantic gap between high-level user intent and platform-specific implementations across distributed stream processing systems for structured multi-agent reasoning by integrating a Hypergraph of Thoughts (HGoT) as an extended version of GoT. AutoStreamPipe combines resilient execution strategies, advanced query analysis, and HGoT to deliver pipelines with good accuracy. Experimental evaluations on diverse pipelines demonstrate that AutoStreamPipe significantly reduces development time (x6.3) and error rates (x5.19), as measured by a novel Error-Free Score (EFS), compared to LLM code-generation methods.</description>

      <title>How to Evaluate Distributed Coordination Systems? -- A Survey and Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coordination services and protocols are critical components of distributed systems and are essential for providing consistency, fault tolerance, and scalability. However, due to the lack of standard benchmarking and evaluation tools for distributed coordination services, coordination service developers/researchers either use a NoSQL standard benchmark and omit evaluating consistency, distribution, and fault tolerance; or create their own ad-hoc microbenchmarks and skip comparability with other services. In this study, we analyze and compare the evaluation mechanisms for known and widely used consensus algorithms, distributed coordination services, and distributed applications built on top of these services. We identify the most important requirements of distributed coordination service benchmarking, such as the metrics and parameters for the evaluation of the performance, scalability, availability, and consistency of these systems. Finally, we discuss why the existing benchmarks fail to address the complex requirements of distributed coordination system evaluation.</description>

      <title>Unlocking True Elasticity for the Cloud-Native Era with Dandelion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elasticity is fundamental to cloud computing, as it enables quickly allocating resources to match the demand of each workload as it arrives, rather than pre-provisioning resources to meet performance objectives. However, even serverless platforms -- which boot sandboxes in 10s to 100s of milliseconds -- are not sufficiently elastic to avoid over-provisioning expensive resources. Today's FaaS platforms rely on pre-provisioning many idle sandboxes in memory to reduce the occurrence of slow, cold starts. A key obstacle for high elasticity is booting a guest OS and configuring features like networking in sandboxes, which are required to expose an isolated POSIX-like interface to user functions. Our key insight is that redesigning the interface for applications in the cloud-native era enables co-designing a much more efficient and elastic execution system. Now is a good time to rethink cloud abstractions as developers are building applications to be cloud-native. Cloud-native applications typically consist of user-provided compute logic interacting with cloud services (for storage, AI inference, query processing, etc) exposed over REST APIs. Hence, we propose Dandelion, an elastic cloud platform with a declarative programming model that expresses applications as DAGs of pure compute functions and higher-level communication functions. Dandelion can securely execute untrusted user compute functions in lightweight sandboxes that cold start in hundreds of microseconds, since pure functions do not rely on extra software environments such as a guest OS. Dandelion makes it practical to boot a sandbox on-demand for each request, decreasing performance variability by two to three orders of magnitude compared to Firecracker and reducing committed memory by 96% on average when running the Azure Functions trace.</description>

      <title>NestedFP: High-Performance, Memory-Efficient Dual-Precision Floating Point Support for LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Meeting service-level objectives (SLOs) in Large Language Models (LLMs) serving is critical, but managing the high variability in load presents a significant challenge. Recent advancements in FP8 inference, backed by native hardware support, offer a potential solution: executing FP16 models by default, while switching to FP8 models during sudden load surges to achieve higher throughput at the cost of a slight quality degradation. Although this approach facilitates effective SLO management, it introduces additional memory overhead due to storing two versions of the same model. In response, this paper proposes NestedFP, an LLM serving technique that supports both FP16 and FP8 models in a memory efficient manner by overlaying FP8 parameters onto FP16 parameters, allowing both models to share the same FP16 memory footprint. By leveraging a compact data format for the overlay and a specialized GEMM kernel optimized for this format, NestedFP ensures minimal degradation in both model quality and inference throughput across both FP8 and FP16 modes. NestedFP provides a flexible platform for dynamic, SLO-aware precision selection. The code is available at https://github.com/SNU-ARC/NestedFP.</description>

      <title>FalconFS: Distributed File System for Large-Scale Deep Learning Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Client-side metadata caching has long been considered an effective method for accelerating metadata operations in distributed file systems (DFSs). However, we have found that client-side state (e.g., caching) is not only ineffective but also consumes valuable memory resources in the deep learning pipelines. We thus propose FalconFS, a DFS optimized for deep learning pipelines with the stateless-client architecture. Specifically, instead of performing client-side path resolution and caching, FalconFS efficiently resolves paths on the server side using hybrid metadata indexing and lazy namespace replication. FalconFS also boosts server concurrency with concurrent request merging and provides easy deployment with VFS shortcut. Evaluations against CephFS and Lustre show that FalconFS achieves up to 5.72$\times$ throughput for small file read/write and up to 12.81$\times$ throughput for deep learning model training. FalconFS has been running in Huawei autonomous driving system's production environment with 10,000 NPUs for one year and has been open-sourced.</description>

      <title>CSnake: Detecting Self-Sustaining Cascading Failure via Causal Stitching of Fault Propagations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that self-sustaining cascading failures in distributed systems frequently lead to widespread outages, which are challenging to contain and recover from. Existing failure detection techniques struggle to expose such failures prior to deployment, as they typically require a complex combination of specific conditions to be triggered. This challenge stems from the inherent nature of cascading failures, as they typically involve a sequence of fault propagations, each activated by distinct conditions.
  This paper presents CSnake, a fault injection framework to expose self-sustaining cascading failures in distributed systems. CSnake uses the novel idea of causal stitching, which causally links multiple single-fault injections in different tests to simulate complex fault propagation chains. To identify these chains, CSnake designs a counterfactual causality analysis of fault propagations - fault causality analysis (FCA): FCA compares the execution trace of a fault injection run with its corresponding profile run (i.e., same test w/o the injection) and identifies any additional faults triggered, which are considered to have a causal relationship with the injected fault.
  To address the large search space of fault and workload combinations, CSnake employs a three-phase allocation protocol of test budget that prioritizes faults with unique and diverse causal consequences, increasing the likelihood of uncovering conditional fault propagations. Furthermore, to avoid incorrectly connecting fault propagations from workloads with incompatible conditions, CSnake performs a local compatibility check that approximately checks the compatibility of the path constraints associated with connected fault propagations with low overhead.
  CSnake detected 15 bugs that cause self-sustaining cascading failures in five systems, five of which have been confirmed with two fixed.</description>

      <title>Tiny but Mighty: A Software-Hardware Co-Design Approach for Efficient Multimodal Inference on Battery-Powered Small Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are inherently modular, consisting of vision and audio encoders, projectors, and large language models. Yet, they are almost always executed monolithically, which underutilizes the heterogeneous accelerators (NPUs, GPUs, DSPs) in modern SoCs and leads to high end-to-end latency. In this paper, we present NANOMIND, a hardware--software co-design inference framework for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that breaks large models into modular ``bricks'' (vision, language, audio, etc.) and maps each to its ideal accelerator. The key insight is that large models can be broken into modular components and scheduled to run on the most appropriate compute units. It performs module-level dynamic offloading across accelerators on unified-memory SoCs. By combining customized hardware design, system-level scheduling, and optimized low-bit computation kernels, we demonstrate our framework with a compact, battery-powered device capable of running LMMs entirely on device. This prototype functions as a self-contained intelligent assistant that requires no network connectivity, while achieving higher throughput and superior power efficiency under strict resource constraints. The design further bypasses CPU bottlenecks and reduces redundant memory usage through token-aware buffer management and module-level coordination. Our system outperforms existing implementations in resource efficiency, cutting energy consumption by 42.3\% and GPU memory usage by 11.2\%. This enables a battery-powered device to run LLaVA-OneVision with a camera for nearly half a day and LLaMA-3-8B for voice interactions up to almost 20.8 hours.</description>

      <title>Blockchain and Biometrics: Survey, GDPR Analysis, and Future Directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10883v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biometric recognition as an efficient and hard-to-forge way of identification and verification has become an indispensable part of the current digital world. The fast evolution of this technology has been a strong incentive for integration into many applications. Meanwhile, blockchain, the decentralized ledger technology, has been widely received by both research and industry in the past few years, and it is being increasingly deployed today in many different applications, such as money transfer, IoT, healthcare, or logistics. Recently, researchers have started to speculate on the pros and cons and what the best applications would be when these two technologies cross paths. This paper provides a survey of the research literature on the combination of blockchain and biometrics and includes a first legal analysis of this integration based on GDPR to shed light on challenges and potentials. Although the integration of blockchain technology into the biometric sector is still in its infancy, with a growing body of literature discussing specific applications and advanced technological setups, this paper aims to provide a holistic understanding of blockchain applicability in biometrics. Based on published studies, this article discusses, among others, practical examples combining blockchain and biometrics for novel applications in PKI systems, distributed trusted services, and identity management. Challenges and limitations when combining blockchain and biometrics that motivate future work will also be discussed; e.g., blockchain networks at their current stage may not be efficient or economical for some real-time biometric applications. Finally, we also discuss key legal aspects of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) related to this combination of technologies (blockchain and biometrics); for example, accountability, immutability, anonymity, and data protection elements.</description>

      <title>Bandwidth Efficient Livestreaming in Mobile Wireless Networks: A Peer-to-Peer ACIDE Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14283v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In mobile wireless networks, livestreaming in high user density areas presents two typical challenges: the wireless bandwidth is depleted and the number of users is limited. In this study, a media distribution model utilizing peer to peer communications, Active Control in an Intelligent and Distributed Environment, is proposed for bandwidth efficient livestreaming. The basic idea is to group users with identical livestream interest in a cluster of n peers. Instead of sending n copies of a livestream package, only one copy is sent to the cluster. A package is divided into n blocks. Each user receives one block from the base station and the remaining n-1 blocks from the other peers. Two optimization problems are addressed. The first problem is minimizing the bandwidth needed to guarantee a continuous live media play on all peers. A solution is proposed to find the optimal block sizes such that the wireless bandwidth is minimized. The second problem is maximizing the number of peers admitted to a cluster, given a fixed wireless bandwidth. This problem is NP-complete and a greedy strategy is proposed to calculate a feasible solution for peer selection. The proposed model improves the bandwidth efficiency and allows more users to be served.</description>

      <title>Efficient Federated Learning against Byzantine Attacks and Data Heterogeneity via Aggregating Normalized Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09539v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, but is vulnerable to Byzantine attacks and data heterogeneity, which can severely degrade performance. Existing Byzantine-robust approaches tackle data heterogeneity, but incur high computational overhead during gradient aggregation, thereby slowing down the training process. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective Federated Normalized Gradients Algorithm (Fed-NGA), which performs aggregation by merely computing the weighted mean of the normalized gradients from each client. This approach yields a favorable time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(pM)$, where $p$ is the model dimension and $M$ is the number of clients. We rigorously prove that Fed-NGA is robust to both Byzantine faults and data heterogeneity. For non-convex loss functions, Fed-NGA achieves convergence to a neighborhood of stationary points under general assumptions, and further attains zero optimality gap under some mild conditions, which is an outcome rarely achieved in existing literature. In both cases, the convergence rate is $\mathcal{O}(1/T^{\frac{1}{2} - \delta})$, where $T$ denotes the number of iterations and $\delta \in (0, 1/2)$. Experimental results on benchmark datasets confirm the superior time efficiency and convergence performance of Fed-NGA over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Efficient Adaptive Federated Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18117v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive optimization is critical in federated learning, where enabling adaptivity on both the server and client sides has proven essential for achieving optimal performance. However, the scalability of such jointly adaptive systems is often hindered by resource limitations in communication and memory. In this paper, we introduce a class of efficient adaptive algorithms, named $FedAda^2$ and its enhanced version $FedAda^2$++, designed specifically for large-scale, cross-device federated environments. $FedAda^2$ optimizes communication efficiency by avoiding the transfer of preconditioners between the server and clients. Additionally, $FedAda^2$++ extends this approach by incorporating memory-efficient adaptive optimizers on the client side, further reducing on-device memory usage. Theoretically, we demonstrate that $FedAda^2$ and $FedAda^2$++ achieve the same convergence rates for general, non-convex objectives as its more resource-intensive counterparts that directly integrate joint adaptivity. Extensive empirical evaluations on image and text datasets demonstrate both the advantages of joint adaptivity and the effectiveness of $FedAda^2$/$FedAda^2$++.</description>

      <title>TraDE: Network and Traffic-aware Adaptive Scheduling for Microservices Under Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transition from monolithic architecture to microservices has enhanced flexibility in application design and its scalable execution. This approach typically uses a computing cluster managed by a container orchestration platform to deploy microservices. However, this shift introduces significant challenges, particularly in the efficient scheduling of containerized services. These challenges are compounded by unpredictable scenarios such as dynamic incoming workloads with various execution traffic and variable communication delays among cluster nodes. Existing works often overlook the real-time traffic impacts of dynamic requests on running microservices, as well as the varied communication delays across cluster nodes. Consequently, even optimally deployed microservices could suffer from significant performance degradation over time. To address these issues, we propose a network and traffic-aware adaptive scheduling framework, TraDE, which can adaptively redeploy microservice instances to maintain desired performance amid changing traffic and network conditions within the hosting cluster. We have implemented TraDE as an extension to the Kubernetes platform. Additionally, we deployed realistic microservice applications in a real compute cluster and conducted extensive experiments to assess our framework's performance in various scenarios. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of TraDE in rescheduling running microservices to enhance end-to-end performance while maintaining a high goodput ratio. Compared with the existing method NetMARKS, TraDE outperforms it by reducing the average response time of the application by up to 48.3%, and improving the throughput by up to 1.2-1.5x across workloads while maintaining a goodput ratio of 95.36%, and showing robust adaptive capability to meet QoS targets under sustained workloads and dynamic networking conditions.</description>

      <title>BLaST: High Performance Inference and Pretraining using BLock Sparse Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The energy consumption of large-scale ML models is dominated by data movement, shuffling billions of parameters across memory hierarchies and data centers. Sparsification offers a principled way to mitigate these costs by pruning redundant weights and activations, thereby reducing data movement. Effective sparsification to prune redundant parameters is still challenging: existing methods incur significant accuracy degradation, performance overhead, or both. We introduce (Bl)ock (a)nd (S)parse (T)ransformers (BLaST), a general, robust, and reliable method for sparsification, applicable to linear layers in all settings. Our method iteratively sparsifies weight matrices into a block sparsity pattern suitable for efficient sparse matrix-matrix (SpMM) multiplication. BLaST achieves up to 95% sparsity in MLP weights with negligible accuracy loss (majority &lt;2.25%). We show a 2.2x inference speedup for Llama 3.2 with 16 GPUs, and up to 4.45x reduction in inference memory footprint resulting in a 2.9x reduction in GPU setup and operating costs.</description>

      <title>FMI Meets SystemC: A Framework for Cross-Tool Virtual Prototyping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As systems become more complex, the demand for thorough testing and virtual prototyping grows. To simulate whole systems, multiple tools are usually needed to cover different parts. These parts include the hardware of a system and the environment with which the system interacts. The Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard for co-simulation can be used to connect these tools.
  The control part of modern systems is usually a computing unit, such as a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) or Microcontroller Unit (MCU), which executes software from a connected memory and interacts with peripherals. To develop software without requiring access to physical hardware, full-system simulators, the so-called Virtual Platforms (VPs), are commonly used. The IEEE-standardized framework for VP development is SystemC TLM. SystemC provides interfaces and concepts that enable modular design and model exchange. However, SystemC lacks native FMI support, which limits the integration into broader co-simulation environments.
  This paper presents a novel framework to control and interact with SystemC-based VPs using the FMI. We present a case study showing how a simulated temperature sensor in a SystemC simulation can obtain temperature values from an external tool via FMI. This approach allows the unmodified target software to run on the VP and receive realistic environmental input data such as temperature, velocity, or acceleration values from other tools. Thus, extensive software testing and verification is enabled. By having tests ready and the software pre-tested using a VP once the physical hardware is available, certifications like ISO 26262 can be done earlier.</description>
