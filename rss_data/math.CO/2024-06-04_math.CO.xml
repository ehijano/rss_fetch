      <title>Combinatorial proofs of inequalities involving the number of partitions with parts separated by parity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the number of various partitions of $n$ with parts separated by parity and prove combinatorially several inequalities between these numbers. For example, we show that for $n\geq 5$ we have $p_{od}^{eu}(n)&lt;p_{ed}^{ou}(n)$, where $p_{od}^{eu}(n)$ is the number of partitions of $n$ with odd parts distinct and even parts unrestricted and all odd parts less than all even parts and $p_{ed}^{ou}(n)$ is the number of partitions of $n$ with even parts distinct and odd parts unrestricted and all even parts less than all odd parts. We also prove a conjectural inequality of Fu and Tang involving partitions with parts separated by parity with restrictions on the multiplicity of parts.</description>

      <title>There are no good infinite families of toric codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soprunov and Soprunova introduced the notion of a good infinite family of toric codes. We prove that such good families do not exist by proving a more general Szemer\'edi-type result: for all $c\in(0,1]$ and all positive integers $N$, subsets of density at least $c$ in $\{0,1,\dots,N-1\}^n$ contain hypercubes of arbitrarily large dimension as $n$ grows.</description>

      <title>Triangle-free graphs with diameter 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are finitely many graphs with diameter $2$ and girth 5. What if the girth 5 assumption is relaxed? Apart from stars, are there finitely many triangle-free graphs with diameter $2$ and no $K_{2,3}$ subgraph? This question is related to the existence of triangle-free strongly regular graphs, but allowing for a range of co-degrees gives the question a more extremal flavour. More generally, for fixed $s$ and $t$, are there infinitely many twin-free triangle-free $K_{s,t}$-free graphs with diameter 2? This paper presents partial results regarding these questions, including computational results, potential Cayley-graph and probabilistic constructions.</description>

      <title>Removable edges in near-bipartite bricks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An edge $e$ of a matching covered graph $G$ is removable if $G-e$ is also matching covered. The notion of removable edge arises in connection with ear decompositions of matching covered graphs introduced by Lov\'asz and Plummer. A nonbipartite matching covered graph $G$ is a brick if it is free of nontrivial tight cuts. Carvalho, Lucchesi, and Murty proved that every brick other than $K_4$ and $\overline{C_6}$ has at least $\Delta-2$ removable edges. A brick $G$ is near-bipartite if it has a pair of edges $\{e_1,e_2\}$ such that $G-\{e_1,e_2\}$ is a bipartite matching covered graph. In this paper, we show that in a near-bipartite brick $G$ with at least six vertices, every vertex of $G$, except at most six vertices of degree three contained in two disjoint triangles, is incident with at most two nonremovable edges; consequently, $G$ has at least $\frac{|V(G)|-6}{2}$ removable edges. Moreover, all graphs attaining this lower bound are characterized.</description>

      <title>Cokernels of the Euler restriction map of logarithmic derivation modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are two restriction maps of the logarithmic modules of plane arrangements in a three dimensional vector space. One is the Euler restriction and the other is the Ziegler restriction. The dimension of the cokernel of the Ziegler restriction map of logarithmic derivation modules has been well-studied for the freeness of hyperplane arrangements after Yoshinaga's celebrated criterion for freeness, which connects the second Betti number and the splitting type (exponents). However, though the Euler restriction has a longer history than the Ziegler restriction, the cokernel and its dimension of the Euler restriction have not been studied at all.
  The aim of this article is to study the cokernel and dimension of the Euler restriction maps in terms of combinatorics, more explicitly, the characteristic polynomial. We give an upper bound of that cokernel, and show the formula for that if the arrangement is free.</description>

      <title>Induced Ramsey problems for trees and graphs with bounded treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The induced $q$-color size-Ramsey number $\hat{r}_{\text{ind}}(H;q)$ of a graph $H$ is the minimal number of edges a host graph $G$ can have so that every $q$-edge-coloring of $G$ contains a monochromatic copy of $H$ which is an induced subgraph of $G$. A natural question, which in the non-induced case has a very long history, asks which families of graphs $H$ have induced Ramsey numbers that are linear in $|H|$. We prove that for every $k,w,q$, if $H$ is an $n$-vertex graph with maximum degree $k$ and treewidth at most $w$, then $\hat{r}_{\text{ind}}(H;q) = O_{k,w,q}(n)$. This extends several old and recent results in Ramsey theory. Our proof is quite simple and relies upon a novel reduction argument.</description>

      <title>Hamilton paths and cycles in the 3-uniform cube hypergraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $d$-dimensional hypercube is the $d$-dimensional generalisation of a square $(d=2)$ and a cube $(d=3)$. Formally, it is the graph with vertex set $\{0,1\}^d$ and edges connecting any two vertices that differ in exactly one coordinate. These vertices represent the corners of the hypercube, while the edges establish connections between these corners. It is well-known that for $d \geq 2$ the $d$-dimensional hypercube contains a Hamilton cycle, which is a path that visits every vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex.
  In this thesis we address the analogous problem for the $3$-uniform cube hypergraph, a $3$-uniform analogue of the hypercube. In contrast to the ordinary hypercube, the vertex set is now $\{0,1,2\}^d$ and edges consist of three instead of two vertices. We will examine the $3$-uniform cube hypergraph and consider a number of different definitions of paths and cycles. Our strongest result concerns loose paths: for simple parity reasons, the $3$-uniform cube hypergraph can never admit a loose Hamilton cycle in any dimension, but we determine for which dimensions a loose Hamilton path exists.</description>

      <title>On the number of solutions to a random instance of the permuted kernel problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Permuted Kernel Problem (PKP) is a problem in linear algebra that was first introduced by Shamir in 1989. Roughly speaking, given an $\ell \times m$ matrix $\mathbf{A}$ and an $m \times 1$ vector $\mathbf{b}$ over a finite field of $q$ elements $\mathbb{F}_q$, the PKP asks to find an $m \times m$ permutation matrix $\mathbf{\pi}$ such that $\mathbf{\pi} \mathbf{b}$ belongs to the kernel of $\mathbf{A}$. In recent years, several post-quantum digital signature schemes whose security can be provably reduced to the hardness of solving random instances of the PKP have been proposed. In this regard, it is important to know the expected number of solutions to a random instance of the PKP in terms of the parameters $q,\ell,m$. Previous works have heuristically estimated the expected number of solutions to be $m! / q^\ell$.
  We provide, and rigorously prove, exact formulas for the expected number of solutions to a random instance of the PKP and the related Inhomogeneous Permuted Kernel Problem (IPKP), considering two natural ways of generating random instances.</description>

      <title>Intersecting families with large shadow degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00465v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $k$-uniform family $\mathcal{F}$ is called intersecting if $F\cap F'\neq \emptyset$ for all $F,F'\in \mathcal{F}$. The shadow family $\partial \mathcal{F}$ is the family of $(k-1)$-element sets that are contained in some members of $\mathcal{F}$. The shadow degree (or minimum positive co-degree) of $\mathcal{F}$ is defined as the maximum integer $r$ such that every $E\in \partial \mathcal{F}$ is contained in at least $r$ members of $\mathcal{F}$. In 2021, Balogh, Lemons and Palmer determined the maximum size of an intersecting $k$-uniform family with shadow degree at least $r$ for $n\geq n_0(k,r)$, where $n_0(k,r)$ is doubly exponential in $k$ for $4\leq r\leq k$. In the present paper, we present a short proof of this result for $n\geq 2(r+1)^rk \frac{\binom{2k-1}{k}}{\binom{2r-1}{r}}$ and $4\leq r\leq k$.</description>

      <title>On a Pieri-like rule for the Petrie symmetric functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $k$-ribbon tiling is a decomposition of a connected skew diagram into disjoint ribbons of size $k$. In this paper, we establish a connection between a subset of $k$-ribbon tilings and Petrie symmetric functions, thus providing a combinatorial interpretation for the coefficients in a Pieri-like rule for the Petrie symmetric functions due to Grinberg (Algebr. Comb. 5 (2022), no. 5, 947-1013). This also extends a result by Cheng, Chou and Eu et al. (Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 151 (2023), no. 5, 1839-1854). As a bonus, our findings can be effectively utilized to derive certain specializations.</description>

      <title>A note on the Nearly Dispersability of Odd Toroidal Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \emph{matching book thickness} $mbt(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum integer $m$ such that an $m$-page matching book embedding exists. A graph $G$ is called \emph{dispersable} if $mbt(G)=\Delta(G)$, \emph{nearly dispersable} if $mbt(G)=\Delta(G)+1$. Recently, the authors determined the nearly dispersability of odd toroidal grids $T_{s,t}$. In this note, we further present a brief proof for this result.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{O}(VE)$ time algorithms for the Grundy (First-Fit) chromatic number of block graphs and graphs with sufficiently large girth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Grundy (or First-Fit) chromatic number of a graph $G=(V,E)$, denoted by $\Gamma(G)$ (or $\chi_{_{\sf FF}}(G)$), is the maximum number of colors used by a First-Fit (greedy) coloring of $G$. To determine $\Gamma(G)$ is NP-complete for various classes of graphs. Also there exists a constant $c&gt;0$ such that the Grundy number is hard to approximate within the ratio $c$. We first obtain an $\mathcal{O}(VE)$ algorithm to determine the Grundy number of block graphs i.e. graphs in which every biconnected component is complete subgraph. We prove that the Grundy number of a general graph $G$ with cut-vertices is upper bounded by the Grundy number of a block graph corresponding to $G$. This provides a reasonable upper bound for the Grundy number of graphs with cut-vertices. Next, define $\Delta_2(G)={\max}_{u\in G}~ {\max}_{v\in N(u):d(v)\leq d(u)} d(v)$. We obtain an $\mathcal{O}(VE)$ algorithm to determine $\Gamma(G)$ for graphs $G$ whose girth $g$ is at least $2\Delta_2(G)+1$. This algorithm provides a polynomial time approximation algorithm within ratio $\min \{1, (g+1)/(2\Delta_2(G)+2)\}$ for $\Gamma(G)$ of general graphs $G$ with girth $g$.</description>

      <title>On automorphism groups of binary cyclic codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A lot of attention has been paid to the investigation of the algebraic properties of linear codes. In most cases, this investigation involves the determination of required code automorphisms, which are useful for decoders, such as the automorphism ensemble decoder. It is worth noting that the examination of the automorphism groups of discrete symmetric objects has long been a highly regarded field of research. Cyclic codes, as a significant subclass of linear codes, can be constructed and analyzed using algebraic methods. And due to its cyclic nature, they have efficient encoding and decoding algorithms. To date, cyclic codes have found applications in various domains, including consumer electronics, data storage systems, and communication systems. In this paper, we investigate the full automorphism groups of binary cyclic codes. In particular, we present constructions for binary cyclic codes of long lengths that facilitate the determination of the full automorphism groups.</description>

      <title>Maximum Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado sets of chambers and their antidesigns in vector-spaces of even dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A chamber of the vector space $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ is a set $\{S_1,\dots,S_{n-1}\}$ of subspaces of $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ where $S_1\subset S_2\subset \dotso \subset S_{n-1}$ and $\dim(S_i)=i$ for $i=1,\dots,n-1$. By $\Gamma_n(q)$ we denote the graph whose vertices are the chambers of $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ with two chambers $C_1=\{S_1,\dots,S_{n-1}\}$ and $C_2=\{T_1,\dots,T_{n-1}\}$ adjacent in $\Gamma_n(q)$, if $S_i\cap T_{n-i}=\{0\}$ for $i=1,\dots,n-1$. The Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado problem on chambers is equivalent to determining the structure of independent sets of $\Gamma_n(q)$. The independence number of this graph was determined in [7] for $n$ even and given a subspace $P$ of dimension one, the set of all chambers whose subspaces of dimension $\frac n2$ contain $P$ attains the bound. The dual example of course also attains the bound. It remained open in [7] whether or not these are all maximum independent sets. Using a description from [6] of the eigenspace for the smallest eigenvalue of this graph, we prove an Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem on chambers of $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ for sufficiently large $q$, giving an affirmative answer for n even.</description>

Abstract: We characterize ratios of permanents of (generalized) submatrices which are bounded on the set of all totally positive matrices. This provides a permanental analog of results of Fallat, Gekhtman, and Johnson [{\em Adv.\ Appl.\ Math.} {\bf 30} no.\ 3, (2003) pp.\ 442--470] concerning ratios of matrix minors. We also extend work of Drake, Gerrish, and the first author [{\em Electron.\ J.\ Combin.,} {\bf 11} no.\ 1, (2004) Note 6] by characterizing the differences of monomials in $\mathbb{Z}[x_{1,1},x_{1,2},...,x_{n,n}]$ which evaluate positively on the set of all totally positive $n \times n$ matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an integer partition $(h_1,h_2,\dots,h_k)$ of $n$, is it possible to find an order $n$ latin square with $k$ disjoint subsquares of orders $h_1,\dots,h_k$? This question was posed by L.Fuchs and is only partially solved. Existence has been determined in general when $k\leq 4$, and in this paper we will complete the case when $k=5$. We also prove some less general results for partitions with $k=5$.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set $E(G)$. Pebbling shift is a deletion of two pebbles from a vertex and a placement of one pebble at a neighbouring vertex. The vertex cover set, $D_{vc}$ for graph $G$ is the subset of $V(G)$ such that every edge in $G$ has at least one end in $D_{vc}$. A detour monophonic path is considered to be a longest chordless path between two non adjacent vertices $x$ and $y$. A detour monophonic vertex cover pebbling number, ${\mu}_{vc}(G),$ is a minimum number of pebbles required to cover all the vertices of the vertex cover set of $G$ with at least one pebble each on them after the transformation of pebbles by using detour monophonic paths. We determine the detour monophonic vertex cover pebbling number (DMVCPN) of the cycle, path, fan, and wheel graphs.</description>

      <title>Guarding isometric subgraphs and Cops and Robber in planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the game of Cops and Robbers, one of the most useful results is that an isometric path in a graph can be guarded by one cop. In this paper, we introduce the concept of wide shadow in a subgraph, and use it to characterize all 1-guardable graphs. As an application, we show that 3 cops can capture a robber in any planar graph with the added restriction that at most two cops can move simultaneously, proving a conjecture of Yang and strengthening a classical result of Aigner and Fromme.</description>

      <title>Structural characterizations and Obstructions to Planar-Rips complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a scale parameter $r&gt;0$, the Vietoris-Rips complex of $X \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ (referred to as planar-Rips complex) under the usual Euclidean metric is a (finite) simplicial complex whose simplices are subsets of $X$ with diameter at most $r$. This paper focuses on characterizing the simplicial complexes that can or cannot be realized as planar-Rips complexes. Building on the prior work of Adamszek et al., we classify, up to simplicial isomorphism, all $n$-dimensional pseudomanifolds and weak-pseudomanifolds that admit a planar-Rips structure, and further characterize two-dimensional, pure, and closed planar-Rips complexes. Additionally, the notion of obstructions to planar-Rips complexes has been introduced, laying the groundwork for algorithmic approaches to identifying forbidden planar-Rips structures. We also explore the correlations between planar-Rips complexes and the class of intersection graphs called disk graphs, establishing a natural isomorphism between the two classes. Parallelly, our findings on planar-Rips complexes have been consolidated in terms of unit disk graphs for interested readers, depicting the significance of the topological and algebraic approaches. Several structural and geometric properties of planar-Rips complexes have been derived that are of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $V$ be a finite nonempty set. A transit function is a map $R:V\times V\rightarrow 2^V$ such that $R(u,u)=\{u\}$, $R(u,v)=R(v,u)$ and $u\in R(u,v)$ hold for every $u,v\in V$. A set $K\subseteq V$ is $R$-convex if $R(u,v)\subset K$ for every $u,v\in K$ and all $R$-convex subsets of $V$ form a convexity $\mathcal{C}_R$. We consider Minkowski-Krein-Milman property that every $R$-convex set $K$ in a convexity $\mathcal{C}_R$ is the convex hull of the set of extreme points of $K$ from axiomatic point of view and present a characterization of it. Later we consider several well-known transit functions on graphs and present the use of the mentioned characterizations on them.</description>

      <title>Crossing Numbers of Billiard Curves in the Multidimensional Box via Translation Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The billiard table is modeled as an $n$-dimensional box $[0,a_1]\times [0,a_2]\times \ldots \times [0,a_n] \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, with each side having real-valued lengths $a_i$ that are pairwise commensurable. A ball is launched from the origin in direction $d=(1,1,\ldots,1)$. The ball is reflected if it hits the boundary of the billiard table. It comes to a halt when reaching a corner. We show that the number of intersections of the billiard curve at any given point on the table is either $0$ or a power of $2$. To prove this, we use algebraic and number theoretic tools to establish a bijection between the number of intersections of the billiard curve and the number of satisfying assignments of a specific constraint satisfaction problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the compatibility between the antipode and the preLie product of a Com-PreLie Hopf algebra, that is to say a commutative Hopf algebra with a complementary preLie product, compatible with the product and the coproduct in a certain sense. An example of such a Hopf algebra is the Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra, with the preLie product given by graftingof forests, extending the free preLie product of grafting of rooted trees. This compatibility is then used to study the antipode of the Connes-Moscovici subalgebra, whichcan be defined with the help of this preLie product. The antipode of the generators of this subalgebra gives a family of combinatorial coefficients indexed by partitions,which can be computed with the help of iterated harmonic sums.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous works we introduced a $q$-deformation of the generating functions for enriched $P$-partitions. We call the evaluation of this generating functions on labelled chains, the $q$-fundamental quasisymmetric functions. These functions interpolate between Gessel's fundamental ($q=0$) and Stembridge's peak ($q=1$) functions, the natural quasisymmetric expansions of Schur and Schur's $Q$-symmetric functions. In this paper, we show that our $q$-fundamental functions provide a quasisymmetric expansion of Hall-Littlewood $S$-symmetric functions with parameter $t=-q$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce path-conjoined graphs defined for two rooted graphs by joining their roots with a path, and investigate the chromatic symmetric functions of its two generalizations: spider-conjoined graphs and chain-conjoined graphs. By using the composition method developed by Zhou and the third author, we obtain neat positive $e_I$-expansions for the chromatic symmetric functions of clique-path-cycle graphs, path-clique-path graphs, and path-clique-clique graphs.</description>

      <title>Block Sizes in the Block Sets Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set $X$ is called Euclidean Ramsey if, for any $k$ and sufficiently large $n$, every $k$-colouring of $\mathbb{R}^n$ contains a monochromatic congruent copy of $X$. This notion was introduced by Erd\H{o}s, Graham, Montgomery, Rothschild, Spencer and Straus. They asked if a set is Ramsey if and only if it is spherical, meaning that it lies on the surface of a sphere. It is not too difficult to show that if a set is not spherical then it is not Euclidean Ramsey either, but the converse is very much open despite extensive research over the years.
  On the other hand, the block sets conjecture is a purely combinatorial, Hales-Jewett type of statement, concerning `blocks in large products', introduced by Leader, Russell and Walters. If true, the block sets conjecture would imply that every transitive set (a set whose symmetry group acts transitively) is Euclidean Ramsey. As for the question above, the block sets conjecture remains very elusive, being known only in a few cases.
  In this paper we show that the sizes of the blocks in the block sets conjecture cannot be bounded, even for templates over the alphabet of size $3$. We also show that for the first non-trivial template, namely $123$, the blocks may be taken to be of size $2$ (for any number of colours). This is best possible; all previous bounds were `tower-type' large.</description>

      <title>Applications of Sparse Hypergraph Colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many problems in extremal combinatorics can be reduced to determining the independence number of a specific auxiliary hypergraph. We present two such problems, one from discrete geometry and one from hypergraph Tur\'an theory. Using results on hypergraph colorings by Cooper-Mubayi and Li-Postle, we demonstrate that for those two problems the trivial lower bound on the independence number can be improved upon:
  Erd\H{o}s, Graham, Ruzsa and Taylor asked to determine the largest size, denoted by $g(n)$, of a subset $P$ of the grid $[n]^2$ such that every pair of points in $P$ span a different slope. Improving on a lower bound by Zhang from 1993, we show that $$g(n)=\Omega \left( \frac{n^{2/3} (\log \log n)^{1/3} }{ \log^{1/3}n} \right).$$
  Let $H^r_3$ denote an $r$-graph with $r+1$ vertices and $3$ edges. Recently, Sidorenko proved the following lower bounds for the Tur\'an density of this $r$-graph: $\pi(H^r_3)\geq r^{-2}$ for every $r$, and $\pi(H^r_3)\geq (1.7215 - o(1)) r^{-2}$. We present an improved asymptotic bound: $\pi(H^r_3)=\Omega\left(r^{-2} \log^{1/2} r \right).$</description>

Abstract: More than $30$ years ago, \v{S}olt\'es observed that the total distance of the graph $C_{11}$ does not change by deleting a vertex, and wondered about the existence of other such graphs, called \v{S}olt\'es graphs. We extend the definition of \v{S}olt\'es' graphs to \v{S}olt\'es' hypergraphs, determine all orders for which a \v{S}olt\'es' hypergraph exists, observe infinitely many uniform \v{S}olt\'es' hypergraphs, and find the \v{S}olt\'es' hypergraph with minimum size (spoiler: it is not $C_{11}$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a quasisymmetric analogue of the combinatorial theory of Schubert polynomials and the associated divided difference operators. Our counterparts are "forest polynomials", and a new family of linear operators, whose theory of compositions is governed by forests and the "Thompson monoid". Our approach extends naturally to $m$-colored quasisymmetric functions.
  We then give several applications of our theory to fundamental quasisymmetric functions, the study of quasisymmetric coinvariant rings and their associated harmonics, and positivity results for various expansions. In particular we resolve a conjecture of Aval-Bergeron-Li regarding quasisymmetric harmonics.</description>

Abstract: Two new proofs are provided, offering two new perspectives on Godbersen's conjecture. One of the proofs utilizes Helly's theorem to provide a concise and elegant proof of the inequality in Godbersen's conjecture. The other proof utilizes the Brunn-Minkowski inequality to provide a completely new proof of the inclusion $-K\subset nK$ for convex bodies $K$ with centroid at the origin, thereby proving Godbersen's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Better coloring of 3-colorable graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of coloring a 3-colorable graph in polynomial time using as few colors as possible. This is one of the most challenging problems in graph algorithms.
  In this paper using Blum's notion of ``progress'', we develop a new combinatorial algorithm for the following: Given any 3-colorable graph with minimum degree $\ds&gt;\sqrt n$, we can, in polynomial time, make progress towards a $k$-coloring for some $k=\sqrt{n/\ds}\cdot n^{o(1)}$.
  We balance our main result with the best-known semi-definite(SDP) approach which we use for degrees below $n^{0.605073}$. As a result, we show that $\tO(n^{0.19747})$ colors suffice for coloring 3-colorable graphs. This improves on the previous best bound of $\tO(n^{0.19996})$ by Kawarabayashi and Thorup in 2017.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain explicit formulas for capped descendent vertex functions of $\text{Hilb}^n(\mathbb{C}^2)$ for descendents given by chern classes of tautological bundles. The expression is the result of twisting a well known generating function for normalized Macdonald polynomials. This gives an explicit description of the rational function the capped vertex is an expansion of. Along the way we prove various limit expressions of the capping operator and the bare vertex function.</description>

      <title>Non-Isomorphic Groups with Isomorphic Power and Commuting Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The power graph of a group $G$ is a graph with vertex set $G$, in which two vertices are adjacent if one is some power of the other. In the commuting graph, with $G$ as the vertex set, two vertices are joined by an edge if they commute in $G$. The enhanced power graph of a group $G$ is a graph with vertex set $G$ and an edge joining two vertices $x$ and $y$ if $\langle x,y\rangle$ is cyclic. In this paper, we answer a question posed by P. J. Cameron, namely, if there exist groups $G$ and $H$ such that the power graph of $G$ is isomorphic to the commuting graph of $H$. We show that the answer is yes if $G$ is the generalised quaternion group and $H$ is the dihedral group. We also show that the enhanced power graph of the dicyclic group is isomorphic to the commuting graph of the dihedral group.</description>

Abstract: Recently, the concept of frames generated by graphs has been introduced in \cite{D}. In this paper, we study spectrally optimal dual frames of frames generated by graphs. We show that if the frame is generated by a connected graph, then its canonical dual frame is the unique spectrally optimal dual frame for $1$-erasure and $2$-erasures. Further, we show that the canonical dual frames of frames generated by disconnected graphs are non-unique spectrally optimal dual frames for $1$-erasure and $2$-erasures.</description>

      <title>The Behavior of a Three-Term Hofstadter-Like Recurrence with Linear Initial Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the three-term nested recurrence relation $B(n)=B(n-B(n-1))+B(n-B(n-2))+B(n-B(n-3))$ subject to initial conditions where the first $N$ terms are the integers $1$ through $N$. This recurrence is the three-term analog of Hofstadter's famous $Q$-recurrence $Q(n)=Q(n-Q(n-1))+Q(n-Q(n-2))$. Nested recurrences are highly sensitive to their initial conditions. Some initial conditions lead to finite sequences, others lead to predictable sequences, and yet others lead to sequences that appear to be chaotic and infinite. A corresponding study to this one was previously carried out on the $Q$-recurrence. As with that work, we consider two families of sequences, one where terms with nonpositive indices are undefined and a second where terms with nonpositive indices are defined to be zero. We find similar results here as with the $Q$-recurrence, as we can completely characterize the sequences for sufficiently large $N$. The results here are, in a sense, simpler, as our sequences are all finite for sufficiently large $N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A subset $R$ of integers is a set of Bohr recurrence if every rotation on $\mathbb{T}^d$ returns arbitrarily close to zero under some non-zero multiple of $R$. We show that the set $\{k!\, 2^m3^n\colon k,m,n\in \mathbb{N}\}$ is a set of Bohr recurrence. This is a particular case of a more general statement about images of such sets under any integer polynomial with zero constant term. We also show that if $P$ is a real polynomial with at least one non-constant irrational coefficient, then the set $\{P(2^m3^n)\colon m,n\in \mathbb{N}\}$ is dense in $\mathbb{T}$, thus providing a joint generalization of two well-known results, one of Furstenberg and one of Weyl.</description>

      <title>The volume of an isocanted cube is a determinant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In any dimension d&gt;=2, we give exact volume formulas of two mutually polar dual convex d--polytopes. The primal body is called isocanted cube of dimension d, depending on two real parameters 0&lt;a&lt;l. The limit case a=0 yields a d--cube of edge--length l. We prove that the volume of such a body is the determinant of the matrix of order d having diagonal entries equal to l and a elsewhere.
  We also compute the volume of the polar dual body, getting a rational expression in l and a, homogeneous of degree -d with rational coefficients.
  Isocanted cubes are origin--symmetric zonotopes. Zonoids (defined as the limits of families of zonotopes) satisfy the Mahler conjecture; in particular, zonotopes do. Nonetheless, we confirm (by elementary methods) that the Mahler conjecture holds for isocanted cubes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.10868v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is possible for a combinatorial type of polytope to have both decomposable and indecomposable realizations; here decomposability is meant with respect to Minkowski addition. Such polytopes are called conditionally decomposable. We show that the minimum number of vertices of a conditionally decomposable $d$-polytope is in the range $[3d-3, 4d-4]$, and that for a polytope having a line segment for a summand, $4d-4$ is sharp. As an application, the exact lower bound of the number of $k$-faces of a decomposable $d$-polytope with $2d+m$ vertices ($2 \le m\le d-4$) is obtained. Concerning the facets, in dimension 4, the minimum number of facets of a conditionally decomposable polytope is 9, and in dimension $d\ge 5$, the minimum is $d+4$.</description>

      <title>Finite Free Cumulants: Multiplicative Convolutions, Genus Expansion and Infinitesimal Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.08489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two polynomials $p(x), q(x)$ of degree $d$, we give a combinatorial formula for the finite free cumulants of $p(x)\boxtimes_d q(x)$. We show that this formula admits a topological expansion in terms of non-crossing multi-annular permutations on surfaces of different genera.
  This topological expansion, on the one hand, deepens the connection between the theories of finite free probability and free probability, and in particular proves that $\boxtimes_d$ converges to $\boxtimes$ as $d$ goes to infinity. On the other hand, borrowing tools from the theory of second order freeness, we use our expansion to study the infinitesimal distribution of certain families of polynomials which include Hermite and Laguerre, and draw some connections with the theory of infinitesimal distributions for real random matrices.
  Finally, building off our results we give a new short and conceptual proof of a recent result [Steinerberger (2020), Hoskins and Kabluchko (2020)] that connects root distributions of polynomial derivatives with free fractional convolution powers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.04799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article discusses random hypergraphs with varying hyperedge sizes, admitting large hyperedges with size tending to infinity, and heavy-tailed limiting hyperedge size distributions. The main result describes a threshold for the random hypergraph to be connected with high probability, and shows that the average hyperedge size suffices to characterise connectivity under mild regularity assumptions. Especially, the connectivity threshold is in most cases insensitive to the shape and higher moments of the hyperedge size distribution. Similar results are also provided for related random intersection graph models.</description>

      <title>Extending partial edge colorings of iterated cartesian products of cycles and paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of extending partial edge colorings of iterated cartesian products of even cycles and paths, focusing on the case when the precolored edges satisfy either an Evans-type condition or is a matching. In particular, we prove that if $G=C^d_{2k}$ is the $d$th power of the cartesian product of the even cycle $C_{2k}$ with itself, and at most $2d-1$ edges of $G$ are precolored, then there is a proper $2d$-edge coloring of $G$ that agrees with the partial coloring. We show that the same conclusion holds, without restrictions on the number of precolored edges, if any two precolored edges are at distance at least $4$ from each other. For odd cycles of length at least $5$, we prove that if $G=C^d_{2k+1}$ is the $d$th power of the cartesian product of the odd cycle $C_{2k+1}$ with itself ($k\geq2$), and at most $2d$ edges of $G$ are precolored, then there is a proper $(2d+1)$-edge coloring of $G$ that agrees with the partial coloring. Our results generalize previous ones on precoloring extension of hypercubes [Journal of Graph Theory 95 (2020) 410--444].</description>

      <title>$n^2 + 1$ unit equilateral triangles cannot cover an equilateral triangle of side $&gt; n$ if all triangles have parallel sides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09533v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conway and Soifer showed that an equilateral triangle $T$ of side $n + \varepsilon$ with sufficiently small $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ can be covered by $n^2 + 2$ unit equilateral triangles. They conjectured that it is impossible to cover $T$ with $n^2 + 1$ unit equilateral triangles no matter how small $\varepsilon$ is.
  We show that if we require all sides of the unit equilateral triangles to be parallel to the sides of $T$ (e.g. $\bigtriangleup$ and $\bigtriangledown$), then it is impossible to cover $T$ of side $n + \varepsilon$ with $n^2 + 1$ unit equilateral triangles for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. As the coverings of $T$ by Conway and Soifer only involve triangles with sides parallel to $T$, our result determines the exact minimum number $n^2+2$ of unit equilateral triangles with all sides parallel to $T$ that cover $T$. We also determine the largest value $\varepsilon = 1/(n + 1)$ (resp. $\varepsilon = 1 / n$) of $\varepsilon$ such that the equilateral triangle $T$ of side $n + \varepsilon$ can be covered by $n^2+2$ (resp. $n^2 + 3$) unit equilateral triangles with sides parallel to $T$, where the first case is achieved by the construction of Conway and Soifer.</description>

      <title>On kernels of descent statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The kernel $\mathcal{K}^{\operatorname{st}}$ of a descent statistic $\operatorname{st}$, introduced by Grinberg, is a subspace of the algebra $\operatorname{QSym}$ of quasisymmetric functions defined in terms of $\operatorname{st}$-equivalent compositions, and is an ideal of $\operatorname{QSym}$ if and only if $\operatorname{st}$ is shuffle-compatible. This paper continues the study of kernels of descent statistics, with emphasis on the peak set $\operatorname{Pk}$ and the peak number $\operatorname{pk}$. The kernel $\mathcal{K}^{\operatorname{Pk}}$ in particular is precisely the kernel of the canonical projection from $\operatorname{QSym}$ to Stembridge's algebra of peak quasisymmetric functions, and is the orthogonal complement of Nyman's peak algebra. We prove necessary and sufficient conditions for obtaining spanning sets and linear bases for the kernel $\mathcal{K}^{\operatorname{st}}$ of any descent statistic $\operatorname{st}$ in terms of fundamental quasisymmetric functions, and give characterizations of $\mathcal{K}^{\operatorname{Pk}}$ and $\mathcal{K}^{\operatorname{pk}}$ in terms of the fundamental basis and the monomial basis of $\operatorname{QSym}$. Our results imply that the peak set and peak number statistics are $M$-binomial, confirming a conjecture of Grinberg.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Penrose tilings are the most famous aperiodic tilings, and they have been studied extensively. In particular, patterns composed with hexagons ($H$), boats ($B$) and stars ($S$) were soon exhibited and many physicists published on what they later called $HBS$ tilings, but no article or book combines all we know about them. This work is done here, before introducing new decorations and properties including explicit substitutions. For the latter, the star comes in three versions so we have 5 prototiles in what we call the Star tileset. Yet this set yields exactly the strict $HBS$ tilings formed using 3 tiles decorated with either the usual decorations (arrows) or Ammann bar markings for instance. Another new tileset called Gemstones is also presented, derived from the Star tileset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15379v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate several extremal combinatorics problems that ask for the maximum number of copies of a fixed subgraph given the number of edges. We call problems of this type Kruskal--Katona-type problems. Most of the problems that will be discussed in this paper are related to the joints problem. There are two main results in this paper. First, we prove that, in a $3$-edge-colored graph with $R$ red, $G$ green, $B$ blue edges, the number of rainbow triangles is at most $\sqrt{2RGB}$, which is sharp. Second, we give a generalization of the Kruskal--Katona theorem that implies many other previous generalizations. Both arguments use the entropy method, and the main innovation lies in a more clever argument that improves bounds given by Shearer's inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To apportion a complex matrix means to apply a similarity so that all entries of the resulting matrix have the same magnitude. We initiate the study of apportionment, both by unitary matrix similarity and general matrix similarity. There are connections between apportionment and classical graph decomposition problems, including graceful labelings of graphs, Hadamard matrices, and equiangluar lines, and potential applications to instantaneous uniform mixing in quantum walks. The connection between apportionment and graceful labelings allows the construction of apportionable matrices from trees. A generalization of the well-known Eigenvalue Interlacing Inequalities using graceful labelings is also presented. It is shown that every rank one matrix can be apportioned by a unitary similarity, but there are $2\x 2$ matrices that cannot be apportioned. A necessary condition for a matrix to be apportioned by unitary matrix is established. This condition is used to construct a set of matrices with nonzero Lebesgue measure that are not apportionable by a unitary matrix.</description>

Abstract: We define a new pair of dual bases that generalize the immaculate and dual immaculate bases to the colored algebras $QSym_A$ and $NSym_A$. The colored dual immaculate functions are defined combinatorially via tableaux, and we present results on their Hopf algebra structure, expansions to and from other bases, and skew functions. For the colored immaculate functions, defined using creation operators, we study expansions to and from other bases and provide a right Pieri rule. This includes a combinatorial method for expanding colored immaculate functions into the colored ribbon basis that specializes to a new analogous result in the uncolored case. We use the same methods to define colored generalizations of the row-strict immaculate and row-strict dual immaculate functions with similar results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the concept of self-overlapping permutations, which is related to the larger study of consecutive patterns in permutations. We show that this concept admits a simple and clear geometrical meaning, and prove that a permutation can be represented as a sequence of non-self-overlapping ones. The above structural decomposition allows us to obtain equations for the corresponding generating functions, as well as the complete asymptotic expansions for the probability that a large random permutation is (non-)self-overlapping. In particular, we show that almost all permutations are non-self-overlapping, and that the corresponding asymptotic expansion has the self-reference property: the involved coefficients count non-self-overlapping permutations once again. We also establish complete asymptotic expansions of the distributions of very tight non-self-overlapping patterns, and discuss the similarities of the non-self-overlapping permutations to other permutation building blocks, such as indecomposable and simple permutations, as well as their associated asymptotics.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple graph of order $n$. It is known that any Laplacian eigenvalue of $G$ belongs to the interval $[0,n]$. For an interval $I\subseteq [0, n]$, denote by $m_GI$ the number of Laplacian eigenvalues of $G$ in $I$, counted with multiplicity. When $G$ is connected, known results on the Laplacian eigenvalue distribution related to the diameter $d$ of $G$ include: $m_G[n-d+2,n]\le n-d$ if $2\le d\le n-3$ and $m_G[n-d+1,n]\le n-d+1$ if $1\le d\le n-3$. In this paper, we show that $m_G[n-d,n]\le n-d+2$ if $2\le d\le n-4$, and $m_G[n-2d+4,n]\le n-2$ if $2\le d\le \lfloor\frac{n}{2} \rfloor$.</description>

      <title>Invariant theory for the face algebra of the braid arrangement</title>

Abstract: The faces of the braid arrangement form a monoid. The associated monoid algebra -- the face algebra -- is well-studied, especially in relation to card shuffling and other Markov chains. In this paper, we explore the action of the symmetric group on the face algebra from the perspective of invariant theory. Bidigare proved the invariant subalgebra of the face algebra is (anti)isomorphic to Solomon's descent algebra. We answer the more general question: what is the structure of the face algebra as a simultaneous representation of the symmetric group and Solomon's descent algebra? Special cases of our main theorem recover the Cartan invariants of Solomon's descent algebra discovered by Garsia-Reutenauer and work of Uyemura-Reyes on certain shuffling representations. Our proof techniques involve the homology of intervals in the lattice of set partitions.</description>

      <title>Classification of Integral Domains by combinatorially rich sets and extension of Goswami's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In \cite{Fi} A. Fish proved that if $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ are two subsets of $\mathbb{Z}$ of positive upper Banach density, then there exists $k\in\mathbb{Z}\setminus{0}$ such that $k\cdot\mathbb{Z}\subset\left(E_{1}-E_{1}\right)\cdot\left(E_{2}-E_{2}\right)$. In \cite{G}, S. Goswami proved the same but a fundamental result on the set of prime numbers $\mathbb{P}$ in $\mathbb{N}$ and proved that for some $k\in\mathbb{N}$, $k\cdot\mathbb{N}\subset\left(\mathbb{P}-\mathbb{P}\right)\cdot\left(\mathbb{P}-\mathbb{P}\right)$. To do so, Goswami mainly proved that the product of an $IP^{\star}$-set with an $IP_{r}^{\star}$-set contains $k\mathbb{N}$. This result is very important and surprising to mathematicians who are aware of combinatorially rich sets. In this article, we extend Goswami's result to large Lntegral Domain, that behave like $\mathbb{N}$ in the sense of some combinatorics. We prove that for a combinatorially rich ($CR$-set) set, $A$, for some $k\in\mathbb{N}$, $k\cdot\mathbb{N}\subset\left(A-A\right)\cdot\left(A-A\right)$. We provide a new proof that if we partition a large Integral Domain, $R$, into finitely many cells, then at least one cell is both additive and multiplicative central, and we prove the converse part, which is a new and unknown result.</description>

      <title>The Helly number of Hamming balls and related problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the following variant of Helly's classical theorem for Hamming balls with a bounded radius. For $n&gt;t$ and any (finite or infinite) set $X$, if in a family of Hamming balls of radius $t$ in $X^n$, every subfamily of at most $2^{t+1}$ balls have a common point, so do all members of the family. This is tight for all $|X|&gt;1$ and all $n&gt;t$. The proof of the main result is based on a novel variant of the so-called dimension argument, which allows one to prove upper bounds that do not depend on the dimension of the ambient space. We also discuss several related questions and connections to problems and results in extremal finite set theory and graph theory.</description>

      <title>Representation stability in the intrinsic hyperplane arrangements associated to irreducible representations of the symmetric-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some of the most classically relevant Hyperplane arrangements are the Braid Arrangements $B_n$ and their associated compliment spaces $\mathcal{F}_n$. In their recent work, Tsilevich, Vershik, and Yuzvinsky construct what they refer to as the intrinsic hyperplane arrangement within any irreducible representation of the symmetric group that generalize the classical braid arrangements. Through examples it is also shown that the associated compliment spaces to these intrinsic arrangements display behaviors far removed from $\mathcal{F}_n$. In this work we study the intrinsic hyperplane arrangements of irreducible representations of the symmetric group from the perspective of representation stability. This work is both theoretical, proving representation stability theorems for hyperplane complements, as well as statistical, examining the outputs of a number of simulations designed to enumerate flats.</description>

      <title>On n-dependence</title>

      <description>arXiv:1411.0120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we develop and clarify some of the basic combinatorial properties of the new notion of $n$-dependence (for $1\leq n &lt; \omega$) recently introduced by Shelah. In the same way as dependence of a theory means its inability to encode a bipartite random graph with a definable edge relation, $n$-dependence corresponds to the inability to encode a random $(n+1)$-partite $(n+1)$-hypergraph with a definable edge relation. Most importantly, we characterize $n$-dependence by counting $\varphi$-types over finite sets (generalizing Sauer-Shelah lemma and answering a question of Shelah) and in terms of the collapse of random ordered $(n+1)$-hypergraph indiscernibles down to order-indiscernibles (which implies that the failure of $n$-dependence is always witnessed by a formula in a single free variable).</description>

      <title>Fans and polytopes in tilting theory I: Foundations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.15213v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a finite dimensional algebra $A$ over a field $k$, the 2-term silting complexes of $A$ gives a simplicial complex $\Delta(A)$ called the $g$-simplicial complex. We give tilting theoretic interpretations of the $h$-vectors and Dehn-Sommerville equations of $\Delta(A)$. Using $g$-vectors of 2-term silting complexes, $\Delta(A)$ gives a nonsingular fan $\Sigma(A)$ in the real Grothendieck group $K_0(\mathsf{proj} A)_{\mathbb{R}}$ called the $g$-fan. We give several basic properties of $\Sigma(A)$ including sign-coherence, sign decomposition, idempotent reductions, Jasso reductions, pairwise positivity and a connection with Newton polytopes of $A$-modules. Moreover, $\Sigma(A)$ gives a (possibly infinite and non-convex) polytope $P(A)$ in $K_0(\mathsf{proj} A)_{\mathbb{R}}$ called the $g$-polytope of $A$. We call $A$ $g$-convex if $P(A)$ is convex. In this case, we show that it is a reflexive polytope, and that the dual polytope is given by the 2-term simple minded collections of $A$. There are precisely 7 convex $g$-polyogons up to isomorphism. We give a classification of algebras whose $g$-polytopes are smooth Fano.
  We study $g$-fans and $g$-polytopes of two important classes of algebras. We show that the $g$-fan of a classical or generalized preprojective algebra is given by the Coxeter fan. It is $g$-convex if and only if it is of type $A$ or $B$, and in this case, its $g$-polytope is the dual polytope of the short root polytope. Moreover we classify Brauer graph algebras which are $g$-convex, and describe their $g$-polytopes as the root polytopes of type $A$ or $C$.</description>

      <title>Packing, Hitting, and Colouring Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.02185v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a finite family of squares in the plane, the packing problem asks for the maximum number $\nu$ of pairwise disjoint squares among them, while the hitting problem for the minimum number $\tau$ of points hitting all of them. Clearly, $\tau \ge \nu$. Both problems are known to be NP-hard, even for families of axis-parallel unit squares.
  The main results of this work provide the first non-trivial bounds for the $\tau / \nu$ ratio for not necessarily axis-parallel squares. We establish an upper bound of $6$ for unit squares and $10$ for squares of varying sizes. The worst ratios we can provide with examples are $3$ and $4$, respectively. For comparison, in the axis-parallel case, the supremum of the considered ratio is in the interval $[\frac{3}{2},2]$ for unit squares and $[\frac{3}{2},4]$ for squares of varying sizes. The methods we introduced for the $\tau/\nu$ ratio can also be used to relate the chromatic number $\chi$ and clique number $\omega$ of squares by bounding the $\chi/\omega$ ratio by $6$ for unit squares and $9$ for squares of varying sizes.
  The $\tau / \nu$ and $\chi/\omega$ ratios have already been bounded before by a constant for "fat" objects, the fattest and simplest of which are disks and squares. However, while disks have received significant attention, specific bounds for squares have remained essentially unexplored. This work intends to fill this gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.03089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a connection between Apollonian packings and knot theory. We introduce new representations of links realized in the tangency graph of the regular crystallographic sphere packings. Particularly, we prove that any algebraic link can be realized in the cubic section of the orthoplicial Apollonian packing. We use these representations to improve the upper bound on the ball number of an infinite family of alternating algebraic links. Furthermore, the later allow us to reinterpret the correspondence of rational tangles and rational numbers and to reveal geometrically primitive solutions for the Diophantine equation $x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 2t^2$.</description>

      <title>The spectral genus of an isolated hypersurface singularity and a conjecture relating to the Milnor number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03450v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of spectral genus $\widetilde{p}_{g}$ of a germ of an isolated hypersurface singularity $(\mathbb{C}^{n+1}, 0) \to (\mathbb{C}, 0)$, defined as a sum of small exponents of monodromy eigenvalues. The number of these is equal to the geometric genus $p_{g}$, and hence $\widetilde{p}_g$ can be considered as a secondary invariant to it. We then explore a secondary version of the Durfee conjecture on $p_{g}$, and we predict an inequality between $\widetilde{p}_{g}$ and the Milnor number $\mu$, to the effect that $$\widetilde{p}_g\leq\frac{\mu-1}{(n+2)!}.$$ We provide evidence by confirming our conjecture in several cases, including homogeneous singularities and singularities with large Newton polyhedra, and quasi-homogeneous or irreducible curve singularities. We also show that a weaker inequality follows from Durfee's conjecture, and hence holds for quasi-homogeneous singularities and curve singularities.
  Our conjecture is shown to relate closely to the asymptotic behavior of the holomorphic analytic torsion of the sheaf of holomorphic functions on a degeneration of projective varieties, potentially indicating deeper geometric and analytic connections.</description>
