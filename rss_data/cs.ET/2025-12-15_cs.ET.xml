      <title>Tekum: Balanced Ternary Tapered Precision Real Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of recent hardware advances, it is striking that real arithmetic in balanced ternary logic has received almost no attention in the literature. This is particularly surprising given ternary logic's promising properties, which could open new avenues for energy-efficient computing and offer novel strategies for overcoming the memory wall.
  This paper revisits the concept of tapered precision arithmetic, as used in posit and takum formats, and introduces a new scheme for balanced ternary logic: tekum arithmetic. Several fundamental design challenges are addressed along the way. The proposed format is evaluated and shown to exhibit highly promising characteristics. In many respects, it outperforms both posits and takums. As ternary hardware matures, this work represents a crucial step toward unlocking the full potential of real-number computation in ternary systems, laying the groundwork for a new class of number formats designed from the ground up for a new category of next-generation hardware.</description>

      <title>Beyond Memristor: Neuromorphic Computing Using Meminductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memristor (resistor with memory), inductor with memory (meminductor) and capacitor with memory (memcapacitor) have different roles to play in novel computing architectures. We found that a coil with a magnetic core is an inductor with memory (meminductor) in terms of its inductance L(q) being a function of the charge q. The history of the current passing through the coil is remembered by the magnetization inside the magnetic core. Such a meminductor can play a unique role (that cannot be played by a memristor) in neuromorphic computing, deep learning and brain inspired since the time constant of a neuromorphic RLC circuit is jointly determined by the inductance and capacitance, rather than the resistance. As an experimental verification, this newly invented meminductor was used to reproduce the observed biological behaviour of amoebae (the memorizing, timing and anticipating mechanisms). In conclusion, a beyond memristor computing paradigm is theoretically sensible and experimentally practical.</description>

      <title>Processing through encoding: Quantum circuit approaches for point-wise multiplication and convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces quantum circuit methodologies for pointwise multiplication and convolution of complex functions, conceptualized as "processing through encoding". Leveraging known techniques, we describe an approach where multiple complex functions are encoded onto auxiliary qubits. Applying the proposed scheme for two functions $f$ and $g$, their pointwise product $f(x)g(x)$ is shown to naturally form as the coefficients of part of the resulting quantum state. Adhering to the convolution theorem, we then demonstrate how the convolution $f*g$ can be constructed. Similarly to related work, this involves the encoding of the Fourier coefficients $\mathcal{F}[f]$ and $\mathcal{F}[g]$, which facilitates their pointwise multiplication, followed by the inverse Quantum Fourier Transform. We discuss the simulation of these techniques, their integration into an extended \verb|quantumaudio| package for audio signal processing, and present initial experimental validations. This work offers a promising avenue for quantum signal processing, with potential applications in areas such as quantum-enhanced audio manipulation and synthesis.</description>

      <title>Pinball: A Cryogenic Predecoder for Surface Code Decoding Under Circuit-Level Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling fault tolerant quantum computers, especially cryogenic systems based on the surface code, to millions of qubits is challenging due to poorly-scaling data processing and power consumption overheads. One key hurdle is the design of real-time quantum error correction (QEC) decoders, which demands high data rates for error processing; this is particularly apparent in systems with cryogenic qubits and room temperature (RT) decoders. In response, cryogenic predecoding using lightweight logic has been proposed to handle sparse errors in the cryogenic domain. However, prior work only accounts for a subset of error sources in real-world quantum systems with limited accuracy, often degrading performance below useful levels in practical scenarios. Moreover, prior reliance on SFQ logic precludes detailed architecture-technology co-optimization.
  To address these limitations, this paper introduces Pinball, a comprehensive design in cryogenic CMOS of a QEC predecoder for the surface code tailored to realistic, circuit-level noise. By accounting for error generation and propagation through QEC circuits, our design achieves higher predecoding accuracy, outperforming logical error rates (LER) of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) cryogenic predecoder by nearly six orders of magnitude. Remarkably, despite operating under much stricter power and area constraints, Pinball also reduces LER by 32.58x and 5x, respectively, compared to SOTA RT predecoder and RT ensemble configurations. By increasing cryogenic coverage, we also reduce syndrome bandwidth up to 3780.72x. Through co-design with 4 K-characterized 22nm FDSOI technology, we achieve peak power consumption under 0.56 mW. Voltage/frequency scaling and body biasing enable 22.2x lower typical power consumption, yielding up to 67.4x total energy savings. Assuming a 1.5 W 4 K power budget, our predecoder supports up to 2,668 logical qubits at d=21.</description>
