      <title>Slowing YbF molecules using radiation pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report radiation pressure slowing of YbF molecules to low velocity. In YbF, laser slowing is hindered by leaks out of the optical cycle attributed to low-lying metastable electronic states arising from inner-shell excitation. We bring this population back into the optical cycle once it has decayed to the electronic ground state using microwaves to couple the relevant rotational levels. We measure the scattering rate and closure of the optical cycle as repumps are added, and study the destabilzation of dark states by a magnetic field and by polarization modulation, finding that both are helpful for maximizing the scattering rate. Starting from a beam with a mean speed of 80 m/s, and using frequency broadened slowing light, we reduce the mean speed of the beam and produce a substantial flux in the low velocity tail of the distribution. Slowing increases the fraction of molecules below 40 m/s from 0.4(1)% to 7.0(2)%, and the fraction below 30 m/s from zero to 3.2(1)%. The establishment of a nearly-closed optical cycle and the production of molecules at low velocity are important steps towards trapping YbF molecules for future measurements of the electron's electric dipole moment.</description>

      <title>Finite length of the solenoid and the Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scattering of a nonrelativistic electron on a narrow solenoid of finite length is considered. In this case, the magnetic field outside the solenoid is not zero. Using the eikonal approximation, the differential and total cross sections of the process are found. It is shown that the total cross section is finite, in contrast to the case of scattering on an infinitely long solenoid (Aharonov-Bohm effect). An asymmetry in the scattering cross section is also found, which can be observed in an experiment.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a simple and compact ytterbium magneto-optical trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a low Size, Weight and Power (SWaP), low-complexity, ytterbium magneto-optical trap (MOT). We demonstrate trapping of $1.4 \times 10^6$ $^{171}$Yb atoms on the $|{^1S_0}, F = 1/2\rangle \leftrightarrow |{^1P_1}, F' = 3/2\rangle$ transition directly from a hot thermal beam. We explore the effect of trap detuning and oven temperature on trap number, density, loading rate and sample temperature. The low SWaP and low-complexity design presents a realistic pathway towards portable ytterbium MOTs, allowing cold atom ytterbium systems to escape the confines of the laboratory and perform precision measurements in field environments.</description>

      <title>Magnetic shielding in the atomic hydrogen anion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atomic hydrogen anion H$^-$ is the lightest stable anion and its bound states and resonances are well studied in the literature. Due to the planned comparison of the bare antiproton to H$^-$ in a Penning trap, we study the magnetic shielding of H$^-$ using the nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics theory, by accurately calculating the non-relativistic shielding, as well as finite nuclear mass, relativistic, and partially QED corrections. We find that the finite nuclear mass correction is quite significant in H$^-$ contributing about $0.1\%$ of the total shielding, which is more than twice as much as the relativistic correction. Our final result for the shielding constant has a nine-parts-per-trillion accuracy and paves the way for direct comparison of the antiproton-to-proton magnetic moments.</description>

      <title>Trapping of electrons and $^{40}\textrm{Ca}^+$ ions in a dual-frequency Paul trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the operation of a dual-frequency Paul trap and characterize its performance by storing either electrons or calcium ions while applying two quadrupole fields simultaneously which oscillate at $\Omega_\textrm{fast} = 2\pi \times 1.6$ GHz and $\Omega_\textrm{slow} = 2\pi \times 2$ MHz. The particles are loaded and stored in the trap under various conditions followed by detection employing an electron multiplier tube. We find that tens of electrons or ions can be trapped for up to ten milliseconds and a small fraction remains trapped even after hundreds of milliseconds. During dual-frequency operation we find that while the number of trapped electrons rapidly decreases with increase of the $\Omega_\textrm{slow}$ field amplitude, the number of trapped ions shows no dependence on the $\Omega_\textrm{fast}$ field amplitude as supported by our extensive numerical simulations. We aim to use a similar trap for synthesising antihydrogen from antiprotons and positrons. Accordingly, we discuss open challenges such as the co-trapping of oppositely charged species and particle trap duration.</description>

      <title>Robust Control and Entanglement of Qudits in Neutral Atom Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum devices comprised of elementary components with more than two stable levels - so-called qudits - enrich the accessible Hilbert space, enabling applications ranging from fault-tolerant quantum computing to simulating complex many-body models. While several quantum platforms are built from local elements that are equipped with a rich spectrum of stable energy levels, schemes for the efficient control and entanglement of qudits are scarce. Importantly, no experimental demonstration of multi-qudit control has been achieved to date in neutral atom arrays. Here, we propose a general scheme for controlling and entangling qudits and perform a full analysis for the case of qutrits, encoded in ground and metastable states of alkaline earth atoms. We find an efficient implementation of single-qudit gates via the simultaneous driving of multiple transition frequencies. For entangling operations, we provide a concrete and intuitive recipe for the controlled-Z (CZ) gate for any local dimension d, realized through alternating single qudit and entangling pulses that simultaneously drive up to two Rydberg transitions. We further prove that two simultaneous Rydberg tones are, in general, the minimum necessary for implementing the CZ gate with a global drive. The pulses we use are optimally-controlled, smooth, and robust to realistic experimental imperfections, as we demonstrate using extensive noise simulations. This amounts to a minimal, resource-efficient, and practical protocol for realizing a universal set of gates. Our scheme for the native control of qudits in a neutral atom array provides a high-fidelity route toward qudit-based quantum computation, ready for implementation on near-term devices.</description>

      <title>Heatpipe-cooled in-vacuum electromagnet for quantum science experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum inertial sensors test general relativity, measure fundamental constants, and probe dark matter and dark energy in the laboratory with outstanding accuracy. Their precision relies heavily on carefully choreographed quantum control of the atomic states with a collection of lasers, microwaves, electric and magnetic fields. Making this technology available outside of the laboratory would unlock many applications, such as geophysics, geodesy and inertial navigation. However, this requires an apparatus of reduced size, weight, power use and increased robustness, modularity and ease-of-use. Here, we describe the design and implementation of an in-vacuum electromagnet able to create the magnetic fields necessary for various quantum control operations, such as magneto-optical trapping or magnetic levitation to assist evaporative cooling. Placing the electromagnet inside the vacuum chamber has significant advantages, such as fast switching times that are not limited by induced current inside the vacuum chamber metal, reduced size, weight and power usage. However, dissipating the heat produced typically requires complex designs that include bulky metal heatsinks or cooling using water or cryogens. Our design implements heatpipes in a compact, low-vibration and robust apparatus, which use a phase transition in the working fluid to achieve thermal conductivity that is more than one hundred times larger than that of typical bulk metal. We show that the setup can conduct more than 50 W of thermal power in a configuration that provides ample optical access and is compatible with the ultra-high vacuum requirements of atomic and molecular experiments.</description>

      <title>Continuously trapped matter-wave interferometry in magic Floquet-Bloch band structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11881v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trapped matter-wave interferometry offers the promise of compact high-precision local force sensing. However, noise in the trap itself can introduce new systematic errors which are absent in traditional free-fall interferometers. We describe and demonstrate an intrinsically noise-tolerant Floquet-engineered platform for continuously trapped atom interferometry. A non-interacting degenerate quantum gas undergoes position-space Bloch oscillations through an amplitude-modulated optical lattice, whose resulting Floquet-Bloch band structure includes Landau-Zener beamsplitters and Bragg mirrors, forming the components of a Mach-Zehnder interferometric force sensor. We identify, realize, and experimentally characterize magic band structures, analogous to the magic wavelengths employed in optical lattice clocks, for which the interferometric phase is insensitive to lattice intensity noise. We leverage the intrinsic programmability of the Floquet band synthesis approach to demonstrate a variety of interferometer structures, highlighting the potential of this technique for quantum force sensors which are tunable, compact, simple, and robust.</description>

      <title>Precision Spectroscopy of the Fine Structure in the $\boldsymbol{a\;{}^3\Sigma_u^+(v=0)}$ and $\boldsymbol{c\;{}^3\Sigma_g^+(v=4)}$ States of the Helium Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With four electrons, He$_2$ is one of very few molecules for which first-principles quantum-chemical calculations that include the treatment of nonadiabatic, relativistic and quantum-electrodynamics corrections are possible. Precise spectroscopic measurements are needed as references to test these calculations. We report here on a spectroscopic measurement of the $c$ $^3\Sigma_g^+\leftarrow a$ $^3\Sigma_u^+$ electronic transition of $^4$He$_2$ at a precision ($\Delta \nu/\nu$) of $2.5\times 10^{-10}$ and with full resolution of the rotational, spin-spin and spin-rotational fine structures. The investigation focuses on transitions to the rotational levels of the $c$ $^3\Sigma_g^+(v=4)$ state, located energetically above the He$(1$ $^1S_0) + $He$(2$ $^3S_1)$ dissociation limit and decaying by tunneling predissociation through a barrier in the $c$ state. The new data include a full map of the energy levels of the $a$ $^3\Sigma_u^+(v=0)$ and $c$ $^3\Sigma_g^+(v=4)$ states with rotational quantum numbers $N$ up to 9 and 10, respectively, and full sets of fine-structure intervals in these levels for comparison with first-principles calculations from a parallel investigation [B. R\'acsai, P. Jeszenszki, A. Marg\'ocsy and E. Maty\'us, arXiv:2506.23879v1 (2025)]. The new data were combined with data from earlier measurements of the spectrum of the $c-a$ band system of $^4$He$_2$ to derive full sets of molecular constants for the $a$ $^3\Sigma_u^+(v=0)$ and $c$ $^3\Sigma_g^+(v=4)$ states with much improved precision over previous experimental results. A pronounced broadening of the linewidths of the transitions to the $c$ $^3\Sigma_g^+(v=4,N=10)$ fine-structure levels is attributed to tunneling predissociation through a barrier in the potential of the $c$ state and is quantitatively accounted for by calculations of the predissociation widths.</description>

      <title>A practical guide to feedback control for Pound-Drever-Hall laser linewidth narrowing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) technique for laser linewidth narrowing is widely used by AMO experimentalists. However, achieving a high-performance PDH locking requires substantial engineering experience, which is scattered across literature and often lacks a cohesive control-theory perspective. Excellent pedagogical papers exist on the theory of the PDH error signal but they rarely cover feedback control. General-purpose control theory literature seldom discuss PDH laser locking specifically. Although excellent PDH review articles provide thorough knowledge and practice on both aspects but they are not reader-friendly. We extend prior works by addressing component choice and loop tuning using modern tools like a vector network analyzer. We organize multifaceted engineering considerations systematically, grounded in feedback control principles. Our target reader is researchers setting up a PDH laser lock for the first time; we eschew advanced topics like minimizing residual amplitude modulation (RAM). Our guidance is illustrated by step-by-step optimization of the lock for a 1650 nm ECDL.</description>
