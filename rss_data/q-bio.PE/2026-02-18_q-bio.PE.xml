      <title>Household size can explain 40% of the variance in cumulative COVID-19 incidence across Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Household size impacts the spread of respiratory infectious diseases: Larger households tend to boost transmission by acquiring external infections more frequently and subsequently transmitting them back into the community. Furthermore, mandatory interventions primarily modulate contagion between households rather than within them. We developed an approach to quantify the role of household size in epidemics by separating within-household from out-household transmission, and found that household size explains 41% of the variability in cumulative COVID-19 incidence across 34 European countries (95% confidence interval: [15%, 46%]). The contribution of households to the overall dynamics can be quantified by a boost factor that increases with the effective household size, implying that countries with larger households require more stringent interventions to achieve the same levels of containment. This suggests that households constitute a structural (dis-)advantage that must be considered when designing and evaluating mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Topological Percolation in Urban Dengue Transmission: A Multi-Scale Analysis of Spatial Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the spatial organization of dengue cases in the city of Recife, Brazil, from 2015 to 2024, using tools from statistical physics and topological data analysis. Reported cases are modeled as point clouds in a metric space, and their spatial connectivity is studied through Vietoris-Rips filtrations and zero-dimensional persistent homology, which captures the emergence and collapse of connected components across spatial scales. By parametrizing the filtration using percentiles of the empirical distance distribution, we identify critical percolation thresholds associated with abrupt growth of the largest connected component. These thresholds define distinct geometric regimes, ranging from fragmented spatial patterns to highly concentrated, percolated structures. Remarkably, years with similar incidence levels exhibit qualitatively different percolation behavior, demonstrating that case counts alone do not determine the spatial organization of transmission. Our analysis further reveals pronounced temporal heterogeneity in the percolation properties of dengue spread, including a structural rupture in 2020 characterized by delayed or absent spatial percolation. These findings highlight percolation-based topological observables as physically interpretable and sensitive descriptors of urban epidemic structure, offering a complementary perspective to traditional spatial and epidemiological analyses.</description>

      <title>New sector morphologies emerge from anisotropic colony growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Competition during range expansions is of great interest from both practical and theoretical view points. Experimentally, range expansions are often studied in homogeneous Petri dishes, which lack spatial anisotropy that might be present in realistic populations. Here, we analyze a model of anisotropic growth, based on coupled Kardar-Parisi-Zhang and Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov equations that describe surface growth and lateral competition. Compared to a previous study of isotropic growth, anisotropy relaxes a constraint between parameters of the model. We completely characterize spatial patterns and invasion velocities in this generalized model. In particular, we find that strong anisotropy results in a distinct morphology of spatial invasion with a kink in the displaced strain ahead of the boundary between the strains. This morphology of the out-competed strain is similar to a shock wave and serves as a signature of anisotropic growth.</description>

      <title>Correlation-Weighted Communicability Curvature as a Structural Driver of Dengue Spread: A Bayesian Spatial Analysis of Recife (2015-2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00315v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether the structural connectivity of urban road networks helps explain dengue incidence in Recife, Brazil (2015--2024). For each neighborhood, we compute the average \emph{communicability curvature}, a graph-theoretic measure capturing the ability of a locality to influence others through multiple network paths. We integrate this metric into Negative Binomial models, fixed-effects regressions, SAR/SAC spatial models, and a hierarchical INLA/BYM2 specification. Across all frameworks, curvature is the strongest and most stable predictor of dengue risk. In the BYM2 model, the structured spatial component collapses ($\phi \approx 0$), indicating that functional network connectivity explains nearly all spatial dependence typically attributed to adjacency-based CAR terms. The results show that dengue spread in Recife is driven less by geographic contiguity and more by network-mediated structural flows.</description>
