      <title>Scalable covalently functionalized black phosphorus hybrids for broadspectrum virucidal activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the onset of viral outbreaks, broad-spectrum antiviral materials are crucial before specific therapeutics become available. We report scalable, biodegradable black phosphorus (BP) hybrids that provide mutation-resilient virucidal protection. BP sheets, produced via an optimized mechanochemical process, are covalently functionalized with 2-azido-4,6-dichloro- 1,3,5-triazine to form P=N bonds. Fucoidan, a sulfated polysaccharide with intrinsic antiviral activity, and hydrophobic chains are then incorporated to achieve irreversible viral deactivation. The material exhibits strong antiviral inhibition and complete virucidal activity against multiple viruses, including recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants. It maintains high biocompatibility, remains effective against viral mutations, and is shelf stable for at least five month. The combination of biodegradability, scalable synthesis, and synergistic antiviral and virucidal mechanisms establishes BP-conjugates as a new class of highly efficient antivirals. They offer a broad spectrum antiviral solutions that could bridge the gap between antiviral medicines and general antiseptics.</description>

      <title>What is Implementation Science; and Why It Matters for Bridging the Artificial Intelligence Innovation-to-Application Gap in Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical Imaging (MI) is well recognized. Yet despite promising reports in research settings, many AI tools fail to achieve clinical adoption in practice. In fact, more generally, there is a documented 17-year average delay between evidence generation and implementation of a technology1. Implementation science (IS) may provide a practical, evidence-based framework to bridge the gap between AI development and real-world clinical imaging use that helps shorten this lag through systematic frameworks, strategies, and hybrid research designs. We outline challenges specific to AI adoption in MI workflows, including infrastructural, educational, and cultural barriers. We highlight the complementary roles of effectiveness research and implementation research, emphasizing hybrid study designs and the role of integrated KT (iKT), stakeholder engagement, and equity-focused co-creation in designing sustainable and generalizable solutions. We discuss integration of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) frameworks in MI towards usable AI. Adopting IS is not only a methodological advancement; it is a strategic imperative for accelerating translation of innovation into improved patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Towards Human-Centric Intelligent Treatment Planning for Radiation Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current radiation therapy treatment planning is limited by suboptimal plan quality, inefficiency, and high costs. This perspective paper explores the complexity of treatment planning and introduces Human-Centric Intelligent Treatment Planning (HCITP), an AI-driven framework under human oversight, which integrates clinical guidelines, automates plan generation, and enables direct interactions with operators. We expect that HCITP will enhance efficiency, potentially reducing planning time to minutes, and will deliver personalized, high-quality plans. Challenges and potential solutions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Five Years of Clinical Application of independent Monte Carlo-Based Patient-Specific Quality Assurance at the Maastro Proton Therapy Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the Maastro Proton Therapy Center in Maastricht, patient-specific quality assurance (PSQA) using an independent GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo (MC) calculation has fully replaced conventional measurements, which are time-consuming and have limited sensitivity to clinically relevant errors.
  A fully automated and robust pipeline was developed, integrating two clinical workflows based on the fast MC code Fred. The system is fully operational, and automatic verification reports are part of daily clinical practice.
  The first workflow performs a pre-treatment dose recalculation in Fred using the planning CT and clinical plan. The second uses Fred with machine log files to verify the actually delivered dose. Both generate automatic reports for clinical review.
  Over five years, this workflow has become part of routine clinical operations, providing robust 3D dosimetric verification in heterogeneous anatomies. So far, Fred has recalculated more than 6000 pre-treatment plans and 3513 log file-based PSQA cases, saving an estimated 4090 hours of QA work. The pipeline identified true negatives and detected two planning-related failures that would have been missed by conventional measurements. No false positives or negatives were observed, confirming high accuracy and reliability.
  The MC-based PSQA pipeline offers an efficient, sensitive, and clinically meaningful alternative to measurement-based QA in pencil beam scanning proton therapy. By eliminating routine measurements, it saves resources while improving patient safety and treatment quality. Five years of experience confirm that measurement-less MC-based PSQA is a viable and superior approach, providing full 3D verification and early error detection - a practical blueprint for other proton therapy centres.</description>

      <title>Steerable Conditional Diffusion for Domain Adaptation in PET Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently enabled state-of-the-art reconstruction of positron emission tomography (PET) images while requiring only image training data. However, domain shift remains a key concern for clinical adoption: priors trained on images from one anatomy, acquisition protocol or pathology may produce artefacts on out-of-distribution data. We propose integrating steerable conditional diffusion (SCD) with our previously-introduced likelihood-scheduled diffusion (PET-LiSch) framework to improve the alignment of the diffusion model's prior to the target subject. At reconstruction time, for each diffusion step, we use low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to align the diffusion model prior with the target domain on the fly. Experiments on realistic synthetic 2D brain phantoms demonstrate that our approach suppresses hallucinated artefacts under domain shift, i.e. when our diffusion model is trained on perturbed images and tested on normal anatomy, our approach suppresses the hallucinated structure, outperforming both OSEM and diffusion model baselines qualitatively and quantitatively. These results provide a proof-of-concept that steerable priors can mitigate domain shift in diffusion-based PET reconstruction and motivate future evaluation on real data.</description>

      <title>An efficient approach with theoretical guarantees to simultaneously reconstruct activity and attenuation sinogram for TOF-PET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In positron emission tomography (PET), it is indispensable to perform attenuation correction in order to obtain the quantitatively accurate activity map (tracer distribution) in the body. Generally, this is carried out based on the estimated attenuation map obtained from computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. However, except for errors in the attenuation correction factors obtained, the additional scan not only brings in new radiation doses and/or increases the scanning time but also leads to severe misalignment induced by various motions during and between the two sequential scans. To address these issues, based on maximum likelihood estimation, we propose a new mathematical model for simultaneously reconstructing the activity and attenuation sinogram from the time-of-flight (TOF)-PET emission data only. Particularly, we make full use of the exclusively exponential form for the attenuation correction factors, and consider the constraint of a total amount of the activity in some mask region in the proposed model. Furthermore, we prove its well-posedness, including the existence, uniqueness and stability of the solution. We propose an alternating update algorithm to solve the model, and also analyze its convergence. Finally, numerical experiments with various TOF-PET emission data demonstrate that the proposed method is of numerical convergence and robust to noise, and outperforms some state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency, and has the capability of autonomous attenuation correction.</description>

      <title>Spherical Radiomics - A Novel Approach to Glioblastoma Radiogenomic Analysis of Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and validate a novel spherical radiomics framework for predicting key molecular biomarkers using multiparametric MRI. Conventional Cartesian radiomics extract tumor features on orthogonal grids, which do not fully capture the tumor's radial growth patterns and can be insensitive to evolving molecular signatures. In this study, we analyzed GBM radiomic features on concentric 2D shells, which were then mapped onto 2D planes for radiomics analysis. Radiomic features were extracted using PyRadiomics from four different regions in GBM. Feature selection was performed using ANOVA F-statistics. Classification was conducted with multiple machine-learning models. Model interpretability was evaluated through SHAP analysis, clustering analysis, feature significance profiling, and comparison between radiomic patterns and underlying biological processes. Spherical radiomics consistently outperformed conventional 2D and 3D Cartesian radiomics across all prediction tasks. The best framework reached an AUC of 0.85 for MGMT, 0.80 for EGFR, 0.80 for PTEN, and 0.83 for survival prediction. GLCM-derived features were identified as the most informative predictors. Radial transition analysis using the Mann-Whitney U-test demonstrates that transition slopes between T1-weighted contrast-enhancing and T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesion regions, as well as between T2 intense lesion and a 2 cm peritumoral expansion region, are significantly associated with biomarker status. Furthermore, the observed radiomic changes along the radial direction closely reflected known biological characteristics. Radiomic features extracted on the spherical surfaces at varying radial distances to the GBM tumor centroid are better correlated with important tumor molecular markers and patient survival than the conventional Cartesian analysis.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanical Analysis of Neutron Wavefunction Overlap and Nuclear Interaction Probability with Carborane Cage ($^{10}$B10) in Boron Neutron Capture Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) leverages the nuclear reaction between thermal neutrons and boron-10 (B-10) atoms to induce selective tumor cell death. The spatial and quantum mechanical overlap between the neutron wavefunction and B-10 nuclei encapsulated in carborane cages (C2B10H12) is fundamental to optimizing therapeutic efficacy. This study presents a quantum mechanical framework to evaluate the neutron-boron interaction probability by modeling neutron wavefunctions and the spatial distribution of boron atoms within the carborane cages. Using spherical harmonics and density functional theory (DFT)-derived geometries of carborane, the neutron scattering amplitudes and reaction cross sections are quantitatively analyzed. The implications of neutron spin states, nuclear magnetic moments, and external perturbations on the neutron capture probability are discussed. The computed neutron scattering amplitudes and reaction cross sections provide a basis for evaluating neutron-boron interaction probabilities under varied quantum conditions. The proposed model offers theoretical insights into molecular-level design considerations for enhancing the efficiency of BNCT.</description>

      <title>A Quantitative Holographic Agglutination Assay for Immunoglobulin A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a Holographic Agglutination Assay for quantifying levels of the immunoglobulin protein IgA in biological samples. This is the first example of a label-free and bead-free assay that quantifies protein agglutinates by direct detection using Total Holographic Characterization. A proof-of-concept assay for human serum immunoglobulins is demonstrated using Jacalin, the galactose-specific plant lectin, to induce selective agglutination.
  By analyzing the size, refractive index, and number of particles in an assay sample, we obtain a reproducible and quantitative measurement of galactosylated immunoglobulins in a given sample. The assay is calibrated for a physiologically relevant reference interval of IgA concentrations in a 10x diluted emulated biological sample from low (80 mg/dL, 5 {\mu}M) to high (320 mg/dL, 20 {\mu}M) levels. The assay clearly distinguishes samples containing IgA from samples containing IgG.
  More broadly, this study introduces a platform for creating lectin-mediated Holographic Agglutination Assays to monitor levels of immunoglobulins in biological samples. The ability to quantify immunoglobulin levels efficiently in clinical samples is likely to be valuable for diagnostics and will provide a basis for assaying other proteins that can be induced to agglutinate.</description>

      <title>RAIDER: Rapid, anatomy-independent, deep learning-based PDFF and R2* estimation using magnitude-only signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01178v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been recent interest in the use of magnitude-based fitting methods for estimating proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and R2* from chemical shift-encoded MRI (CSE-MRI) data, since these methods can still be used when complex- based methods fail or when phase data are inaccessible or unreliable (such as in multicentre trials, low resource settings, preclinical imaging and national cohort datasets), and may also be used as a final processing step with complex-based methods. However, conventional fitting techniques are computationally expensive. Deep learning (DL)-based methods promise to accelerate parameter estimation, but there are no existing deep learning methods for voxelwise CSE-MRI tissue parameter estimation. Here, we show that a naive voxelwise multilayer perceptron (MLP) implementation suffers from poor performance because multiple tissue parameter values can produce similar signals (degeneracy), potentially accounting for this gap in the literature. To address this problem and realise the potential acceleration offered by MLP-based tissue parameter estimation, we propose RAIDER, a voxelwise method for rapid, anatomy-independent deep learning-based PDFF and R2* estimation using multi-echo magnitude-data. RAIDER utilises two neural networks, each with a separately-designed training data distribution, to deal with degeneracy and thus realise the benefits of an MLP-based approach, with a 400-fold to 2800-fold acceleration (meaning that processing takes just seconds, rather than minutes or hours). Our code is available at https://github.com/TJPBray/DixonDL.</description>

      <title>Conceptualization of ionization dose to water for dosimetry in external beam radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21948v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Absorbed dose or temperature rise may not be essential for radiotherapy for its limited biological relevance. This study conceptualizes ionization dose to water, which is the absorbed dose to water expended on ionization, to represent biologically more relevant doses. Based on the international code of practice for ionization chamber dosimetry with cobalt calibration, the procedures to measure ionization dose were formulated for high-energy photon, electron, proton, and ion beams. Nitrogen-based water-equivalent gas (WEG) mixtures were designed for proton and ion beams. The proposed procedures were theoretically simulated for test beams of respective types. The calibrated ionization dose virtually measured with a common ionization chamber was identical to the absorbed dose for high-energy photon and electron beams, and was reasonably compatible with uncertainty reduced from 1.4% to 1.3% for a proton beam and from 2.4% to 1.9% for an ion beam. With an WEG ionization chamber, the uncertainty was further reduced to 0.7% for the proton beam and 1.0% for the ion beam. The new dose concept, calibrated ionization dose to water, may be used directly in current radiotherapy practice with reduced uncertainty. Its minimized beam-quality correction will be advantageous for complex clinical beams of various types and in non-reference conditions not covered by the standard dosimetry protocols. It is also less affected by nuclear energies, which have been overlooked in the long-established dosimetric concepts including absorbed dose.</description>

      <title>Accurate myocardial T1 mapping at 5T using an improved MOLLI method: A validation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08425v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Accurate myocardial T1 mapping at 5T remains a technical challenge due to field inhomogeneity and prolonged T1 values. The aim of this study is to develop an accurate and clinically applicable myocardial T1 mapping technique for 5T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems and validate its performance in a multicenter study. Methods: The proposed method is based on a 5-(3)-3 MOLLI sequence, dubbed combined-correction MOLLI (coMOLLI), which corrects for both inversion efficiency and readout-induced signal disturbances. Specifically, coMOLLI employs a gradient recalled echo (GRE) readout rather than the commonly used bSSFP readout. Its signal evolution is modeled to estimate T1 values, which incorporates both inversion efficiency and readout disturbances to improve fitting accuracy. To further enhance accuracy, the inversion pulse was redesigned under hardware constraints and the observed B0 and B1 variations over the heart at 5T, using adiabatic hyperbolic secant (HSn) and tangent/hyperbolic tangent (Tan/Tanh) pulses. The method was validated in phantom experiments, as well as in 21 healthy volunteers and 9 patients. Results: The optimized inversion pulse at 5T is the Tan/Tanh pulse with A = 10 kHz, K_s = 4, k = 22, and T_p = 8 ms. In phantom studies, coMOLLI showed high accuracy versus reference IR-FSE, yielding relative errors within 5% for all nine vials. In vivo studies, the average native myocardial T1 values across 21 healthy volunteers were 1468 +/- 48 ms, 1514 +/- 39 ms, and 1545 +/- 50 ms, and blood T1 values were 2182 +/- 132 ms, 2124 +/- 153 ms, and 2131 +/- 158 ms for apical, middle, and base slices, respectively. Conclusion: The coMOLLI method demonstrated high accuracy in phantom studies and feasibility in vivo studies. By adopting the widely used 5-(3)-3 MOLLI acquisition scheme, it shows potential for clinical cardiac imaging at 5T.</description>
