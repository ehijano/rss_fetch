      <title>Investigating Technological Solutions for Addressing Water Scarcity in Agricultural Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This comprehensive study investigates the intricate relationship between water scarcity and agricultural production, emphasizing its critical global significance. The research, through multidimensional analysis, investigates the various effects of water scarcity on crop productivity, especially the economic water scarcity (AEWS) which is the main factor of influence. The study stresses the possibility of vertical farming as a viable solution to the different kinds of water scarcity problems, hence, it emphasizes its function in the sustainable agricultural development. Although the study recognizes that some problems still remain, it also points out the necessity of more research to solve the issues of scalability and socio-economic implications. Moving forward, interdisciplinary collaboration and technological innovation are essential to achieving water-secure agriculture and societal resilience.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Role of Perceived Range Anxiety in Adoption Behavior of Plug-in Electric Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A sustainable solution to negative externalities imposed by road transportation is replacing internal combustion vehicles with electric vehicles (EVs), especially plug-in EV (PEV) encompassing plug-in hybrid EV (PHEV) and battery EV (BEV). However, EV market share is still low and is forecast to remain low and uncertain. This shows a research need for an in-depth understanding of EV adoption behavior with a focus on one of the main barriers to the mass EV adoption, which is the limited electric driving range. The present study extends the existing literature in two directions; First, the influence of the psychological aspect of driving range, which is referred to as range anxiety, is explored on EV adoption behavior by presenting a nested logit (NL) model with a latent construct. Second, the two-level NL model captures individuals' decision on EV adoption behavior distinguished by vehicle transaction type and EV type, where the upper level yields the vehicle transaction type selected from the set of alternatives including no-transaction, sell, trade, and add. The fuel type of the vehicles decided to be acquired, either as traded-for or added vehicles, is simultaneously determined at the lower level from a set including conventional vehicle, hybrid EV, PHEV, and BEV. The model is empirically estimated using a stated preferences dataset collected in the State of California. A notable finding is that anxiety about driving range influences the preference for BEV, especially as an added than traded-for vehicle, but not the decision on PHEV adoption.</description>

      <title>Meritocracy and Its Discontents: Long-run Effects of Repeated School Admission Reforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04429v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What happens if selective colleges change their admission policies? We study this question by analyzing the world's first implementation of nationally centralized meritocratic admissions in the early twentieth century. We find a persistent meritocracy-equity tradeoff. Compared to the decentralized system, the centralized system admitted more high-achievers and produced more occupational elites (such as top income earners) decades later in the labor market. This gain came at a distributional cost, however. Meritocratic centralization also increased the number of urban-born elites relative to rural-born ones, undermining equal access to higher education and career advancement.</description>

      <title>Securing the supply of graphite for batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing demand for graphite in batteries, particularly for electric vehicles, has led to concerns around supply chain security. Currently, over 92% of global anode material is produced in China, posing a geopolitical risk for other countries reliant on graphite supply for domestic industries. This paper assesses the costs of producing battery-grade graphite (natural and synthetic) in the US and China using process-based cost models. We find that production costs in the US significantly exceed those in China due to higher capital intensity and input costs. Our analysis reveals that a majority of modeled projects in the US are not competitive at current market prices. We identify key cost drivers, including capital costs, economies of scale, and input material prices, and explore pathways to improve the competitiveness of US graphite production, such as supportive financing and process innovation directions. The analysis of conventional graphite production costs at scale also informs ceiling costs for alternative, promising pathways such as methane pyrolysis and catalytic graphitization. This study highlights the challenges and trade-offs in building a diversified graphite supply chain and informs policy and investment decisions.</description>

      <title>Strategic Informed Trading and the Value of Private Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a market of risky financial assets whose participants are an informed trader, a representative uninformed trader, and noisy liquidity providers. We prove the existence of a market-clearing equilibrium when the insider internalizes her power to impact prices, but the uninformed trader takes prices as given. Compared to the associated competitive economy, in equilibrium the insider strategically reveals a noisier signal, and prices are less reactive to publicly available information. Additionally, and in direct contrast to the related literature, in equilibrium the insider's indirect utility monotonically increases in the signal precision. Therefore, the insider is motivated not only to obtain, but also to refine, her signal. Lastly, we show that compared to the competitive economy, the insider's internalization of price impact is utility improving for the uninformed trader, but somewhat surprisingly may be utility decreasing for the insider herself. This utility reduction occurs provided the insider is sufficiently risk averse compared to the uninformed trader, and provided the signal is of sufficiently low quality.</description>
