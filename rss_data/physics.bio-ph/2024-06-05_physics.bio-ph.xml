      <title>Cell divisions imprint long lasting elastic strain fields in epithelial tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hallmark of biological tissues, viewed as complex cellular materials, is the active generation of mechanical stresses by cellular processes, such as cell divisions. Each cellular event generates a force dipole that deforms the surrounding tissue. Therefore, a quantitative description of these force dipoles, and their consequences on tissue mechanics, is one of the central problems in understanding the overall tissue mechanics. In this work we analyze previously published experimental data on fruit fly \textit{D. melanogaster} wing epithelia to quantitatively describe the deformation fields induced by a cell-scale force dipole. We find that the measured deformation field can be explained by a simple model of fly epithelium as a linearly elastic sheet. This fact allows us to use measurements of the strain field around cellular events, such as cell divisions, to infer the magnitude and dynamics of the mechanical forces they generate. In particular, we find that cell divisions exert a transient isotropic force dipole field, corresponding to the temporary localisation of the cell nucleus to the tissue surface during the division, and traceless-symmetric force dipole field that remains detectable from the tissue strain field for up to about $3.5$ hours after the division. This is the timescale on which elastic strains are erased by other mechanical processes and therefore it corresponds to the tissue fluidization timescale. In summary, we have developed a method to infer force dipoles induced by cell divisions, by observing the strain field in the surrounding tissues. Using this method we quantitatively characterize mechanical forces generated during a cell division, and their effects on the tissue mechanics.</description>

      <title>Optimising microstructural characterisation of white-matter phantoms: impact of gradient waveform modulation on Non-uniform Oscillating Gradient Spin-Echo sequences</title>

Abstract: Changes in the nervous system due to neurological diseases take place at very small spatial scales, on the order of the micro and nanometers. Developing non-invasive imaging methods for obtaining this microscopic information as quantitative biomarkers is therefore crucial for improved medical diagnosis. In this context, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging has shown significant advances in revealing tissue microstructural features by probing molecular diffusion processes. Implementing modulated gradient spin-echo sequences allows monitoring time-dependent diffusion processes to reveal such detailed information. In particular, one of those sequences termed Non-uniform Oscillating Gradient Spin-Echo (NOGSE), has shown to selectively characterise microstructure sizes by generating an image contrast based on a signal decay-shift rather than on the conventionally used signal decay rate. In this work, we prove that such decay-shift is more pronounced with instantaneous switches of the magnetic field gradient strength sign. As fast gradient ramps need to be avoided in clinical settings, due to potential patient discomfort and artefacts in imaging, we evaluate the method's efficacy for estimating microstructure sizes using both idealised, sharp gradient modulations and more realistic, smooth modulations. In this more realistic scenario, we find that the signal decay shift might be lost as the diffusion time increases, likely hindering the accurate estimation of microstructural characteristics. We demonstrate, by a combination of numerical simulations, information theory analysis and proof-of-principle experiments with white-matter phantoms, that optimal sequence design to estimate microstructure size distributions can be achieved using either sharp or smooth gradient spin-echo modulations. This approach simplifies the translation of the NOGSE method for its use in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Single-shot volumetric fluorescence imaging with neural fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10463</link>

Abstract: Single-shot volumetric fluorescence (SVF) imaging offers a significant advantage over traditional imaging methods that require scanning across multiple axial planes as it can capture biological processes with high temporal resolution across a large field of view. The key challenges in SVF imaging include requiring sparsity constraints to meet the multiplexing requirements of compressed sensing, eliminating depth ambiguity in the reconstruction, and maintaining high resolution across a large field of view. In this paper, we introduce the QuadraPol point spread function (PSF) combined with neural fields, a novel approach for SVF imaging. This method utilizes a custom polarizer at the back focal plane and a polarization camera to detect fluorescence, effectively encoding the 3D scene within a compact PSF without depth ambiguity. Additionally, we propose a reconstruction algorithm based on the neural fields technique that provides improved reconstruction quality and addresses the inaccuracies of phase retrieval methods used to correct imaging system aberrations. This algorithm combines the accuracy of experimental PSFs with the long depth of field of computationally generated retrieved PSFs. QuadraPol PSF, combined with neural fields, significantly reduces the acquisition time of a conventional fluorescence microscope by approximately 20 times and captures a 100 mm$^3$ cubic volume in one shot. We validate the effectiveness of both our hardware and algorithm through all-in-focus imaging of bacterial colonies on sand surfaces and visualization of plant root morphology. Our approach offers a powerful tool for advancing biological research and ecological studies.</description>
