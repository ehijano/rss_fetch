      <title>The global well-posedness for master equations of mean field games of controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we establish the global well-posedness for master equations of mean field games of controls, where the interaction is through the joint law of the state and control. Our results are proved under two different conditions: the Lasry-Lions monotonicity and the displacement $\lambda$-monotonicity, both considered in their integral forms. We provide a detailed analysis of both the differential and integral versions of these monotonicity conditions for the corresponding nonseparable Hamiltonian and examine their relation. The proof of global well-posedness relies on the propagation of these monotonicity conditions in their integral forms and a priori uniform Lipschitz continuity of the solution with respect to the measure variable.</description>

      <title>Large deviations and the matrix product ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider probability measures on $A^N$, the set of sequences of symbols on a finite alphabet $A$ of length $N$, that give a weight to each sequence in terms of a collection of matrices with non-negative entries and having rows and columns labeled by a finite or countable set $B$. We prove for such kind of measures large deviations principles for several empirical measures. Our approach is based on a simultaneous combination of an enlargement of the state space to sequences on $A\times B$ and a spectral conjugation that produces a stochastic matrix, as discussed in \cite{GI1}. As a result we describe the measures as hidden Markov measures and can deduce the large deviations results by contraction from the corresponding ones for the enlarged Markov chain. The measure on the enlarged state space is a Markov bridge. The invariant measures of several non equilibrium models of interacting particle systems can be represented by the so called {\it Matrix Product Ansatz} that corresponds to measures of the type that we consider and with matrices labeled by $B$ that is typically countable infinite. The large deviations behavior is different in the cases with $B$ finite or countable. In the finite case we give a variational formula for both the algebraic and the spatial empirical measures, that can be solved in special cases. For the infinite case, we illustrate the method through an example that is the invariant measure of the boundary driven TASEP model in a special regime. We recover in this way the celebrated results in \cite{Der4,Derr7}, and in particular we obtain a variational representation of the rate function similar to that in \cite{Bryc}. Our approach is general and can in principle be applied to any measure represented by the matrix product ansatz with matrices having positive entries.</description>

      <title>On efficient estimates of the rate of convergence for Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents efficient approaches for evaluating convergence rate in total variation for finite and general linear Markov chains. The motivation for studying convergence rate in this metric is its usefulness in various limit theorems. For homogeneous Markov chains the goal is to compare several different methods: (1) the second eigenvalue for the transition matrix method (the method no. 1), (2) the method based on Markov -- Dobrushin's ergodic coefficient, and the new spectral method developed in earlier works, as well as modifications of they both by iterations (the ``other methods''). We answer the question whether or not the ``other methods'' may provide the optimal or close to optimal convergence rate in the case of homogeneous Markov chains. The answer turns out to be positive for appropriate modifications of both ``other methods''. The analogues of these ``other methods'' for the non-homogeneous Markov chains are also presented. The work is theoretical. However, the methods of computing efficient bounds of convergence rates may be in demand in various applied areas.</description>

      <title>The P\'olya Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the P\'olya Web, a system of coalescing random walks based on the classic P\'olya urn model. This construction serves as an analogue to the web of coalescing random walks studied by T\'oth and Werner (1998), replacing simple symmetric random walks with P\'olya walks as primary constituents. First, we study the general web of up-right oriented coalescing random walks. We investigate its geometric properties and prove that certain indicator random variables satisfy negative association. Notably, the proof involves a non-trivial application of the van den Berg-Kesten-Reimer (BKR) inequality. Based on this property, we derive a strong law for the number of connected components generated by walks starting at the same time. Subsequently, we focus on the specific properties of the P\'olya Web. It is well-known that the normalized coordinates of a single P\'olya Walk converge almost surely to a beta-distributed random variable. We determine the joint distribution of these limiting variables in the coalescing framework. Using these joint densities, we provide exact calculations regarding the almost sure convergence of the number of components. Finally, by applying a local scaling to the P\'olya Web at the edges, we introduce the Yule Web, a web of coalescing Yule processes. We demonstrate that the fundamental properties and results derived for the P\'olya Web can be extended to this limiting case.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Approximations of Sojourn Times in M/G/1 Queues via Stein's Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stationary sojourn time distribution in an M/G/1 queue operating under heavy traffic. It is known that the sojourn time converges to an exponential distribution in the limit. Our focus is on obtaining pre-asymptotic, higher-order approximations that go beyond the classical exponential limit. Using Stein's method, we develop an approach based on higher-order expansions of the generator of the underlying Markov process. The key technical step is to represent higher-order derivatives in terms of lower-order ones and control the resulting error via derivative bounds of the Stein equation. Under suitable moment-matching conditions on the service distribution, we show that the approximation error decays as a high-order power of the slack parameter $\varepsilon=1-\rho$. Error bounds are established in the Zolotarev metric, which further imply bounds on the Wasserstein distance as well as the moments. Our results demonstrate that the accuracy of the exponential approximation can be systematically improved by matching progressively more moments of the service distribution.</description>

      <title>New Trends in the Stability of Sinkhorn Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropic optimal transport problems play an increasingly important role in machine learning and generative modelling. In contrast with optimal transport maps which often have limited applicability in high dimensions, Schrodinger bridges can be solved using the celebrated Sinkhorn's algorithm, a.k.a. the iterative proportional fitting procedure. The stability properties of Sinkhorn bridges when the number of iterations tends to infinity is a very active research area in applied probability and machine learning. Traditional proofs of convergence are mainly based on nonlinear versions of Perron-Frobenius theory and related Hilbert projective metric techniques, gradient descent, Bregman divergence techniques and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, including propagation of convexity profiles based on coupling diffusions by reflection methods. The objective of this review article is to present, in a self-contained manner, recently developed Sinkhorn/Gibbs-type semigroup analysis based upon contraction coefficients and Lyapunov-type operator-theoretic techniques. These powerful, off-the-shelf semigroup methods are based upon transportation cost inequalities (e.g. log-Sobolev, Talagrand quadratic inequality, curvature estimates), $\phi$-divergences, Kantorovich-type criteria and Dobrushin contraction-type coefficients on weighted Banach spaces as well as Wasserstein distances. This novel semigroup analysis allows one to unify and simplify many arguments in the stability of Sinkhorn algorithm. It also yields new contraction estimates w.r.t. generalized $\phi$-entropies, as well as weighted total variation norms, Kantorovich criteria and Wasserstein distances.</description>

      <title>Stable and Fr\'echet limit theorem for subgraph functionals in the hyperbolic random geometric graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations of subgraph counts in hyperbolic random geometric graphs on the $d$-dimensional Poincar\'e ball in the heterogeneous, heavy-tailed degree regime. In a hyperbolic random geometric graph whose vertices are given by a Poisson point process on a growing hyperbolic ball, we consider two basic families of subgraphs: star shape counts and clique counts, and we analyze their global counts and maxima over the vertex set. Working in the parameter regime where a small number of vertices close to the center of the Poincar\'e ball carry very large degrees and act as hubs, we establish joint functional limit theorems for suitably normalized star shape and clique count processes together with the associated maxima processes. The limits are given by a two-dimensional dependent process whose components are a stable L\'evy process and an extremal Fr\'echet process, reflecting the fact that a small number of hubs dominates both the total number of local subgraphs and their extremes. As an application, we derive fluctuation results for the global clustering coefficient, showing that its asymptotic behavior is described by the ratio of the components of a bivariate L\'evy process with perfectly dependent stable jumps.</description>

      <title>The distribution of the ratio of products of independent zero mean normal random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X_1,\ldots,X_M$ and $Y_1,\ldots,Y_N$ be independent zero mean normal random variables with variances $\sigma_{X_i}^2$, $i=1,\ldots,M$, and $\sigma_{Y_j}^2$, $j=1,\ldots,N$, respectively, and let $X=X_1\cdots X_M$ and $Y=Y_1\cdots Y_N$. In this paper, we derive the exact probability density function of the ratio $X/Y$. We apply this formula to derive exact formulas for the cumulative distribution function and the characteristic function. We also obtain further distributional properties, including asymptotic approximations for the probability density function, tail probabilities and the quantile function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Brownian loop measure on hyperbolic surfaces for Brownian motion with a constant killing rate. We compute the mass of Brownian loops with killing in a free homotopy class and then relate the total mass of loops in all essential homotopy classes to the Selberg zeta function when the surface is geometrically finite. As an application, we provide a probabilistic interpretation of different notions of regularized determinants of Laplacian, in both the compact and infinite-area cases.</description>

Abstract: We obtain a new closed-form formula for the characteristic function of the asymmetric Student's $t$-distribution. As part of our analysis, we derive a new closed-form formula for the integral $\int_0^\infty \sin(ax)/(b^2+x^2)^n\,\mathrm{d}x$, for $a,b&gt;0$, $n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$, expressed in terms of the exponential integral function. As a consequence of our integral formula, we deduce a closed-form formula for the limit $\lim_{\nu\rightarrow n} \{I_{\nu-1/2}(x)-\mathbf{L}_{1/2-\nu}(x)\}/\sin(\pi\nu)$, for $n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$, $x&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Wasserstein regularization, defective local concentration and a cutoff criterion beyond non-negative curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Notions of positive curvature have been shown to imply many remarkable properties for Markov processes, in terms, e.g., of regularization effects, functional inequalities, mixing time bounds and, more recently, the cutoff phenomenon. In this work, we are interested in a relaxed variant of Ollivier's coarse Ricci curvature, where a Markov kernel $P$ satisfies only a weaker Wasserstein bound $W_p(\mu P, \nu P) \leq K W_p(\mu,\nu)+M$ for constants $M\ge 0, K\in [0,1], p \ge 1$. Under appropriate additional assumptions on the one-step transition measures $\delta_x P$, we establish (i) a form of local concentration, given by a defective Talagrand inequality, and (ii) an entropy-transport regularization effect. We consider as illustrative examples the Langevin dynamics and the Proximal Sampler when the target measure is a log-Lipschitz perturbation of a log-concave measure. As an application of the above results, we derive criteria for the occurrence of the cutoff phenomenon in some negatively curved settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the dimer model in cylindrical domains $\Omega_\delta$ on square grids of mesh size $\delta$ with two Temperleyan boundary components of different colors. Assuming that the $\Omega_\delta$ approximate a cylindrical domain $\Omega$ as $\delta\to 0$, we prove the convergence of height fluctuations to the Gaussian Free Field in $\Omega$ plus an independent discrete Gaussian multiple of the harmonic measure of one of the boundary components. The limit of the dimer coupling functions on $\Omega_\delta$ is holomorphic in $\Omega$ but not conformally covariant. Given this, we determine the limiting structure of height fluctuations from general principles rather than from explicit computations. In particular, our analysis justifies the inevitable appearance of the discrete Gaussian distribution in the doubly connected setup.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of invariant measures for non-Feller Markov semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study existence and uniqueness of invariant probability measures for continuous-time Markov processes on general state spaces. Existence is obtained from tightness of time averages under a weak regularity assumption inspired by quasi-Feller semigroups, allowing for discontinuous and non-Feller dynamics.
  Our main contribution concerns uniqueness. Under a natural $\psi$-irreducibility assumption, we show that the normalized resolvent kernel satisfies a domination property with respect to a reference measure. As a consequence, every invariant probability measure charges this reference measure. Since distinct ergodic invariant measures are mutually singular on standard Borel spaces, this domination property implies uniqueness whenever an invariant probability measure exists.
  The argument is purely measure-theoretic and does not rely on Harris recurrence, return-time estimates, or Foster--Lyapunov conditions, and applies in particular to jump processes and hybrid models with discontinuous dynamics.</description>

      <title>A uniformity principle for spatial matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Platforms matching spatially distributed supply to demand face a fundamental design choice: given a fixed total budget of service range, how should it be allocated across supply nodes ex ante, i.e. before supply and demand locations are realized, to maximize fulfilled demand? We model this problem using bipartite random geometric graphs where $n$ supply and $m$ demand nodes are uniformly distributed on $[0,1]^k$ ($k \ge 1$), and edges form when demand falls within a supply node's service region, the volume of which is determined by its service range. Since each supply node serves at most one demand, platform performance is determined by the expected size of a maximum matching. We establish a uniformity principle: whenever one service range allocation is more uniform than the other, the more uniform allocation yields a larger expected matching. This principle emerges from diminishing marginal returns to range expanding service range, and limited interference between supply nodes due to bounded ranges naturally fragmenting the graph. For $k=1$, we further characterize the expected matching size through a Markov chain embedding and derive closed-form expressions for special cases. Our results provide theoretical guidance for optimizing service range allocation and designing incentive structures in ride-hailing, on-demand labor markets, and drone delivery networks.</description>

      <title>Second Order Asymptotics for the Hard Wall Probability of the 2D Harmonic Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimate the probability that the discrete Gaussian free field on a planar domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions stays positive in the bulk. Improving upon the result by Bolthausen, Deuschel and Giacomin from 2001, we derive the order of the subleading term of this probability when a sequence of discretized scale-ups of given domain and compactly included smooth bulk are considered. A main ingredient in the proof is the double exponential decay of the right tail of the centered minimum of the field in the bulk, conditioned on a certain weighted average of its values to be zero.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study LU-type factorizations of the infinitesimal generator of a birth--death process on $\mathbb{N}_0$. Our goal is to characterize those factorizations whose Darboux transformations (that is, inverting the order of the factors) yield new infinitesimal generators of birth--death processes. Two types are considered: lower--upper (LU), which is unique and upper--lower (UL), which involves a free parameter. For both cases, we determine the conditions under which such factorizations can occur, derive explicit formulas for their coefficients, and provide a probabilistic interpretation of the factors. The spectral properties and associated orthogonal polynomials of the Darboux transformations are also analyzed. Finally, the general results are applied to classical examples such as the $M/M/1$ and $M/M/\infty$ queues and to different cases of linear birth--death processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce classes of supergraphs and superpermutations with novel universal graphon and permuton limiting objects whose construction involves the two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet process introduced by Pitman and Yor (1997). We demonstrate the universality of these limiting objects through general invariance principles in a heavy-tailed regime and establish a comprehensive phase diagram for the asymptotic shape of superstructures.</description>

      <title>Chaos propagation in genetic algorithms: An optimal transport approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genetic algorithms are high-level heuristic optimization methods which enjoy great popularity thanks to their intuitive description, flexibility, and, of course, effectiveness. The optimization procedure is based on the evolution of possible solutions following three mechanisms: selection, mutation, and crossover. In this paper, we look at the algorithm as an interacting particle system and show that it is described by a Boltzmann-type equation in the many particles limit. Specifically, we prove a propagation of chaos result with a novel technique that leverages the optimal transport formulation of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein norm and naturally incorporates the crossover mechanism into the analysis. The convergence rate is sharp with respect to the number of particles.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein distances between ERGMs and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are random graph models under which the presence of certain small structures (such as triangles) is encouraged; they can be constructed by tilting an Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi model by the exponential of a particular nonlinear Hamiltonian. These models are mixtures of metastable wells which each behave macroscopically like an Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi model, exhibiting the same laws of large numbers for subgraph counts [CD13]. However, on the microscopic scale these metastable wells are very different from Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi models, with the total variation distance between the two measures tending to 1 [MX23]. In this article we clarify this situation by providing a sharp (up to constants) bound on the Hamming-Wasserstein distance between the two models, which is the average number of edges at which they differ, under the coupling which minimizes this average. In particular, we show that this distance is $\Theta(n^{3/2})$, quantifying exactly how these models differ. 
  An upper bound of this form has appeared in the past [RR19], but this was restricted to the subcritical (high-temperature) regime of parameters. We extend this bound, using a new proof technique, to the supercritical (low-temperature) regime, and prove a matching lower bound which has only previously appeared in the subcritical regime of special cases of ERGMs satisfying a "triangle-free" condition [DF25]. To prove the lower bound in the presence of triangles, we introduce an approximation of the discrete derivative of the Hamiltonian, which controls the dynamical properties of the ERGM, in terms of local counts of triangles and wedges (two-stars) near an edge. This approximation is the main technical and conceptual contribution of the article, and we expect it will be useful in a variety of other contexts as well. Along the way, we also prove a bound on the marginal edge probability under the ERGM via a new bootstrapping argument. Such a bound has already appeared [FLSW25], but again only in the subcritical regime and using a different proof strategy.</description>

      <title>Detecting Mutual Excitations in Non-Stationary Hawkes Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the network of mutual excitations (i.e., the dependency graph) in a non-stationary, multivariate Hawkes process. We consider a general setting where baseline rates at each node are time-varying and delay kernels are not shift-invariant. Our main results show that if the dependency graph of an $n$-variate Hawkes process is sparse (i.e., it has a maximum degree that is bounded with respect to $n$), our algorithm accurately reconstructs it from data after observing the Hawkes process for $T = \mathrm{polylog}(n)$ time, with high probability. Our algorithm is computationally efficient, and provably succeeds in learning dependencies even if only a subset of time series are observed and event times are not precisely known.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework to construct Gibbs measures for the Dirac equation. We consider the Dirac equation on the sphere with a "Hartree-type" nonlinearity. We consider a zonal model, that is the analog of a spherically symmetric model but on the sphere. We build a Gibbs measure for this model. With a compactness argument, we prove the existence of a random variable that is a weak solution to the Dirac equation and whose law is the Gibbs measure at all times.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a Random Local Search Algorithm for Dominating Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dominating Set is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem which finds application in computational biology or mobile communication. Because of its $\mathrm{NP}$-hardness, one often turns to heuristics for good solutions. Many such heuristics have been empirically tested and perform rather well. However, it is not well understood why their results are so good or even what guarantees they can offer regarding their runtime or the quality of their results. For this, a strong theoretical foundation has to be established. We contribute to this by rigorously analyzing a Random Local Search (RLS) algorithm that aims to find a minimum dominating set on a graph. We consider its performance on cycle graphs with $n$ vertices. We prove an upper bound for the expected runtime until an optimum is found of $\mathcal{O}\left(n^4\log^2(n)\right)$. In doing so, we introduce several models to represent dominating sets on cycles that help us understand how RLS explores the search space to find an optimum. For our proof we use techniques which are already quite popular for the analysis of randomized algorithms. We further apply a special method to analyze a reversible Markov Chain, which arises as a result of our modeling. This method has not yet found wide application in this kind of runtime analysis.</description>

      <title>Self-avoiding walk, connective constant, cubic graph, Fisher transformation, quasi-transitive graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study self-avoiding walks (SAWs) on infinite quasi-transitive cubic graphs under \emph{local transformations} that replace each degree-$3$ vertex by a finite, symmetric three-port gadget. To each gadget we associate a two-port SAW generating function $g(x)$, defined by counting SAWs that enter and exit the gadget through prescribed ports. Our first main result shows that, if $G$ is cubic and $G_1=\phi(G)$ is obtained by applying the local transformation at every vertex, then the connective constants $\mu(G)$ and $\mu(G_1)$ satisfy the functional relation \[ \mu(G)^{-1}=g\bigl(\mu(G_1)^{-1}\bigr). \] We next consider critical exponents defined via susceptibility-type series that do not rely on an ambient Euclidean dimension, and prove that the exponents $\gamma$ and $\eta$ are invariant under local transformations; moreover $\nu$ is invariant under a standard regularity hypothesis on SAW counts (a common slowly varying function).
  Our second set of results concerns bipartite graphs, where the local transformation is applied to one colour class (or to both classes, possibly with different gadgets). In this setting we obtain an analogous relation \[ \mu(G)^{-2}=h\bigl(\mu(G_{\mathrm e})^{-1}\bigr), \] with $h(x)=xg(x)$ when only one class is transformed and $h(x)=g_{\phi_1}(x)\,g_{\phi_2}(x)$ when both are transformed. We further present explicit families of examples, including replacing each degree-3 vertex by a complete-graph gadget $K_N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let Y be a random variable whose moment-generating function exists in some neighborhood of the origin. While probabilistic Stirling numbers of the first and second kind have been introduced, early definitions often failed to satisfy fundamental orthogonality and inverse relations or lacked consistency with classical forms in the case when Y = 1. This paper addresses these limitations by utilizing redefined probabilistic Stirling numbers of the first kind and the second kind alongside their degenerate counterparts. Our primary objective is twofold: first,to introduce the probabilistic (degenerate) logarithm associated with Y, providing explicit
  expressions for various random variables and defining new probabilistic degenerate Daehee and Cauchy numbers; and second, to investigate probabilistic heterogeneous Stirling numbers and establish a probabilistic degenerate version of the Schlomilch formula, demonstrating that these new frameworks maintain the essential algebraic properties of their classical counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a data-driven algorithm for automatically selecting the regularisation parameter in Bayesian inversion under random tree Besov priors. One of the key challenges in Bayesian inversion is the construction of priors that are both expressive and computationally feasible. Random tree Besov priors, introduced in Kekkonen et al. (2023), provide a flexible framework for capturing local regularity properties and sparsity patterns in a wavelet basis. In this paper, we extend this approach by introducing a hierarchical model that enables data-driven selection of the wavelet density parameter, allowing the regularisation strength to adapt across scales while retaining computational efficiency. We focus on nonparametric regression and also present preliminary plug-and-play results for a deconvolution problem.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a Benamou--Brenier type transportation metric for nonnegative measures on a finite reversible Markov chain, which endows the space of measures with a Riemannian structure. Using this geometric framework, we identify a generalized heat equation with source as the gradient flow of the discrete entropy. Moreover, by means of a local \L{}ojasiewicz inequality, we prove exponential convergence of the flow to a unique equilibrium. Our results clarify the role of the Benamou--Brenier formulation in discrete optimal transport for nonnegative measures and provide a coherent geometric interpretation of generalized diffusion equations with source terms.</description>

We discuss the concept of Blackwell optimality and comment on intricacies which arise when the risk-neutral expectation is replaced by the risk-sensitive entropy. Also, we show the relation between the Blackwell optimality and ultimate stationarity and provide an illustrative example that helps to better understand the structural difference between these two concepts.</description>

      <title>A Lower Bound on the Expected Number of Distinct Patterns in a Random Permutation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\pi_n$ be a uniformly chosen random permutation on $[n]$. The authors of [2] showed that the expected number of distinct consecutive patterns of all lengths $k\in\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ in $\pi_n$ was $\frac{n^2}{2}(1-o(1))$ as $n\to\infty$, exhibiting the fact that random permutations pack consecutive patterns near-perfectly. A conjecture was made in [11] that the same is true for non-consecutive patterns, i.e., that there are $2^n(1-o(1))$ distinct non-consecutive patterns expected in a random permutation. This conjecture is false, but, in this paper, we prove that a random permutation contains an expected number of at least $2^{n-1}(1+o(1))$ distinct permutations; this number is half of the range of the number of distinct permutations.</description>

Abstract: We consider non-linear regression models corrupted by generic noise when the regression functions form a non-linear subspace of L^2, relevant in non-linear PDE inverse problems and data assimilation. We show that when the score of the model is injective, the Fisher information operator is automatically invertible between well-identified Hilbert spaces, and we provide an operational characterization of these spaces. This allows us to construct in broad generality the efficient Gaussian involved in the classical minimax and convolution theorems to establish information lower bounds, that are typically achieved by Bayesian algorithms thus showing optimality of these methods. We illustrate our results on time-evolution PDE models for reaction-diffusion and Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Renewal theory for Brownian motion across a stochastically gated interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastically gated interfaces play an important role in a variety of cellular diffusion processes. Examples include intracellular transport via stochastically gated ion channels and pores in the plasma membrane of a cell, intercellular transport between cells coupled by stochastically gated gap junctions, and oxygen transport in insect respiration. Most studies of stochastically-gated interfaces are based on macroscopic models that track the particle concentration averaged with respect to different realisations of the gate dynamics. In this paper we use renewal theory to develop a probabilistic model of single-particle Brownian motion (BM) through a stochastically gated interface. We proceed by constructing a renewal equation for 1D BM with an interface at the origin, which effectively sews together a sequence of BMs on the half-line with a totally absorbing boundary at $x=0$. Each time the particle is absorbed, the stochastic process is immediately restarted according to the following rule: if the gate is closed then BM restarts on the same side of the interface, whereas if the gate is open then BM restarts on either side of the interface with equal probability. In order to ensure that diffusion restarts in a state that avoids immediate re-absorption. we assume that whenever the particle reaches the interface it is instantaneously shifted a distance $\epsilon$ from the origin. We explicitly solve the renewal equation for $\epsilon&gt;0$ and show how the solution of a corresponding forward Kolmogorov equation is recovered in the limit $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$. However, the renewal equation provides a more general mathematical framework by explicitly separating the first passage time problem of detecting the gated interface (absorption) and the subsequent rule for restarting BM. We conclude by extending the theory to higher-dimensional interfaces.</description>

      <title>LQ Mean Field Games with Common Noise in Hilbert Spaces: Small and Arbitrary Finite Time Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the results of (Liu and Firoozi, 2025), which develops the theory of linear-quadratic (LQ) mean field games in Hilbert spaces, by incorporating a common noise. This common noise is an infinite-dimensional Wiener process affecting the dynamics of all agents. In the presence of common noise, the mean-field consistency condition is characterized by a system of coupled forward-backward stochastic evolution equations (FBSEEs) in Hilbert spaces, whereas in its absence, it is represented by forward-backward deterministic evolution equations. We establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the coupled linear FBSEEs associated with the LQ MFG setting for small time horizons and prove the $\epsilon$-Nash property of the resulting equilibrium strategy. Furthermore, for the first time in the literature, we develop an analysis that establishes the well-posedness of these coupled linear FBSEEs in Hilbert spaces, for which only mild solutions exist, over arbitrary finite time horizons.</description>

      <title>Additive-Functional Approach to Transport in Periodic and Tilted Periodic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified theoretical framework for effective transport in periodic and tilted periodic potentials based on additive functionals of stochastic processes. By systematically combining the Poisson equation, corrector construction, and martingale decomposition, we show that both the long-time drift and diffusion of overdamped Brownian motion can be derived within a single and transparent scheme. In the absence of external tilt, the formalism naturally recovers the classical Lifson-Jackson formula for the effective diffusion coefficient. When a constant bias is applied, breaking detailed balance and inducing a finite stationary current, the same approach yields the Stratonovich expressions for the effective drift and diffusion in tilted periodic potentials. Beyond one dimension, we demonstrate that the same additive-functional structure extends directly to two-dimensional and general N dimensional periodic diffusions, leading to the standard homogenized drift and diffusion tensor expressed in terms of vector-valued correctors. Our derivation highlights the central role of additive functionals in separating bounded microscopic corrections from unbounded macroscopic transport and clarifies the connection between reversible and nonequilibrium steady states. This work provides a conceptually unified and mathematically controlled route to transport coefficients in periodic media, with direct relevance to stochastic transport, soft matter, and nonequilibrium statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Control policies for a two-stage queueing system with parallel and single server options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a two-stage tandem service queue attended by two servers. Each job-server pair must complete both service phases together, with the server unable to begin a new job until the current one is fully processed after two stages. Immediately after the first phase of service, the server decides whether to send the job/customer to a downstream station that allows parallel processing or to a single-service facility that offers faster or higher-quality service but handles only one job at a time. This choice determines whether the second phase commences immediately or (potentially) after waiting in a queue for the single-service facility to become available.
  The decision-making scenario is modeled via a Markov decision process formulation, of a clearing system with holding costs at each station. We fully characterize the structural properties of an optimal control policy based on the relationship between the service rates at the downstream stations. A numerical study highlights the significance of optimal control by comparing its performance against several natural heuristic policies.</description>

      <title>Balancing Independent and Collaborative Service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a two-type server queueing system where flexible Type-I servers, upon their initial interaction with jobs, decide in real time whether to process them independently or in collaboration with dedicated Type-II servers. Independent processing begins immediately, as does collaborative service if a Type-II server is available. Otherwise, the job and its paired Type-I server wait in queue for collaboration. Type-I servers are non-preemptive and cannot engage with new jobs until their current job is completed.
  We provide a complete characterization of the structural properties of the optimal policy for the clearing system. In particular, an optimal control is shown to follow a threshold structure based on the number of jobs in the queue before a Type-I first interaction and on the number of jobs in either independent or collaborative service.
  We propose simple threshold heuristics, based on linear approximations, for real-time decision-making. In much of the parameter and state spaces, we establish theoretical bounds that compare the thresholds proposed by our heuristics to those of optimal policies and identify parameter configurations where these bounds are attained. Outside of these regions, the optimal thresholds are infinite. Numerical experiments further demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our heuristics, particularly when the initial queue length is high. Our proposed heuristics achieve costs within 0.5% of the optimal policy on average and significantly outperform benchmark policies that exhibit extreme sensitivity to system parameters, sometimes incurring costs exceeding 100% of the optimal.</description>

      <title>The spectral measures of random Jacobi matrices related to beta ensembles at high temperature and Dirichlet processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a high temperature regime where $\beta N \to 2c$, the empirical distribution of the eigenvalues of Gaussian beta ensembles, beta Laguerre ensembles and beta Jacobi ensembles converges to a limiting measure which is related to associated Hermite polynomials, associated Laguerre polynomials and associated Jacobi polynomials, respectively. Here $\beta$ is the inverse temperature parameter, $N$ is the system size and $c&gt;0$ is a given constant. This paper studies the spectral measure of the random tridiagonal matrix model of the three classical beta ensembles. We show that in the high temperature regime, the spectral measure converges in distribution to a Dirichlet process with base distribution being the limiting distribution, and scaling parameter $c$. Consequently, the spectral measure of a related semi-infinite Jacobi matrix coincides with that Dirichlet process, which provides examples of random Jacobi matrices with explicit spectral measures.</description>

      <title>Zero-free regions and concentration inequalities for hypergraph colorings in the local lemma regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for $q$-colorings in $k$-uniform hypergraphs with maximum degree $\Delta$, if $k\ge 50$ and $q\ge 700\Delta^{\frac{5}{k-10}}$, there is a "Lee-Yang" zero-free strip around the interval $[0,1]$ of the partition function, which includes the special case of uniform enumeration of hypergraph colorings. As an immediate consequence, we obtain Berry-Esseen type inequalities for hypergraph $q$-colorings under such conditions, demonstrating the asymptotic normality for the size of any color class in a uniformly random coloring. Our framework also extends to the study of "Fisher zeros", leading to deterministic algorithms for approximating the partition function in the zero-free region.
  Our approach is based on extending the recent work of [Liu, Wang, Yin, Yu, STOC 2025] to general constraint satisfaction problems (CSP). We focus on partition functions defined for CSPs by introducing external fields to the variables. A key component in our approach is a projection-lifting scheme, which enables us to essentially lift information percolation type analysis for Markov chains from the real line to the complex plane. Last but not least, we also show a Chebyshev-type inequality under the sampling LLL condition for atomic CSPs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1604.00056v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Concentration inequalities, which have proved very useful in a variety of fields, provide fairly tight bounds on large deviation probabilities while central limit theorem (CLT) describes the asymptotic distribution around the mean (at the $\sqrt{n}$ scale). Harris (1963) conjectured that for a supercritical branching random walk (BRW) of i.i.d offspring and i.i.d displacements, positions of individuals in $nth$ generation approach to Gaussian distribution -- central limit theorem. This conjecture was later proved by Stam (1966) and Kaplan \&amp; Asmussen (1976). Refinements and extensions followed. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no corresponding existing work on concentration inequalities for BRWs. In this note, we propose a new definition of BRW, providing a more general framework. Owing to this definition, a Chernoff-type (subgaussian) bound for BRWs follows directly from the Chernoff bound for random walk. The relation between RW (random walk) and BRW is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07064v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The focus of this article is studying an optimal control problem for branching diffusion processes. Initially, we introduce the problem in its strong formulation and expand it to include linearly growing drifts. Then, we present a relaxed formulation that provides a suitable characterization based on martingale measures. Considering weak controls, we prove they are equivalent to strong controls in the relaxed setting, and establish the equivalence between the strong and relaxed problem, under a Filippov--type convexity condition. Furthermore, by defining control rules, we can restate the problem as the minimization of a lower semi-continuous function over a compact set, leading to the existence of optimal controls both for the relaxed problem and the strong one. Finally, with a useful embedding technique, we show that the value function solves a system of HJB equations, establishing a verification theorem. We then apply it to a linear-quadratic example and a kinetic one.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of the number of rarely visited edges (i.e., edges that visited only once) of a simple symmetric random walk on $\mathbb{Z}$. Let $\alpha(n)$ be the number of rarely visited edges up to time $n$. First, we evaluate $\mathbb{E}(\alpha(n))$, show that $n\to \mathbb{E}(\alpha(n))$ is non-decreasing in $n$ and that $\lim\limits_{n\to+\infty}\mathbb{E}(\alpha(n))=2$. Then we study the asymptotic behavior of $\mathbb{P} (\alpha(n)&gt;a(\log n)^2)$ for any $a&gt;0$ and use it to show that there exists a constant $C\in(1/32,1/2]$ such that $\limsup\limits_{n\to+\infty}\frac{\alpha(n)}{(\log n)^2}=C$ almost surely.</description>

Abstract: We examine optimal matchings or transport between two stationary random measures. It covers allocation from the Lebesgue measure to a point process and matching a point process to a regular (shifted) lattice. The main focus of the article is the impact of hyperuniformity(reduced variance fluctuations in point processes) to optimal transport: in dimension 2, we show that the typical matching cost has finite second moment under a mild logarithmic integrability condition on the reduced pair correlation measure, showing that most planar hyperuniform point processes are L2-perturbed lattices. Our method also retrieves known sharp bounds in finite windows for neutral integrable systems such as Poisson processes, and also applies to hyperfluctuating systems. Further, in three dimensions onwards, all point processes with an integrable pair correlation measure are L2-perturbed lattices without requiring hyperuniformity.</description>

      <title>Long-time behaviour of a multidimensional age-dependent branching process with a singular jump kernel modelling telomere shortening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the ergodic behaviour of a multidimensional age-dependent branching process with a singular jump kernel, motivated by studying the phenomenon of telomere shortening in cell populations. Our model tracks individuals evolving within a continuous-time framework indexed by a binary tree, characterised by age and a multidimensional trait. Branching events occur with rates dependent on age, where offspring inherit traits from their parent with random increase or decrease in some coordinates, while the most of them are left unchanged. Exponential ergodicity is obtained at the cost of an exponential normalisation, despite the fact that we have an unbounded age-dependent birth rate that may depend on the multidimensional trait, and a non-compact transition kernel. These two difficulties are respectively treated by stochastically comparing our model to Bellman-Harris processes, and by using a weak form of a Harnack inequality. We conclude this study by giving examples where the assumptions of our main result are verified.</description>

      <title>Entropy contraction of the Gibbs sampler under log-concavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gibbs sampler (a.k.a. Glauber dynamics and heat-bath algorithm) is a popular Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm which iteratively samples from the conditional distributions of a probability measure $\pi$ of interest. Under the assumption that $\pi$ is strongly log-concave, we show that the random scan Gibbs sampler contracts in relative entropy and provide a sharp characterization of the associated contraction rate. Assuming that evaluating conditionals is cheap compared to evaluating the joint density, our results imply that the number of full evaluations of $\pi$ needed for the Gibbs sampler to mix grows linearly with the condition number and is independent of the dimension. If $\pi$ is non-strongly log-concave, the convergence rate in entropy degrades from exponential to polynomial. Our techniques are versatile and extend to Metropolis-within-Gibbs schemes and the Hit-and-Run algorithm. A comparison with gradient-based schemes and the connection with the optimization literature are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: We study standard processes with no negative jumps under the entrance boundary condition. Similarly to one-dimensional diffusions, we show that the process can be made into a Feller process by attaching the boundary point to the state space. We investigate the spectrum of the infinitesimal generator in detail via the scale function, characterizing it as the zeros of an entire function. As an application, we prove that under the strong Feller property, the convergence to the Yaglom limit of the process killed on hitting the boundary is exponentially fast.</description>

      <title>Information-Based Martingale Optimal Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomised arcade processes are a class of continuous stochastic processes that interpolate in a strong sense, i.e., omega by omega, between any given ordered set of random variables, at fixed pre-specified times. Utilising these processes as generators of partial information, a class of continuous-time martingale -- the filtered arcade martingales (FAMs) -- are constructed. FAMs interpolate through a sequence of target random variables, which form a discrete-time martingale. The research presented in this paper relaxes the FAM setting to the interpolation between probability measures instead and treats the problem of selecting the worst martingale coupling for given, convexly ordered, probability measures contingent on the paths of FAMs that are constructed using the martingale coupling. This optimisation problem, that we term the information-based martingale optimal transport problem (IB-MOT), can be viewed from different perspectives. It can be understood as a model-free construction of FAMs, in the case where the coupling is not determined a priori. It can also be considered from the vantage point of optimal transport (OT), where the problem is concerned with introducing a noise factor in martingale optimal transport, similarly to how the entropic regularisation of optimal transport introduces noise in OT. The IB-MOT problem is static in its nature, since its aim is to find a coupling. However, a corresponding dynamical solution can be found by considering the FAM constructed with the identified optimal coupling. The existence and uniqueness of its solution are shown and an algorithm for empirical measures is proposed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a family of Crump--Mode--Jagers branching processes in random environment that explode, i.e. that grow infinitely large in finite time with positive probability. Building on recent work of the author and Iyer (``On the structure of genealogical trees associated with explosive Crump--Mode--Jagers branching processes", arXiv:2311.14664, 2023), we weaken certain assumptions required to prove that the branching process, at the time of explosion, contains a (unique) individual with infinite offspring. We then apply these results to super-linear preferential attachment models. In particular, we fill gaps in some of the cases analysed in Appendix A of the work of the author and Iyer and study a large range of previously unattainable cases.</description>

      <title>A Tail-Respecting Explicit Numerical Scheme for L\'evy-Driven SDEs With Superlinear Drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an explicit numerical approximation scheme, denoted by $\{X^n\}$, for the effective simulation of solutions $X$ to a multivariate stochastic differential equation (SDE) with a superlinearly growing $\kappa$-dissipative drift, where $\kappa&gt;1$, driven by a multiplicative heavy-tailed L\'evy process that has a finite $p$-th moment, with $p&gt;0$. We show that the strong $L^q$-convergence $\sup_{t\in[0,T]}\mathbf E \|X^n_t-X_t\|^q=\mathcal O (h_n^{\gamma})$ holds true for any $q\in (0,p+\kappa-1)$, which is exactly the range where the $q$-moment of the solution is known to be finite. Additionally, for any $q\in (0,p)$ we establish strong uniform convergence: $\mathbf E\sup_{t\in[0,T]} \|X^n_t-X_t\|^q=\mathcal{O} ( h_n^{\delta} )$. In both cases we determine the convergence rates $\gamma$ and $\delta$. In the special case of SDEs driven solely by a Brownian motion, our numerical scheme preserves super-exponential moments of the solution. The scheme $\{X^n\}$ is realized as a combination of a well-known Euler method with a Lie-Trotter type splitting technique.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous blowup for interacting SDEs with superlinear drift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a system of interacting SDEs on the integer lattice with multiplicative noise and a drift satisfying the finite Osgood's condition. We show instantaneous everywhere blowup for initial profiles decaying slower than $\exp \left( -\sqrt{\big|\log |x|\big|}\right)$. We employ the splitting-up method to compare the interacting system to a one-dimensional SDE which blows up.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we define the squared G-Bessel process as the square of the modulus of a class of G-Brownian motions and establish that it is the unique solution to a stochastic differential equation. We then derive several path properties of the squared G-Bessel process, which are more profound in the capacity sense. Furthermore, we provide upper and lower bounds for the Laplace transform of the squared G-Bessel process. Finally, we prove that the time-space transformed squared G-Bessel process is a G'-CIR process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We survey different perspectives on the stochastic localization process of Eldan, a powerful construction that has had many exciting recent applications in high-dimensional probability and algorithm design. Unlike prior surveys on this topic, our focus is on giving a self-contained presentation of all known alternative constructions of Eldan's stochastic localization, with an emphasis on connections between different constructions. Our hope is that by collecting these perspectives, some of which had primarily arisen within a particular community (e.g., probability theory, theoretical computer science, information theory, or machine learning), we can broaden the accessibility of stochastic localization, and ease its future use.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of self-repelling diffusions on compact Riemannian manifolds whose drift is the gradient of a potential accumulated along their trajectory. When the interaction potential admits a suitable spectral decomposition, the dynamics and its environment are equivalent to a finite-dimensional degenerate diffusion. We show that this diffusion is a second-order lift of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process whose invariant law corresponds to the Gaussian invariant measure of the environment, and immediately obtain a general upper bound on the rate of convergence to stationarity using the framework of second-order lifts. Furthermore, using a flow Poincar\'e inequality, we develop lower bounds on the convergence rate. We show that, in the periodic case, these lower bounds improve upon those of Bena\"im and Gauthier (Probab. Theory Relat. Fields, 2016), and even match the order of the upper bound in some cases.</description>

      <title>Small time asymptotics of spectral heat content of isotropic processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectral heat content of a domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ corresponding to a $d$-dimensional stochastic process $X=(X_t)_{t\ge 0}$ is defined as \[Q^{X}_\Omega(t)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^d} \mathbb{P}_x(\tau^X_\Omega&gt;t)dx,\] where $\tau^X_\Omega$ is the first exit time of $X$ from $\Omega$. We provide a novel technique for proving small time asymptotic of spectral heat content for any translation invariant isotropic process satisfying negligible tail probability condition. As a consequence, we recover several existing results in the context of L\'evy processes and Gaussian processes, and provide spectral heat content asymptotics for a class of $\alpha$-stable L\'evy processes time-changed by right inverse of positive, increasing, self-similar Markov processes. The latter has connection to some Cauchy problems that are non-local in both time and space.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for the number of domino tilings of L-shaped Aztec domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain precise asymptotics for the weighted number of domino tilings of an L-shaped subset of the Aztec diamond, obtained by removing an approximate rectangle in a corner of the Aztec diamond. By tuning the size of the removed corner, we observe different types of asymptotics. For a small removed corner, the number of tilings is close to that of the full Aztec diamond. Enlarging the removed corner to a critical size, a phase transition described in terms of the Tracy-Widom distribution occurs. Further increasing the size of the removed region, we observe a sharp decrease of the number of tilings, until it is finally approximated by the number of tilings of two smaller disjoint Aztec diamonds. We obtain uniform asymptotics for the number of domino tilings which fully describe these transitions.</description>

      <title>Local Asymptotic Normality for Mixed Fractional Brownian Motion Under High-Frequency Observation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we will consider the LAN property for both the Hurst parameter $H&gt;3/4$ and the variance of the fractional Brownian motion plus an independent standard Brownian motion (called mixed fractional Brownian motion) with high-frequency observation. We will first remove the $H$-score linear term and orthogonalize the remainder through two non-diagonal transformations, then we can construct the CLT for the quadratic form base on $\| \cdot \|_{\mathrm{op}}/\|\cdot\|_F\to0$. At last we obtain a diagonal Gaussian LAN expansion with an explicit information matrix. Beyond the case of $H&gt;3/4$, we also present that the $\| \cdot \|_{\mathrm{op}}/\|\cdot\|_F\to0$ method is also useful for the case of $H&lt;3/4$ and the proof will be concise compared with the Whittle translation method. We consider that this method can be applied to this type of problem, including the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model and mixed fractional O-U process.</description>

      <title>Coupling Brownian loop soups and random walk loop soups at all polynomial scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lawler and Trujillo Ferreras constructed a well-known coupling between the Brownian loop soups in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and the random walk loop soups on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ (one rescales the random walk loops by $1/N$, their time parametrizations by $1/(2N^2)$, and let $N\to \infty$), which led to numerous applications. It nevertheless only holds for loops with time length at least $N^{\theta-2}$ for $\theta \in(2/3,2)$. In particular, there is no control on mesoscopic loops with time length less than $N^{-4/3}$ (i.e. roughly diameter less than $N^{-2/3}$). This coupling was subsequently extended by Sapozhnikov and Shiraishi to $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with $d\ge 3$, for loops with time length at least $N^{\theta-2}$, for $\theta \in(2d/(d+4),2)$.
  In this paper, we find a simple way to remove the restriction $\theta&gt;2d/(d+4)$, so that such a coupling works for all $\theta\in (0,2)$, i.e. for loops at all polynomial scales. We establish couplings for both discrete-time and continuous-time random walk loop soups on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, for $d\ge 1$.</description>

      <title>Ergodic Theorems and Equivalence of Green's Kernel for Random Walks in Random Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Ergodic Properties of Random Walks in stationary ergodic environments without uniform ellipticity under a minimal assumption. There are two main components in our work. The first step is to adopt the arguments of Lawler to first prove a uniqueness principle. We use a more general definition of environments using~\textit{Environment Functions}. As a corollary, we can deduce an invariance principle under these assumptions for balanced environments under some assumptions. We also use the uniqueness principle to show that any balanced, elliptic random walk must have the same transience behaviour as the simple symmetric random walk. The second is to transfer the results we deduce in balanced environments to general ergodic environments(under some assumptions) using a control technique to derive a measure under which the \textit{local process} is stationary and ergodic. As a consequence of our results, we deduce the Law of Large Numbers for the Random Walk and an Invariance Principle under our assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.15894v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate two-player zero-sum stochastic differential games with an ergodic payoff, in which the diffusion coefficient does not need to be non-degenerate. We first establish the existence of a viscosity solution to the associated ergodic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs equation under a dissipativity condition. With the help of this viscosity solution, we then derive estimates for the upper and the lower ergodic value functions by constructing a series of non-degenerate approximating processes combined with the sup- and inf-convolution techniques. Finally, we prove the existence of a value for the game under the Isaacs condition and provide its representation formulae. As an application, we study the pollution accumulation problem with a long-run average social welfare to illustrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.12788v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model is fundamental to the study of synchronization. It consists of a collection of oscillators with interactions given by a network, which we identify respectively with vertices and edges of a graph. In this paper, we show that a graph with sufficient expansion must be globally synchronizing, meaning that a homogeneous Kuramoto model of identical oscillators on such a graph will converge to the fully synchronized state with all the oscillators having the same phase, for every initial state up to a set of measure zero. In particular, we show that for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and $p \geq (1 + \varepsilon) (\log n) / n$, the homogeneous Kuramoto model on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n, p)$ is globally synchronizing with probability tending to one as $n$ goes to infinity. This improves on a previous result of Kassabov, Strogatz, and Townsend and solves a conjecture of Ling, Xu, and Bandeira. We also show that the model is globally synchronizing on any $d$-regular Ramanujan graph, and on typical $d$-regular graphs, for large enough degree $d$.</description>

Abstract: We establish a theory for multivariate extreme value analysis of dynamical systems. Namely, we provide conditions adapted to the dynamical setting which enable the study of dependence between extreme values of the components of $\R^d$-valued observables evaluated along the orbits of the systems. We study this cross-sectional dependence, which results from the combination of a spatial and a temporal dependence structures. We give several illustrative applications, where concrete systems and dependence sources are introduced and analysed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03870v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a nonlocal approximation of the Fokker-Planck equation in which we can estimate the speed of convergence to equilibrium in a way which does not degenerate as we approach the local limit of the equation. This uniform estimate cannot be easily obtained with standard inequalities or entropy methods, but can be obtained through the use of Harris's theorem, finding interesting links to quantitative versions of the central limit theorem in probability. As a consequence one can prove that solutions of this nonlocal approximation converge to solutions of the usual Fokker-Planck equation uniformly in time-hence we show the approximation is asymptotic-preserving in this sense. The associated equilibrium has some interesting tail and regularity properties, which we also study.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Online Smoother with Closed-Form Solutions and Information-Theoretic Lag Selection for Conditional Gaussian Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) combines partial observations with dynamical models to improve state estimation. Filter-based DA uses only past and present data and is the prerequisite for real-time forecasts. Smoother-based DA exploits both past and future observations. It aims to fill in missing data, provide more accurate estimations, and develop high-quality datasets. However, the standard smoothing procedure requires using all historical state estimations, which is storage-demanding, especially for high-dimensional systems. This paper develops an adaptive-lag online smoother for a large class of complex dynamical systems with strong nonlinear and non-Gaussian features, which has important applications to many real-world problems. The adaptive lag allows the utilization of observations only within a nearby window, thus reducing computational complexity and storage needs. Online lag adjustment is essential for tackling turbulent systems, where temporal autocorrelation varies significantly over time due to intermittency, extreme events, and nonlinearity. Based on the uncertainty reduction in the estimated state, an information criterion is developed to systematically determine the adaptive lag. Notably, the mathematical structure of these systems facilitates the use of closed analytic formulae to calculate the online smoother and adaptive lag, avoiding empirical tunings as in ensemble-based DA methods. The adaptive online smoother is applied to studying three important scientific problems. First, it helps detect online causal relationships between state variables. Second, the advantage of reduced computational storage expenditure is illustrated via Lagrangian DA, a high-dimensional nonlinear problem. Finally, the adaptive smoother advances online parameter estimation with partial observations, emphasizing the role of the observed extreme events in accelerating convergence.</description>

      <title>Rare events statistics for $\mathbb Z^d$ map lattices coupled by collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the statistics of collisions among locally confined gas particles poses a major challenge. In this work we investigate $\mathbb Z^d$-map lattices coupled by collision with simplified local dynamics that offer significant insights for the above challenging problem. We obtain a first order approximation for the first collision rate at a site $\textbf{p}^*\in \mathbb Z^d$ and we prove a distributional convergence for the first collision time to an exponential, with sharp error term. Moreover, we prove that the number of collisions at site $\textbf{p}^*$ converge in distribution to a compound Poisson distributed random variable. Key to our analysis in this infinite dimensional setting is the use of transfer operators associated with the decoupled map lattice at site $\textbf{p}^*$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider heavy-tailed observables maximised on a dynamically defined Cantor set and prove convergence of the associated point processes as well as functional limit theorems. The Cantor structure, and its connection to the dynamics, causes clustering of large observations: this is captured in the `decorations' on our point processes and functional limits, an application of the theory developed in a paper by the latter three authors.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Average Impulse Control with Mean Field Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes and explicitly solves a class of long-term average impulse control problems with a specific mean-field interaction. The underlying process is a general one-dimensional diffusion with appropriate boundary behavior. The model is motivated by applications such as the optimal long-term management of renewable resources and financial portfolio management. Each individual agent seeks to maximize her long-term average reward, which consists of a running reward and income from discrete impulses, where the unit intervention price depends on the market through a stationary supply rate, the specific mean field variable to be considered. In a competitive market setting, we establish the existence of and explicitly characterize an equilibrium strategy within a large class of policies under mild conditions. Additionally, we formulate and solve the mean field control problem, in which agents cooperate with each other, aiming to realize a common maximal long-term average profit. To illustrate the theoretical results, we examine a stochastic logistic growth model and a population growth model in a stochastic environment with impulse control.</description>

      <title>Statistical properties of non-linear observables of fractal Gaussian fields with a focus on spatial-averaging observables and on composite operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The statistical properties of non-linear observables of the fractal Gaussian field $\phi(\vec x)$ of negative Hurst exponent $H&lt;0$ in dimension $d$ are revisited with a focus on spatial-averaging observables and on the properties of the finite parts $\phi_n(\vec x)$ of the ill-defined composite operators $\phi^n(\vec x) $. For the special case $n=2$ of quadratic observables, explicit results include the cumulants of arbitrary order, the L\'evy-Khintchine formula for the characteristic function and the anomalous large deviations properties. The case of observables of arbitrary order $n&gt;2$ is analyzed via the Wiener-Ito chaos-expansion for functionals of the white noise: the multiple stochastic Ito integrals are useful to identify the finite parts $\phi_n(\vec x)$ of the ill-defined composite operators $\phi^n(\vec x) $ and to compute their correlations involving the Hurst exponents $H_n=nH$.</description>

      <title>Computable Bounds for Strong Approximations with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Koml\'os$\unicode{x2013}$Major$\unicode{x2013}$Tusn\'ady (KMT) inequality for partial sums is one of the most celebrated results in probability theory. Yet its practical application has been hindered by a lack of practical constants. This paper addresses this limitation for bounded i.i.d. random variables. At the cost of an additional logarithmic factor, we propose a computable version of the KMT inequality that depends only on the variables' range and standard deviation. We also derive an empirical version of the inequality that achieves nominal coverage even when the standard deviation is unknown. We then demonstrate the practicality of our bounds through applications to online change point detection and first hitting time probabilities. As a byproduct of our analysis, we obtain a Cram\'er-type moderate deviation bound for normalized centered partial sums.</description>

      <title>Rearrangements of distributions on integers that minimize variance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Which permutations of a probability distribution on integers minimize variance?
  Let $X$ be a random variable on a set of integers $\{x_1, \dots, x_N\}$ such that $\mathbb{P}(X_i = x_i) = p_i$, $i \in \{1,\dots,N\}$. Let $(p^{(1)}, \dots, p^{(N)})$ be the sequence $(p_1, \dots, p_N)$ ordered non-increasingly. Let $X^+$ be the random variable defined by $\mathbb{P}(X^+=0)=p^{(1)}$, $\mathbb{P}(X^+=1) = p^{(2)}$, $\mathbb{P}(X^+=-1)=p^{(3)}, \dots, \mathbb{P}(X^+=(-1)^N \lfloor \frac {N} 2 \rfloor)=p^{(N)}$. In this short note we generalize and prove the inequality $\mathrm{Var}\, X^+ \le \mathrm{Var}\, X$.</description>

      <title>The time fractional stochastic partial differential equations with non-local operator on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive well-posedness and regularity theory for time-fractional stochastic partial differential equations on $\mathbb{R}^d$ driven by mixed Wiener--L\'evy noises. The equations feature a Caputo time derivative $\partial_t^\alpha$ ($0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$) and a spatial nonlocal operator $\phi(\Delta)$ generated by a subordinate Brownian motion, leading to a doubly nonlocal structure.
  For the case $p \ge 2$, we prove the existence, uniqueness, and sharp Sobolev regularity of weak solutions in the scale of $\phi$-Sobolev spaces $\mathcal{H}_p^{\phi,\gamma+2}(T)$. Our approach combines harmonic analysis techniques (Fefferman--Stein theorem, Littlewood--Paley theory) with stochastic analysis to handle the combined Wiener and L\'evy noise terms. In the special case of cylindrical Wiener noise, a dimensional constraint $d &lt; 2\kappa_0\bigl(2 - (2\sigma_2 - 2/p)_+/\alpha\bigr)$ is obtained.~For the low-regularity case $1 \le p \le 2$, where maximal function estimates fail, we construct unique local mild solutions in $L_p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for equations driven by pure-jump L\'evy space-time white noise, using stochastic truncation and fixed-point arguments.
  The results unify and extend previous theories by simultaneously incorporating time-space nonlocality and jump-type randomness.</description>

      <title>Quantization Dimension of $1$-variable Random Self-Similar Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantization problem for random fractals presents unique challenges due to the lack of uniform geometric scaling inherent in deterministic systems. In this article, we establish the almost sure quantization dimension for a class of $1$-variable (homogeneously) random self-similar measures. Unlike the deterministic setting, where the dimension is derived from a fixed pressure function, we prove that in the random case, the quantization dimension $\kappa_{r}$ is the unique zero of the expectation of the topological pressure. We rigorously justify this by exploiting the ergodicity of the shift map on the symbolic space to control distortion errors across non-uniform scales. Our results highlight the thermodynamic formalism underlying the quantization of random dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Renewal theory for Brownian motion with stochastically gated targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are a wide range of first passage time (FPT) problems in the physical and life sciences that can be modelled in terms of a Brownian particle binding to a reactive surface (absorption). However, prior to absorption, the particle may undergo several rounds of surface attachment (adsorption), detachment (desorption) and diffusion. Alternatively, the surface may be stochastically gated so that absorption can only occur when the gate is open. In both cases one can view each return to the surface as a renewal event. In this paper we develop a renewal theory for stochastically gated FPT problems along analogous lines to previous work on adsorption/desorption processes. We proceed by constructing a renewal equation that relates the joint probability density for particle position and the state of a gate (or multiple gates) to the probability density and FPT density for a totally absorbing (non-gated) boundary. This essentially decomposes sample paths into an alternating sequence of bulk diffusion and instantaneous adsorption/desorption events, which is terminated when adsorption coincides with an open gate. Through a variety of examples, we show how renewal theory provides a general mathematical framework for incorporating stochastic gating into FPT problems.</description>

      <title>SIGMA: Scalable Spectral Insights for LLM Model Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of synthetic data for training Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced the technical challenge of "model collapse"-a degenerative process where recursive training on model-generated content leads to a contraction of distributional variance and representational quality. While the phenomenology of collapse is increasingly evident, rigorous methods to quantify and predict its onset in high-dimensional spaces remain elusive. In this paper, we introduce SIGMA (Spectral Inequalities for Gram Matrix Analysis), a unified framework that benchmarks model collapse through the spectral lens of the embedding Gram matrix. By deriving and utilizing deterministic and stochastic bounds on the matrix's spectrum, SIGMA provides a mathematically grounded metric to track the contraction of the representation space. Crucially, our stochastic formulation enables scalable estimation of these bounds, making the framework applicable to large-scale foundation models where full eigendecomposition is intractable. We demonstrate that SIGMA effectively captures the transition towards degenerate states, offering both theoretical insights into the mechanics of collapse and a practical, scalable tool for monitoring the health of recursive training pipelines.</description>

      <title>The Greedy Algorithm for Dissociated Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A set $\mathcal S\subset \mathbb N$ is said to be a subset-sum-distinct or dissociated if all of its finite subsets have different sums. Alternately, an equivalent classification is if any equality of the form $$\sum_{s\in \mathcal S} \varepsilon_s \cdot s =0$$ where $\varepsilon_s \in \{-1,0,+1\}$ implies that all the $\varepsilon_s$'s are $0$. For a dissociated set $\mathcal S$, we prove that for $c_\ast = \frac 12 \log_2 \left(\frac \pi 2\right)$ and any $c_\ast-1&lt;C&lt;c_\ast$, we have $$\mathcal S(n) \,:=\, \mathcal S\cap [1,n] \,\le\, \log_2 n +\frac 12 \log_2\log_2 n + C$$ for all $n\in \mathcal N_C$ with asymptotic density $\mathbf d\left(\mathcal N_C\right)=2-2^{c_\ast-C}$. Further, we consider the greedy algorithm for generating these sets and prove that this algorithm always eventually doubles. Finally, we also consider some generalizations of dissociated sets and prove similar results about them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ferromagnetic Ising model on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $\mathbb{G}(n,m)$ with bounded average degree $d=2m/n$. Specifically, we determine the limiting distribution of $\log Z_{\mathbb{G}(n,m)}(\beta,B)$, where $Z_{\mathbb{G}(n,m)}(\beta,B)$ is the partition function at inverse temperature $\beta&gt;0$ and external field $B\geq0$.
  If either $B&gt;0$, or $B=0$, $d&gt;1$ and $\beta&gt;\operatorname{ath}(1/d)$ the limiting distribution is a Gaussian whose variance is of order $\Theta(n)$ and is described by a family of stochastic fixed point problems that encode the root magnetisation of two correlated Galton-Watson trees. By contrast, if $B=0$ and either $d\leq1$ or $\beta&lt;\operatorname{ath}(1/d)$ the limiting distribution is an infinite sum of independent random variables and has bounded variance.</description>
