      <title>Discovering Candidate Genes Regulated by GWAS Signals in Cis and Trans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the genetic underpinnings of complex traits and diseases has been greatly advanced by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, a significant portion of trait heritability remains unexplained, known as ``missing heritability". Most GWAS loci reside in non-coding regions, posing challenges in understanding their functional impact. Integrating GWAS with functional genomic data, such as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), can bridge this gap. This study introduces a novel approach to discover candidate genes regulated by GWAS signals in both cis and trans. Unlike existing eQTL studies that focus solely on cis-eQTLs or consider cis- and trans-QTLs separately, we utilize adaptive statistical metrics that can reflect both the strong, sparse effects of cis-eQTLs and the weak, dense effects of trans-eQTLs. Consequently, candidate genes regulated by the joint effects can be prioritized. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method through theoretical and numerical analyses and apply it to adipose eQTL data from the METabolic Syndrome in Men (METSIM) study, uncovering genes playing important roles in the regulatory networks influencing cardiometabolic traits. Our findings offer new insights into the genetic regulation of complex traits and present a practical framework for identifying key regulatory genes based on joint eQTL effects.</description>

      <title>CMOB: Large-Scale Cancer Multi-Omics Benchmark with Open Datasets, Tasks, and Baselines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has shown great potential in the field of cancer multi-omics studies, offering incredible opportunities for advancing precision medicine. However, the challenges associated with dataset curation and task formulation pose significant hurdles, especially for researchers lacking a biomedical background. Here, we introduce the CMOB, the first large-scale cancer multi-omics benchmark integrates the TCGA platform, making data resources accessible and usable for machine learning researchers without significant preparation and expertise.To date, CMOB includes a collection of 20 cancer multi-omics datasets covering 32 cancers, accompanied by a systematic data processing pipeline. CMOB provides well-processed dataset versions to support 20 meaningful tasks in four studies, with a collection of benchmarks. We also integrate CMOB with two complementary resources and various biological tools to explore broader research avenues.All resources are open-accessible with user-friendly and compatible integration scripts that enable non-experts to easily incorporate this complementary information for various tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on selected datasets to offer recommendations on suitable machine learning baselines for specific applications. Through CMOB, we aim to facilitate algorithmic advances and hasten the development, validation, and clinical translation of machine-learning models for personalized cancer treatments. CMOB is available on GitHub (\url{https://github.com/chenzRG/Cancer-Multi-Omics-Benchmark}).</description>

      <title>EBIC: an open source software for high-dimensional and big data biclustering analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09932</link>
      <description>arXiv:1807.09932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivation: In this paper we present the latest release of EBIC, a next-generation biclustering algorithm for mining genetic data. The major contribution of this paper is adding support for big data, making it possible to efficiently run large genomic data mining analyses. Additional enhancements include integration with R and Bioconductor and an option to remove influence of missing value on the final result.
  Results: EBIC was applied to datasets of different sizes, including a large DNA methylation dataset with 436,444 rows. For the largest dataset we observed over 6.6 fold speedup in computation time on a cluster of 8 GPUs compared to running the method on a single GPU. This proves high scalability of the algorithm.
  Availability: The latest version of EBIC could be downloaded from http://github.com/EpistasisLab/ebic . Installation and usage instructions are also available online.</description>
