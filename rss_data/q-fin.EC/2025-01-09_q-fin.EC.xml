      <title>Trust of Strangers: a framework for analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trust among people is essential to ensure collaboration, social network building, transactions, and the development and engagement of new audiences for brand promotion or social causes. In Berry (2024), the trust attitudes of respondents toward strangers on the street, other groups of people, and information sources were measured. This study evaluates the trust of strangers using a 5-factor structural equation model. The analysis yielded a robust model with four of five factors and all variables being statistically significant, with social trust and institutional trust yielding the greatest positive effect on trust of strangers on the street. While demographic characteristics had a small positive effect, the trust of friends and family had a mild negative effect on the trust of strangers on the street. Trust of information sources was not statistically significant and had a negligible positive effect on the trust of strangers. The results also indicate that almost 48% of respondents distrust strangers on the street, implying that trust is not automatically endowed. Directions for future research and implications for business and social causes are discussed.</description>

      <title>Dissertation Paths: Advisors and Students in the Economics Research Production Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elite economics PhD programs aim to train graduate students for a lifetime of academic research. This paper asks how advising affects graduate students' post-PhD research productivity. Advising is highly concentrated: at the eight highly-selective schools in our study, a minority of advisors do most of the advising work. We quantify advisor attributes such as an advisor's own research output and aspects of the advising relationship like coauthoring and research field affinity that might contribute to student research success. Students advised by research-active, prolific advisors tend to publish more, while coauthoring has no effect. Student-advisor research affinity also predicts student success. But a school-level aggregate production function provides much weaker evidence of causal effects, suggesting that successful advisors attract students likely to succeed-without necessarily boosting their students' chances of success. Evidence for causal effects is strongest for a measure of advisors' own research output. Aggregate student research output appears to scale linearly with graduate student enrollment, with no evidence of negative class-size effects. An analysis of gender differences in research output shows male and female graduate students to be equally productive in the first few years post-PhD, but female productivity peaks sooner than male productivity.</description>
