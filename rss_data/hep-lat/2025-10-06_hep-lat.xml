      <title>Approaching the continuum with anisotropic lattice thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FASTSUM collaboration has a long-standing programme of using anisotropic lattice QCD to investigate strong interaction thermodynamics, and in particular spectral quantities. Here we present first results from our new ensemble which has a temporal lattice spacing a_t=15am and anisotropy xi=a_s/a_t=7, giving unprecedented resolution in the temporal direction. We show results for the chiral transition, vector-axial-vector degeneracy, and heavy quarkonium, and compare them with earlier results with coarser time resolution.</description>

      <title>Strong CP problem, theta term and QCD topological properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this chapter we introduce the $\theta$-dependence and the topological properties of QCD, features of the strongly interacting sector which give rise to the strong CP problem in the more general context of the Standard Model of particle physics. We discuss the analytical approaches that can be used to obtain qualitative, or in some cases quantitative, information on the $\theta$-dependence of QCD and QCD-like models, discussing their range of validity and comparing their predictions with the numerical results obtained by means of lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Studying $\textrm{QED}_3$ with radial quantization on the lattice -- I. Free limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate the three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics in the radial quantization on the lattice, the lattice action is constructed and the free limit is studied on $S^2 \times \mathbb{R}$. With the overlap fermion, it is numerically verified that the important symmetries of the theory can be realized on the lattice. The analytic correlators are derived and compared to the lattice results, which agree including the overall normalization. The $O(a^2)$-scaling is confirmed toward the analytic value in the continuum limit, and the number of reproduced descendant states is estimated heuristically for the first few refinement levels. Our study helps us identify the features of the theory that we can study on the icosahedral lattice without fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Flux tube profile from Holography: finite size and strong coupling corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the holographic correspondence as a tool to infer the classical flux tube profile connecting a static quark-antiquark pair in a $2+1$-dimensional strongly-coupled large $N$ QCD-like theory. Our final prediction extends already known results in the literature in several ways. First, it is an analytical function of both the space-like boundary coordinates; in other words, we keep track of what happens both along and transversely to the inter-quark axis. Then, we take into account the finiteness of the inter-quark distance and the first correction in the strong coupling expansion. To the same order, we also confirm the relation between the mass of the lightest glueball in the spectrum and the intrinsic width of the flux tube profile. We conclude by trying to gain some insights about the quantum fluctuations. Intriguingly, our proposal is in agreement with widespread expectations in the literature. En passant, we also derive a semi-analytical formula that gives the first correction to the scalar glueball masses in the strong coupling expansion.</description>

      <title>To break, or not to break: Symmetries in adaptive quantum simulations, a case study on the Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of symmetries in constructing resource-efficient operator pools for adaptive variational quantum eigensolvers. In particular, we focus on the lattice Schwinger model, a discretized model of $1+1$ dimensional electrodynamics, which we use as a proxy for spin chains with a continuum limit. We present an extensive set of simulations comprising a total of $11$ different operator pools, which all systematically and independently break or preserve a combination of discrete translations, the conservation of charge (magnetization) and the fermionic locality of the excitations. Circuit depths are the primary bottleneck in current quantum hardware, and we find that the most efficient ans\"atze in the near-term are obtained by pools that $\textit{break}$ translation invariance, conserve charge, and lead to shallow circuits. On the other hand, we anticipate the shot counts to be the limiting factor in future, error-corrected quantum devices; our findings suggest that pools $\textit{preserving}$ translation invariance could be preferable for such platforms.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of the static potential in SU(3) gluodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After fixing the Maximal Abelian gauge in SU(3) lattice gluodynamics we decompose the nonabelian gauge field into the Abelian field created by Abelian monopoles and the modified nonabelian field with monopoles removed. We then calculate respective static potentials in the fundamental representation and show that the sum of these potentials approximates the nonabelian static potential with good precision at all distances considered. Comparison with other ways of decomposition is made.</description>

      <title>Sparse modeling study of extracting charmonium spectral functions from lattice QCD at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present charmonium spectral functions extracted from Euclidean-time correlation functions using sparse modeling (SpM). SpM solves inverse problems by considering only the sparsity of the target solution. To assess the applicability of the method, we first test it with mock data designed to mimic charmonium correlation functions. We demonstrate that while resonance peaks in the spectral functions can be reconstructed using this method, transport peaks are difficult to resolve without introducing further assumptions beyond sparsity. We then apply the method to charmonium correlation functions obtained from lattice QCD at temperatures below and above the critical temperature. The results are found to be qualitatively consistent with those obtained using the maximum entropy method, although the transport peak is not clearly resolved. This indicates that, even when relying solely on the assumption of sparsity, the method can capture some relevant features of the underlying physics.</description>

      <title>CGAN-Based Framework for Meson Mass and Width Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mesons play a crucial role in understanding the strong interactionin the framework of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). However, the mass and decay width of several ordinary and exotic mesons remain experimentally undetermined. In this work, we propose a novel application of advanced machine learning techniques to deal with this challenge. Due to the limited available meson datasets, traditional data-driven methods are norm To overcome this, we employ a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) to generate synthetic meson data based on known physical parameters. This not only augments the dataset but also retain the underlying physics of the original mesons data. With the extended dataset, we train multiple copies of CGAN and apply a bagging technique to predict uncertainties, improving the robustness and reliability of the predictions. As our findings indicate, the CGAN models are capable of well describing meson properties and their structure relations, offering a potent novel instrument for hadron spectroscopy. This calculation opens a promising future for data-driven hadron physics studies.</description>

      <title>The Gauge Theory Bootstrap: Predicting pion dynamics from QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gauge Theory Bootstrap [arXiv:2309.12402, arXiv:2403.10772] computes the strongly coupled pion dynamics by considering the most general scattering matrix, form factors and spectral densities and matching them with perturbative QCD at high energy and with weakly coupled pions at low energy. In this work, we show that further constraints on the spectral densities significantly reduce the possible solutions to a small set of qualitatively similar ones. Quantitatively, the precise solution is controlled by the asymptotic value of the form factors and SVZ sum rules. We also introduce an iterative procedure that, starting from a generic feasible point, converges to a unique solution parameterized by the UV input. For the converged solution we compute masses and widths of resonances that appear, scattering lengths and effective ranges of partial waves, low energy coefficients in the effective action. Additionally, we use these results to discuss the thermodynamics of a pion gas including pair correlations of pions with same and opposite charge.</description>
