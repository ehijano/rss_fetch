      <title>Symmetry groups of geodesic equations with applications in water waves and liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we derive several important equations in water waves and liquid crystals by deriving them as geodesic equations of right-invariant metrics on two infinite-dimensional groups. The equations we obtain this way are the Hopf (inviscid Burgers) equation, the Camassa-Holm equation, the Hunter-Saxton equation and the Korteweg-De Vries equation. We then study the symmetry groups of the equations themselves and show that one can improve the behaviour of the Hopf equation by metric and topological corrections. The symmetry groups of these equations can aid the benchmarking and testing of numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Efficient Multiparty Entanglement Distribution with DODAG-X Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce the DODAG-X protocol for multipartite entanglement distribution in quantum networks. Leveraging the power of Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAGs), our protocol optimizes resource consumption and enhances robustness to noise in dynamic and lossy networks. Implementing a variation on the X-protocol within the DODAG, we minimize graph verification and path-finding calculations, significantly reducing computational overhead when compared to other entanglement routing schemes. Additionally, our benchmarks on grid lattice and small-world topologies reveal substantial measurement reduction compared to existing protocols. We demonstrate the success of DODAG-X for generating maximal three-party entanglement in arbitrary networks, and describe the potential for scaling to generic $n$-party entanglement. The DODAG-X protocol provides a scalable and efficient solution for entanglement routing, advancing current techniques for reliable quantum communication and network applications.</description>

      <title>Spectral gap and cutoff of the simple exclusion process with IID conductances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the spectral gap and mixing time of the simple exclusion process with $k$ particles in the line segment $[1, N]$ with conductances $c(x, x+1)_{1\le x&lt;N}$ where $c(x, x+1)&gt;0$ is the rate of swapping the contents of the two sites $x$ and $ x+1$. Under the IID assumption on $(c(x, x+1))_{x \in \mathbb{N}}$ with unit inverse expectation $\mathbb{E}[1/c(x, x+1)]=1$, we prove that the spectral gap, denoted by $\mathrm{gap}_{N,k}$, of the process satisfies $\mathrm{gap}_{N, k}=(1+o(1))\pi^2/N^2$ and the eigenfunction $g_N$ with $g_N(1)=1$ corresponding to the spectral gap of one particle case is well approximated by $h_N(x) := \cos\left( (x-1/2)\pi/N \right)$. Under some further assumptions on $c(x, x+1)_{x \in \mathbb{N} }$ and $k$, we prove that around time $(1+o(1)) (2 \pi^2)^{-1} N^2 \log k$, the total variation distance to equilibrium drops abruptly from $1$ to $0$.</description>

      <title>Failure of the Crystalline Equivalence Principle for Weak Free Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interacting crystalline SPT phases were first classified by Thorngren and Else through the crystalline equivalence principle, suggesting that a spatial group symmetry can be treated as if it were an internal symmetry group. Using techniques from topology we elucidate how this principle holds for one of the proposals for the interacting bosonic case and yet fails for weak free fermion phases. Last we show how a variant of the principle does hold for strong crystalline free fermion phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a new and very explicit linearization of the discrete periodic Toda flow by using Mumford$\text{'}$s algebraic description of the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve, where the addition law is described in terms of the Gau{\ss} composition law of quadratic forms. Further, we explain how the periodic box-ball flow fits nicely into this picture as well.</description>

      <title>Matrix models for extremal and integrated correlators of higher rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study extremal and integrated correlators of half-BPS operators in four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ SQCD and $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM with $SU(3)$ gauge group. We focus on the large R-charge sector where the number of operators insertions becomes very large. In this regime, we demonstrate that the correlators are described by a combination of Wishart and Jacobi matrix models, coupled in a non-trivial way. The size of the matrices in each model corresponds to the maximal number of insertions for each of the two single trace generators. This dual matrix model representation allows us to extract the behavior of the correlators at weak and strong coupling in a 't Hooft-like double scaling limit, including nonperturbative corrections. Although this work focuses on $SU(3)$, we expect that our techniques can be extended to $SU(N)$ for $N&gt;3$ as well.</description>

      <title>Unstable Limit Cycles Estimation from Small Perturbations: A Model-Free Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although stable solutions of dynamical systems are typically considered more important than unstable ones, unstable solutions have a critical role in the dynamical integrity of stable solutions. In fact, usually, basins of attraction boundaries are composed of unstable solutions and their stable manifolds. This study proposes a method for estimating unstable limit cycles surrounding stable equilibrium points. The method exploits the shape of the decrement of trajectories converging towards the equilibrium. For the method, trajectories obtained from small perturbations from the equilibrium state are sufficient to estimate the unstable limit cycle roughly. No mathematical model of the system dynamics is needed for the computation, which requires only a single trajectory in the phase space. As such, the method is computationally very rapid and potentially implementable in real structures.</description>

      <title>Geometric constraints on Ekman boundary layer solutions in non-flat regions with well-prepared data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The construction of Ekman boundary layer solutions near the non-flat boundaries presents a complex challenge, with limited research on this issue. In Masmoudi's pioneering work [Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 53 (2000), 432--483], the Ekman boundary layer solution was investigated on the domain $\mathbb{T}^2\times [\varepsilon B(x,y), 1]$, where $\varepsilon$ is a small constant and $B(x,y)$ denotes a periodic smooth function. This study investigates the influence of the geometric structure of the boundary $B(x,y)$ within the boundary layer. Specifically, for well-prepared initial data in the domain $\mathbb{R}^2\times[B(x,y), B(x,y)+2]$, if the boundary surface $B(x,y)$ is smooth and satisfies certain geometric constraints concerning its Gaussian and mean curvatures, then we derive an approximate boundary layer solution. Additionally, according to the curvature and incompressible conditions, the limit system we constructed is a 2D primitive system with damping and rotational effects. From the model's background, it reflects the characteristics arising from rotational effects. Finally, we validate the convergence of this approximate solution. No smallness condition on the amplitude of boundary $B(x, y)$ is required.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Ising Models: Contours, Phase Transitions and Decaying Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.06103v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by Fr\"{o}hlich-Spencer and subsequent authors who introduced the notion of contour for long-range systems, we provide a definition of contour and a direct proof for the phase transition for ferromagnetic long-range Ising models on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 2$. The argument, which is based on a multi-scale analysis, works for the sharp region $\alpha&gt;d$ and improves previous results obtained by Park for $\alpha&gt;3d+1$, and by Ginibre, Grossmann, and Ruelle for $\alpha&gt; d+1$, where $\alpha$ is the power of the coupling constant. The key idea is to avoid a large number of small contours. As an application, we prove the persistence of the phase transition when we add a polynomially decaying magnetic field with power $\delta&gt;0$ as $h^*|x|^{-\delta}$, where $h^* &gt;0$. For $d&lt;\alpha&lt;d+1$, the phase transition occurs when $\delta&gt;\alpha-d$, and when $h^*$ is small enough over the critical line $\delta=\alpha-d$. For $\alpha \geq d+1$, $\delta&gt;1$ is enough to prove the phase transition, and for $\delta=1$ we have to ask $h^*$ small. The natural conjecture is that this region is also sharp for the phase transition problem when we have a decaying field.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a cold gas of $N \gg 1$ weakly interacting fermions. We describe the time evolution of states that are perturbations of the Fermi ball, and analyze the dynamics in particle-hole variables. Our main result states that, for small values of the coupling constant and for appropriate initial data, the effective dynamics of the momentum distribution is determined by a discrete collision operator of quantum Boltzmann form.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hydrodynamics for the Volterra lattice: Ballistic and nonballistic behavior of correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, a lot of effort has been put in describing the hydrodynamic behavior of integrable systems. In this paper, we describe such picture for the Volterra lattice. Specifically, we are able to explicitly compute the susceptibility matrix and the current-field correlation matrix in terms of the density of states of the Volterra lattice endowed with a Generalized Gibbs ensemble. Furthermore, we apply the theory of linear Generalized Hydrodynamics to describe the Euler scale behavior of the correlation functions. We anticipate that the solution to the Generalized Hydrodynamics equations develops shocks at $\xi_0=\frac{x}{t}$; so this linear approximation does not fully describe the behavior of correlation functions. Intrigued but this fact, we performed several numerical investigations which show that, exactly when the solution to the hydrodynamic equations develops shock, the correlation functions show an highly oscillatory behavior. In view of this empirical observation, we believe that at this point $\xi_0$ the diffusive contribution are not sub-leading corrections to the ballistic transport, but they are of the same order.</description>

      <title>Restrictions on realizable unitary operations imposed by symmetry and locality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2003.05524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to a fundamental result in quantum computing, any unitary transformation on a composite system can be generated using so-called 2-local unitaries that act only on two subsystems. Beyond its importance in quantum computing, this result can also be regarded as a statement about the dynamics of systems with local Hamiltonians: although locality puts various constraints on the short-term dynamics, it does not restrict the possible unitary evolutions that a composite system with a general local Hamiltonian can experience after a sufficiently long time. Here we show that this universality does not remain valid in the presence of conservation laws and global continuous symmetries such as U(1) and SU(2). In particular, we show that generic symmetric unitaries cannot be implemented, even approximately, using local symmetric unitaries. Based on this no-go theorem, we propose a method for experimentally probing the locality of interactions in nature. In the context of quantum thermodynamics, our results mean that generic energy-conserving unitary transformations on a composite system cannot be realized solely by combining local energy-conserving unitaries on the components. We show how this can be circumvented via catalysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sheffield showed that conformally welding a $\gamma$-Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) surface to itself gives a Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) curve with parameter $\kappa = \gamma^2$ as the interface, and Duplantier-Miller-Sheffield proved similar results for $\kappa = \frac{16}{\gamma^2}$ for $\gamma$-LQG surfaces with boundaries decorated by looptrees of disks or by continuum random trees. We study these dynamics for LQG surfaces coming from Liouville conformal field theory (LCFT). At stopping times depending only on the curve, we give an explicit description of the surface and curve in terms of LCFT and SLE. This has applications to both LCFT and SLE. We prove the boundary BPZ equations for LCFT, a crucial input for subsequent work with Remy, Sun and Zhu deriving the structure constants of boundary LCFT. With Yu we prove the reversibility of whole-plane SLE$_\kappa$ for $\kappa &gt; 8$ via a novel radial mating-of-trees, and will show the space of LCFT surfaces is closed under conformal welding.</description>

Abstract: We show that the vertex-reinforced jump process on the $d$-dimensional lattice with long-range jumps is transient in any dimension $d$ as long as the initial weights do not decay too fast. The main ingredients in the proof are: an analysis of the corresponding random environment on finite boxes, a comparison with a hierarchical model, and the reduction of the hierarchical model to a non-homogeneous effective one-dimensional model. For $d\ge 3$ we also prove transience of the vertex-reinforced jump process with possibly long-range jumps as long as nearest-neighbor weights are large enough.</description>

      <title>Simulating Holographic Conformal Field Theories on Hyperbolic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how table-top settings combining hyperbolic lattices with nonlinear dynamics universally encode aspects of the bulk-boundary-correspondence between gravity in anti-de-Sitter (AdS) space and conformal field theory (CFT). Our concrete and broadly applicable holographic toy model simulates gravitational self-interactions in the bulk and features an emergent CFT with nontrivial correlations on the boundary. We measure the CFT data contained in the two- and three-point functions and clarify how a thermal CFT is simulated through an effective black hole geometry. As a concrete example, we propose and simulate an experimentally feasible protocol to measure the holographic CFT using electrical circuits.</description>

      <title>Integral identities and universal relations for solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05789v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any nonlinear field theory giving rise to static solutions with finite energy like, e.g., topological solitons, allows us to derive a continuous infinity of integral identities which any such solution has to obey. These integral identities can always be understood as being generated by field transformations and their related Noether currents. We also explain why all integral identities generated by coordinate transformations become trivial for Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) solitons, i.e., topological solitons which saturate a topological energy bound. Finally, we consider applications of these identities to a broad class of nonlinear scalar theories, including the Skyrme model. More concretely, we find nontrivial integral identities that can be seen as model-independent relations between certain physical properties of the solitons in such theories, and we comment on the possible connection between these new relations and those already found in the context of astrophysical compact objects. We also demonstrate the usefulness of said identities to estimate the precision of the numerical calculation of soliton observables.</description>

      <title>Quantum entropy couples matter with geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08556v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a theory for coupling matter fields with discrete geometry on higher-order networks, i.e. cell complexes. The key idea of the approach is to associate to a higher-order network the quantum entropy of its metric. Specifically we propose an action having two contributions. The first contribution is proportional to the logarithm of the volume associated to the higher-order network by the metric. In the vacuum this contribution determines the entropy of the geometry. The second contribution is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of the higher-order network and the metric induced by the matter and gauge fields. The induced metric is defined in terms of the topological spinors and the discrete Dirac operators. The topological spinors, defined on nodes, edges and higher-dimensional cells, encode for the matter fields. The discrete Dirac operators act on topological spinors, and depend on the metric of the higher-order network as well as on the gauge fields via a discrete version of the minimal substitution. We derive the coupled dynamical equations for the metric, the matter and the gauge fields, providing an information theory principle to obtain the field theory equations in discrete curved space.</description>

      <title>Fermat Principle and weak deflection angle from Lindstedt-Poincare method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fermat principle is advocated to be a convenient tool to analyze the light propagation in a curved space time. It is shown that in the weak deflection regime the light ray trajectories can be systematically described by applying the Lindstedt--Poicare method of solving perturbatively the nonlinear oscillation equations. The expansion in terms of inverse invariant impact parameter for Schwarzschild, Reissner--Nordstr\"om and Kerr (equatorial motion) metrics is described. The corresponding deflection angles are computed to the third order. Only algebraic operations are involved in the derivation; no integrations or Fourier expansion of elliptic functions are necessary.</description>

      <title>Integrable Higher-Spin Deformations of Sigma Models from Auxiliary Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new infinite family of integrable deformations of the principal chiral model (PCM) parameterized by an interaction function of several variables, which extends the formalism of arXiv:2405.05899, and includes deformations of the PCM by functions of both the stress tensor and higher-spin conserved currents. We show in detail that every model in this class admits a Lax representation for its equations of motion, and that the Poisson bracket of the Lax connection takes the Maillet form, establishing the existence of an infinite set of Poisson-commuting conserved charges. We argue that the non-Abelian T-dual of any model in this family is classically integrable, and that T-duality "commutes" with a general deformation in this class, in a sense which we make precise. Finally, we demonstrate that these higher-spin auxiliary field deformations can be extended to accommodate the addition of a Wess-Zumino term, and we exhibit the Lax connection in this case.</description>

      <title>Quantum obesity and steering ellipsoids for fermionic fields in Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger dilation spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates quantum obesity (QO), quantum discord (QD), and the quantum steering ellipsoid (QSE) for bipartite Gisin states subjected to Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilation of spacetime on the second qubit. These three quantifiers are introduced to characterize quantum correlations beyond entanglement and can also function as entanglement witnesses. Our results demonstrate a monotonic decrease in the physical accessibility of both QD and QO as the dilation parameter increases within the region-I of the second qubit. Conversely, in the anti-particle region, the accessibility of QD and QO stabilizes at finite values of the dilation parameter owing to the influence of the Pauli exclusion principle and Fermi-Dirac statistics, subsequently increasing gradually. Notably, the QSE in the region-I expands as the Dirac field frequency rises and the dilation parameter diminishes, while the opposite trend is observed in the anti-particle region.</description>
