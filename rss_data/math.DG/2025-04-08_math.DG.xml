      <title>Area, Volume and Capacity in non--compact $3$--manifolds with non--negative scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a $3$--dimensional, complete, one--ended Riemannian manifold, with a minimal, compact and connected boundary. We assume that $M$ has a simple topology and that the scalar curvature of $(M,g)$ is non--negative. Moreover, we suppose that $(M,g)$ admits a $2$--capacitary potential $v$ with $v,\,\vert \nabla v\vert\to 0$ at infinity. In this note, we provide a gradient integral estimate for the level sets of the function $u=1-v$. This estimate leads to a sharp volume comparison for the sub--level sets of $u$, and a sharp area comparison of the level sets of $u$. From this last comparison it follows a sharp area--capacity inequality, originally derived by Bray and Miao, thereby extending its cases of validity. This work is based on a recent paper by Colding and Minicozzi. Finally, for completeness, we also show the same type of area and volume comparison, in the case where $(M,g)$ has no boundary, replacing the function $u$ with one related to the minimal positive Green's function. This volume comparison leads to a more geometric proof of the positive mass inequality than the one given in \cite{Ago_Maz_Oro}.</description>

      <title>Estimates for Eigenvalues of the Dirichlet Laplacian on Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the eigenvalue problem of the Dirichlet Laplacian on bounded domains in complete Riemannian manifolds. By building on classical results like Li-Yau's and Yang's inequalities, we derive upper and lower bounds for eigenvalues, including an affirmative resolution on conjecture of Cheng and Yang \cite{ChengYang11} by using Harrell-Stubbe type estimates. For the projective spaces and minimal submanifolds in the projective spaces, we also give explicit estimates on lower bound for eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04515v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the upper hemisphere, we use the Obata-Escobar argument to classify conformal metrics with constant $\sigma_k$ curvature and constant boundary mean curvature in all types of cones including positive and negative cones. This extends a result of Escobar in \cite{Es} for $k=1$.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Computation of Geodesic Distances on Reductive Homogeneous Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many geometric machine learning and image analysis applications, require a left-invariant metric on the 5D homogeneous space of 3D positions and orientations SE(3)/SO(2). This is done in Equivariant Neural Networks (G-CNNs), or in PDE-Based Group Convolutional Neural Networks (PDE-G-CNNs), where the Riemannian metric enters in multilayer perceptrons, message passing, and max-pooling over Riemannian balls.
  In PDE-G-CNNs it is proposed to take the minimum left-invariant Riemannian distance over the fiber in SE(3)/SO(2), whereas in G-CNNs and in many geometric image processing methods an efficient SO(2)-conjugation invariant section is advocated.
  The conjecture rises whether that computationally much more efficient section indeed always selects distance minimizers over the fibers. We show that this conjecture does NOT hold in general, and in the logarithmic norm approximation setting used in practice we analyze the small (and sometimes vanishing) differences. We first prove that the minimal distance section is reached by minimal horizontal geodesics with constant momentum and zero acceleration along the fibers, and we generalize this result to (reductive) homogeneous spaces with legal metrics and commutative structure groups.</description>

      <title>On Separation of Variables for Symmetric Spaces of Rank1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study existence and nonexistence of diagonal and separating coordinates for Riemannian symmetric spaces of rank 1. We generalize the results of Gauduchon and Moroianu, 2020, by showing that a symmetric space of rank 1 has diagonal coordinates if and only if it has constant sectional curvature. This implies that orthogonal separation of variables on a symmetric space of rank 1 is possible only in the constant sectional curvature case. We show that on the complex projective space $\mathbb{C}P^n$ and on complex hyperbolic space $\mathbb{C}H^n$, with $n\ge 2$, separating coordinates necessarily have precisely $n$ ignorable coordinates.
  In view of results of Boyer et al, 1983 and 1985, and later results of Winternitz et al, 1994, this completes the description of separation of variables on $\mathbb{C}P^n$ for all $n$ and on $\mathbb{C}H^n$ for $n=2,3$.</description>

      <title>Some new functionals related to free boundary minimal submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metrics induced on free boundary minimal surfaces in geodesic balls in the upper unit hemisphere and hyperbolic space can be characterized as critical metrics for the functionals $\Theta_{r,i}$ and $\Omega_{r,i}$, introduced recently by Lima, Menezes and the second author. In this paper, we generalize this characterization to free boundary minimal submanifolds of higher dimension in the same spaces. We also introduce some functionals of the form different from $\Theta_{r,i}$ and show that the critical metrics for them are the metrics induced by free boundary minimal immersions into a geodesic ball in the upper unit hemisphere. In the case of surfaces, these functionals are bounded from above and not bounded from below. Moreover, the canonical metric on a geodesic disk in a 3-ball in the upper unit hemisphere is maximal for this functional on the set of all Riemannian metric of the topological disk.</description>

      <title>Affine hypersurfaces and superintegrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently shown that under mild assumptions second-order conformally superintegrable systems can be encoded in a $(0,3)$-tensor, called structure tensor. For abundant systems, this approach led to algebraic integrability conditions that essentially allow one to restore a system from the knowledge of its structure tensor in a point on the manifold. Here we study the geometric structure formalising such systems, which we call an abundant manifold. The underlying Riemannian manifold is necessarily conformally flat. We establish a correspondence between these superintegrable systems and the geometry of affine hypersurfaces. More precisely, we show that abundant manifolds correspond to certain non-degenerate relative affine hypersurfaces normalisations in $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ ($n\ge 2$). We also formulate the necessary and sufficient conditions non-degenerate relative affine hypersurface normalisations in $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ need to satisfy, if they arise from abundant manifolds. These relative affine hypersurface normalisations are called abundant hypersurface normalisations. Both for abundant manifolds and for relative affine hypersurface normalisations a natural concept of conformal equivalence can be defined. We prove that they are compatible, permitting us to identify conformal classes of abundant manifolds with abundant hypersurface immersions (without specified normalisation).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides a complete characterization of the conformal classes of product tori and standard flat tori in complex dimension 1 (real dimension 2). Utilizing basic differential geometry methods, our approach contrasts with techniques employing Hopf tori for the conformal classification of Riemann surfaces of genus 1. While the results may be familiar to experts in complex analysis and Riemann surface theory, we contend that this work offers a clear and insightful perspective on the conformal properties of these geometrically distinct appearing tori.</description>

      <title>Refined algebraic domains with finite sets in the boundaries respecting differential geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are interested in shapes of real algebraic curves in the plane and regions surrounded by them: they are named refined algebraic domains by the author.
  As characteristic finite sets, we consider points contained in two curves and the sets of singular points of the restrictions of the projections to the lines to the curves. As a new case, we respect differential geometry and consider inflection points and points of some double tangent lines of a single connected curve. We prove fundamental properties and investigate some examples.
  We have also previously considered the cases where the curves are straight lines, circles, or boundaries of ellipsoids for example. Such simple cases are trivial in our new consideration.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an $L_{p}$ Christoffel-Minkowski-type problem that prescribes a class of $L_p$ geometric measures, which are mixtures of the $k$-th area measure and the $q$-th dual curvature measure. By establishing a gradient estimate, we obtain the existence of an even, smooth, strictly convex solution to this problem for $1 &lt; p &lt; q \leq k + 1$, where $1 \leq k \leq n$ and $n \geq 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the first of a pair of papers devoted to the local invariants of Goursat distributions. The study of these distributions naturally leads to a tower of spaces over an arbitrary surface, called the monster tower, and thence to connections with the topic of singularities of curves on surfaces. Here we study those invariants of Goursat distributions akin to those of curves on surfaces, which we call structural invariants. In the subsequent paper we will relate these structural invariants to the small growth invariants.</description>

Abstract: We give improved estimates for the size of the singular set of minimizing capillary hypersurfaces: the singular set is always of codimension at least $4$, and this estimate improves if the capillary angle is close to $0$, $\frac{\pi}{2}$, or $\pi$. For capillary angles that are close to $0$ or $\pi$, our analysis is based on a rigorous connection between the capillary problem and the one-phase Bernoulli problem.</description>

Abstract: For each $g\ge 3$, we prove existence of a compact, connected, smoothly embedded, genus-$g$ surface $M_g$ with the following property: under mean curvature flow, there is exactly one singular point at the first singular time, and the tangent flow at the singularity is given by a shrinker with genus $(g-1)$ and with two ends. Furthermore, we show that if $g$ is sufficiently large, then $M_g$ fattens at the first singular time. As $g\to\infty$, the shrinker converges to a multiplicity $2$ plane.</description>

Abstract: We study the structure of $\mathfrak{M}_2$, the set of half-dimensional collapsing spaces of hyperk\"ahler metrics on K3 surfaces. We show that $\mathfrak{M}_2$ consists precisely of those underlying metric spaces of integral singular special K\"ahler structures (SKSs) on $ \mathbb{P}^1 $. Furthermore, we establish a bijection between integral singular SKSs on $\mathbb{P}^1 $ and Jacobian elliptic K3 surfaces with a marked holomorphic volume form. Additionally, we compute the number of Jacobian elliptic K3 surfaces that correspond to a given metric on $ \mathbb{P}^1 $.</description>

      <title>On a natural L2 metric on the space of Hermitian metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23756v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the space of Hermitian metrics on a fixed complex vector bundle. This infinite-dimensional space has appeared in the study of Hermitian-Einstein structures, where a special L2-type Riemannian metric is introduced. We compute the metric spray, geodesics and curvature associated to this metric, and show that the exponential map is a diffeomorphsim. Though being geodesically complete, the space of Hermitian metrics is metrically incomplete, and its metric completion is proved to be the space of L2 integrable singular Hermitian metrics. In addition, both the original space and its completion are CAT(0). In the holomorphic case, it turns out that Griffiths seminegative/semipositive singular Hermitian metric is always "L2 integrable" in our sense. Also, in the Appendix, the Nash-Moser inverse function theorem is used to prove that, for any L2 metric on the space of smooth sections of a given fiber bundle, the exponential map is always a local diffeomorphism, provided that each fiber is nonpositively curved.</description>

      <title>Filtered Calculus and crossed products by R-actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13532v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show an isomorphism between the kernel of the C*-algebra of the tangent groupoid of a filtered manifold and the crossed product of the order 0 pseudodifferential operators in the associated filtered calculus by a natural R-action. This isomorphism is constructed in the same way as in the classical pseudodifferential calculus by Debord and Skandalis. The proof however relies on a structure result for the C*-algebra of graded nilpotent Lie groups which did not appear in the commutative case. A consequence of this structure result is a decomposition of the principal symbol algebra, generalizing the decomposition of Epstein and Melrose in the case of contact manifolds.</description>

      <title>Defining equations of $7$-dimensional model CR hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18588v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study CR hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{C}^4$ that are Levi degenerate with constant rank Levi form, and moreover finitely nondegenerate. Each of these can be described as a deformation of a model CR hypersurface by adding terms of higher natural weighted order to the model's defining equation. We obtain a complete normal form for models of real analytic uniformly $2$-nondegenerate CR hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{C}^4$, and present a detailed study of their local invariants. The normal form illustrates that $2$-nondegenerate models in $\mathbb{C}^4$ comprise a moduli space parameterized by two univariate holomorphic functions, which is in sharp contrast to the well known Levi-nondegenerate setting and the more recently discovered behavior of $2$-nondegenerate structures in $\mathbb{C}^3$. In further contrast to these previously studied settings, we demonstrate that not all $2$-nondegenerate structures in $\mathbb{C}^4$ arise as perturbations of homogeneous models. We derive defining equations for the homogeneous $2$-nondegenerate models, a set of $9$ structures, and find explicit formulas for their infinitesimal symmetries.</description>

      <title>K-semistability of log Fano cone singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a non-Archimedean characterization of K-semistability of log Fano cone singularities, and show that it agrees with the definition originally defined by Collins--Sz\'ekelyhidi. As an application, we show that to test K-semistability, it suffices to test special test configurations. We also show that special test configurations give rise to lc places of torus equivariant bounded complements.</description>

      <title>Many facets of cohomology: Differential complexes and structure-aware formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complexes and cohomology, traditionally central to topology, have emerged as fundamental tools across applied mathematics and the sciences. This survey explores their roles in diverse areas, from partial differential equations and continuum mechanics to reformulations of the Einstein equations and network theory. Motivated by advances in compatible and structure-preserving discretisation such as Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC), we examine how differential complexes encode critical properties such as existence, uniqueness, stability and rigidity of solutions to differential equations. We demonstrate that various fundamental concepts and models in solid and fluid mechanics are essentially formulated in terms of differential complexes.</description>

      <title>Charges, complex structures, and perturbations of instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hermitian non-K\"ahler Einstein 4-manifolds have a quasi-locally conserved charge associated to spin-lowering via Killing spinors, and corresponding to a parameter of the moduli space. This charge is evaluated for all explicitly known examples. Infinitesimal Einstein deformations are shown to admit a closed 2-form that measures the perturbation to this charge. Provided certain boundary conditions hold, a curve of metrics in the moduli space passing through a Hermitian non-K\"ahler Einstein metric is shown to be conformally K\"ahler to second perturbative order. This result is applied to prove that infinitesimal Ricci-flat deformations of ALF Hermitian non-K\"ahler instantons are tangent to the moduli space of Hermitian instantons, and hence as a consequence that infinitesimal rigidity holds. The analog of this statement also holds for the case of compact Hermitian non-K\"ahler Einstein metrics.</description>
