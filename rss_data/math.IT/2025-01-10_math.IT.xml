      <title>Relative Phase Equivariant Deep Neural Systems for Physical Layer Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of telecommunications, the increasing demand for complex and specialized communication systems has led to a focus on improving physical layer communications. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising solution avenue for doing so. Deep neural receivers have already shown significant promise in improving the performance of communications systems. However, a major challenge lies in developing deep neural receivers that match the energy efficiency and speed of traditional receivers. This work investigates the incorporation of inductive biases in the physical layer using group-equivariant deep learning to improve the parameter efficiency of deep neural receivers. We do so by constructing a deep neural receiver that is equivariant with respect to the phase of arrival. We show that the inclusion of relative phase equivariance significantly reduces the error rate of deep neural receivers at similar model sizes. Thus, we show the potential of group-equivariant deep learning in the domain of physical layer communications.</description>

      <title>SNR-EQ-JSCC: Joint Source-Channel Coding with SNR-Based Embedding and Query</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coping with the impact of dynamic channels is a critical issue in joint source-channel coding (JSCC)-based semantic communication systems. In this paper, we propose a lightweight channel-adaptive semantic coding architecture called SNR-EQ-JSCC. It is built upon the generic Transformer model and achieves channel adaptation (CA) by Embedding the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) into the attention blocks and dynamically adjusting attention scores through channel-adaptive Queries. Meanwhile, penalty terms are introduced in the loss function to stabilize the training process. Considering that instantaneous SNR feedback may be imperfect, we propose an alternative method that uses only the average SNR, which requires no retraining of SNR-EQ-JSCC. Simulation results conducted on image transmission demonstrate that the proposed SNR-EQJSCC outperforms the state-of-the-art SwinJSCC in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and perception metrics while only requiring 0.05% of the storage overhead and 6.38% of the computational complexity for CA. Moreover, the channel-adaptive query method demonstrates significant improvements in perception metrics. When instantaneous SNR feedback is imperfect, SNR-EQ-JSCC using only the average SNR still surpasses baseline schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the decoding of the rank metric Reed--Muller codes introduced by Augot, Couvreur, Lavauzelle and Neri in 2021. We propose a polynomial time algorithm that rests on the structure of Dickson matrices, works on any such code and corrects up to half the minimum distance.</description>

      <title>Classification of Self-Dual Constacyclic Codes of Prime Power Length $p^s$ Over $\frac{\mathbb{F}_{p^m}[u]}{\left\langle u^3\right\rangle} $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_{p^m}$ be a finite field of cardinality $p^m$, where $p$ is a prime number and $m$ is a positive integer. Self-dual constacyclic codes of length \( p^s \) over \( \frac{\mathbb{F}_{p^m}[u]}{\langle u^3 \rangle} \) exist only when \( p = 2 \). In this work, we classify and enumerate all self-dual cyclic codes of length \( 2^s \) over \( \frac{\mathbb{F}_{2^m}[u]}{\langle u^3 \rangle} \), thereby completing the classification and enumeration of self-dual constacyclic codes of length \( p^s \) over \( \frac{\mathbb{F}_{p^m}[u]}{\langle u^3 \rangle} \). Additionally, we correct and improve results from B. Kim and Y. Lee (2020) in \cite{kim2020classification}.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Delsarte Dual LPs: Lifting, Constructions and Completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central and longstanding open problem in coding theory is the rate-versus-distance trade-off for binary error-correcting codes. In a seminal work, Delsarte introduced a family of linear programs establishing relaxations on the size of optimum codes. To date, the state-of-the-art upper bounds for binary codes come from dual feasible solutions to these LPs. Still, these bounds are exponentially far from the best-known existential constructions.
  Recently, hierarchies of linear programs extending and strengthening Delsarte's original LPs were introduced for linear codes, which we refer to as higher-order Delsarte LPs. These new hierarchies were shown to provably converge to the actual value of optimum codes, namely, they are complete hierarchies. Therefore, understanding them and their dual formulations becomes a valuable line of investigation. Nonetheless, their higher-order structure poses challenges. In fact, analysis of all known convex programming hierarchies strengthening Delsarte's original LPs has turned out to be exceedingly difficult and essentially nothing is known, stalling progress in the area since the 1970s.
  Our main result is an analysis of the higher-order Delsarte LPs via their dual formulation. Although quantitatively, our current analysis only matches the best-known upper bounds, it shows, for the first time, how to tame the complexity of analyzing a hierarchy strengthening Delsarte's original LPs. In doing so, we reach a better understanding of the structure of the hierarchy, which may serve as the foundation for further quantitative improvements. We provide two additional structural results for this hierarchy. First, we show how to \emph{explicitly} lift any feasible dual solution from level $k$ to a (suitable) larger level $\ell$ while retaining the objective value. Second, we give a novel proof of completeness using the dual formulation.</description>

      <title>Error Floor of Spinal Codes under ML Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spinal codes is a new family of capacity-achieving rateless codes that has been shown to achieve better rate performance compared to Raptor codes, Strider codes, and rateless Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes. This correspondence addresses the performance limitations of Spinal codes in the finite block length regime, uncovering an error floor phenomenon at high Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs). We develop an analytical expression to approximate the error floor and devise SNR thresholds at which the error floor initiates. Numerical results across {Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), rayleigh, and nakagami-m fading channels} verify the accuracy of our analysis. The analysis and numerical results also show that transmitting more passes of symbols can lower the error floor but does not affect the SNR threshold, providing insights on the performance target, the working SNR region, and the code design.</description>

      <title>Convexity of Mutual Information along the Fokker-Planck Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a preliminary study of the convexity of mutual information regarded as the function of time along the Fokker-Planck equation and generalize conclusions in the cases of heat flow and OU flow. We firstly prove the existence and uniqueness of the classical solution to a class of Fokker-Planck equations and then we obtain the second derivative of mutual information along the Fokker-Planck equation. We prove that if the initial distribution is sufficiently strongly log-concave compared to the steady state, then mutual information always preserves convexity under suitable conditions. In particular, if there exists a large time, such that the distribution at this time is sufficiently strongly log-concave compared to the steady state, then mutual information preserves convexity after this time under suitable conditions.</description>

      <title>Towards High-Performance Network Coding: FPGA Acceleration With Bounded-value Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network coding enhances performance in network communications and distributed storage by increasing throughput and robustness while reducing latency. Batched Sparse (BATS) codes are a class of capacity-achieving network codes, but their practical applications are hindered by their structure, computational intensity, and power demands of finite field operations. Most literature focuses on algorithmic-level techniques to improve coding efficiency. Optimization with an algorithm/hardware co-designing approach has long been neglected. Leveraging the unique structure of BATS codes, we first present CS-BATS, a hardware-friendly variant. Next we propose a simple but effective bounded-value generator, to reduce the size of a finite field multiplier by up to 70%. Finally, we report on a scalable and resource-efficient FPGA-based network coding accelerator that achieves a throughput of 27 Gbps, a speedup of more than 300 over software.</description>

      <title>On the Completely Monotone Conjecture for R\'enyi Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the completely monotone conjecture along the heat flow for the R\'enyi entropy. We confirm this conjecture for the order of derivative up to $4$, when the order of R\'enyi entropy is in certain regimes. We also investigate concavity of R\'enyi entropy power and the complete monotonicity of Tsallis entropy. We recover and slightly extend Hung's result on the fourth-order derivative of the Tsallis entropy, and observe that the complete monotonicity holds for Tsallis entropy of order $2$, which is equivalent to that the noise stability with respect to the heat semigroup is completely monotone. Based on this observation, we conjecture that the complete monotonicity holds for Tsallis entropy of all orders $\alpha\in(1,2)$. Our proofs in this paper are based on the techniques of integration-by-parts, sum-of-squares, and curve-fitting.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of short blocklength Reed-Muller codes for physical layer security in real environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the application of Reed-Muller (RM) codes for Physical-layer security in a real world wiretap channel scenario. Utilizing software-defined radios (SDRs) in a real indoor environment, we implement a coset coding scheme that leverages the hierarchical structure of RM codes to secure data transmission. The generator matrix of the RM code is used to partition codewords into cosets in the usual way, where each message corresponds to a unique coset, and auxiliary bits select specific codewords within each coset. This approach enables the legitimate receiver (Bob) can decode the transmitted message with minimal information leakage to eavesdropper (Eve) thus protecting the confidentiality of the communication with the help of coset structure. Mutual information neural estimation (MINE) is used to quantify information leakage and validate the effectiveness of the scheme. Experimental results indicate that RM codes can achieve robust security even in practical environments affected by real-world channel impairments. These findings demonstrate the potential of RM codes as an efficient solution for physical-layer security, particularly for applications that require low latency and short blocklengths.</description>

      <title>A General Framework for Clustering and Distribution Matching with Bandit Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for clustering and distribution matching problems with bandit feedback. We consider a $K$-armed bandit model where some subset of $K$ arms is partitioned into $M$ groups. Within each group, the random variable associated to each arm follows the same distribution on a finite alphabet. At each time step, the decision maker pulls an arm and observes its outcome from the random variable associated to that arm. Subsequent arm pulls depend on the history of arm pulls and their outcomes. The decision maker has no knowledge of the distributions of the arms or the underlying partitions. The task is to devise an online algorithm to learn the underlying partition of arms with the least number of arm pulls on average and with an error probability not exceeding a pre-determined value~$\delta$. Several existing problems fall under our general framework, including finding $M$ pairs of arms, odd arm identification, and $N$-ary clustering of $K$ arms belong to our general framework. We derive a non-asymptotic lower bound on the average number of arm pulls for any online algorithm with an error probability not exceeding $\delta$. Furthermore, we develop a computationally-efficient online algorithm based on the Track-and-Stop method and Frank--Wolfe algorithm, and show that the average number of arm pulls of our algorithm asymptotically matches that of the lower bound. Our refined analysis also uncovers a novel bound on the speed at which the average number of arm pulls of our algorithm converges to the fundamental limit as $\delta$ vanishes.</description>
