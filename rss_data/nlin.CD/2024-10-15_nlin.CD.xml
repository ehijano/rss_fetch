      <title>Route to hyperchaos in quadratic optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperchaos is a qualitatively stronger form of chaos, in which several degrees of freedom contribute simultaneously to exponential divergence of small changes. A hyperchaotic dynamical system is therefore even more unpredictable than a chaotic one, and has a higher fractal dimension. While hyperchaos has been studied extensively over the last decades, only a few experimental systems are known to exhibit hyperchaotic dynamics. Here we introduce hyperchaos in the context of cavity optomechanics, in which light inside an optical resonator interacts with a suspended oscillating mass. We show that hyperchaos can arise in optomechanical systems with quadratic coupling that operate in the resolved-sideband regime by applying a far off-resonance, blue-detuned pump, and is well within reach of current experiments. We compute the two positive Lyapunov exponents, characteristic of hyperchaos, and independently verify the correlation dimension. As systems designed for high-precision measurements, optomechanical systems enable direct measurement of all four dynamical variables and therefore the full reconstruction of the hyperchaotic attractor. Our results may contribute to better understanding of nonlinear systems and the chaos-hyperchaos transition, and allow the study of hyperchaos in the quantum regime.</description>

      <title>Extending 1089 attractor to any number of digits and any number of steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-known 1089 trick reflects an amazing trait of digital reversal process and reminisces of a limiting attractor in dynamical systems even though it takes only two steps. It is natural to consider the situations when the number of digits is beyond three as in the original 1089 trick, as well as situations when the number of steps is beyond two. The first part has been mostly done by Webster which we will reproduce. After two steps, the resulting integers are called Papadakis-Webster integers (PWI), which is always divisible by 99, and the resulting quotients consist of only 0's and 1's, which we name Papadakis-Webster binary strings (PWBS). Not all binary strings could be PWBS, and we define the hairpin pairing rule to determine if a binary string is a PWBS. For the second part, we propose a two-option iteration system named iterative digital reversal (IDR) suitably interweaving additions and subtractions. The simplest limiting behavior of IDR is 2-cycles. The elements in an IDR 2-cycle are all composed of repetitions of the 10(9)$_L$89 (L&gt;=0) motif, and are all PWIs. The lower 2-cycle elements after division of 99 belong to the subset of PWBS that are palindromic and consist of 0- and 1-blocks with a minimal length of two. IDR also has higher p-cycles (p=10,12,71) whose elements seem to contain at least one PWI. Another interesting finding about IDR is that it contains non-periodic and diverging trajectories, as the integer values grow to infinity. In these diverging trajectories, while the number of flanking digits around the middle point increases by the iteration, the middle part has an 8-cycle rhythm or signature which has been found in all diverging trajectories. Overall, the generalization of the original 1089 trick in both space and time leads to new patterns in integers and new phenomenology in dynamics.</description>

      <title>How many points converge to a heteroclinic network in an aperiodic way?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homoclinic and heteroclinic connections can form cycles and networks in phase space, which organize the global phenomena in dynamical systems. On the one hand, stability notions for (omni)cycles give insight into how many initial conditions approach the network along a single given (omni)cycle. On the other hand, the term switching is used to describe situations where there are trajectories that follow any possible sequence of heteroclinic connections along the network. Here we give a notion of asymptotic stability for general sequences along a network of homoclinic and heteroclinic connections. We show that there cannot be uncountably many aperiodic sequences that attract a set with nontrivial measure. Finally, we discuss examples where one may or may not expect aperiodic convergence towards a network and conclude with some open questions.</description>

      <title>Basin of attraction organization in infinite-dimensional delayed systems: a stochastic basin entropy approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mackey-Glass system is a paradigmatic example of a delayed model whose dynamics is particularly complex due to, among other factors, its multistability involving the coexistence of many periodic and chaotic attractors. The prediction of the long-term dynamics is especially challenging in these systems, where the dimensionality is infinite and initial conditions must be specified as a function in a finite time interval. In this paper we extend the recently proposed basin entropy to randomly sample arbitrarily high-dimensional spaces. By complementing this stochastic approach with the basin fraction of the attractors in the initial conditions space we can understand the structure of the basins of attraction and how they are intermixed. The results reported here allow us to quantify the predictability giving us an idea about the long-term evolution of trajectories as a function of the initial conditions. The tools employed can result very useful in the study of complex systems of infinite dimension.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity breaking and deviation from Eigenstate Thermalisation in relativistic QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15123v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The validity of the ergodic hypothesis in quantum systems can be rephrased in the form of the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis (ETH), a set of statistical properties for the matrix elements of local observables in energy eigenstates, which is expected to hold in any ergodic system. We test the ETH in a nonintegrable model of relativistic quantum field theory (QFT) using the numerical method of Hamiltonian truncation in combination with analytical arguments based on Lorentz symmetry and renormalisation group theory. We find that there is an infinite sequence of eigenstates with the characteristics of quantum many-body scars, that is, exceptional eigenstates with observable expectation values that lie far from thermal values, and we show that these states are one-quasiparticle states. We argue that in the thermodynamic limit the eigenstates cover the entire area between two diverging lines: the line of one-quasiparticle states, whose direction is dictated by relativistic kinematics, and the thermal average line. Our results suggest that the strong version of the ETH is violated in any relativistic QFT whose spectrum admits a quasiparticle description.</description>
