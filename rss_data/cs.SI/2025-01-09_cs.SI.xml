      <title>Resource Allocation for the Training of Image Semantic Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication is a new paradigm that aims at providing more efficient communication for the next-generation wireless network. It focuses on transmitting extracted, meaningful information instead of the raw data. However, deep learning-enabled image semantic communication models often require a significant amount of time and energy for training, which is unacceptable, especially for mobile devices. To solve this challenge, our paper first introduces a distributed image semantic communication system where the base station and local devices will collaboratively train the models for uplink communication. Furthermore, we formulate a joint optimization problem to balance time and energy consumption on the local devices during training while ensuring effective model performance. An adaptable resource allocation algorithm is proposed to meet requirements under different scenarios, and its time complexity, solution quality, and convergence are thoroughly analyzed. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm in resource allocation optimization against existing benchmarks and discuss its impact on the performance of image semantic communication systems.</description>

      <title>Not All Bonds Are Created Equal: Dyadic Latent Class Models for Relational Event Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic social networks can be conceptualized as sequences of dyadic interactions between individuals over time. The relational event model has been the workhorse to analyze such interaction sequences in empirical social network research. When addressing possible unobserved heterogeneity in the interaction mechanisms, standard approaches, such as the stochastic block model, aim to cluster the variation at the actor level. Though useful, the implied latent structure of the adjacency matrix is restrictive which may lead to biased interpretations and insights. To address this shortcoming, we introduce a more flexible dyadic latent class relational event model (DLC-REM) that captures the unobserved heterogeneity at the dyadic level. Through numerical simulations, we provide a proof of concept demonstrating that this approach is more general than latent actor-level approaches. To illustrate the applicability of the model, we apply it to a dataset of militarized interstate conflicts between countries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The climatic change is one of the serious concerns nowadays. The impacts of climate change are global in scope and unprecedented in scale. Moreover, a small perturbation in climatic changes affects not only the pristine ecosystem but also the socioeconomic sectors. Specifically, the affect of climatic changes is related to frequent casualties. This makes it essential to dwelve deeper into analyzing the socio-climatic trends and variability. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of India's climatic trends, emphasizing on regional variations and specifically delving into the unique climate of Delhi. Specifically, this research unveils the temporal and spatial variations in temperature patterns by amalgamating extensive datasets encompassing India's diverse landscapes. The study uses advanced statistical tools and methodologies to scrutinize temperature's annual and seasonal variability. The insights drawn from this rigorous analysis may offer invaluable contributions to regional planning strategies, adaptive measures, and informed decision-making amidst the complex impacts of climate change. By bridging the gap between broader climatic trends and localized impacts, this research aims to facilitate more effective measures to mitigate and adapt to the multifaceted challenges of climate change, ensuring a more nuanced and tailored approaches. We utilized the Mann-Kendall test and Theil-Sen's slope estimator to analyze the trends and variability of the climatic conditions over the decades. The results demonstrate that temperature variations have increased over 0.58oC on average over the last decade. Moreover, over last decade the variability of Indian states shows that Lakshadweep faced the highest change (0.87oC), highlighting coastal vulnerability, while Tripura observed the least change of 0.07oC.</description>

      <title>A Digital Shadow for Modeling, Studying and Preventing Urban Crime</title>

Abstract: Crime is one of the greatest threats to urban security. Around 80 percent of the world's population lives in countries with high levels of criminality. Most of the crimes committed in the cities take place in their urban environments. This paper presents the development and validation of a digital shadow platform for modeling and simulating urban crime. This digital shadow has been constructed using data-driven agent-based modeling and simulation techniques, which are suitable for capturing dynamic interactions among individuals and with their environment. Our approach transforms and integrates well-known criminological theories and the expert knowledge of law enforcement agencies (LEA), policy makers, and other stakeholders under a theoretical model, which is in turn combined with real crime, spatial (cartographic) and socio-economic data into an urban model characterizing the daily behavior of citizens. The digital shadow has also been instantiated for the city of Malaga, for which we had over 300,000 complaints available. This instance has been calibrated with those complaints and other geographic and socio-economic information of the city. To the best of our knowledge, our digital shadow is the first for large urban areas that has been calibrated with a large dataset of real crime reports and with an accurate representation of the urban environment. The performance indicators of the model after being calibrated, in terms of the metrics widely used in predictive policing, suggest that our simulated crime generation matches the general pattern of crime in the city according to historical data. Our digital shadow platform could be an interesting tool for modeling and predicting criminal behavior in an urban environment on a daily basis and, thus, a useful tool for policy makers, criminologists, sociologists, LEAs, etc. to study and prevent urban crime.</description>

      <title>Network-Based Video Recommendation Using Viewing Patterns and Modularity Analysis: An Integrated Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of video-on-demand (VOD) services has led to a paradox of choice, overwhelming users with vast content libraries and revealing limitations in current recommender systems. This research introduces a novel approach by combining implicit user data, such as viewing percentages, with social network analysis to enhance personalization in VOD platforms. The methodology constructs user-item interaction graphs based on viewing patterns and applies centrality measures (degree, closeness, and betweenness) to identify important videos. Modularity-based clustering groups related content, enabling personalized recommendations. The system was evaluated on a documentary-focused VOD platform with 328 users over four months. Results showed significant improvements: a 63% increase in click-through rate (CTR), a 24% increase in view completion rate, and a 17% improvement in user satisfaction. The approach outperformed traditional methods like Naive Bayes and SVM. Future research should explore advanced techniques, such as matrix factorization models, graph neural networks, and hybrid approaches combining content-based and collaborative filtering. Additionally, incorporating temporal models and addressing scalability challenges for large-scale platforms are essential next steps. This study contributes to the state of the art by introducing modularity-based clustering and ego-centric ranking methods to enhance personalization in video recommendations. The findings suggest that integrating network-based features and implicit feedback can significantly improve user engagement, offering a cost-effective solution for VOD platforms to enhance recommendation quality.</description>

      <title>Simulating Relational Event Histories: Why and How</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19329v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many important social phenomena are characterized by repeated interactions among individuals over time such as email exchanges in an organization or face-to-face interactions in a classroom. To understand the underlying mechanisms of social interaction dynamics, statistical simulation techniques of longitudinal network data on a fine temporal granularity are crucially important. This paper makes two contributions to the field. First, we present statistical frameworks to simulate relational event networks under dyadic and actor-oriented relational event models which are implemented in a new R package 'remulate'. Second, we explain how the simulation framework can be used to address challenging problems in temporal social network analysis, such as model fit assessment, theory building, network intervention planning, making predictions, understanding the impact of network structures, to name a few. This is shown in three extensive case studies. In the first study, it is elaborated why simulation-based techniques are crucial for relational event model assessment which is illustrated for a network of criminal gangs. In the second study, it is shown how simulation techniques are important when building and extending theories about social phenomena which is illustrated via optimal distinctiveness theory. In the third study, we demonstrate how simulation techniques contribute to a better understanding of the longevity and the potential effect sizes of network interventions. Through these case studies and software, researchers will be able to better understand social interaction dynamics using relational event data from real-life networks.</description>

      <title>Kaleidoscopic reorganization of network communities across different scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of structural heterogeneity is pervasive in real networks, and their community organization is no exception. Still, a vast majority of community detection methods assume neatly hierarchically organized communities of a characteristic scale for a given hierarchical level. In this work, we demonstrate that the reality of scale-dependent community reorganization is convoluted with simultaneous processes of community splitting and merging, challenging the conventional understanding of community-scale adjustment. We provide a mathematical argument concerning the modularity function, the results from real-network analysis, and a simple network model for a comprehensive understanding of the nontrivial community reorganization process. The reorganization is characterized by a local drop in the number of communities as the resolution parameter varies. This study suggests a need for a paradigm shift in the study of network communities, which emphasizes the importance of considering scale-dependent reorganization to better understand the genuine structural organization of networks.</description>

      <title>Evidence of equilibrium dynamics in human social networks evolving in time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How do networks of relationships evolve over time? We analyse a dataset tracking the social interactions of 900 individuals over four years. Despite continuous shifts in individual relationships, the macroscopic structural properties of the network remain stable, fluctuating within predictable bounds. We connect this stability to the concept of equilibrium in statistical physics. Specifically, we demonstrate that the probabilities governing network dynamics are stationary over time, and key features like degree, edge, and triangle abundances align with theoretical predictions from equilibrium dynamics. Moreover, the dynamics satisfies the detailed balance condition. Remarkably, equilibrium persists despite constant turnover as people join, leave, and change connections. This suggests that equilibrium arises not from specific individuals but from the balancing act of human needs, cognitive limits, and social pressures. Practically, this equilibrium simplifies data collection, supports methods relying on single network snapshots (like Exponential Random Graph Models), and aids in designing interventions for social challenges. Theoretically, it offers new insights into collective human behaviour, revealing how emergent properties of complex social systems can be captured by simple mathematical models.</description>

      <title>Garbage in Garbage out: Impacts of data quality on criminal network intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Criminal networks such as human trafficking rings are threats to the rule of law, democracy and public safety in our global society. Network science provides invaluable tools to identify key players and design interventions for Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs), e.g., to dismantle their organisation. However, poor data quality and the adaptiveness of criminal networks through self-organization make effective disruption extremely challenging. Although there exists a large body of work building and applying network scientific tools to attack criminal networks, these work often implicitly assume that the network measurements are accurate and complete. Moreover, there is thus far no comprehensive understanding of the impacts of data quality on the downstream effectiveness of interventions. This work investigates the relationship between data quality and intervention effectiveness based on classical graph theoretic and machine learning-based approaches. Decentralization emerges as a major factor in network robustness, particularly under conditions of incomplete data, which renders attack strategies largely ineffective. Moreover, the robustness of centralized networks can be boosted using simple heuristics, making targeted attack more infeasible. Consequently, we advocate for a more cautious application of network science in disrupting criminal networks, the continuous development of an interoperable intelligence ecosystem, and the creation of novel network inference techniques to address data quality challenges.</description>
