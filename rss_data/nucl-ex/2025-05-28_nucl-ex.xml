      <title>Improved direct measurement of low-energy resonances in the $^{21}$Ne(p,$\gamma$)$^{22}$Na reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the nova temperature range, 0.1 GK $&lt; T &lt;$ 0.4 GK, several low-energy resonances dominate the $^{21}$Ne(p,$\gamma$)$^{22}$Na reaction rate, which is currently affected by large uncertainties. We present a high-precision study of the resonances at $E^{\rm{lab}}_{\rm{r}}$ = 127.3, 271.4, 272.3, 291.5, and 352.6 keV, measured directly at the Laboratory for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics in Italy. The strengths of the 127.3, 271.4, and 291.5 keV resonances are consistent with previous measurements within 1$\sigma$. However, for the 272.3 keV and 352.6 keV resonances, we report strength values of (129.9 $\pm$ 5.8) meV and (14.9 $\pm$ 0.8) meV, respectively, more than a factor of 1.5 higher than literature values. In addition, we report on new branching ratios for the 127.3, 272.3, and 352.6 keV resonances, leading to updated decay schemes. Finally, we present a revised thermonuclear reaction rate and investigate its impact on the NeNa nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the $ppp$ correlation function within the hyperspherical adiabatic basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computation of the three-particle correlation function involving three hadrons started just recently after the first publications of ALICE measurements. Key elements to be considered are the correct description of the asymptotics, antisymmetrization issues and, in most cases, the treatment of the Coulomb interaction. In the case of the $ppp$ correlation function, a first analysis was done where the hyperspherical adiabatic method was used to determine the $ppp$ wave function at different energies. Although the asymptotic behavior, antisymmetrization issues and the treatment of the Coulomb interaction were discussed in detail, the convergence properties of the adiabatic basis were studied at low energies around the formation of the correlation peak determined mainly by the $J^\pi=1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$ three-body states. Since many and very precise data have been taken or are planned to be measured at energies beyond the peak, we present an analysis of the convergence characteristics of the basis as the energy of the process increases. We show that in order to describe correctly the correlation tail it is necessary to consider three-body states up to $J^\pi=21/2^-$ whereas higher states can be considered as free. Once those states are incorporated solving the associate dynamical equations, the agreement with the experimental data is found to be excellent.</description>

      <title>Community input to the European Strategy on particle physics: Searches for Permanent Electric Dipole Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searches for electric dipole moments (EDMs) in fundamental particles and quantum systems with spin are pivotal experiments at the intersection of low-energy and high-precision particle physics. These investigations offer a complementary pathway to uncovering new physics beyond the Standard Model, parallel to high-energy collider searches. EDM experiments are among the most sensitive probes for detecting non-standard time-reversal (T) symmetry violations and, via the CPT theorem, CP-violation (CPV). Current EDM measurements test new physics at mass scales in or above the 10TeV to 100TeV range. This community input to the European Particle Physics Strategy Update highlights the status of the field, and describes challenges and opportunities in Europe.</description>

      <title>Probing nuclear structure in relativistic p-O and O-O collisions at the LHC through the measurement of anisotropic flow coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RHIC and LHC plan to inject $^{16}\rm O$ nuclei with a focus to investigate collectivity and the origin of quark-gluon plasma signatures in small collision systems. $^{16}\rm O$ nuclei is known to possess clusters of $\alpha$-particles ($^{4}\rm He$) inside the nucleus. In this paper, we study the anisotropic flow coefficients such as elliptic flow ($v_2$) and triangular flow ($v_3$), which are sensitive to the nuclear geometry of colliding nuclei, for p-O and O-O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=9.61$ TeV and 7 TeV respectively. The study is performed employing a hybrid model encompassing IPGlasma + MUSIC + iSS + UrQMD. The results of the clustered nuclear geometry are compared with those of the Woods-Saxon nuclear profile. Both initial and final state anisotropies are explored. This study is thus one of its first kind, where the study of anisotropic flow coefficients for p-O and O-O collisions is presented using a hybrid hydrodynamics model. We find a small effect of $\alpha$-clustering in p-O, while a significant one for O-O collisions. It is also observed that the magnitude of the effect correlates with the size of the $^{4}$He.</description>

      <title>Ab initio no-core shell-model study of $^{20-23}$Na isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17893v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have done a systematic no-core shell-model study of $^{20-23}$Na isotopes. The low-energy spectra of these sodium isotopes consisting of natural and un-natural parity states were reported, considering three realistic interactions: inside nonlocal outside Yukawa (INOY), charge-dependent Bonn 2000 (CDB2K), and the chiral next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO). We also present the mirror energy differences in the low-energy spectra of $|T_z|$ = 1/2 mirror pair ($^{21}$Na - $^{21}$Ne). Apart from the energy spectra, we have also reported the electromagnetic transition strengths and moments. Finally, considering all three realistic interactions, we report the point-proton radii and neutron skin thicknesses.</description>

      <title>Impact of strong magnetic field, baryon chemical potential, and medium anisotropy on polarization and spin alignment of hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent observation of global spin polarization of $\Lambda$ ($\bar{\Lambda}$) hyperons and the spin alignment of $\phi$ and $K^{*0}$ vector mesons create remarkable interest in investigating the particle polarization in the relativistic fluid produced in heavy-ion collisions at GeV/TeV energies. Among other sources of spin polarization phenomena, the Debye mass of a medium plays a crucial role in particle polarization. Any modification brought to the effective mass due to the temperature, strong magnetic field ($eB$), baryonic chemical potential ($\mu_{B}$), medium anisotropy ($\xi$), and vorticity, etc., certainly affects the particle spin polarization. In this work, we explore the global hyperon spin polarization and the spin alignment of vector mesons corresponding to the strong magnetic field, baryonic chemical potential, and medium anisotropy. We find that the degree of spin polarization is flavor-dependent for hyperons. Meanwhile, vector meson spin alignment depends on the hadronization mechanisms of initially polarized quarks and anti-quarks. Medium anisotropy significantly changes the degree of spin polarization compared to the magnetic field and baryon chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic emission from strongly interacting hadronic and partonic matter created in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05253v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate dilepton production in heavy-ion, proton-proton, and proton-nucleus collisions from low energies of 1 AGeV (SIS) to ultra-relativistic energies (LHC) using the Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach. PHSD is a microscopic, non-equilibrium approach that integrates hadronic and partonic degrees of freedom, providing a comprehensive description of relativistic heavy-ion collisions from initial nucleon-nucleon interactions to quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation, hadronization, and final-state interactions. Key dilepton sources in PHSD include hadronic decays, bremsstrahlung, QGP radiation ($q+\bar q \to e^+e^-$, \ $q+\bar q \to g+ e^+e^-$, \ $q+g \to q+ e^+e^-$), primary Drell-Yan production, and semileptonic decays of correlated charm and bottom pairs. PHSD well describes dilepton data from HADES, STAR, and ALICE experiments. We examine in-medium effects, such as the vector meson spectral function broadening, and present the excitation function for the dilepton "excess" in the invariant mass range $0.4&lt;M_{ee}&lt;0.75$ GeV/c$^2$. For the first time we report on the baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$-dependence of the QGP radiation calculated on a basis of the Dynamical-Quasi-Particle Model (DQPM) in PHSD. The influence of $\mu_B$ on the QGP yield grows at lower collision energies, where $\mu_B$ becomes large, however, its impact on the total dilepton spectra is small due to the lowering of the QGP volume with decreasing energy. The excitation function of QGP dileptons, is presented versus correlated charm, confirming that the QGP radiation overshines charm contributions at $\sqrt{s} \simeq 25-30$ GeV in central Au+Au collisions, providing access to thermal QGP dileptons at BES RHIC and FAIR.</description>
