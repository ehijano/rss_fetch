      <title>Simultaneous Inference of Effective Range Parameters and EFT Truncation Uncertainty in $^{3}$He-$\alpha$ Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend previous halo effective field theory analyses of low-energy elastic scattering of $^{3}$He-$^{4}$He, including the $\frac{7}{2}^{-}$ $f$-wave resonance as an explicit degree of freedom. The presence of this resonance necessitates a changing power counting scheme depending on the kinematic region. Therefore, we construct a theory uncertainty model at the partial wave amplitude level, allowing us to generate a sophisticated theory covariance matrix that captures the way the theory error structure changes as energy increases. We then perform a Bayesian analysis and simultaneously estimate the joint posterior distributions of the effective range theory parameters and the parameters that characterize the effective field theory truncation uncertainty. We compare two different analyses: no $f$-wave interactions for data up to $E_{\text{max}} = 2.6$ MeV, and including $f$-wave interactions for data up to $E_{\text{max}} = 5.5$ MeV. The inferred breakdown scales in each analysis are consistent with previous work. We find that $f$-wave interactions are needed to describe data for $E_{lab} \gtrapprox 3.6$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Deuteron yields near the QCD phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of QCD phase transition and critical fluctuations of the critical end point (CEP) on the deuteron yield within the functional renormalization group (fRG) approach, by using the nucleon coalescence model and a low energy effective field theory of quarks and mesons. It is found that the two-point baryon density correlation function is enhanced in a narrow region radiated from the CEP along the phase boundary. The deuteron yield arising from the two-point baryon correlation is small compared to the leading-order contribution, which is attributed to the fact that in the regime of low collision energy, i.e., the region of large baryon chemical potential, the freeze-out curves deviate from the critical region, resulting in that the enhancement of the deuteron yield stemming from the critical fluctuations near the CEP is mild.</description>

      <title>A Bottom-Up EFT Approach To Superdense Baryonic Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How to arrive at the densest matter in massive compact stars starting from Walecka's linear $\omega$-$\sigma$ mean-field model is described in a series of arguments anchored on hidden local symmetry, hidden scale symmetry and emergent parity-doublet symmetry. I follow the bottom-up approach from chiral symmetry with pions, coupled to hidden local and scale symmetry degrees of freedom. Exploiting the renormalization-group treatment \`a la Shankar and Polchinski of the fermionic interactions on the Fermi sphere, leading to Landau-Migdal Fermi-liquid, one obtains a sort of generalized ``Density Functional" that allows via a topology change hadrons transform to quarks without phase changes at the center of massive stars. The highly dense matter is ``pseudo-conformal" with the sound velocity $v_{pcs}^2/c^2\approx 1/3$ but the trace of the energy-momentum tensor is not equal to zero, hence the matter is non-conformal.</description>

      <title>Enhanced antineutrino emission from $\beta$ decay in core-collapse supernovae with self-consistent weak decay rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear weak-interaction rates are known to exert a prominent effect in the late-stages of stellar collapse. Despite their importance, most studies to date on core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) have focused primarily on the effects of electron captures, generally neglecting $\beta$ decay contributions. In this Letter, we present the first CCSNe simulation incorporating global $\beta$ decay rates from a microscopic theory. These are enabled by a large-scale evaluation of both electron capture and $\beta$ decay rates, obtained self-consistently utilizing the relativistic energy density functional theory and finite-temperature quasiparticle random-phase approximation. We find a significant enhancement of antineutrino emissivity by more than 4 orders of magnitude due to the inclusion of $\beta$ decay rates, as well as 3 orders of magnitude for antineutrino luminosity. It is expected that these new rates could help us constrain the model uncertainties related to weak-interaction processes, improving the prediction of antineutrino signal during the final stages of stellar death and potentially influencing the late-stage evolution of massive stars.</description>

      <title>Effects of a first-order QCD phase transition on light nucleus production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using an extended Polyakov-looped Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model to describe the baryon density fluctuations of quark matter along the isentropic trajectories corresponding to different $s/\rho_B$ values extracted from Au+Au collisions at energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7-200$ GeV, we investigate the effects of the first-order phase transition on the light nucleus yield ratio $N_t \times N_p/N_d^2$. The results indicate that the second-order scaled density moment $y_2$, used to quantify density fluctuations, rapidly increases to form a peak when the isentropic trajectories pass through the phase coexistence region. We extract the yield ratios $N_t\times N_p/N_d^2$ at chemical freeze-out from the isentropic trajectories at different collision energies and found significant enhancements at 19.6 GeV and 27 GeV. This is similar to the trends observed by the STAR experiment, suggesting that the enhancements in the yield ratios $N_t\times N_p/N_d^2$ observed in the STAR experiment could be explained by the density fluctuations generated in the first-order phase transition region.</description>

      <title>Long-Range $N-J/\psi$ Interaction from an Operator Product Expansion Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04980v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent lattice QCD study has shown that the $N-J/\psi$ potential is attractive at all distances, and its long-range tail is well described by two-pion exchange. Here, we study to what extent the long-range part of the attraction can be reproduced from the perspective of the operator product expansion (OPE). This is accomplished by extracting the leading-order four-quark operator that couples to two pions and calculating its contribution to the $J/\psi$ mass in nuclear matter, to linear order in density, within the QCD sum rule framework. Using previous estimates of the four-quark operators for the chiral symmetric and breaking parts, we obtain a mass decrease that is smaller in magnitude but qualitatively consistent with the attraction obtained in the lattice QCD calculation. By expressing the interaction in terms of four-quark operators, we can analyze the effects of chiral symmetry restoration in dense matter on the masses of the $J/\psi$ and other mesons composed of heavy quarks.</description>

      <title>Ab initio computations of the fourth-order charge density moments of $^{48}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron skins of neutron-rich nuclei connect nuclei with the matter in neutron stars. High-precision measurements of nuclear charge densities to extract higher-order moments are proposed to be sensitive to neutron radii and skin thicknesses. We investigate the charge density of $^{48}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb, leading candidates for such studies, with ab initio nuclear structure calculations. We find strong correlations between the fourth-order charge density moment $R_\mathrm{ch}^4$ and the charge and neutron radii, allowing us to predict $R_\mathrm{ch}^4$ for $^{48}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb. We find a substantially weaker correlation between the fourth-order charge density moment and the neutron skin, limiting the ability of high-precision electron scattering to determine the neutron skin in a model-independent manner.</description>

      <title>A Continuous Galactic Line Source of Axions: The Remarkable Case of 23Na</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that $^{23}$Na is a potentially significant source of galactic axions. For temperatures $\gtrsim 7 \times 10^8$K -- characteristic of carbon burning in the massive progenitors of supernovae and ONeMg white dwarfs -- the 440 keV first excited state of $^{23}$Na is thermally populated, with its repeated decays pumping stellar energy into escaping axions. Odd-A nuclear abundances are typically very low in high-temperature stellar environments (or absent entirely due to burn-up). $^{23}$Na is an exception: $\approx 0.1 M_\odot$ of the isotope is synthesized during carbon burning then maintained at $\approx 10^9$K for times ranging up to $6 \times 10^4$y. Using MESA simulations, a galactic model, and sampling over progenitor masses, locations, and evolutionary stages, we find a continuous flux at earth of $\langle \phi_a \rangle \approx 22$/cm$^2$s for $g^\mathrm{eff}_{aNN} = 10^{-9}$. Some fraction of these axions convert to photons as they propagate through the galactic magnetic field, producing a distinctive 440 keV line $\gamma$ ray detectable by all-sky detectors like the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI). Assuming a 1$\mu$G galactic magnetic field and a sufficiently light axion mass, we find that COSI will be able to probe $| g_{aNN}^\mathrm{eff} g_{a \gamma \gamma} | \gtrsim1.8 \times 10^{-22}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at $3\sigma$ after two years of surveying.</description>

      <title>Meson-Exchange Currents in Quasielastic Charged-Current Neutrino Reactions with Single-Nucleon Knockout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effect of meson-exchange currents on charged-current quasielastic neutrino scattering with single-nucleon emission is computed and analyzed within the relativistic Fermi gas model. This contribution arises primarily from the interference between one-body and two-body currents, where the two-body operator excites a 1p1h state in the presence of a second, spectator nucleon. The results obtained show a reduction of the vector, axial and vector-axial transverse response functions and, consequently, a decrease in the total neutrino cross section. In addition to a comparison with the non-relativistic limit, other models are also explored, such as the relativistic mean field model for nuclear matter and the superscaling analysis with relativistic effective mass, both of which yield qualitatively similar results.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to superallowed beta decays at $\mathcal O(\alpha^2 Z)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute $\mathcal O(\alpha^2 Z)$ radiative corrections to superallowed $\beta$ decays with a heavy-particle effective field theory that systematically describes the interactions of low-energy ultrasoft photons with nuclei. We calculate two-loop virtual and one-loop real-virtual amplitudes by reducing the Feynman integrals to a set of master integrals, which we solve analytically using a variety of techniques. These techniques can be applied to other phenomenologically interesting observables. The ultrasoft corrections can then be combined with contributions arising from the exchange of potential photons to obtain the complete $\mathcal O(\alpha^2 Z)$ correction to the decay rate, with resummation of large logarithms of the electron energy times the nuclear radius. We find that $\mathcal O(\alpha^2 Z)$ ultrasoft loops induce a relative correction to the decay rate that ranges from $0.7 \cdot 10^{-3}$ in the decay of $^{10}$C to $3.6 \cdot 10^{-3}$ in the decay of $^{54}$Co, and will thus impact the extraction of $V_{ud}$ at the permille level. We show that the inclusion of these corrections reduces the residual renormalization scale dependence of the decay rate to a negligible level, making missing ultrasoft perturbative corrections a subdominant source of theoretical error.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions with qubits and qumodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a hybrid qubit-qumode framework for simulating quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions. In this approach, fermionic matter fields are represented by qubits, while U(1) gauge fields are encoded in continuous-variable bosonic modes whose canonical quadratures capture the electric and vector-potential components of the theory. To reconcile the non-compact phase space of the qumodes with the compact U(1) gauge symmetry, we introduce and compare two complementary constraint-enforcement strategies: (i) a squeezing-based projection that confines qumode states to the unit circle through an effective modification of the inner product, and (ii) a method that dynamically enforces compactness via a penalty Hamiltonian term. We construct the corresponding hybrid Hamiltonian, derive its decomposition into experimentally accessible qubit-qumode gates, and analyze its spectrum in the analytically tractable single-plaquette limit. The hybrid formulation reproduces the correct gauge-invariant dynamics and provides a scalable route toward simulating Abelian lattice gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter on near-term hybrid quantum architectures. Ground-state preparation and convergence are demonstrated using a continuous-variable extension of the Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE) algorithm, establishing a general framework for hybrid discrete-continuous quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories.</description>
