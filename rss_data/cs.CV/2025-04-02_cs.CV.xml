      <title>Enhance Vision-based Tactile Sensors via Dynamic Illumination and Image Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-based tactile sensors use structured light to measure deformation in their elastomeric interface. Until now, vision-based tactile sensors such as DIGIT and GelSight have been using a single, static pattern of structured light tuned to the specific form factor of the sensor. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of dynamic illumination patterns, in conjunction with image fusion techniques, to improve the quality of sensing of vision-based tactile sensors. Specifically, we propose to capture multiple measurements, each with a different illumination pattern, and then fuse them together to obtain a single, higher-quality measurement. Experimental results demonstrate that this type of dynamic illumination yields significant improvements in image contrast, sharpness, and background difference. This discovery opens the possibility of retroactively improving the sensing quality of existing vision-based tactile sensors with a simple software update, and for new hardware designs capable of fully exploiting dynamic illumination.</description>

      <title>A Novel Distance-Based Metric for Quality Assessment in Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The assessment of segmentation quality plays a fundamental role in the development, optimization, and comparison of segmentation methods which are used in a wide range of applications. With few exceptions, quality assessment is performed using traditional metrics, which are based on counting the number of erroneous pixels but do not capture the spatial distribution of errors. Established distance-based metrics such as the average Hausdorff distance are difficult to interpret and compare for different methods and datasets. In this paper, we introduce the Surface Consistency Coefficient (SCC), a novel distance-based quality metric that quantifies the spatial distribution of errors based on their proximity to the surface of the structure. Through a rigorous analysis using synthetic data and real segmentation results, we demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of SCC in distinguishing errors near the surface from those further away. At the same time, SCC is easy to interpret and comparable across different structural contexts.</description>

      <title>Skeletonization Quality Evaluation: Geometric Metrics for Point Cloud Analysis in Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skeletonization is a powerful tool for shape analysis, rooted in the inherent instinct to understand an object's morphology. It has found applications across various domains, including robotics. Although skeletonization algorithms have been studied in recent years, their performance is rarely quantified with detailed numerical evaluations. This work focuses on defining and quantifying geometric properties to systematically score the skeletonization results of point cloud shapes across multiple aspects, including topological similarity, boundedness, centeredness, and smoothness. We introduce these representative metric definitions along with a numerical scoring framework to analyze skeletonization outcomes concerning point cloud data for different scenarios, from object manipulation to mobile robot navigation. Additionally, we provide an open-source tool to enable the research community to evaluate and refine their skeleton models. Finally, we assess the performance and sensitivity of the proposed geometric evaluation methods from various robotic applications.</description>

      <title>ViT-Linearizer: Distilling Quadratic Knowledge into Linear-Time Vision Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have delivered remarkable progress through global self-attention, yet their quadratic complexity can become prohibitive for high-resolution inputs. In this work, we present ViT-Linearizer, a cross-architecture distillation framework that transfers rich ViT representations into a linear-time, recurrent-style model. Our approach leverages 1) activation matching, an intermediate constraint that encourages student to align its token-wise dependencies with those produced by the teacher, and 2) masked prediction, a contextual reconstruction objective that requires the student to predict the teacher's representations for unseen (masked) tokens, to effectively distill the quadratic self-attention knowledge into the student while maintaining efficient complexity. Empirically, our method provides notable speedups particularly for high-resolution tasks, significantly addressing the hardware challenges in inference. Additionally, it also elevates Mamba-based architectures' performance on standard vision benchmarks, achieving a competitive 84.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with a base-sized model. Our results underscore the good potential of RNN-based solutions for large-scale visual tasks, bridging the gap between theoretical efficiency and real-world practice.</description>

      <title>Chapter-Llama: Efficient Chaptering in Hour-Long Videos with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the task of video chaptering, i.e., partitioning a long video timeline into semantic units and generating corresponding chapter titles. While relatively underexplored, automatic chaptering has the potential to enable efficient navigation and content retrieval in long-form videos. In this paper, we achieve strong chaptering performance on hour-long videos by efficiently addressing the problem in the text domain with our 'Chapter-Llama' framework. Specifically, we leverage a pretrained large language model (LLM) with large context window, and feed as input (i) speech transcripts and (ii) captions describing video frames, along with their respective timestamps. Given the inefficiency of exhaustively captioning all frames, we propose a lightweight speech-guided frame selection strategy based on speech transcript content, and experimentally demonstrate remarkable advantages. We train the LLM to output timestamps for the chapter boundaries, as well as free-form chapter titles. This simple yet powerful approach scales to processing one-hour long videos in a single forward pass. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements (e.g., 45.3 vs 26.7 F1 score) over the state of the art on the recent VidChapters-7M benchmark. To promote further research, we release our code and models at our project page.</description>

      <title>SuperEvent: Cross-Modal Learning of Event-based Keypoint Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event-based keypoint detection and matching holds significant potential, enabling the integration of event sensors into highly optimized Visual SLAM systems developed for frame cameras over decades of research. Unfortunately, existing approaches struggle with the motion-dependent appearance of keypoints and the complex noise prevalent in event streams, resulting in severely limited feature matching capabilities and poor performance on downstream tasks. To mitigate this problem, we propose SuperEvent, a data-driven approach to predict stable keypoints with expressive descriptors. Due to the absence of event datasets with ground truth keypoint labels, we leverage existing frame-based keypoint detectors on readily available event-aligned and synchronized gray-scale frames for self-supervision: we generate temporally sparse keypoint pseudo-labels considering that events are a product of both scene appearance and camera motion. Combined with our novel, information-rich event representation, we enable SuperEvent to effectively learn robust keypoint detection and description in event streams. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of SuperEvent by its integration into a modern sparse keypoint and descriptor-based SLAM framework originally developed for traditional cameras, surpassing the state-of-the-art in event-based SLAM by a wide margin. Source code and multimedia material are available at smartroboticslab.github.io/SuperEvent.</description>

      <title>Towards Precise Action Spotting: Addressing Temporal Misalignment in Labels with Dynamic Label Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise action spotting has attracted considerable attention due to its promising applications. While existing methods achieve substantial performance by employing well-designed model architecture, they overlook a significant challenge: the temporal misalignment inherent in ground-truth labels. This misalignment arises when frames labeled as containing events do not align accurately with the actual event times, often as a result of human annotation errors or the inherent difficulties in precisely identifying event boundaries across neighboring frames. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel dynamic label assignment strategy that allows predictions to have temporal offsets from ground-truth action times during training, ensuring consistent event spotting. Our method extends the concept of minimum-cost matching, which is utilized in the spatial domain for object detection, to the temporal domain. By calculating matching costs based on predicted action class scores and temporal offsets, our method dynamically assigns labels to the most likely predictions, even when the predicted times of these predictions deviate from ground-truth times, alleviating the negative effects of temporal misalignment in labels. We conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in conditions where events are visually distinct and temporal misalignment in labels is common.</description>

      <title>Few-Shot Generation of Brain Tumors for Secure and Fair Data Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging multi-center data for medical analytics presents challenges due to privacy concerns and data heterogeneity. While distributed approaches such as federated learning has gained traction, they remain vulnerable to privacy breaches, particularly in sensitive domains like medical imaging. Generative models, such as diffusion models, enhance privacy by synthesizing realistic data. However, they are prone to memorization, especially when trained on small datasets. This study proposes a decentralized few-shot generative model (DFGM) to synthesize brain tumor images while fully preserving privacy. DFGM harmonizes private tumor data with publicly shareable healthy images from multiple medical centers, constructing a new dataset by blending tumor foregrounds with healthy backgrounds. This approach ensures stringent privacy protection and enables controllable, high-quality synthesis by preserving both the healthy backgrounds and tumor foregrounds. We assess DFGM's effectiveness in brain tumor segmentation using a UNet, achieving Dice score improvements of 3.9% for data augmentation and 4.6% for fairness on a separate dataset.</description>

      <title>SonarSplat: Novel View Synthesis of Imaging Sonar via Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present SonarSplat, a novel Gaussian splatting framework for imaging sonar that demonstrates realistic novel view synthesis and models acoustic streaking phenomena. Our method represents the scene as a set of 3D Gaussians with acoustic reflectance and saturation properties. We develop a novel method to efficiently rasterize learned Gaussians to produce a range/azimuth image that is faithful to the acoustic image formation model of imaging sonar. In particular, we develop a novel approach to model azimuth streaking in a Gaussian splatting framework. We evaluate SonarSplat using real-world datasets of sonar images collected from an underwater robotic platform in a controlled test tank and in a real-world river environment. Compared to the state-of-the-art, SonarSplat offers improved image synthesis capabilities (+2.5 dB PSNR). We also demonstrate that SonarSplat can be leveraged for azimuth streak removal and 3D scene reconstruction.</description>

      <title>SAVeD: Learning to Denoise Low-SNR Video for Improved Downstream Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models excel at vision tasks in natural images but fail in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) videos, such as underwater sonar, ultrasound, and microscopy. We introduce Spatiotemporal Augmentations and denoising in Video for Downstream Tasks (SAVeD), a self-supervised method that denoises low-SNR sensor videos and is trained using only the raw noisy data. By leveraging differences in foreground and background motion, SAVeD enhances object visibility using an encoder-decoder with a temporal bottleneck. Our approach improves classification, detection, tracking, and counting, outperforming state-of-the-art video denoising methods with lower resource requirements.

      <title>Self-Evolving Visual Concept Library using Vision-Language Critics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of building a visual concept library for visual recognition. Building effective visual concept libraries is challenging, as manual definition is labor-intensive, while relying solely on LLMs for concept generation can result in concepts that lack discriminative power or fail to account for the complex interactions between them. Our approach, ESCHER, takes a library learning perspective to iteratively discover and improve visual concepts. ESCHER uses a vision-language model (VLM) as a critic to iteratively refine the concept library, including accounting for interactions between concepts and how they affect downstream classifiers. By leveraging the in-context learning abilities of LLMs and the history of performance using various concepts, ESCHER dynamically improves its concept generation strategy based on the VLM critic's feedback. Finally, ESCHER does not require any human annotations, and is thus an automated plug-and-play framework. We empirically demonstrate the ability of ESCHER to learn a concept library for zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning visual classification tasks. This work represents, to our knowledge, the first application of concept library learning to real-world visual tasks.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Diffusion Model and Image Foundation Model for Improved Correspondence Matching in Coronary Angiography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate correspondence matching in coronary angiography images is crucial for reconstructing 3D coronary artery structures, which is essential for precise diagnosis and treatment planning of coronary artery disease (CAD). Traditional matching methods for natural images often fail to generalize to X-ray images due to inherent differences such as lack of texture, lower contrast, and overlapping structures, compounded by insufficient training data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pipeline that generates realistic paired coronary angiography images using a diffusion model conditioned on 2D projections of 3D reconstructed meshes from Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA), providing high-quality synthetic data for training. Additionally, we employ large-scale image foundation models to guide feature aggregation, enhancing correspondence matching accuracy by focusing on semantically relevant regions and keypoints. Our approach demonstrates superior matching performance on synthetic datasets and effectively generalizes to real-world datasets, offering a practical solution for this task. Furthermore, our work investigates the efficacy of different foundation models in correspondence matching, providing novel insights into leveraging advanced image foundation models for medical imaging applications.</description>

      <title>SmartScan: An AI-based Interactive Framework for Automated Region Extraction from Satellite Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of a continuous methane monitoring system requires determining the optimal number and placement of fixed sensors. However, planning is labor-intensive, requiring extensive site setup and iteration to meet client restrictions. This challenge is amplified when evaluating multiple sites, limiting scalability. To address this, we introduce SmartScan, an AI framework that automates data extraction for optimal sensor placement. SmartScan identifies subspaces of interest from satellite images using an interactive tool to create facility-specific constraint sets efficiently. SmartScan leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a prompt-based transformer for zero-shot segmentation, enabling subspace extraction without explicit training. It operates in two modes: (1) Data Curation Mode, where satellite images are processed to extract high-quality subspaces using an interactive prompting system for SAM, and (2) Autonomous Mode, where user-curated prompts train a deep learning network to replace manual prompting, fully automating subspace extraction. The interactive tool also serves for quality control, allowing users to refine AI-generated outputs and generate additional constraint sets as needed. With its AI-driven prompting mechanism, SmartScan delivers high-throughput, high-quality subspace extraction with minimal human intervention, enhancing scalability and efficiency. Notably, its adaptable design makes it suitable for extracting regions of interest from ultra-high-resolution satellite imagery across various domains.</description>

      <title>RailGoerl24: G\"orlitz Rail Test Center CV Dataset 2024</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driverless train operation for open tracks on urban guided transport and mainline railways requires, among other things automatic detection of actual and potential obstacles, especially humans, in the danger zone of the train's path. Machine learning algorithms have proven to be powerful state-of-the-art tools for this task. However, these algorithms require large amounts of high-quality annotated data containing human beings in railway-specific environments as training data. Unfortunately, the amount of publicly available datasets is not yet sufficient and is significantly inferior to the datasets in the road domain. Therefore, this paper presents RailGoerl24, an on-board visual light Full HD camera dataset of 12205 frames recorded in a railway test center of T\"UV S\"UD Rail, in G\"orlitz, Germany. Its main purpose is to support the development of driverless train operation for guided transport. RailGoerl24 also includes a terrestrial LiDAR scan covering parts of the area used to acquire the RGB data. In addition to the raw data, the dataset contains 33556 boxwise annotations in total for the object class 'person'. The faces of recorded actors are not blurred or altered in any other way. RailGoerl24, soon available at data.fid-move.de/dataset/railgoerl24, can also be used for tasks beyond collision prediction.</description>

      <title>LITA-GS: Illumination-Agnostic Novel View Synthesis via Reference-Free 3D Gaussian Splatting and Physical Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00219</link>

Abstract: Directly employing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) on images with adverse illumination conditions exhibits considerable difficulty in achieving high-quality, normally-exposed representations due to: (1) The limited Structure from Motion (SfM) points estimated in adverse illumination scenarios fail to capture sufficient scene details; (2) Without ground-truth references, the intensive information loss, significant noise, and color distortion pose substantial challenges for 3DGS to produce high-quality results; (3) Combining existing exposure correction methods with 3DGS does not achieve satisfactory performance due to their individual enhancement processes, which lead to the illumination inconsistency between enhanced images from different viewpoints. To address these issues, we propose LITA-GS, a novel illumination-agnostic novel view synthesis method via reference-free 3DGS and physical priors. Firstly, we introduce an illumination-invariant physical prior extraction pipeline. Secondly, based on the extracted robust spatial structure prior, we develop the lighting-agnostic structure rendering strategy, which facilitates the optimization of the scene structure and object appearance. Moreover, a progressive denoising module is introduced to effectively mitigate the noise within the light-invariant representation. We adopt the unsupervised strategy for the training of LITA-GS and extensive experiments demonstrate that LITA-GS surpasses the state-of-the-art (SOTA) NeRF-based method while enjoying faster inference speed and costing reduced training time.

      <title>MultiMorph: On-demand Atlas Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MultiMorph, a fast and efficient method for constructing anatomical atlases on the fly. Atlases capture the canonical structure of a collection of images and are essential for quantifying anatomical variability across populations. However, current atlas construction methods often require days to weeks of computation, thereby discouraging rapid experimentation. As a result, many scientific studies rely on suboptimal, precomputed atlases from mismatched populations, negatively impacting downstream analyses. MultiMorph addresses these challenges with a feedforward model that rapidly produces high-quality, population-specific atlases in a single forward pass for any 3D brain dataset, without any fine-tuning or optimization. MultiMorph is based on a linear group-interaction layer that aggregates and shares features within the group of input images. Further, by leveraging auxiliary synthetic data, MultiMorph generalizes to new imaging modalities and population groups at test-time. Experimentally, MultiMorph outperforms state-of-the-art optimization-based and learning-based atlas construction methods in both small and large population settings, with a 100-fold reduction in time. This makes MultiMorph an accessible framework for biomedical researchers without machine learning expertise, enabling rapid, high-quality atlas generation for diverse studies.</description>

      <title>NeRF-Based defect detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of industrial automation has highlighted the need for precise and efficient defect detection in large-scale machinery. Traditional inspection techniques, involving manual procedures such as scaling tall structures for visual evaluation, are labor-intensive, subjective, and often hazardous. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces an automated defect detection framework built on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and the concept of digital twins. The system utilizes UAVs to capture images and reconstruct 3D models of machinery, producing both a standard reference model and a current-state model for comparison. Alignment of the models is achieved through the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm, enabling precise point cloud analysis to detect deviations that signify potential defects. By eliminating manual inspection, this method improves accuracy, enhances operational safety, and offers a scalable solution for defect detection. The proposed approach demonstrates great promise for reliable and efficient industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Transductive One-Shot Learning Meet Subspace Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-shot learning focuses on adapting pretrained models to recognize newly introduced and unseen classes based on a single labeled image. While variations of few-shot and zero-shot learning exist, one-shot learning remains a challenging yet crucial problem due to its ability to generalize knowledge to unseen classes from just one human-annotated image. In this paper, we introduce a transductive one-shot learning approach that employs subspace decomposition to utilize the information from labeled images in the support set and unlabeled images in the query set. These images are decomposed into a linear combination of latent variables representing primitives captured by smaller subspaces. By representing images in the query set as linear combinations of these latent primitives, we can propagate the label from a single image in the support set to query images that share similar combinations of primitives. Through a comprehensive quantitative analysis across various neural network feature extractors and datasets, we demonstrate that our approach can effectively generalize to novel classes from just one labeled image.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Global-Local Representation with Augmented Spatial Guidance for Zero-Shot Referring Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in zero-shot referring image segmentation (RIS), driven by models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and CLIP, have made substantial progress in aligning visual and textual information. Despite these successes, the extraction of precise and high-quality mask region representations remains a critical challenge, limiting the full potential of RIS tasks. In this paper, we introduce a training-free, hybrid global-local feature extraction approach that integrates detailed mask-specific features with contextual information from the surrounding area, enhancing mask region representation. To further strengthen alignment between mask regions and referring expressions, we propose a spatial guidance augmentation strategy that improves spatial coherence, which is essential for accurately localizing described areas. By incorporating multiple spatial cues, this approach facilitates more robust and precise referring segmentation. Extensive experiments on standard RIS benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing zero-shot RIS models, achieving substantial performance gains. We believe our approach advances RIS tasks and establishes a versatile framework for region-text alignment, offering broader implications for cross-modal understanding and interaction.

      <title>Spatiotemporal Attention Learning Framework for Event-Driven Object Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event-based vision sensors, inspired by biological neural systems, asynchronously capture local pixel-level intensity changes as a sparse event stream containing position, polarity, and timestamp information. These neuromorphic sensors offer significant advantages in dynamic range, latency, and power efficiency. Their working principle inherently addresses traditional camera limitations such as motion blur and redundant background information, making them particularly suitable for dynamic vision tasks. While recent works have proposed increasingly complex event-based architectures, the computational overhead and parameter complexity of these approaches limit their practical deployment. This paper presents a novel spatiotemporal learning framework for event-based object recognition, utilizing a VGG network enhanced with Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). Our approach achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art ResNet-based methods while reducing parameter count by 2.3% compared to the original VGG model. Specifically, it outperforms ResNet-based methods like MVF-Net, achieving the highest Top-1 accuracy of 76.4% (pretrained) and 71.3% (not pretrained) on CIFAR10-DVS, and 72.4% (not pretrained) on N-Caltech101. These results highlight the robustness of our method when pretrained weights are not used, making it suitable for scenarios where transfer learning is unavailable. Moreover, our approach reduces reliance on data augmentation. Experimental results on standard event-based datasets demonstrate the framework's efficiency and effectiveness for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>CamoSAM2: Motion-Appearance Induced Auto-Refining Prompts for Video Camouflaged Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), a prompt-guided video foundation model, has remarkably performed in video object segmentation, drawing significant attention in the community. Due to the high similarity between camouflaged objects and their surroundings, which makes them difficult to distinguish even by the human eye, the application of SAM2 for automated segmentation in real-world scenarios faces challenges in camouflage perception and reliable prompts generation. To address these issues, we propose CamoSAM2, a motion-appearance prompt inducer (MAPI) and refinement framework to automatically generate and refine prompts for SAM2, enabling high-quality automatic detection and segmentation in VCOD task. Initially, we introduce a prompt inducer that simultaneously integrates motion and appearance cues to detect camouflaged objects, delivering more accurate initial predictions than existing methods. Subsequently, we propose a video-based adaptive multi-prompts refinement (AMPR) strategy tailored for SAM2, aimed at mitigating prompt error in initial coarse masks and further producing good prompts. Specifically, we introduce a novel three-step process to generate reliable prompts by camouflaged object determination, pivotal prompting frame selection, and multi-prompts formation. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed model, CamoSAM2, significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving increases of 8.0% and 10.1% in mIoU metric. Additionally, our method achieves the fastest inference speed compared to current VCOD models.</description>

      <title>MPDrive: Improving Spatial Understanding with Marker-Based Prompt Learning for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving visual question answering (AD-VQA) aims to answer questions related to perception, prediction, and planning based on given driving scene images, heavily relying on the model's spatial understanding capabilities. Prior works typically express spatial information through textual representations of coordinates, resulting in semantic gaps between visual coordinate representations and textual descriptions. This oversight hinders the accurate transmission of spatial information and increases the expressive burden. To address this, we propose a novel Marker-based Prompt learning framework (MPDrive), which represents spatial coordinates by concise visual markers, ensuring linguistic expressive consistency and enhancing the accuracy of both visual perception and spatial expression in AD-VQA. Specifically, we create marker images by employing a detection expert to overlay object regions with numerical labels, converting complex textual coordinate generation into straightforward text-based visual marker predictions. Moreover, we fuse original and marker images as scene-level features and integrate them with detection priors to derive instance-level features. By combining these features, we construct dual-granularity visual prompts that stimulate the LLM's spatial perception capabilities. Extensive experiments on the DriveLM and CODA-LM datasets show that MPDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in cases requiring sophisticated spatial understanding.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Flow Diffusion for Efficient Frame Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most recent diffusion-based methods still show a large gap compared to non-diffusion methods for video frame interpolation, in both accuracy and efficiency. Most of them formulate the problem as a denoising procedure in latent space directly, which is less effective caused by the large latent space. We propose to model bilateral optical flow explicitly by hierarchical diffusion models, which has much smaller search space in the denoising procedure. Based on the flow diffusion model, we then use a flow-guided images synthesizer to produce the final result. We train the flow diffusion model and the image synthesizer end to end. Our method achieves state of the art in accuracy, and 10+ times faster than other diffusion-based methods. The project page is at: https://hfd-interpolation.github.io.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic-feature-guided 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving systems. However, LiDAR point clouds may appear to have sparsity, uneven distribution, and incomplete structures, significantly limiting the detection performance. In road driving environments, target objects referring to vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists are well-suited for enhancing representation through the complete template guidance, considering their grid and topological structures. Therefore, this paper presents an intrinsic-feature-guided 3D object detection method based on a template-assisted feature enhancement module, which extracts intrinsic features from relatively generalized templates and provides rich structural information for foreground objects. Furthermore, a proposal-level contrastive learning mechanism is designed to enhance the feature differences between foreground and background objects. The proposed modules can act as plug-and-play components and improve the performance of multiple existing methods. Extensive experiments illustrate that the proposed method achieves the highly competitive detection results. Code will be available at https://github.com/zhangwanjingjj/IfgNet.git.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Contrast Information for Efficient Document Shadow Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Document shadows are a major obstacle in the digitization process. Due to the dense information in text and patterns covered by shadows, document shadow removal requires specialized methods. Existing document shadow removal methods, although showing some progress, still rely on additional information such as shadow masks or lack generalization and effectiveness across different shadow scenarios. This often results in incomplete shadow removal or loss of original document content and tones. Moreover, these methods tend to underutilize the information present in the original shadowed document image. In this paper, we refocus our approach on the document images themselves, which inherently contain rich information.We propose an end-to-end document shadow removal method guided by contrast representation, following a coarse-to-fine refinement approach. By extracting document contrast information, we can effectively and quickly locate shadow shapes and positions without the need for additional masks. This information is then integrated into the refined shadow removal process, providing better guidance for network-based removal and feature fusion. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Scene4U: Hierarchical Layered 3D Scene Reconstruction from Single Panoramic Image for Your Immerse Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reconstruction of immersive and realistic 3D scenes holds significant practical importance in various fields of computer vision and computer graphics. Typically, immersive and realistic scenes should be free from obstructions by dynamic objects, maintain global texture consistency, and allow for unrestricted exploration. The current mainstream methods for image-driven scene construction involves iteratively refining the initial image using a moving virtual camera to generate the scene. However, previous methods struggle with visual discontinuities due to global texture inconsistencies under varying camera poses, and they frequently exhibit scene voids caused by foreground-background occlusions. To this end, we propose a novel layered 3D scene reconstruction framework from panoramic image, named Scene4U. Specifically, Scene4U integrates an open-vocabulary segmentation model with a large language model to decompose a real panorama into multiple layers. Then, we employs a layered repair module based on diffusion model to restore occluded regions using visual cues and depth information, generating a hierarchical representation of the scene. The multi-layer panorama is then initialized as a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation, followed by layered optimization, which ultimately produces an immersive 3D scene with semantic and structural consistency that supports free exploration. Scene4U outperforms state-of-the-art method, improving by 24.24% in LPIPS and 24.40% in BRISQUE, while also achieving the fastest training speed. Additionally, to demonstrate the robustness of Scene4U and allow users to experience immersive scenes from various landmarks, we build WorldVista3D dataset for 3D scene reconstruction, which contains panoramic images of globally renowned sites. The implementation code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/LongHZ140516/Scene4U .</description>

      <title>AP-CAP: Advancing High-Quality Data Synthesis for Animal Pose Estimation via a Controllable Image Generation Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of 2D animal pose estimation plays a crucial role in advancing deep learning applications in animal behavior analysis and ecological research. Despite notable progress in some existing approaches, our study reveals that the scarcity of high-quality datasets remains a significant bottleneck, limiting the full potential of current methods. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Controllable Image Generation Pipeline for synthesizing animal pose estimation data, termed AP-CAP. Within this pipeline, we introduce a Multi-Modal Animal Image Generation Model capable of producing images with expected poses. To enhance the quality and diversity of the generated data, we further propose three innovative strategies: (1) Modality-Fusion-Based Animal Image Synthesis Strategy to integrate multi-source appearance representations, (2) Pose-Adjustment-Based Animal Image Synthesis Strategy to dynamically capture diverse pose variations, and (3) Caption-Enhancement-Based Animal Image Synthesis Strategy to enrich visual semantic understanding. Leveraging the proposed model and strategies, we create the MPCH Dataset (Modality-Pose-Caption Hybrid), the first hybrid dataset that innovatively combines synthetic and real data, establishing the largest-scale multi-source heterogeneous benchmark repository for animal pose estimation to date. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in improving both the performance and generalization capability of animal pose estimators.</description>

      <title>SPF-Portrait: Towards Pure Portrait Customization with Semantic Pollution-Free Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While fine-tuning pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) models on portrait datasets enables attribute customization, existing methods suffer from Semantic Pollution that compromises the original model's behavior and prevents incremental learning. To address this, we propose SPF-Portrait, a pioneering work to purely understand customized semantics while eliminating semantic pollution in text-driven portrait customization. In our SPF-Portrait, we propose a dual-path pipeline that introduces the original model as a reference for the conventional fine-tuning path. Through contrastive learning, we ensure adaptation to target attributes and purposefully align other unrelated attributes with the original portrait. We introduce a novel Semantic-Aware Fine Control Map, which represents the precise response regions of the target semantics, to spatially guide the alignment process between the contrastive paths. This alignment process not only effectively preserves the performance of the original model but also avoids over-alignment. Furthermore, we propose a novel response enhancement mechanism to reinforce the performance of target attributes, while mitigating representation discrepancy inherent in direct cross-modal supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPF-Portrait achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Low Light Enhancement via Joint Global-Local Illumination Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Images captured under real-world low-light conditions face significant challenges due to uneven ambient lighting, making it difficult for existing end-to-end methods to enhance images with a large dynamic range to normal exposure levels. To address the above issue, we propose a novel brightness-adaptive enhancement framework designed to tackle the challenge of local exposure inconsistencies in real-world low-light images. Specifically, our proposed framework comprises two components: the Local Contrast Enhancement Network (LCEN) and the Global Illumination Guidance Network (GIGN). We introduce an early stopping mechanism in the LCEN and design a local discriminative module, which adaptively perceives the contrast of different areas in the image to control the premature termination of the enhancement process for patches with varying exposure levels. Additionally, within the GIGN, we design a global attention guidance module that effectively models global illumination by capturing long-range dependencies and contextual information within the image, which guides the local contrast enhancement network to significantly improve brightness across different regions. Finally, in order to coordinate the LCEN and GIGN, we design a novel training strategy to facilitate the training process. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior quantitative and qualitative results compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Beyond Wide-Angle Images: Unsupervised Video Portrait Correction via Spatiotemporal Diffusion Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide-angle cameras, despite their popularity for content creation, suffer from distortion-induced facial stretching-especially at the edge of the lens-which degrades visual appeal. To address this issue, we propose an image portrait correction framework using diffusion models named ImagePD. It integrates the long-range awareness of transformer and multi-step denoising of diffusion models into a unified framework, achieving global structural robustness and local detail refinement. Besides, considering the high cost of obtaining video labels, we then repurpose ImagePD for unlabeled wide-angle videos (termed VideoPD), by spatiotemporal diffusion adaption with spatial consistency and temporal smoothness constraints. For the former, we encourage the denoised image to approximate pseudo labels following the wide-angle distortion distribution pattern, while for the latter, we derive rectification trajectories with backward optical flows and smooth them. Compared with ImagePD, VideoPD maintains high-quality facial corrections in space and mitigates the potential temporal shakes sequentially. Finally, to establish an evaluation benchmark and train the framework, we establish a video portrait dataset with a large diversity in people number, lighting conditions, and background. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform existing solutions quantitatively and qualitatively, contributing to high-fidelity wide-angle videos with stable and natural portraits. The codes and dataset will be available.</description>

      <title>NCAP: Scene Text Image Super-Resolution with Non-CAtegorical Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scene text image super-resolution (STISR) enhances the resolution and quality of low-resolution images. Unlike previous studies that treated scene text images as natural images, recent methods using a text prior (TP), extracted from a pre-trained text recognizer, have shown strong performance. However, two major issues emerge: (1) Explicit categorical priors, like TP, can negatively impact STISR if incorrect. We reveal that these explicit priors are unstable and propose replacing them with Non-CAtegorical Prior (NCAP) using penultimate layer representations. (2) Pre-trained recognizers used to generate TP struggle with low-resolution images. To address this, most studies jointly train the recognizer with the STISR network to bridge the domain gap between low- and high-resolution images, but this can cause an overconfidence phenomenon in the prior modality. We highlight this issue and propose a method to mitigate it by mixing hard and soft labels. Experiments on the TextZoom dataset demonstrate an improvement by 3.5%, while our method significantly enhances generalization performance by 14.8\% across four text recognition datasets. Our method generalizes to all TP-guided STISR networks.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Assist Computer Education? an Empirical Case Study of DeepSeek</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an empirical case study to assess the efficacy and reliability of DeepSeek-V3, an emerging large language model, within the context of computer education. The evaluation employs both CCNA simulation questions and real-world inquiries concerning computer network security posed by Chinese network engineers. To ensure a thorough evaluation, diverse dimensions are considered, encompassing role dependency, cross-linguistic proficiency, and answer reproducibility, accompanied by statistical analysis. The findings demonstrate that the model performs consistently, regardless of whether prompts include a role definition or not. In addition, its adaptability across languages is confirmed by maintaining stable accuracy in both original and translated datasets. A distinct contrast emerges between its performance on lower-order factual recall tasks and higher-order reasoning exercises, which underscores its strengths in retrieving information and its limitations in complex analytical tasks. Although DeepSeek-V3 offers considerable practical value for network security education, challenges remain in its capability to process multimodal data and address highly intricate topics. These results provide valuable insights for future refinement of large language models in specialized professional environments.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Power of Pre-trained Encoders for Universal Adversarial Attack Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a critical security threat to real-world AI systems by injecting human-imperceptible perturbations into benign samples to induce misclassification in deep learning models. While existing detection methods, such as Bayesian uncertainty estimation and activation pattern analysis, have achieved progress through feature engineering, their reliance on handcrafted feature design and prior knowledge of attack patterns limits generalization capabilities and incurs high engineering costs. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a lightweight adversarial detection framework based on the large-scale pre-trained vision-language model CLIP. Departing from conventional adversarial feature characterization paradigms, we innovatively adopt an anomaly detection perspective. By jointly fine-tuning CLIP's dual visual-text encoders with trainable adapter networks and learnable prompts, we construct a compact representation space tailored for natural images. Notably, our detection architecture achieves substantial improvements in generalization capability across both known and unknown attack patterns compared to traditional methods, while significantly reducing training overhead. This study provides a novel technical pathway for establishing a parameter-efficient and attack-agnostic defense paradigm, markedly enhancing the robustness of vision systems against evolving adversarial threats.</description>

      <title>Data Synthesis with Diverse Styles for Face Recognition via 3DMM-Guided Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identity-preserving face synthesis aims to generate synthetic face images of virtual subjects that can substitute real-world data for training face recognition models. While prior arts strive to create images with consistent identities and diverse styles, they face a trade-off between them. Identifying their limitation of treating style variation as subject-agnostic and observing that real-world persons actually have distinct, subject-specific styles, this paper introduces MorphFace, a diffusion-based face generator. The generator learns fine-grained facial styles, e.g., shape, pose and expression, from the renderings of a 3D morphable model (3DMM). It also learns identities from an off-the-shelf recognition model. To create virtual faces, the generator is conditioned on novel identities of unlabeled synthetic faces, and novel styles that are statistically sampled from a real-world prior distribution. The sampling especially accounts for both intra-subject variation and subject distinctiveness. A context blending strategy is employed to enhance the generator's responsiveness to identity and style conditions. Extensive experiments show that MorphFace outperforms the best prior arts in face recognition efficacy.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fundus Image-based Glaucoma Screening via Dynamic Global-Local Feature Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancements in medical artificial intelligence (AI), fundus image classifiers are increasingly being applied to assist in ophthalmic diagnosis. While existing classification models have achieved high accuracy on specific fundus datasets, they struggle to address real-world challenges such as variations in image quality across different imaging devices, discrepancies between training and testing images across different racial groups, and the uncertain boundaries due to the characteristics of glaucomatous cases. In this study, we aim to address the above challenges posed by image variations by highlighting the importance of incorporating comprehensive fundus image information, including the optic cup (OC) and optic disc (OD) regions, and other key image patches. Specifically, we propose a self-adaptive attention window that autonomously determines optimal boundaries for enhanced feature extraction. Additionally, we introduce a multi-head attention mechanism to effectively fuse global and local features via feature linear readout, improving the model's discriminative capability. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior accuracy and robustness in glaucoma classification.</description>

      <title>DecoFuse: Decomposing and Fusing the "What", "Where", and "How" for Brain-Inspired fMRI-to-Video Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding visual experiences from brain activity is a significant challenge. Existing fMRI-to-video methods often focus on semantic content while overlooking spatial and motion information. However, these aspects are all essential and are processed through distinct pathways in the brain. Motivated by this, we propose DecoFuse, a novel brain-inspired framework for decoding videos from fMRI signals. It first decomposes the video into three components - semantic, spatial, and motion - then decodes each component separately before fusing them to reconstruct the video. This approach not only simplifies the complex task of video decoding by decomposing it into manageable sub-tasks, but also establishes a clearer connection between learned representations and their biological counterpart, as supported by ablation studies. Further, our experiments show significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving 82.4% accuracy for semantic classification, 70.6% accuracy in spatial consistency, a 0.212 cosine similarity for motion prediction, and 21.9% 50-way accuracy for video generation. Additionally, neural encoding analyses for semantic and spatial information align with the two-streams hypothesis, further validating the distinct roles of the ventral and dorsal pathways. Overall, DecoFuse provides a strong and biologically plausible framework for fMRI-to-video decoding. Project page: https://chongjg.github.io/DecoFuse/.</description>

      <title>ADGaussian: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting for Autonomous Driving with Multi-modal Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach, termed ADGaussian, for generalizable street scene reconstruction. The proposed method enables high-quality rendering from single-view input. Unlike prior Gaussian Splatting methods that primarily focus on geometry refinement, we emphasize the importance of joint optimization of image and depth features for accurate Gaussian prediction. To this end, we first incorporate sparse LiDAR depth as an additional input modality, formulating the Gaussian prediction process as a joint learning framework of visual information and geometric clue. Furthermore, we propose a multi-modal feature matching strategy coupled with a multi-scale Gaussian decoding model to enhance the joint refinement of multi-modal features, thereby enabling efficient multi-modal Gaussian learning. Extensive experiments on two large-scale autonomous driving datasets, Waymo and KITTI, demonstrate that our ADGaussian achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits superior zero-shot generalization capabilities in novel-view shifting.</description>

      <title>Suite-IN++: A FlexiWear BodyNet Integrating Global and Local Motion Features from Apple Suite for Robust Inertial Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of wearable technology has established multi-device ecosystems comprising smartphones, smartwatches, and headphones as critical enablers for ubiquitous pedestrian localization. However, traditional pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) struggles with diverse motion modes, while data-driven methods, despite improving accuracy, often lack robustness due to their reliance on a single-device setup. Therefore, a promising solution is to fully leverage existing wearable devices to form a flexiwear bodynet for robust and accurate pedestrian localization. This paper presents Suite-IN++, a deep learning framework for flexiwear bodynet-based pedestrian localization. Suite-IN++ integrates motion data from wearable devices on different body parts, using contrastive learning to separate global and local motion features. It fuses global features based on the data reliability of each device to capture overall motion trends and employs an attention mechanism to uncover cross-device correlations in local features, extracting motion details helpful for accurate localization. To evaluate our method, we construct a real-life flexiwear bodynet dataset, incorporating Apple Suite (iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods) across diverse walking modes and device configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that Suite-IN++ achieves superior localization accuracy and robustness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models in real-life pedestrian tracking scenarios.</description>

      <title>FA^{3}-CLIP: Frequency-Aware Cues Fusion and Attack-Agnostic Prompt Learning for Unified Face Attack Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Facial recognition systems are vulnerable to physical (e.g., printed photos) and digital (e.g., DeepFake) face attacks. Existing methods struggle to simultaneously detect physical and digital attacks due to: 1) significant intra-class variations between these attack types, and 2) the inadequacy of spatial information alone to comprehensively capture live and fake cues. To address these issues, we propose a unified attack detection model termed Frequency-Aware and Attack-Agnostic CLIP (FA\textsuperscript{3}-CLIP), which introduces attack-agnostic prompt learning to express generic live and fake cues derived from the fusion of spatial and frequency features, enabling unified detection of live faces and all categories of attacks. Specifically, the attack-agnostic prompt module generates generic live and fake prompts within the language branch to extract corresponding generic representations from both live and fake faces, guiding the model to learn a unified feature space for unified attack detection. Meanwhile, the module adaptively generates the live/fake conditional bias from the original spatial and frequency information to optimize the generic prompts accordingly, reducing the impact of intra-class variations. We further propose a dual-stream cues fusion framework in the vision branch, which leverages frequency information to complement subtle cues that are difficult to capture in the spatial domain. In addition, a frequency compression block is utilized in the frequency stream, which reduces redundancy in frequency features while preserving the diversity of crucial cues. We also establish new challenging protocols to facilitate unified face attack detection effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves performance in detecting physical and digital face attacks, achieving state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <title>Distilling Multi-view Diffusion Models into 3D Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00457v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce DD3G, a formulation that Distills a multi-view Diffusion model (MV-DM) into a 3D Generator using gaussian splatting. DD3G compresses and integrates extensive visual and spatial geometric knowledge from the MV-DM by simulating its ordinary differential equation (ODE) trajectory, ensuring the distilled generator generalizes better than those trained solely on 3D data. Unlike previous amortized optimization approaches, we align the MV-DM and 3D generator representation spaces to transfer the teacher's probabilistic flow to the student, thus avoiding inconsistencies in optimization objectives caused by probabilistic sampling. The introduction of probabilistic flow and the coupling of various attributes in 3D Gaussians introduce challenges in the generation process. To tackle this, we propose PEPD, a generator consisting of Pattern Extraction and Progressive Decoding phases, which enables efficient fusion of probabilistic flow and converts a single image into 3D Gaussians within 0.06 seconds. Furthermore, to reduce knowledge loss and overcome sparse-view supervision, we design a joint optimization objective that ensures the quality of generated samples through explicit supervision and implicit verification. Leveraging existing 2D generation models, we compile 120k high-quality RGBA images for distillation. Experiments on synthetic and public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

      <title>Mixture-of-Attack-Experts with Class Regularization for Unified Physical-Digital Face Attack Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Facial recognition systems in real-world scenarios are susceptible to both digital and physical attacks. Previous methods have attempted to achieve classification by learning a comprehensive feature space. However, these methods have not adequately accounted for the inherent characteristics of physical and digital attack data, particularly the large intra class variation in attacks and the small inter-class variation between live and fake faces. To address these limitations, we propose the Fine-Grained MoE with Class-Aware Regularization CLIP framework (FG-MoE-CLIP-CAR), incorporating key improvements at both the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, we employ a Soft Mixture of Experts (Soft MoE) architecture to leverage different experts for specialized feature processing. Additionally, we refine the Soft MoE to capture more subtle differences among various types of fake faces. At the loss level, we introduce two constraint modules: the Disentanglement Module (DM) and the Cluster Distillation Module (CDM). The DM enhances class separability by increasing the distance between the centers of live and fake face classes. However, center-to-center constraints alone are insufficient to ensure distinctive representations for individual features. Thus, we propose the CDM to further cluster features around their respective class centers while maintaining separation from other classes. Moreover, specific attacks that significantly deviate from common attack patterns are often overlooked. To address this issue, our distance calculation prioritizes more distant features. Experimental results on two unified physical-digital attack datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Collaborative Advantage of Low-level Information on Generalizable AI-Generated Image Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing state-of-the-art AI-Generated image detection methods mostly consider extracting low-level information from RGB images to help improve the generalization of AI-Generated image detection, such as noise patterns. However, these methods often consider only a single type of low-level information, which may lead to suboptimal generalization. Through empirical analysis, we have discovered a key insight: different low-level information often exhibits generalization capabilities for different types of forgeries. Furthermore, we found that simple fusion strategies are insufficient to leverage the detection advantages of each low-level and high-level information for various forgery types. Therefore, we propose the Adaptive Low-level Experts Injection (ALEI) framework. Our approach introduces Lora Experts, enabling the backbone network, which is trained with high-level semantic RGB images, to accept and learn knowledge from different low-level information. We utilize a cross-attention method to adaptively fuse these features at intermediate layers. To prevent the backbone network from losing the modeling capabilities of different low-level features during the later stages of modeling, we developed a Low-level Information Adapter that interacts with the features extracted by the backbone network. Finally, we propose Dynamic Feature Selection, which dynamically selects the most suitable features for detecting the current image to maximize generalization detection capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, finetuned on only four categories of mainstream ProGAN data, performs excellently and achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets containing unseen GAN and Diffusion methods.</description>

      <title>4th PVUW MeViS 3rd Place Report: Sa2VA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) is a challenging task that requires the model to segment the object in a video given the language description. MeViS is a recently proposed dataset that contains motion expressions of the target objects, leading to a challenging benchmark, compared with existing RVOS benchmarks. On the other hand, for referring expression tasks, a new trend is to adopt multi-modal large language model (MLLM) to achieve better image and text alignment. In this report, we show that with a simple modification to the test time inference method on stronger MLLMs, we can lead to stronger results on MeVIS. In particular, we adopt the recent method Sa2VA, a unified model for dense grounded understanding of both images and videos. By enlarging the scope of key frames, without any further training, we can achieve the 3rd place in the 4th PVUW workshop.</description>

      <title>FSSUWNet: Mitigating the Fragility of Pre-trained Models with Feature Enhancement for Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation in Underwater Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (FSS), which focuses on segmenting new classes in images using only a limited number of annotated examples, has recently progressed in data-scarce domains. However, in this work, we show that the existing FSS methods often struggle to generalize to underwater environments. Specifically, the prior features extracted by pre-trained models used as feature extractors are fragile due to the unique challenges of underwater images. To address this, we propose FSSUWNet, a tailored FSS framework for underwater images with feature enhancement. FSSUWNet exploits the integration of complementary features, emphasizing both low-level and high-level image characteristics. In addition to employing a pre-trained model as the primary encoder, we propose an auxiliary encoder called Feature Enhanced Encoder which extracts complementary features to better adapt to underwater scene characteristics. Furthermore, a simple and effective Feature Alignment Module aims to provide global prior knowledge and align low-level features with high-level features in dimensions. Given the scarcity of underwater images, we introduce a cross-validation dataset version based on the Segmentation of Underwater Imagery dataset. Extensive experiments on public underwater segmentation datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. For example, our method outperforms the previous best method by 2.8% and 2.6% in terms of the mean Intersection over Union metric for 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios in the datasets, respectively. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/lizhh268/FSSUWNet.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Attention Networks for Lossless Point Cloud Attribute Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a deep hierarchical attention context model for lossless attribute compression of point clouds, leveraging a multi-resolution spatial structure and residual learning. A simple and effective Level of Detail (LoD) structure is introduced to yield a coarse-to-fine representation. To enhance efficiency, points within the same refinement level are encoded in parallel, sharing a common context point group. By hierarchically aggregating information from neighboring points, our attention model learns contextual dependencies across varying scales and densities, enabling comprehensive feature extraction. We also adopt normalization for position coordinates and attributes to achieve scale-invariant compression. Additionally, we segment the point cloud into multiple slices to facilitate parallel processing, further optimizing time complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method offers better coding performance than the latest G-PCC for color and reflectance attributes while maintaining more efficient encoding and decoding runtimes.</description>

      <title>SCFANet: Style Distribution Constraint Feature Alignment Network For Pathological Staining Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining serves as a valuable technique for detecting specific antigens or proteins through antibody-mediated visualization. However, the IHC staining process is both time-consuming and costly. To address these limitations, the application of deep learning models for direct translation of cost-effective Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) stained images into IHC stained images has emerged as an efficient solution. Nevertheless, the conversion from H&amp;E to IHC images presents significant challenges, primarily due to alignment discrepancies between image pairs and the inherent diversity in IHC staining style patterns. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Style Distribution Constraint Feature Alignment Network (SCFANet), which incorporates two innovative modules: the Style Distribution Constrainer (SDC) and Feature Alignment Learning (FAL). The SDC ensures consistency between the generated and target images' style distributions while integrating cycle consistency loss to maintain structural consistency. To mitigate the complexity of direct image-to-image translation, the FAL module decomposes the end-to-end translation task into two subtasks: image reconstruction and feature alignment. Furthermore, we ensure pathological consistency between generated and target images by maintaining pathological pattern consistency and Optical Density (OD) uniformity. Extensive experiments conducted on the Breast Cancer Immunohistochemical (BCI) dataset demonstrate that our SCFANet model outperforms existing methods, achieving precise transformation of H&amp;E-stained images into their IHC-stained counterparts. The proposed approach not only addresses the technical challenges in H&amp;E to IHC image translation but also provides a robust framework for accurate and efficient stain conversion in pathological analysis.</description>

      <title>Learned Image Compression with Dictionary-based Entropy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learned image compression methods have attracted great research interest and exhibited superior rate-distortion performance to the best classical image compression standards of the present. The entropy model plays a key role in learned image compression, which estimates the probability distribution of the latent representation for further entropy coding. Most existing methods employed hyper-prior and auto-regressive architectures to form their entropy models. However, they only aimed to explore the internal dependencies of latent representation while neglecting the importance of extracting prior from training data. In this work, we propose a novel entropy model named Dictionary-based Cross Attention Entropy model, which introduces a learnable dictionary to summarize the typical structures occurring in the training dataset to enhance the entropy model. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed model strikes a better balance between performance and latency, achieving state-of-the-art results on various benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>ShortV: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models by Freezing Visual Tokens in Ineffective Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from high computational costs due to their massive size and the large number of visual tokens. In this paper, we investigate layer-wise redundancy in MLLMs by introducing a novel metric, Layer Contribution (LC), which quantifies the impact of a layer's transformations on visual and text tokens, respectively. The calculation of LC involves measuring the divergence in model output that results from removing the layer's transformations on the specified tokens. Our pilot experiment reveals that many layers of MLLMs exhibit minimal contribution during the processing of visual tokens. Motivated by this observation, we propose ShortV, a training-free method that leverages LC to identify ineffective layers, and freezes visual token updates in these layers. Experiments show that ShortV can freeze visual token in approximately 60\% of the MLLM layers, thereby dramatically reducing computational costs related to updating visual tokens. For example, it achieves a 50\% reduction in FLOPs on LLaVA-NeXT-13B while maintaining superior performance. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/icip-cas/ShortV</description>

      <title>High-Quality Pseudo-Label Generation Based on Visual Prompt Assisted Cloud Model Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating high-quality pseudo-labels on the cloud is crucial for cloud-edge object detection, especially in dynamic traffic monitoring where data distributions evolve. Existing methods often assume reliable cloud models, neglecting potential errors or struggling with complex distribution shifts. This paper proposes Cloud-Adaptive High-Quality Pseudo-label generation (CA-HQP), addressing these limitations by incorporating a learnable Visual Prompt Generator (VPG) and dual feature alignment into cloud model updates. The VPG enables parameter-efficient adaptation by injecting visual prompts, enhancing flexibility without extensive fine-tuning. CA-HQP mitigates domain discrepancies via two feature alignment techniques: global Domain Query Feature Alignment (DQFA) capturing scene-level shifts, and fine-grained Temporal Instance-Aware Feature Embedding Alignment (TIAFA) addressing instance variations. Experiments on the Bellevue traffic dataset demonstrate that CA-HQP significantly improves pseudo-label quality compared to existing methods, leading to notable performance gains for the edge model and showcasing CA-HQP's adaptation effectiveness. Ablation studies validate each component (DQFA, TIAFA, VPG) and the synergistic effect of combined alignment strategies, highlighting the importance of adaptive cloud updates and domain adaptation for robust object detection in evolving scenarios. CA-HQP provides a promising solution for enhancing cloud-edge object detection systems in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>SMILE: Infusing Spatial and Motion Semantics in Masked Video Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masked video modeling, such as VideoMAE, is an effective paradigm for video self-supervised learning (SSL). However, they are primarily based on reconstructing pixel-level details on natural videos which have substantial temporal redundancy, limiting their capability for semantic representation and sufficient encoding of motion dynamics. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel SSL approach for video representation learning, dubbed as SMILE, by infusing both spatial and motion semantics. In SMILE, we leverage image-language pretrained models, such as CLIP, to guide the learning process with their high-level spatial semantics. We enhance the representation of motion by introducing synthetic motion patterns in the training data, allowing the model to capture more complex and dynamic content. Furthermore, using SMILE, we establish a new self-supervised video learning paradigm capable of learning strong video representations without requiring any natural video data. We have carried out extensive experiments on 7 datasets with various downstream scenarios. SMILE surpasses current state-of-the-art SSL methods, showcasing its effectiveness in learning more discriminative and generalizable video representations.

      <title>Generalization-aware Remote Sensing Change Detection via Domain-agnostic Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Change detection has essential significance for the region's development, in which pseudo-changes between bitemporal images induced by imaging environmental factors are key challenges. Existing transformation-based methods regard pseudo-changes as a kind of style shift and alleviate it by transforming bitemporal images into the same style using generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, their efforts are limited by two drawbacks: 1) Transformed images suffer from distortion that reduces feature discrimination. 2) Alignment hampers the model from learning domain-agnostic representations that degrades performance on scenes with domain shifts from the training data. Therefore, oriented from pseudo-changes caused by style differences, we present a generalizable domain-agnostic difference learning network (DonaNet). For the drawback 1), we argue for local-level statistics as style proxies to assist against domain shifts. For the drawback 2), DonaNet learns domain-agnostic representations by removing domain-specific style of encoded features and highlighting the class characteristics of objects. In the removal, we propose a domain difference removal module to reduce feature variance while preserving discriminative properties and propose its enhanced version to provide possibilities for eliminating more style by decorrelating the correlation between features. In the highlighting, we propose a cross-temporal generalization learning strategy to imitate latent domain shifts, thus enabling the model to extract feature representations more robust to shifts actively. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that DonaNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods with a smaller model size and is more robust to domain shift.</description>

      <title>Efficient LLaMA-3.2-Vision by Trimming Cross-attended Visual Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual token reduction lowers inference costs caused by extensive image features in large vision-language models (LVLMs). Unlike relevant studies that prune tokens in self-attention-only LVLMs, our work uniquely addresses cross-attention-based models, which achieve superior performance. We identify that the key-value (KV) cache size for image tokens in cross-attention layers significantly exceeds that of text tokens in self-attention layers, posing a major compute bottleneck. To mitigate this issue, we exploit the sparse nature in cross-attention maps to selectively prune redundant visual features. Our Trimmed Llama effectively reduces KV cache demands without requiring additional training. By benefiting from 50%-reduced visual features, our model can reduce inference latency and memory usage while achieving benchmark parity.</description>

      <title>Archival Faces: Detection of Faces in Digitized Historical Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When digitizing historical archives, it is necessary to search for the faces of celebrities and ordinary people, especially in newspapers, link them to the surrounding text, and make them searchable. Existing face detectors on datasets of scanned historical documents fail remarkably -- current detection tools only achieve around $24\%$ mAP at $50:90\%$ IoU. This work compensates for this failure by introducing a new manually annotated domain-specific dataset in the style of the popular Wider Face dataset, containing 2.2k new images from digitized historical newspapers from the $19^{th}$ to $20^{th}$ century, with 11k new bounding-box annotations and associated facial landmarks. This dataset allows existing detectors to be retrained to bring their results closer to the standard in the field of face detection in the wild. We report several experimental results comparing different families of fine-tuned detectors against publicly available pre-trained face detectors and ablation studies of multiple detector sizes with comprehensive detection and landmark prediction performance results.</description>

      <title>AttentiveGRU: Recurrent Spatio-Temporal Modeling for Advanced Radar-Based BEV Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bird's-eye view (BEV) object detection has become important for advanced automotive 3D radar-based perception systems. However, the inherently sparse and non-deterministic nature of radar data limits the effectiveness of traditional single-frame BEV paradigms. In this paper, we addresses this limitation by introducing AttentiveGRU, a novel attention-based recurrent approach tailored for radar constraints, which extracts individualized spatio-temporal context for objects by dynamically identifying and fusing temporally correlated structures across present and memory states. By leveraging the consistency of object's latent representation over time, our approach exploits temporal relations to enrich feature representations for both stationary and moving objects, thereby enhancing detection performance and eliminating the need for externally providing or estimating any information about ego vehicle motion. Our experimental results on the public nuScenes dataset show a significant increase in mAP for the car category by 21% over the best radar-only submission. Further evaluations on an additional dataset demonstrate notable improvements in object detection capabilities, underscoring the applicability and effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Continual Cross-Modal Generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-modal generalization aims to learn a shared discrete representation space from multimodal pairs, enabling knowledge transfer across unannotated modalities. However, achieving a unified representation for all modality pairs requires extensive paired data, which is often impractical. Inspired by the availability of abundant bimodal data (e.g., in ImageBind), we explore a continual learning approach that incrementally maps new modalities into a shared discrete codebook via a mediator modality. We propose the Continual Mixture of Experts Adapter (CMoE-Adapter) to project diverse modalities into a unified space while preserving prior knowledge. To align semantics across stages, we introduce a Pseudo-Modality Replay (PMR) mechanism with a dynamically expanding codebook, enabling the model to adaptively incorporate new modalities using learned ones as guidance. Extensive experiments on image-text, audio-text, video-text, and speech-text show that our method achieves strong performance on various cross-modal generalization tasks. Code is provided in the supplementary material.</description>

      <title>Sample-level Adaptive Knowledge Distillation for Action Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) compresses neural networks by learning a small network (student) via transferring knowledge from a pre-trained large network (teacher). Many endeavours have been devoted to the image domain, while few works focus on video analysis which desires training much larger model making it be hardly deployed in resource-limited devices. However, traditional methods neglect two important problems, i.e., 1) Since the capacity gap between the teacher and the student exists, some knowledge w.r.t. difficult-to-transfer samples cannot be correctly transferred, or even badly affects the final performance of student, and 2) As training progresses, difficult-to-transfer samples may become easier to learn, and vice versa. To alleviate the two problems, we propose a Sample-level Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (SAKD) framework for action recognition. In particular, it mainly consists of the sample distillation difficulty evaluation module and the sample adaptive distillation module. The former applies the temporal interruption to frames, i.e., randomly dropout or shuffle the frames during training, which increases the learning difficulty of samples during distillation, so as to better discriminate their distillation difficulty. The latter module adaptively adjusts distillation ratio at sample level, such that KD loss dominates the training with easy-to-transfer samples while vanilla loss dominates that with difficult-to-transfer samples. More importantly, we only select those samples with both low distillation difficulty and high diversity to train the student model for reducing computational cost. Experimental results on two video benchmarks and one image benchmark demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method by striking a good balance between performance and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Bi-Grid Reconstruction for Image Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In image anomaly detection, significant advancements have been made using un- and self-supervised methods with datasets containing only normal samples. However, these approaches often struggle with fine-grained anomalies. This paper introduces \textbf{GRAD}: Bi-\textbf{G}rid \textbf{R}econstruction for Image \textbf{A}nomaly \textbf{D}etection, which employs two continuous grids to enhance anomaly detection from both normal and abnormal perspectives. In this work: 1) Grids as feature repositories that improve generalization and mitigate the Identical Shortcut (IS) issue; 2) An abnormal feature grid that refines normal feature boundaries, boosting detection of fine-grained defects; 3) The Feature Block Paste (FBP) module, which synthesizes various anomalies at the feature level for quick abnormal grid deployment. GRAD's robust representation capabilities also allow it to handle multiple classes with a single model. Evaluations on datasets like MVTecAD, VisA, and GoodsAD show significant performance improvements in fine-grained anomaly detection. GRAD excels in overall accuracy and in discerning subtle differences, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Coca-Splat: Collaborative Optimization for Camera Parameters and 3D Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce Coca-Splat, a novel approach to addressing the challenges of sparse view pose-free scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis (NVS) by jointly optimizing camera parameters with 3D Gaussians. Inspired by deformable DEtection TRansformer, we design separate queries for 3D Gaussians and camera parameters and update them layer by layer through deformable Transformer layers, enabling joint optimization in a single network. This design demonstrates better performance because to accurately render views that closely approximate ground-truth images relies on precise estimation of both 3D Gaussians and camera parameters. In such a design, the centers of 3D Gaussians are projected onto each view by camera parameters to get projected points, which are regarded as 2D reference points in deformable cross-attention. With camera-aware multi-view deformable cross-attention (CaMDFA), 3D Gaussians and camera parameters are intrinsically connected by sharing the 2D reference points. Additionally, 2D reference point determined rays (RayRef) defined from camera centers to the reference points assist in modeling relationship between 3D Gaussians and camera parameters through RQ-decomposition on an overdetermined system of equations derived from the rays, enhancing the relationship between 3D Gaussians and camera parameters. Extensive evaluation shows that our approach outperforms previous methods, both pose-required and pose-free, on RealEstate10K and ACID within the same pose-free setting.</description>

      <title>POPEN: Preference-Based Optimization and Ensemble for LVLM-Based Reasoning Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing LVLM-based reasoning segmentation methods often suffer from imprecise segmentation results and hallucinations in their text responses. This paper introduces POPEN, a novel framework designed to address these issues and achieve improved results. POPEN includes a preference-based optimization method to finetune the LVLM, aligning it more closely with human preferences and thereby generating better text responses and segmentation results. Additionally, POPEN introduces a preference-based ensemble method for inference, which integrates multiple outputs from the LVLM using a preference-score-based attention mechanism for refinement. To better adapt to the segmentation task, we incorporate several task-specific designs in our POPEN framework, including a new approach for collecting segmentation preference data with a curriculum learning mechanism, and a novel preference optimization loss to refine the segmentation capability of the LVLM. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in reasoning segmentation, exhibiting minimal hallucination in text responses and the highest segmentation accuracy compared to previous advanced methods like LISA and PixelLM.

      <title>FDDet: Frequency-Decoupling for Boundary Refinement in Temporal Action Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal action detection aims to locate and classify actions in untrimmed videos. While recent works focus on designing powerful feature processors for pre-trained representations, they often overlook the inherent noise and redundancy within these features. Large-scale pre-trained video encoders tend to introduce background clutter and irrelevant semantics, leading to context confusion and imprecise boundaries. To address this, we propose a frequency-aware decoupling network that improves action discriminability by filtering out noisy semantics captured by pre-trained models. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive temporal decoupling scheme that suppresses irrelevant information while preserving fine-grained atomic action details, yielding more task-specific representations. In addition, we enhance inter-frame modeling by capturing temporal variations to better distinguish actions from background redundancy. Furthermore, we present a long-short-term category-aware relation network that jointly models local transitions and long-range dependencies, improving localization precision. The refined atomic features and frequency-guided dynamics are fed into a standard detection head to produce accurate action predictions. Extensive experiments on THUMOS14, HACS, and ActivityNet-1.3 show that our method, powered by InternVideo2-6B features, achieves state-of-the-art performance on temporal action detection benchmarks.</description>

      <title>QG-VTC: Question-Guided Visual Token Compression in MLLMs for Efficient VQA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown significant progress in open-world Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, integrating visual information increases the number of processed tokens, leading to higher GPU memory usage and computational overhead. Images often contain more redundant information than text, and not all visual details are pertinent to specific questions. To address these challenges, we propose QG-VTC, a novel question-guided visual token compression method for MLLM-based VQA tasks. QG-VTC employs a pretrained text encoder and a learnable feed-forward layer to embed user questions into the vision encoder's feature space then computes correlation scores between the question embeddings and visual tokens. By selecting the most relevant tokens and softly compressing others, QG-VTC ensures fine-tuned relevance to user needs. Additionally, a progressive strategy applies this compression across different vision encoder layers, gradually reducing token numbers. This approach maximizes retention of question-relevant information while discarding irrelevant details. Experimental results show that our method achieves performance on par with uncompressed models using just 1/8 of the visual tokens. The code and model will be publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Monocular and Generalizable Gaussian Talking Head Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce Monocular and Generalizable Gaussian Talking Head Animation (MGGTalk), which requires monocular datasets and generalizes to unseen identities without personalized re-training. Compared with previous 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods that requires elusive multi-view datasets or tedious personalized learning/inference, MGGtalk enables more practical and broader applications. However, in the absence of multi-view and personalized training data, the incompleteness of geometric and appearance information poses a significant challenge. To address these challenges, MGGTalk explores depth information to enhance geometric and facial symmetry characteristics to supplement both geometric and appearance features. Initially, based on the pixel-wise geometric information obtained from depth estimation, we incorporate symmetry operations and point cloud filtering techniques to ensure a complete and precise position parameter for 3DGS. Subsequently, we adopt a two-stage strategy with symmetric priors for predicting the remaining 3DGS parameters. We begin by predicting Gaussian parameters for the visible facial regions of the source image. These parameters are subsequently utilized to improve the prediction of Gaussian parameters for the non-visible regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGGTalk surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance across various metrics.</description>

      <title>ToVE: Efficient Vision-Language Learning via Knowledge Transfer from Vision Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language (VL) learning requires extensive visual perception capabilities, such as fine-grained object recognition and spatial perception. Recent works typically rely on training huge models on massive datasets to develop these capabilities. As a more efficient alternative, this paper proposes a new framework that Transfers the knowledge from a hub of Vision Experts (ToVE) for efficient VL learning, leveraging pre-trained vision expert models to promote visual perception capability. Specifically, building on a frozen CLIP encoder that provides vision tokens for image-conditioned language generation, ToVE introduces a hub of multiple vision experts and a token-aware gating network that dynamically routes expert knowledge to vision tokens. In the transfer phase, we propose a "residual knowledge transfer" strategy, which not only preserves the generalizability of the vision tokens but also allows detachment of low-contributing experts to improve inference efficiency. Further, we explore to merge these expert knowledge to a single CLIP encoder, creating a knowledge-merged CLIP that produces more informative vision tokens without expert inference during deployment. Experiment results across various VL tasks demonstrate that the proposed ToVE achieves competitive performance with two orders of magnitude fewer training data.</description>

      <title>CAPE: Connectivity-Aware Path Enforcement Loss for Curvilinear Structure Delineation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Promoting the connectivity of curvilinear structures, such as neuronal processes in biomedical scans and blood vessels in CT images, remains a key challenge in semantic segmentation. Traditional pixel-wise loss functions, including cross-entropy and Dice losses, often fail to capture high-level topological connectivity, resulting in topological mistakes in graphs obtained from prediction maps. In this paper, we propose CAPE (Connectivity-Aware Path Enforcement), a novel loss function designed to enforce connectivity in graphs obtained from segmentation maps by optimizing a graph connectivity metric. CAPE uses the graph representation of the ground truth to select node pairs and determine their corresponding paths within the predicted segmentation through a shortest-path algorithm. Using this, we penalize both disconnections and false positive connections, effectively promoting the model to preserve topological correctness. Experiments on 2D and 3D datasets, including neuron and blood vessel tracing demonstrate that CAPE significantly improves topology-aware metrics and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>MSSFC-Net:Enhancing Building Interpretation with Multi-Scale Spatial-Spectral Feature Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building interpretation from remote sensing imagery primarily involves two fundamental tasks: building extraction and change detection. However, most existing methods address these tasks independently, overlooking their inherent correlation and failing to exploit shared feature representations for mutual enhancement. Furthermore, the diverse spectral,spatial, and scale characteristics of buildings pose additional challenges in jointly modeling spatial-spectral multi-scale features and effectively balancing precision and recall. The limited synergy between spatial and spectral representations often results in reduced detection accuracy and incomplete change localization.To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Scale Spatial-Spectral Feature Cooperative Dual-Task Network (MSSFC-Net) for joint building extraction and change detection in remote sensing images. The framework integrates both tasks within a unified architecture, leveraging their complementary nature to simultaneously extract building and change features. Specifically,a Dual-branch Multi-scale Feature Extraction module (DMFE) with Spatial-Spectral Feature Collaboration (SSFC) is designed to enhance multi-scale representation learning, effectively capturing shallow texture details and deep semantic information, thus improving building extraction performance. For temporal feature aggregation, we introduce a Multi-scale Differential Fusion Module (MDFM) that explicitly models the interaction between differential and dual-temporal features. This module refines the network's capability to detect large-area changes and subtle structural variations in buildings. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSSFC-Net achieves superior performance in both building extraction and change detection tasks, effectively improving detection accuracy while maintaining completeness.</description>

      <title>UnIRe: Unsupervised Instance Decomposition for Dynamic Urban Scene Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing and decomposing dynamic urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, urban planning, and scene editing. However, existing methods fail to perform instance-aware decomposition without manual annotations, which is crucial for instance-level scene editing.We propose UnIRe, a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based approach that decomposes a scene into a static background and individual dynamic instances using only RGB images and LiDAR point clouds. At its core, we introduce 4D superpoints, a novel representation that clusters multi-frame LiDAR points in 4D space, enabling unsupervised instance separation based on spatiotemporal correlations. These 4D superpoints serve as the foundation for our decomposed 4D initialization, i.e., providing spatial and temporal initialization to train a dynamic 3DGS for arbitrary dynamic classes without requiring bounding boxes or object templates.Furthermore, we introduce a smoothness regularization strategy in both 2D and 3D space, further improving the temporal stability.Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing methods in decomposed dynamic scene reconstruction while enabling accurate and flexible instance-level editing, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>DropGaussian: Structural Regularization for Sparse-view Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has gained considerable attentions in the field of novel view synthesis due to its fast performance while yielding the excellent image quality. However, 3DGS in sparse-view settings (e.g., three-view inputs) often faces with the problem of overfitting to training views, which significantly drops the visual quality of novel view images. Many existing approaches have tackled this issue by using strong priors, such as 2D generative contextual information and external depth signals. In contrast, this paper introduces a prior-free method, so-called DropGaussian, with simple changes in 3D Gaussian splatting. Specifically, we randomly remove Gaussians during the training process in a similar way of dropout, which allows non-excluded Gaussians to have larger gradients while improving their visibility. This makes the remaining Gaussians to contribute more to the optimization process for rendering with sparse input views. Such simple operation effectively alleviates the overfitting problem and enhances the quality of novel view synthesis. By simply applying DropGaussian to the original 3DGS framework, we can achieve the competitive performance with existing prior-based 3DGS methods in sparse-view settings of benchmark datasets without any additional complexity. The code and model are publicly available at: https://github.com/DCVL-3D/DropGaussian release.</description>

      <title>CellVTA: Enhancing Vision Foundation Models for Accurate Cell Segmentation and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell instance segmentation is a fundamental task in digital pathology with broad clinical applications. Recently, vision foundation models, which are predominantly based on Vision Transformers (ViTs), have achieved remarkable success in pathology image analysis. However, their improvements in cell instance segmentation remain limited. A key challenge arises from the tokenization process in ViTs, which substantially reduces the spatial resolution of input images, leading to suboptimal segmentation quality, especially for small and densely packed cells. To address this problem, we propose CellVTA (Cell Vision Transformer with Adapter), a novel method that improves the performance of vision foundation models for cell instance segmentation by incorporating a CNN-based adapter module. This adapter extracts high-resolution spatial information from input images and injects it into the ViT through a cross-attention mechanism. Our method preserves the core architecture of ViT, ensuring seamless integration with pretrained foundation models. Extensive experiments show that CellVTA achieves 0.538 mPQ on the CoNIC dataset and 0.506 mPQ on the PanNuke dataset, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art cell segmentation methods. Ablation studies confirm the superiority of our approach over other fine-tuning strategies, including decoder-only fine-tuning and full fine-tuning. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/JieZheng-ShanghaiTech/CellVTA.</description>

      <title>Scaling Prompt Instructed Zero Shot Composed Image Retrieval with Image-Only Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving images matching a reference image augmented with a text, where the text describes changes to the reference image in natural language. Traditionally, models designed for CIR have relied on triplet data containing a reference image, reformulation text, and a target image. However, curating such triplet data often necessitates human intervention, leading to prohibitive costs. This challenge has hindered the scalability of CIR model training even with the availability of abundant unlabeled data. With the recent advances in foundational models, we advocate a shift in the CIR training paradigm where human annotations can be efficiently replaced by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we demonstrate the capability of large captioning and language models in efficiently generating data for CIR only relying on unannotated image collections. Additionally, we introduce an embedding reformulation architecture that effectively combines image and text modalities. Our model, named InstructCIR, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot composed image retrieval on CIRR and FashionIQ datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by increasing the amount of generated data, our zero-shot model gets closer to the performance of supervised baselines.</description>

      <title>The study of non-complete-ring positron emission tomography (PET) detection method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a vital molecular imaging tool widely used in medical diagnosis and treatment evaluation. Traditional PET systems typically rely on complete detector rings to achieve full angular coverage for uniform and statistically robust sampling of coincidence events. However, incomplete-ring PET scanners have emerged in various scenarios due to hardware failures, cost constraints, or specific clinical needs. In such cases, conventional reconstruction algorithms often suffer from performance degradation due to reduced data completeness and geometric inconsistencies. This thesis proposes a coarse-to-fine reconstruction framework for incomplete-ring PET scanners. The framework first employs an Attention U-Net model to recover complete sinograms from incomplete ones, then uses the OSEM algorithm for preliminary reconstruction, and finally applies a two-stage architecture comprising a Coarse Prediction Module (CPM) and an Iterative Refinement Module (IRM) for fine reconstruction. Our approach utilizes neighboring axial slices and spectral transform features as auxiliary guidance at the input level to ensure spatial and frequency domain consistency, and integrates a contrastive diffusion strategy at the output level to improve correspondence between low-quality PET inputs and refined PET outputs. Experimental results on public and in-house brain PET datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in metrics such as PSNR (35.6421 dB) and SSIM (0.9588), successfully preserving key anatomical structures and tracer distribution features, thus providing an effective solution for incomplete-ring PET imaging.</description>

      <title>PRISM-0: A Predicate-Rich Scene Graph Generation Framework for Zero-Shot Open-Vocabulary Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Scene Graphs Generation (SGG) one extracts structured representation from visual inputs in the form of objects nodes and predicates connecting them. This facilitates image-based understanding and reasoning for various downstream tasks. Although fully supervised SGG approaches showed steady performance improvements, they suffer from a severe training bias. This is caused by the availability of only small subsets of curated data and exhibits long-tail predicate distribution issues with a lack of predicate diversity adversely affecting downstream tasks. To overcome this, we introduce PRISM-0, a framework for zero-shot open-vocabulary SGG that bootstraps foundation models in a bottom-up approach to capture the whole spectrum of diverse, open-vocabulary predicate prediction. Detected object pairs are filtered and passed to a Vision Language Model (VLM) that generates descriptive captions. These are used to prompt an LLM to generate fine-andcoarse-grained predicates for the pair. The predicates are then validated using a VQA model to provide a final SGG. With the modular and dataset-independent PRISM-0, we can enrich existing SG datasets such as Visual Genome (VG). Experiments illustrate that PRIMS-0 generates semantically meaningful graphs that improve downstream tasks such as Image Captioning and Sentence-to-Graph Retrieval with a performance on par to the best fully supervised methods.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot 4D Lidar Panoptic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot 4D segmentation and recognition of arbitrary objects in Lidar is crucial for embodied navigation, with applications ranging from streaming perception to semantic mapping and localization. However, the primary challenge in advancing research and developing generalized, versatile methods for spatio-temporal scene understanding in Lidar lies in the scarcity of datasets that provide the necessary diversity and scale of annotations.To overcome these challenges, we propose SAL-4D (Segment Anything in Lidar--4D), a method that utilizes multi-modal robotic sensor setups as a bridge to distill recent developments in Video Object Segmentation (VOS) in conjunction with off-the-shelf Vision-Language foundation models to Lidar. We utilize VOS models to pseudo-label tracklets in short video sequences, annotate these tracklets with sequence-level CLIP tokens, and lift them to the 4D Lidar space using calibrated multi-modal sensory setups to distill them to our SAL-4D model. Due to temporal consistent predictions, we outperform prior art in 3D Zero-Shot Lidar Panoptic Segmentation (LPS) over $5$ PQ, and unlock Zero-Shot 4D-LPS.</description>

      <title>Global Intervention and Distillation for Federated Out-of-Distribution Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attribute skew in federated learning leads local models to focus on learning non-causal associations, guiding them towards inconsistent optimization directions, which inevitably results in performance degradation and unstable convergence. Existing methods typically leverage data augmentation to enhance sample diversity or employ knowledge distillation to learn invariant representations. However, the instability in the quality of generated data and the lack of domain information limit their performance on unseen samples. To address these issues, this paper presents a global intervention and distillation method, termed FedGID, which utilizes diverse attribute features for backdoor adjustment to break the spurious association between background and label. It includes two main modules, where the global intervention module adaptively decouples objects and backgrounds in images, injects background information into random samples to intervene in the sample distribution, which links backgrounds to all categories to prevent the model from treating background-label associations as causal. The global distillation module leverages a unified knowledge base to guide the representation learning of client models, preventing local models from overfitting to client-specific attributes. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that FedGID enhances the model's ability to focus on the main subjects in unseen data and outperforms existing methods in collaborative modeling.</description>

      <title>Exploring Personalized Federated Learning Architectures for Violence Detection in Surveillance Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenge of detecting violent incidents in urban surveillance systems is compounded by the voluminous and diverse nature of video data. This paper presents a targeted approach using Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) to address these issues, specifically employing the Federated Learning with Personalization Layers method within the Flower framework. Our methodology adapts learning models to the unique data characteristics of each surveillance node, effectively managing the heterogeneous and non-IID nature of surveillance video data. Through rigorous experiments conducted on balanced and imbalanced datasets, our PFL models demonstrated enhanced accuracy and efficiency, achieving up to 99.3% accuracy. This study underscores the potential of PFL to significantly improve the scalability and effectiveness of surveillance systems, offering a robust, privacy-preserving solution for violence detection in complex urban environments.</description>

      <title>NeuRadar: Neural Radiance Fields for Automotive Radar Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radar is an important sensor for autonomous driving (AD) systems due to its robustness to adverse weather and different lighting conditions. Novel view synthesis using neural radiance fields (NeRFs) has recently received considerable attention in AD due to its potential to enable efficient testing and validation but remains unexplored for radar point clouds. In this paper, we present NeuRadar, a NeRF-based model that jointly generates radar point clouds, camera images, and lidar point clouds. We explore set-based object detection methods such as DETR, and propose an encoder-based solution grounded in the NeRF geometry for improved generalizability. We propose both a deterministic and a probabilistic point cloud representation to accurately model the radar behavior, with the latter being able to capture radar's stochastic behavior. We achieve realistic reconstruction results for two automotive datasets, establishing a baseline for NeRF-based radar point cloud simulation models. In addition, we release radar data for ZOD's Sequences and Drives to enable further research in this field. To encourage further development of radar NeRFs, we release the source code for NeuRadar.</description>

      <title>Balancing Multi-Target Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation with Collaborative Generalist and Specialists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the promising performance achieved by current semi-supervised models in segmenting individual medical targets, many of these models suffer a notable decrease in performance when tasked with the simultaneous segmentation of multiple targets. A vital factor could be attributed to the imbalanced scales among different targets: during simultaneously segmenting multiple targets, large targets dominate the loss, leading to small targets being misclassified as larger ones. To this end, we propose a novel method, which consists of a Collaborative Generalist and several Specialists, termed CGS. It is centered around the idea of employing a specialist for each target class, thus avoiding the dominance of larger targets. The generalist performs conventional multi-target segmentation, while each specialist is dedicated to distinguishing a specific target class from the remaining target classes and the background. Based on a theoretical insight, we demonstrate that CGS can achieve a more balanced training. Moreover, we develop cross-consistency losses to foster collaborative learning between the generalist and the specialists. Lastly, regarding their intrinsic relation that the target class of any specialized head should belong to the remaining classes of the other heads, we introduce an inter-head error detection module to further enhance the quality of pseudo-labels. Experimental results on three popular benchmarks showcase its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Data-free Knowledge Distillation with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently Data-Free Knowledge Distillation (DFKD) has garnered attention and can transfer knowledge from a teacher neural network to a student neural network without requiring any access to training data. Although diffusion models are adept at synthesizing high-fidelity photorealistic images across various domains, existing methods cannot be easiliy implemented to DFKD. To bridge that gap, this paper proposes a novel approach based on diffusion models, DiffDFKD. Specifically, DiffDFKD involves targeted optimizations in two key areas. Firstly, DiffDFKD utilizes valuable information from teacher models to guide the pre-trained diffusion models' data synthesis, generating datasets that mirror the training data distribution and effectively bridge domain gaps. Secondly, to reduce computational burdens, DiffDFKD introduces Latent CutMix Augmentation, an efficient technique, to enhance the diversity of diffusion model-generated images for DFKD while preserving key attributes for effective knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of DiffDFKD, yielding state-of-the-art results exceeding existing DFKD approaches. We release our code at https://github.com/xhqi0109/DiffDFKD.</description>

      <title>WISE-TTT:Worldwide Information Segmentation Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video multi-target segmentation remains a major challenge in long sequences, mainly due to the inherent limitations of existing architectures in capturing global temporal dependencies. We introduce WISE-TTT, a synergistic architecture integrating Test-Time Training (TTT) mechanisms with the Transformer architecture through co-design. The TTT layer systematically compresses historical temporal data to generate hidden states containing worldwide information(Lossless memory to maintain long contextual integrity), while achieving multi-stage contextual aggregation through splicing. Crucially, our framework provides the first empirical validation that implementing worldwide information across multiple network layers is essential for optimal dependency utilization.Ablation studies show TTT modules at high-level features boost global modeling. This translates to 3.1% accuracy improvement(J&amp;F metric) on Davis2017 long-term benchmarks -- the first proof of hierarchical context superiority in video segmentation. We provide the first systematic evidence that worldwide information critically impacts segmentation performance.</description>

      <title>Improved Visual-Spatial Reasoning via R1-Zero-Like Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing attention has been placed on improving the reasoning capacities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). As the cornerstone for AI agents that function in the physical realm, video-based visual-spatial intelligence (VSI) emerges as one of the most pivotal reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. This work conducts a first, in-depth study on improving the visual-spatial reasoning of MLLMs via R1-Zero-like training. Technically, we first identify that the visual-spatial reasoning capacities of small- to medium-sized Qwen2-VL models cannot be activated via Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts. We then incorporate GRPO training for improved visual-spatial reasoning, using the carefully curated VSI-100k dataset, following DeepSeek-R1-Zero. During the investigation, we identify the necessity to keep the KL penalty (even with a small value) in GRPO. With just 120 GPU hours, our vsGRPO-2B model, fine-tuned from Qwen2-VL-2B, can outperform the base model by 12.1% and surpass GPT-4o. Moreover, our vsGRPO-7B model, fine-tuned from Qwen2-VL-7B, achieves performance comparable to that of the best open-source model LLaVA-NeXT-Video-72B. Additionally, we compare vsGRPO to supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization baselines and observe strong performance superiority. The code and dataset will be available soon.</description>

      <title>A Decade of Deep Learning for Remote Sensing Spatiotemporal Fusion: Advances, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hardware limitations and satellite launch costs make direct acquisition of high temporal-spatial resolution remote sensing imagery challenging. Remote sensing spatiotemporal fusion (STF) technology addresses this problem by merging high temporal but low spatial resolution imagery with high spatial but low temporal resolution imagery to efficiently generate high spatiotemporal resolution satellite images. STF provides unprecedented observational capabilities for land surface change monitoring, agricultural management, and environmental research. Deep learning (DL) methods have revolutionized the remote sensing spatiotemporal fusion field over the past decade through powerful automatic feature extraction and nonlinear modeling capabilities, significantly outperforming traditional methods in handling complex spatiotemporal data. Despite the rapid development of DL-based remote sensing STF, the community lacks a systematic review of this quickly evolving field. This paper comprehensively reviews DL developments in remote sensing STF over the last decade, analyzing key research trends, method classifications, commonly used datasets, and evaluation metrics. It discusses major challenges in existing research and identifies promising future research directions as references for researchers in this field to inspire new ideas. The specific models, datasets, and other information mentioned in this article have been collected in: https://github.com/yc-cui/Deep-Learning-Spatiotemporal-Fusion-Survey.</description>

      <title>DBF-UNet: A Two-Stage Framework for Carotid Artery Segmentation with Pseudo-Label Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image analysis faces significant challenges due to limited annotation data, particularly in three-dimensional carotid artery segmentation tasks, where existing datasets exhibit spatially discontinuous slice annotations with only a small portion of expert-labeled slices in complete 3D volumetric data. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage segmentation framework. First, we construct continuous vessel centerlines by interpolating between annotated slice centroids and propagate labels along these centerlines to generate interpolated annotations for unlabeled slices. The slices with expert annotations are used for fine-tuning SAM-Med2D, while the interpolated labels on unlabeled slices serve as prompts to guide segmentation during inference. In the second stage, we propose a novel Dense Bidirectional Feature Fusion UNet (DBF-UNet). This lightweight architecture achieves precise segmentation of complete 3D vascular structures. The network incorporates bidirectional feature fusion in the encoder and integrates multi-scale feature aggregation with dense connectivity for effective feature reuse. Experimental validation on public datasets demonstrates that our proposed method effectively addresses the sparse annotation challenge in carotid artery segmentation while achieving superior performance compared to existing approaches. The source code is available at https://github.com/Haoxuanli-Thu/DBF-UNet.</description>

      <title>WikiVideo: Article Generation from Multiple Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the challenging task of automatically creating a high-level Wikipedia-style article that aggregates information from multiple diverse videos about real-world events, such as natural disasters or political elections. Videos are intuitive sources for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), but most contemporary RAG workflows focus heavily on text and existing methods for video-based summarization focus on low-level scene understanding rather than high-level event semantics. To close this gap, we introduce WikiVideo, a benchmark consisting of expert-written articles and densely annotated videos that provide evidence for articles' claims, facilitating the integration of video into RAG pipelines and enabling the creation of in-depth content that is grounded in multimodal sources. We further propose Collaborative Article Generation (CAG), a novel interactive method for article creation from multiple videos. CAG leverages an iterative interaction between an r1-style reasoning model and a VideoLLM to draw higher level inferences about the target event than is possible with VideoLLMs alone, which fixate on low-level visual features. We benchmark state-of-the-art VideoLLMs and CAG in both oracle retrieval and RAG settings and find that CAG consistently outperforms alternative methods, while suggesting intriguing avenues for future work.</description>

      <title>Graph Classification and Radiomics Signature for Identification of Tuberculous Meningitis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is a serious brain infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, characterized by inflammation of the meninges covering the brain and spinal cord. Diagnosis often requires invasive lumbar puncture (LP) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Objectives: This study aims to classify TBM patients using T1-weighted (T1w) non-contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. We hypothesize that specific brain regions, such as the interpeduncular cisterns, bone, and corpus callosum, contain visual markers that can non-invasively distinguish TBM patients from healthy controls. We propose a novel Pixel-array Graphs Classifier (PAG-Classifier) that leverages spatial relationships between neighbouring 3D pixels in a graph-based framework to extract significant features through eigen decomposition. These features are then used to train machine learning classifiers for effective patient classification. We validate our approach using a radiomics-based methodology, classifying TBM patients based on relevant radiomics features. Results: We utilized an internal dataset consisting of 52 scans, 32 from confirmed TBM patients based on mycobacteria detection in CSF, and 20 from healthy individuals. We achieved a 5-fold cross-validated average F1 score of 85.71% for cistern regions with our PAG-Classifier and 92.85% with the radiomics features classifier, surpassing current state-of-the-art benchmarks by 15% and 22%, respectively. However, bone and corpus callosum regions showed poor classification effectiveness, with average F1 scores below 50%. Conclusion: Our study suggests that algorithms like the PAG-Classifier serve as effective tools for non-invasive TBM analysis, particularly by targeting the interpeduncular cistern. Findings indicate that the bone and corpus callosum regions lack distinctive patterns for differentiation.</description>

      <title>GKAN: Explainable Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Using Graph Neural Network with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that poses significant diagnostic challenges due to its complex etiology. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have shown promise in modeling brain connectivity for AD diagnosis, yet their reliance on linear transformations limits their ability to capture intricate nonlinear patterns in neuroimaging data. To address this, we propose GCN-KAN, a novel single-modal framework that integrates Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) into GCNs to enhance both diagnostic accuracy and interpretability. Leveraging structural MRI data, our model employs learnable spline-based transformations to better represent brain region interactions. Evaluated on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, GCN-KAN outperforms traditional GCNs by 4-8% in classification accuracy while providing interpretable insights into key brain regions associated with AD. This approach offers a robust and explainable tool for early AD diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Neural Pruning for 3D Scene Reconstruction: Efficient NeRF Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have become a popular 3D reconstruction approach in recent years. While they produce high-quality results, they also demand lengthy training times, often spanning days. This paper studies neural pruning as a strategy to address these concerns. We compare pruning approaches, including uniform sampling, importance-based methods, and coreset-based techniques, to reduce the model size and speed up training. Our findings show that coreset-driven pruning can achieve a 50% reduction in model size and a 35% speedup in training, with only a slight decrease in accuracy. These results suggest that pruning can be an effective method for improving the efficiency of NeRF models in resource-limited settings.</description>

      <title>IDMR: Towards Instance-Driven Precise Visual Correspondence in Multimodal Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal retrieval systems are becoming increasingly vital for cutting-edge AI technologies, such as embodied AI and AI-driven digital content industries. However, current multimodal retrieval tasks lack sufficient complexity and demonstrate limited practical application value. It spires us to design Instance-Driven Multimodal Image Retrieval (IDMR), a novel task that requires models to retrieve images containing the same instance as a query image while matching a text-described scenario. Unlike existing retrieval tasks focused on global image similarity or category-level matching, IDMR demands fine-grained instance-level consistency across diverse contexts. To benchmark this capability, we develop IDMR-bench using real-world object tracking and first-person video data. Addressing the scarcity of training data, we propose a cross-domain synthesis method that creates 557K training samples by cropping objects from standard detection datasets. Our Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based retrieval model, trained on 1.2M samples, outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both traditional benchmarks and our zero-shot IDMR-bench. Experimental results demonstrate previous models' limitations in instance-aware retrieval and highlight the potential of MLLM for advanced retrieval applications. The whole training dataset, codes and models, with wide ranges of sizes, are available at https://github.com/BwLiu01/IDMR.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence-Assisted Prostate Cancer Diagnosis for Reduced Use of Immunohistochemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prostate cancer diagnosis heavily relies on histopathological evaluation, which is subject to variability. While immunohistochemical staining (IHC) assists in distinguishing benign from malignant tissue, it involves increased work, higher costs, and diagnostic delays. Artificial intelligence (AI) presents a promising solution to reduce reliance on IHC by accurately classifying atypical glands and borderline morphologies in hematoxylin &amp; eosin (H&amp;E) stained tissue sections. In this study, we evaluated an AI model's ability to minimize IHC use without compromising diagnostic accuracy by retrospectively analyzing prostate core needle biopsies from routine diagnostics at three different pathology sites. These cohorts were composed exclusively of difficult cases where the diagnosing pathologists required IHC to finalize the diagnosis. The AI model demonstrated area under the curve values of 0.951-0.993 for detecting cancer in routine H&amp;E-stained slides. Applying sensitivity-prioritized diagnostic thresholds reduced the need for IHC staining by 44.4%, 42.0%, and 20.7% in the three cohorts investigated, without a single false negative prediction. This AI model shows potential for optimizing IHC use, streamlining decision-making in prostate pathology, and alleviating resource burdens.</description>

      <title>SuperDec: 3D Scene Decomposition with Superquadric Primitives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SuperDec, an approach for creating compact 3D scene representations via decomposition into superquadric primitives. While most recent works leverage geometric primitives to obtain photorealistic 3D scene representations, we propose to leverage them to obtain a compact yet expressive representation. We propose to solve the problem locally on individual objects and leverage the capabilities of instance segmentation methods to scale our solution to full 3D scenes. In doing that, we design a new architecture which efficiently decompose point clouds of arbitrary objects in a compact set of superquadrics. We train our architecture on ShapeNet and we prove its generalization capabilities on object instances extracted from the ScanNet++ dataset as well as on full Replica scenes. Finally, we show how a compact representation based on superquadrics can be useful for a diverse range of downstream applications, including robotic tasks and controllable visual content generation and editing.</description>

      <title>TurboFill: Adapting Few-step Text-to-image Model for Fast Image Inpainting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces TurboFill, a fast image inpainting model that enhances a few-step text-to-image diffusion model with an inpainting adapter for high-quality and efficient inpainting. While standard diffusion models generate high-quality results, they incur high computational costs. We overcome this by training an inpainting adapter on a few-step distilled text-to-image model, DMD2, using a novel 3-step adversarial training scheme to ensure realistic, structurally consistent, and visually harmonious inpainted regions. To evaluate TurboFill, we propose two benchmarks: DilationBench, which tests performance across mask sizes, and HumanBench, based on human feedback for complex prompts. Experiments show that TurboFill outperforms both multi-step BrushNet and few-step inpainting methods, setting a new benchmark for high-performance inpainting tasks.

      <title>MergeVQ: A Unified Framework for Visual Generation and Representation with Disentangled Token Merging and Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with Vector Quantization (VQ) has achieved great success in both self-supervised pre-training and image generation. However, most existing methods struggle to address the trade-off in shared latent space for generation quality vs. representation learning and efficiency. To push the limits of this paradigm, we propose MergeVQ, which incorporates token merging techniques into VQ-based generative models to bridge the gap between image generation and visual representation learning in a unified architecture. During pre-training, MergeVQ decouples top-k semantics from latent space with the token merge module after self-attention blocks in the encoder for subsequent Look-up Free Quantization (LFQ) and global alignment and recovers their fine-grained details through cross-attention in the decoder for reconstruction. As for the second-stage generation, we introduce MergeAR, which performs KV Cache compression for efficient raster-order prediction. Extensive experiments on ImageNet verify that MergeVQ as an AR generative model achieves competitive performance in both visual representation learning and image generation tasks while maintaining favorable token efficiency and inference speed. The code and model will be available at https://apexgen-x.github.io/MergeVQ.</description>

      <title>Enhancing 3T BOLD fMRI SNR using Unpaired 7T Data with Schr\"odinger Bridge Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High spatial and temporal resolution, coupled with a strong signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), has made BOLD 7 Tesla fMRI an invaluable tool for understanding how the brain processes visual stimuli. However, the limited availability of 7T MRI systems means that most research relies on 3T MRI systems, which offer lower spatial and temporal resolution and SNR. This naturally raises the question: Can we enhance the spatiotemporal resolution and SNR of 3T BOLD fMRI data to approximate 7T quality? In this study, we propose a novel framework that aligns 7T and 3T fMRI data from different subjects and datasets in a shared parametric domain. We then apply an unpaired Brain Disk Schr\"odinger Bridge diffusion model to enhance the spatiotemporal resolution and SNR of the 3T data. Our approach addresses the challenge of limited 7T data by improving the 3T scan quality. We demonstrate its effectiveness by testing it on two distinct fMRI retinotopy datasets (one 7T and one 3T), as well as synthetic data. The results show that our method significantly improves the SNR and goodness-of-fit of the population receptive field (pRF) model in the enhanced 3T data, making it comparable to 7T quality. The codes will be available at Github.</description>

      <title>IntrinsiX: High-Quality PBR Generation using Image Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce IntrinsiX, a novel method that generates high-quality intrinsic images from text description. In contrast to existing text-to-image models whose outputs contain baked-in scene lighting, our approach predicts physically-based rendering (PBR) maps. This enables the generated outputs to be used for content creation scenarios in core graphics applications that facilitate re-lighting, editing, and texture generation tasks. In order to train our generator, we exploit strong image priors, and pre-train separate models for each PBR material component (albedo, roughness, metallic, normals). We then align these models with a new cross-intrinsic attention formulation that concatenates key and value features in a consistent fashion. This allows us to exchange information between each output modality and to obtain semantically coherent PBR predictions. To ground each intrinsic component, we propose a rendering loss which provides image-space signals to constrain the model, thus facilitating sharp details also in the output BRDF properties. Our results demonstrate detailed intrinsic generation with strong generalization capabilities that outperforms existing intrinsic image decomposition methods used with generated images by a significant margin. Finally, we show a series of applications, including re-lighting, editing, and text-conditioned room-scale PBR texture generation.</description>

      <title>GECKO: Gigapixel Vision-Concept Contrastive Pretraining in Histopathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretraining a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) aggregator enables the derivation of Whole Slide Image (WSI)-level embeddings from patch-level representations without supervision. While recent multimodal MIL pretraining approaches leveraging auxiliary modalities have demonstrated performance gains over unimodal WSI pretraining, the acquisition of these additional modalities necessitates extensive clinical profiling. This requirement increases costs and limits scalability in existing WSI datasets lacking such paired modalities. To address this, we propose Gigapixel Vision-Concept Knowledge Contrastive pretraining (GECKO), which aligns WSIs with a Concept Prior derived from the available WSIs. First, we derive an inherently interpretable concept prior by computing the similarity between each WSI patch and textual descriptions of predefined pathology concepts. GECKO then employs a dual-branch MIL network: one branch aggregates patch embeddings into a WSI-level deep embedding, while the other aggregates the concept prior into a corresponding WSI-level concept embedding. Both aggregated embeddings are aligned using a contrastive objective, thereby pretraining the entire dual-branch MIL model. Moreover, when auxiliary modalities such as transcriptomics data are available, GECKO seamlessly integrates them. Across five diverse tasks, GECKO consistently outperforms prior unimodal and multimodal pretraining approaches while also delivering clinically meaningful interpretability that bridges the gap between computational models and pathology expertise.

      <title>A YOLO-Based Semi-Automated Labeling Approach to Improve Fault Detection Efficiency in Railroad Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manual labeling for large-scale image and video datasets is often time-intensive, error-prone, and costly, posing a significant barrier to efficient machine learning workflows in fault detection from railroad videos. This study introduces a semi-automated labeling method that utilizes a pre-trained You Only Look Once (YOLO) model to streamline the labeling process and enhance fault detection accuracy in railroad videos. By initiating the process with a small set of manually labeled data, our approach iteratively trains the YOLO model, using each cycle's output to improve model accuracy and progressively reduce the need for human intervention.
  To facilitate easy correction of model predictions, we developed a system to export YOLO's detection data as an editable text file, enabling rapid adjustments when detections require refinement. This approach decreases labeling time from an average of 2 to 4 minutes per image to 30 seconds to 2 minutes, effectively minimizing labor costs and labeling errors. Unlike costly AI based labeling solutions on paid platforms, our method provides a cost-effective alternative for researchers and practitioners handling large datasets in fault detection and other detection based machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>AnimeGamer: Infinite Anime Life Simulation with Next Game State Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in image and video synthesis have opened up new promise in generative games. One particularly intriguing application is transforming characters from anime films into interactive, playable entities. This allows players to immerse themselves in the dynamic anime world as their favorite characters for life simulation through language instructions. Such games are defined as infinite game since they eliminate predetermined boundaries and fixed gameplay rules, where players can interact with the game world through open-ended language and experience ever-evolving storylines and environments. Recently, a pioneering approach for infinite anime life simulation employs large language models (LLMs) to translate multi-turn text dialogues into language instructions for image generation. However, it neglects historical visual context, leading to inconsistent gameplay. Furthermore, it only generates static images, failing to incorporate the dynamics necessary for an engaging gaming experience. In this work, we propose AnimeGamer, which is built upon Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate each game state, including dynamic animation shots that depict character movements and updates to character states, as illustrated in Figure 1. We introduce novel action-aware multimodal representations to represent animation shots, which can be decoded into high-quality video clips using a video diffusion model. By taking historical animation shot representations as context and predicting subsequent representations, AnimeGamer can generate games with contextual consistency and satisfactory dynamics. Extensive evaluations using both automated metrics and human evaluations demonstrate that AnimeGamer outperforms existing methods in various aspects of the gaming experience. Codes and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/TencentARC/AnimeGamer.</description>

      <title>Scaling Language-Free Visual Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) currently underperforms Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) in multimodal settings such as Visual Question Answering (VQA). This multimodal gap is often attributed to the semantics introduced by language supervision, even though visual SSL and CLIP models are often trained on different data. In this work, we ask the question: "Do visual self-supervised approaches lag behind CLIP due to the lack of language supervision, or differences in the training data?" We study this question by training both visual SSL and CLIP models on the same MetaCLIP data, and leveraging VQA as a diverse testbed for vision encoders. In this controlled setup, visual SSL models scale better than CLIP models in terms of data and model capacity, and visual SSL performance does not saturate even after scaling up to 7B parameters. Consequently, we observe visual SSL methods achieve CLIP-level performance on a wide range of VQA and classic vision benchmarks. These findings demonstrate that pure visual SSL can match language-supervised visual pretraining at scale, opening new opportunities for vision-centric representation learning.</description>

      <title>MixerMDM: Learnable Composition of Human Motion Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating human motion guided by conditions such as textual descriptions is challenging due to the need for datasets with pairs of high-quality motion and their corresponding conditions. The difficulty increases when aiming for finer control in the generation. To that end, prior works have proposed to combine several motion diffusion models pre-trained on datasets with different types of conditions, thus allowing control with multiple conditions. However, the proposed merging strategies overlook that the optimal way to combine the generation processes might depend on the particularities of each pre-trained generative model and also the specific textual descriptions. In this context, we introduce MixerMDM, the first learnable model composition technique for combining pre-trained text-conditioned human motion diffusion models. Unlike previous approaches, MixerMDM provides a dynamic mixing strategy that is trained in an adversarial fashion to learn to combine the denoising process of each model depending on the set of conditions driving the generation. By using MixerMDM to combine single- and multi-person motion diffusion models, we achieve fine-grained control on the dynamics of every person individually, and also on the overall interaction. Furthermore, we propose a new evaluation technique that, for the first time in this task, measures the interaction and individual quality by computing the alignment between the mixed generated motions and their conditions as well as the capabilities of MixerMDM to adapt the mixing throughout the denoising process depending on the motions to mix.</description>

      <title>Shot-by-Shot: Film-Grammar-Aware Training-Free Audio Description Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our objective is the automatic generation of Audio Descriptions (ADs) for edited video material, such as movies and TV series. To achieve this, we propose a two-stage framework that leverages "shots" as the fundamental units of video understanding. This includes extending temporal context to neighbouring shots and incorporating film grammar devices, such as shot scales and thread structures, to guide AD generation. Our method is compatible with both open-source and proprietary Visual-Language Models (VLMs), integrating expert knowledge from add-on modules without requiring additional training of the VLMs. We achieve state-of-the-art performance among all prior training-free approaches and even surpass fine-tuned methods on several benchmarks. To evaluate the quality of predicted ADs, we introduce a new evaluation measure -- an action score -- specifically targeted to assessing this important aspect of AD. Additionally, we propose a novel evaluation protocol that treats automatic frameworks as AD generation assistants and asks them to generate multiple candidate ADs for selection.</description>

      <title>Assessing Foundation Models for Sea Ice Type Segmentation in Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of sea ice types is essential for mapping and operational forecasting of sea ice conditions for safe navigation and resource extraction in ice-covered waters, as well as for understanding polar climate processes. While deep learning methods have shown promise in automating sea ice segmentation, they often rely on extensive labeled datasets which require expert knowledge and are time-consuming to create. Recently, foundation models (FMs) have shown excellent results for segmenting remote sensing images by utilizing pre-training on large datasets using self-supervised techniques. However, their effectiveness for sea ice segmentation remains unexplored, especially given sea ice's complex structures, seasonal changes, and unique spectral signatures, as well as peculiar Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery characteristics including banding and scalloping noise, and varying ice backscatter characteristics, which are often missing in standard remote sensing pre-training datasets. In particular, SAR images over polar regions are acquired using different modes than used to capture the images at lower latitudes by the same sensors that form training datasets for FMs. This study evaluates ten remote sensing FMs for sea ice type segmentation using Sentinel-1 SAR imagery, focusing on their seasonal and spatial generalization. Among the selected models, Prithvi-600M outperforms the baseline models, while CROMA achieves a very similar performance in F1-score. Our contributions include offering a systematic methodology for selecting FMs for sea ice data analysis, a comprehensive benchmarking study on performances of FMs for sea ice segmentation with tailored performance metrics, and insights into existing gaps and future directions for improving domain-specific models in polar applications using SAR data.</description>

      <title>RIG: Synergizing Reasoning and Imagination in End-to-End Generalist Policy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning before action and imagining potential outcomes (i.e., world models) are essential for embodied agents operating in complex open-world environments. Yet, prior work either incorporates only one of these abilities in an end-to-end agent or integrates multiple specialized models into an agent system, limiting the learning efficiency and generalization of the policy. Thus, this paper makes the first attempt to synergize Reasoning and Imagination in an end-to-end Generalist policy, termed RIG. To train RIG in an end-to-end manner, we construct a data pipeline that progressively integrates and enriches the content of imagination and reasoning in the trajectories collected from existing agents. The joint learning of reasoning and next image generation explicitly models the inherent correlation between reasoning, action, and dynamics of environments, and thus exhibits more than $17\times$ sample efficiency improvements and generalization in comparison with previous works. During inference, RIG first reasons about the next action, produces potential action, and then predicts the action outcomes, which offers the agent a chance to review and self-correct based on the imagination before taking real actions. Experimental results show that the synergy of reasoning and imagination not only improves the robustness, generalization, and interoperability of generalist policy but also enables test-time scaling to enhance overall performance.</description>

      <title>Diffusion models applied to skin and oral cancer classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the application of diffusion models in medical image classification (DiffMIC), focusing on skin and oral lesions. Utilizing the datasets PAD-UFES-20 for skin cancer and P-NDB-UFES for oral cancer, the diffusion model demonstrated competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers. Specifically, for the PAD-UFES-20 dataset, the model achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.6457 for six-class classification and 0.8357 for binary classification (cancer vs. non-cancer). For the P-NDB-UFES dataset, it attained a balanced accuracy of 0.9050. These results suggest that diffusion models are viable models for classifying medical images of skin and oral lesions. In addition, we investigate the robustness of the model trained on PAD-UFES-20 for skin cancer but tested on the clinical images of the HIBA dataset.</description>

      <title>CrossWordBench: Evaluating the Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs and LVLMs with Controllable Puzzle Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing reasoning evaluation frameworks for Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) predominantly either assess text-based reasoning or vision-language understanding capabilities, with limited dynamic interplay between textual and visual constraints. To address this limitation, we introduce CrossWordBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of both LLMs and LVLMs through the medium of crossword puzzles-a task requiring multimodal adherence to semantic constraints from text-based clues and intersectional constraints from visual grid structures. CrossWordBench leverages a controllable puzzle generation framework that produces puzzles in multiple formats (text and image) and offers different evaluation strategies ranging from direct puzzle solving to interactive modes. Our extensive evaluation of over 20 models reveals that reasoning LLMs outperform non-reasoning models substantially by effectively leveraging crossing-letter constraints. We further demonstrate that LVLMs struggle with the task, showing a strong correlation between their puzzle-solving performance and grid-parsing accuracy. Our findings offer insights into the limitations of the reasoning capabilities of current LLMs and LVLMs, and provide an effective approach for creating multimodal constrained tasks for future evaluations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microfluidic Live-Cell Imaging yields data on microbial cell factories. However, continuous acquisition is challenging as high-throughput experiments often lack realtime insights, delaying responses to stochastic events. We introduce three components in the Experiment Automation Pipeline for Event-Driven Microscopy to Smart Microfluidic Single-Cell Analysis: a fast, accurate Deep Learning autofocusing method predicting the focus offset, an evaluation of real-time segmentation methods and a realtime data analysis dashboard. Our autofocusing achieves a Mean Absolute Error of 0.0226\textmu m with inference times below 50~ms. Among eleven Deep Learning segmentation methods, Cellpose~3 reached a Panoptic Quality of 93.58\%, while a distance-based method is fastest (121~ms, Panoptic Quality 93.02\%). All six Deep Learning Foundation Models were unsuitable for real-time segmentation.</description>

      <title>CF-CAM: Gradient Perturbation Mitigation and Feature Stabilization for Reliable Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As deep learning continues to advance, the opacity of neural network decision-making remains a critical challenge, limiting trust and applicability in high-stakes domains. Class Activation Mapping (CAM) techniques have emerged as a key approach to visualizing model decisions, yet existing methods face inherent trade-offs. Gradient-based CAM variants suffer from sensitivity to gradient perturbations, leading to unstable and unreliable explanations. Conversely, gradient-free approaches mitigate gradient instability but incur significant computational overhead and inference latency. To address these limitations, we propose Cluster Filter Class Activation Map (CF-CAM), a novel framework that reintroduces gradient-based weighting while enhancing robustness against gradient noise. CF-CAM employs a hierarchical importance weighting strategy to balance discriminative feature preservation and noise elimination. A density-aware channel clustering via Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) groups semantically relevant feature channels and discard noise-prone activations. Additionally, cluster-conditioned gradient filtering leverages bilateral filters to refine gradient signals, preserving edge-aware localization while suppressing noise impact. Experiment results demonstrate that CF-CAM achieves superior interpretability performance while maintaining resilience to gradient perturbations, outperforming state-of-the-art CAM methods in faithfulness and robustness. By effectively mitigating gradient instability without excessive computational cost, CF-CAM provides a reliable solution for enhancing the interpretability of deep neural networks in critical applications such as medical diagnosis and autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>Detecting Glioma, Meningioma, and Pituitary Tumors, and Normal Brain Tissues based on Yolov11 and Yolov8 Deep Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and quick diagnosis of normal brain tissue Glioma, Meningioma, and Pituitary Tumors is crucial for optimal treatment planning and improved medical results. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely used as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for detecting brain abnormalities, including tumors. However, manual interpretation of MRI scans is often time-consuming, prone to human error, and dependent on highly specialized expertise. This paper proposes an advanced AI-driven technique to detecting glioma, meningioma, and pituitary brain tumors using YoloV11 and YoloV8 deep learning models.
  Methods: Using a transfer learning-based fine-tuning approach, we integrate cutting-edge deep learning techniques with medical imaging to classify brain tumors into four categories: No-Tumor, Glioma, Meningioma, and Pituitary Tumors.
  Results: The study utilizes the publicly accessible CE-MRI Figshare dataset and involves fine-tuning pre-trained models YoloV8 and YoloV11 of 99.49% and 99.56% accuracies; and customized CNN accuracy of 96.98%. The results validate the potential of CNNs in achieving high precision in brain tumor detection and classification, highlighting their transformative role in medical imaging and diagnostics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel theoretical framework for understanding how diffusion models can learn disentangled representations. Within this framework, we establish identifiability conditions for general disentangled latent variable models, analyze training dynamics, and derive sample complexity bounds for disentangled latent subspace models. To validate our theory, we conduct disentanglement experiments across diverse tasks and modalities, including subspace recovery in latent subspace Gaussian mixture models, image colorization, image denoising, and voice conversion for speech classification. Additionally, our experiments show that training strategies inspired by our theory, such as style guidance regularization, consistently enhance disentanglement performance.</description>

      <title>GazeLLM: Multimodal LLMs incorporating Human Visual Attention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are advancing into Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), capable of processing image, audio, and video as well as text. Combining first-person video, MLLMs show promising potential for understanding human activities through video and audio, enabling many human-computer interaction and human-augmentation applications such as human activity support, real-world agents, and skill transfer to robots or other individuals. However, handling high-resolution, long-duration videos generates large latent representations, leading to substantial memory and processing demands, limiting the length and resolution MLLMs can manage. Reducing video resolution can lower memory usage but often compromises comprehension. This paper introduces a method that optimizes first-person video analysis by integrating eye-tracking data, and proposes a method that decomposes first-person vision video into sub areas for regions of gaze focus. By processing these selectively gazed-focused inputs, our approach achieves task comprehension equivalent to or even better than processing the entire image at full resolution, but with significantly reduced video data input (reduce the number of pixels to one-tenth), offering an efficient solution for using MLLMs to interpret and utilize human skills.</description>

      <title>CBIL: Collective Behavior Imitation Learning for Fish from Real Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reproducing realistic collective behaviors presents a captivating yet formidable challenge. Traditional rule-based methods rely on hand-crafted principles, limiting motion diversity and realism in generated collective behaviors. Recent imitation learning methods learn from data but often require ground truth motion trajectories and struggle with authenticity, especially in high-density groups with erratic movements. In this paper, we present a scalable approach, Collective Behavior Imitation Learning (CBIL), for learning fish schooling behavior directly from videos, without relying on captured motion trajectories. Our method first leverages Video Representation Learning, where a Masked Video AutoEncoder (MVAE) extracts implicit states from video inputs in a self-supervised manner. The MVAE effectively maps 2D observations to implicit states that are compact and expressive for following the imitation learning stage. Then, we propose a novel adversarial imitation learning method to effectively capture complex movements of the schools of fish, allowing for efficient imitation of the distribution for motion patterns measured in the latent space. It also incorporates bio-inspired rewards alongside priors to regularize and stabilize training. Once trained, CBIL can be used for various animation tasks with the learned collective motion priors. We further show its effectiveness across different species. Finally, we demonstrate the application of our system in detecting abnormal fish behavior from in-the-wild videos.</description>

      <title>ElaLoRA: Elastic &amp; Learnable Low-Rank Adaptation for Efficient Model Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely adopted technique for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models with minimal parameter updates. However, existing methods rely on fixed ranks or focus solely on either rank pruning or expansion, failing to adapt ranks dynamically to match the importance of different layers during training. In this work, we propose ElaLoRA, an adaptive low-rank adaptation framework that dynamically prunes and expands ranks based on gradient-derived importance scores. To the best of our knowledge, ElaLoRA is the first method that enables both rank pruning and expansion during fine-tuning. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ElaLoRA consistently outperforms existing PEFT methods across different parameter budgets. Furthermore, our studies validate that layers receiving higher rank allocations contribute more significantly to model performance, providing theoretical justification for our adaptive strategy. By introducing a principled and adaptive rank allocation mechanism, ElaLoRA offers a scalable and efficient fine-tuning solution, particularly suited for resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many self-supervised denoising approaches have been proposed in recent years. However, these methods tend to overly smooth images, resulting in the loss of fine structures that are essential for medical applications. In this paper, we propose DiffDenoise, a powerful self-supervised denoising approach tailored for medical images, designed to preserve high-frequency details. Our approach comprises three stages. First, we train a diffusion model on noisy images, using the outputs of a pretrained Blind-Spot Network as conditioning inputs. Next, we introduce a novel stabilized reverse sampling technique, which generates clean images by averaging diffusion sampling outputs initialized with a pair of symmetric noises. Finally, we train a supervised denoising network using noisy images paired with the denoised outputs generated by the diffusion model. Our results demonstrate that DiffDenoise outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both synthetic and real-world medical image denoising tasks. We provide both a theoretical foundation and practical insights, demonstrating the method's effectiveness across various medical imaging modalities and anatomical structures.</description>

      <title>Deconver: A Deconvolutional Network for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) have advanced medical image segmentation, they face inherent limitations such as local receptive fields in CNNs and high computational complexity in ViTs. This paper introduces Deconver, a novel network that integrates traditional deconvolution techniques from image restoration as a core learnable component within a U-shaped architecture. Deconver replaces computationally expensive attention mechanisms with efficient nonnegative deconvolution (NDC) operations, enabling the restoration of high-frequency details while suppressing artifacts. Key innovations include a backpropagation-friendly NDC layer based on a provably monotonic update rule and a parameter-efficient design. Evaluated across four datasets (ISLES'22, BraTS'23, GlaS, FIVES) covering both 2D and 3D segmentation tasks, Deconver achieves state-of-the-art performance in Dice scores and Hausdorff distance while reducing computational costs (FLOPs) by up to 90% compared to leading baselines. By bridging traditional image restoration with deep learning, this work offers a practical solution for high-precision segmentation in resource-constrained clinical workflows.

      <description>arXiv:2504.00420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building a lifelong robot that can effectively leverage prior knowledge for continuous skill acquisition remains significantly challenging. Despite the success of experience replay and parameter-efficient methods in alleviating catastrophic forgetting problem, naively applying these methods causes a failure to leverage the shared primitives between skills. To tackle these issues, we propose Primitive Prompt Learning (PPL), to achieve lifelong robot manipulation via reusable and extensible primitives. Within our two stage learning scheme, we first learn a set of primitive prompts to represent shared primitives through multi-skills pre-training stage, where motion-aware prompts are learned to capture semantic and motion shared primitives across different skills. Secondly, when acquiring new skills in lifelong span, new prompts are appended and optimized with frozen pretrained prompts, boosting the learning via knowledge transfer from old skills to new ones. For evaluation, we construct a large-scale skill dataset and conduct extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world tasks, demonstrating PPL's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Less is More: Efficient Black-box Attribution via Minimal Interpretable Subset Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To develop a trustworthy AI system, which aim to identify the input regions that most influence the models decisions. The primary task of existing attribution methods lies in efficiently and accurately identifying the relationships among input-prediction interactions. Particularly when the input data is discrete, such as images, analyzing the relationship between inputs and outputs poses a significant challenge due to the combinatorial explosion. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient black-box attribution mechanism, LiMA (Less input is More faithful for Attribution), which reformulates the attribution of important regions as an optimization problem for submodular subset selection. First, to accurately assess interactions, we design a submodular function that quantifies subset importance and effectively captures their impact on decision outcomes. Then, efficiently ranking input sub-regions by their importance for attribution, we improve optimization efficiency through a novel bidirectional greedy search algorithm. LiMA identifies both the most and least important samples while ensuring an optimal attribution boundary that minimizes errors. Extensive experiments on eight foundation models demonstrate that our method provides faithful interpretations with fewer regions and exhibits strong generalization, shows an average improvement of 36.3% in Insertion and 39.6% in Deletion. Our method also outperforms the naive greedy search in attribution efficiency, being 1.6 times faster. Furthermore, when explaining the reasons behind model prediction errors, the average highest confidence achieved by our method is, on average, 86.1% higher than that of state-of-the-art attribution algorithms.

      <title>FortisAVQA and MAVEN: a Benchmark Dataset and Debiasing Framework for Robust Multimodal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00487v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) is a challenging multimodal reasoning task requiring intelligent systems to answer natural language queries based on paired audio-video inputs accurately. However, existing AVQA approaches often suffer from overfitting to dataset biases, leading to poor robustness. Moreover, current datasets may not effectively diagnose these methods. To address these challenges, we first introduce a novel dataset, FortisAVQA, constructed in two stages: (1) rephrasing questions in the test split of the public MUSIC-AVQA dataset and (2) introducing distribution shifts across questions. The first stage expands the test space with greater diversity, while the second enables a refined robustness evaluation across rare, frequent, and overall question distributions. Second, we introduce a robust Multimodal Audio-Visual Epistemic Network (MAVEN) that leverages a multifaceted cycle collaborative debiasing strategy to mitigate bias learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on FortisAVQA, with a notable improvement of 7.81\%. Extensive ablation studies on both datasets validate the effectiveness of our debiasing components. Additionally, our evaluation reveals the limited robustness of existing multimodal QA methods. We also verify the plug-and-play capability of our strategy by integrating it with various baseline models across both datasets. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/reml-group/fortisavqa.</description>

      <title>Training Frozen Feature Pyramid DINOv2 for Eyelid Measurements with Infinite Encoding and Orthogonal Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate measurement of eyelid parameters such as Margin Reflex Distances (MRD1, MRD2) and Levator Function (LF) is critical in oculoplastic diagnostics but remains limited by manual, inconsistent methods. This study evaluates deep learning models: SE-ResNet, EfficientNet, and the vision transformer-based DINOv2 for automating these measurements using smartphone-acquired images. We assess performance across frozen and fine-tuned settings, using MSE, MAE, and R2 metrics. DINOv2, pretrained through self-supervised learning, demonstrates superior scalability and robustness, especially under frozen conditions ideal for mobile deployment. Lightweight regressors such as MLP and Deep Ensemble offer high precision with minimal computational overhead. To address class imbalance and improve generalization, we integrate focal loss, orthogonal regularization, and binary encoding strategies. Our results show that DINOv2 combined with these enhancements delivers consistent, accurate predictions across all tasks, making it a strong candidate for real-world, mobile-friendly clinical applications. This work highlights the potential of foundation models in advancing AI-powered ophthalmic care.</description>

      <title>Robust LiDAR-Camera Calibration with 2D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LiDAR-camera systems have become increasingly popular in robotics recently. A critical and initial step in integrating the LiDAR and camera data is the calibration of the LiDAR-camera system. Most existing calibration methods rely on auxiliary target objects, which often involve complex manual operations, whereas targetless methods have yet to achieve practical effectiveness. Recognizing that 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) can reconstruct geometric information from camera image sequences, we propose a calibration method that estimates LiDAR-camera extrinsic parameters using geometric constraints. The proposed method begins by reconstructing colorless 2DGS using LiDAR point clouds. Subsequently, we update the colors of the Gaussian splats by minimizing the photometric loss. The extrinsic parameters are optimized during this process. Additionally, we address the limitations of the photometric loss by incorporating the reprojection and triangulation losses, thereby enhancing the calibration robustness and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Orientation Scores should be a Piece of Cake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We axiomatically derive a family of wavelets for an orientation score, lifting from position space $\mathbb{R}^2$ to position and orientation space $\mathbb{R}^2\times S^1$, with fast reconstruction property, that minimise position-orientation uncertainty. We subsequently show that these minimum uncertainty states are well-approximated by cake wavelets: for standard parameters, the uncertainty gap of cake wavelets is less than 1.1, and in the limit, we prove the uncertainty gap tends to the minimum of 1. Next, we complete a previous theoretical argument that one does not have to train the lifting layer in (PDE-)G-CNNs, but can instead use cake wavelets. Finally, we show experimentally that in this way we can reduce the network complexity and improve the interpretability of (PDE-)G-CNNs, with only a slight impact on the model's performance.</description>

      <title>Scaling Up Resonate-and-Fire Networks for Fast Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) present a promising computing paradigm for neuromorphic processing of event-based sensor data. The resonate-and-fire (RF) neuron, in particular, appeals through its biological plausibility, complex dynamics, yet computational simplicity. Despite theoretically predicted benefits, challenges in parameter initialization and efficient learning inhibited the implementation of RF networks, constraining their use to a single layer. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by deriving the RF neuron as a structured state space model (SSM) from the HiPPO framework. We introduce S5-RF, a new SSM layer comprised of RF neurons based on the S5 model, that features a generic initialization scheme and fast training within a deep architecture. S5-RF scales for the first time a RF network to a deep SNN with up to four layers and achieves with 78.8% a new state-of-the-art result for recurrent SNNs on the Spiking Speech Commands dataset in under three hours of training time. Moreover, compared to the reference SNNs that solve our benchmarking tasks, it achieves similar performance with much fewer spiking operations. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/ThomasEHuber/s5-rf.</description>

      <title>Multi-Task Neural Architecture Search Using Architecture Embedding and Transfer Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-task neural architecture search (NAS) enables transferring architectural knowledge among different tasks. However, ranking disorder between the source task and the target task degrades the architecture performance on the downstream task. We propose KTNAS, an evolutionary cross-task NAS algorithm, to enhance transfer efficiency. Our data-agnostic method converts neural architectures into graphs and uses architecture embedding vectors for the subsequent architecture performance prediction. The concept of transfer rank, an instance-based classifier, is introduced into KTNAS to address the performance degradation issue. We verify the search efficiency on NASBench-201 and transferability to various vision tasks on Micro TransNAS-Bench-101. The scalability of our method is demonstrated on DARTs search space including CIFAR-10/100, MNIST/Fashion-MNIST, MedMNIST. Experimental results show that KTNAS outperforms peer multi-task NAS algorithms in search efficiency and downstream task performance. Ablation studies demonstrate the vital importance of transfer rank for transfer performance.</description>

      <title>Visual Environment-Interactive Planning for Embodied Complex-Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on Embodied Complex-Question Answering task, which means the embodied robot need to understand human questions with intricate structures and abstract semantics. The core of this task lies in making appropriate plans based on the perception of the visual environment. Existing methods often generate plans in a once-for-all manner, i.e., one-step planning. Such approach rely on large models, without sufficient understanding of the environment. Considering multi-step planning, the framework for formulating plans in a sequential manner is proposed in this paper. To ensure the ability of our framework to tackle complex questions, we create a structured semantic space, where hierarchical visual perception and chain expression of the question essence can achieve iterative interaction. This space makes sequential task planning possible. Within the framework, we first parse human natural language based on a visual hierarchical scene graph, which can clarify the intention of the question. Then, we incorporate external rules to make a plan for current step, weakening the reliance on large models. Every plan is generated based on feedback from visual perception, with multiple rounds of interaction until an answer is obtained. This approach enables continuous feedback and adjustment, allowing the robot to optimize its action strategy. To test our framework, we contribute a new dataset with more complex questions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs excellently and stably on complex tasks. And also, the feasibility of our approach in real-world scenarios has been established, indicating its practical applicability.</description>

      <title>Feature-Preserving Mesh Decimation for Normal Integration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Normal integration reconstructs 3D surfaces from normal maps obtained e.g. by photometric stereo. These normal maps capture surface details down to the pixel level but require large computational resources for integration at high resolutions. In this work, we replace the dense pixel grid with a sparse anisotropic triangle mesh prior to normal integration. We adapt the triangle mesh to the local geometry in the case of complex surface structures and remove oversampling from flat featureless regions. For high-resolution images, the resulting compression reduces normal integration runtimes from hours to minutes while maintaining high surface accuracy. Our main contribution is the derivation of the well-known quadric error measure from mesh decimation for screen space applications and its combination with optimal Delaunay triangulation.</description>

      <title>Agent S2: A Compositional Generalist-Specialist Framework for Computer Use Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computer use agents automate digital tasks by directly interacting with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) on computers and mobile devices, offering significant potential to enhance human productivity by completing an open-ended space of user queries. However, current agents face significant challenges: imprecise grounding of GUI elements, difficulties with long-horizon task planning, and performance bottlenecks from relying on single generalist models for diverse cognitive tasks. To this end, we introduce Agent S2, a novel compositional framework that delegates cognitive responsibilities across various generalist and specialist models. We propose a novel Mixture-of-Grounding technique to achieve precise GUI localization and introduce Proactive Hierarchical Planning, dynamically refining action plans at multiple temporal scales in response to evolving observations. Evaluations demonstrate that Agent S2 establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on three prominent computer use benchmarks. Specifically, Agent S2 achieves 18.9% and 32.7% relative improvements over leading baseline agents such as Claude Computer Use and UI-TARS on the OSWorld 15-step and 50-step evaluation. Moreover, Agent S2 generalizes effectively to other operating systems and applications, surpassing previous best methods by 52.8% on WindowsAgentArena and by 16.52% on AndroidWorld relatively.

      <title>Personalized Federated Training of Diffusion Models with Privacy Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scarcity of accessible, compliant, and ethically sourced data presents a considerable challenge to the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in sensitive fields like healthcare, finance, and biomedical research. Furthermore, access to unrestricted public datasets is increasingly constrained due to rising concerns over privacy, copyright, and competition. Synthetic data has emerged as a promising alternative, and diffusion models -- a cutting-edge generative AI technology -- provide an effective solution for generating high-quality and diverse synthetic data. In this paper, we introduce a novel federated learning framework for training diffusion models on decentralized private datasets. Our framework leverages personalization and the inherent noise in the forward diffusion process to produce high-quality samples while ensuring robust differential privacy guarantees. Our experiments show that our framework outperforms non-collaborative training methods, particularly in settings with high data heterogeneity, and effectively reduces biases and imbalances in synthetic data, resulting in fairer downstream models.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the WorldScore benchmark, the first unified benchmark for world generation. We decompose world generation into a sequence of next-scene generation tasks with explicit camera trajectory-based layout specifications, enabling unified evaluation of diverse approaches from 3D and 4D scene generation to video generation models. The WorldScore benchmark encompasses a curated dataset of 3,000 test examples that span diverse worlds: static and dynamic, indoor and outdoor, photorealistic and stylized. The WorldScore metrics evaluate generated worlds through three key aspects: controllability, quality, and dynamics. Through extensive evaluation of 19 representative models, including both open-source and closed-source ones, we reveal key insights and challenges for each category of models. Our dataset, evaluation code, and leaderboard can be found at https://haoyi-duan.github.io/WorldScore/</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in video depth estimation, existing methods exhibit inherent limitations in achieving geometric fidelity through the affine-invariant predictions, limiting their applicability in reconstruction and other metrically grounded downstream tasks. We propose GeometryCrafter, a novel framework that recovers high-fidelity point map sequences with temporal coherence from open-world videos, enabling accurate 3D/4D reconstruction, camera parameter estimation, and other depth-based applications. At the core of our approach lies a point map Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that learns a latent space agnostic to video latent distributions for effective point map encoding and decoding. Leveraging the VAE, we train a video diffusion model to model the distribution of point map sequences conditioned on the input videos. Extensive evaluations on diverse datasets demonstrate that GeometryCrafter achieves state-of-the-art 3D accuracy, temporal consistency, and generalization capability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10473v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Oriented object detection is one of the most fundamental and challenging tasks in remote sensing, aiming to locate and classify objects with arbitrary orientations. Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced the capabilities of oriented object detection. Given the rapid development of this field, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent advances in oriented object detection. To be specific, we begin by tracing the technical evolution from horizontal object detection to oriented object detection and highlighting the specific challenges, including feature misalignment, spatial misalignment, and oriented bounding box (OBB) regression problems. Subsequently, we further categorize existing methods into detection framework, OBB regression, and feature representations, and provide an in-depth discussion on how these approaches address the above challenges. In addition, we cover several publicly available datasets and evaluation protocols. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive comparison and analysis of state-of-the-art methods. Toward the end of this paper, we identify several future directions for oriented object detection.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Controllability of Diffusion Models via Feature Disentanglement and Realism-Enhanced Sampling Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14368v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Diffusion Models have shown promising performance, a lot of efforts have been made to improve the controllability of Diffusion Models. However, how to train Diffusion Models to have the disentangled latent spaces and how to naturally incorporate the disentangled conditions during the sampling process have been underexplored. In this paper, we present a training framework for feature disentanglement of Diffusion Models (FDiff). We further propose two sampling methods that can boost the realism of our Diffusion Models and also enhance the controllability. Concisely, we train Diffusion Models conditioned on two latent features, a spatial content mask, and a flattened style embedding. We rely on the inductive bias of the denoising process of Diffusion Models to encode pose/layout information in the content feature and semantic/style information in the style feature. Regarding the sampling methods, we first generalize Composable Diffusion Models (GCDM) by breaking the conditional independence assumption to allow for some dependence between conditional inputs, which is shown to be effective in realistic generation in our experiments. Second, we propose timestep-dependent weight scheduling for content and style features to further improve the performance. We also observe better controllability of our proposed methods compared to existing methods in image manipulation and image translation.</description>

      <title>RedMotion: Motion Prediction via Redundancy Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10840v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce RedMotion, a transformer model for motion prediction in self-driving vehicles that learns environment representations via redundancy reduction. Our first type of redundancy reduction is induced by an internal transformer decoder and reduces a variable-sized set of local road environment tokens, representing road graphs and agent data, to a fixed-sized global embedding. The second type of redundancy reduction is obtained by self-supervised learning and applies the redundancy reduction principle to embeddings generated from augmented views of road environments. Our experiments reveal that our representation learning approach outperforms PreTraM, Traj-MAE, and GraphDINO in a semi-supervised setting. Moreover, RedMotion achieves competitive results compared to HPTR or MTR++ in the Waymo Motion Prediction Challenge. Our open-source implementation is available at: https://github.com/kit-mrt/future-motion</description>

      <title>DG-TTA: Out-of-domain Medical Image Segmentation through Augmentation and Descriptor-driven Domain Generalization and Test-Time Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06275v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: Applying pre-trained medical deep learning segmentation models on out-of-domain images often yields predictions of insufficient quality. In this study, we propose to use a powerful generalizing descriptor along with augmentation to enable domain-generalized pre-training and test-time adaptation, achieving high-quality segmentation in unseen domains.
  Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study five different publicly available datasets (2012 to 2022) including 3D CT and MRI images are used to evaluate segmentation performance in out-of-domain scenarios. The settings include abdominal, spine, and cardiac imaging. The data is randomly split into training and test samples. Domain-generalized pre-training on source data is used to obtain the best initial performance in the target domain. We introduce the combination of the generalizing SSC descriptor and GIN intensity augmentation for optimal generalization. Segmentation results are subsequently optimized at test time, where we propose to adapt the pre-trained models for every unseen scan with a consistency scheme using the same augmentation-descriptor combination. The segmentation is evaluated using Dice similarity and Hausdorff distance and the significance of improvements is tested with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
  Results: The proposed generalized pre-training and subsequent test-time adaptation improves model performance significantly in CT to MRI cross-domain prediction for abdominal (+46.2% and +28.2% Dice), spine (+72.9%), and cardiac (+14.2% and +55.7% Dice) scenarios (p&lt;0.001).
  Conclusion: Our method enables optimal, independent usage of medical image source and target data and bridges domain gaps successfully with a compact and efficient methodology. Open-source code available at: https://github.com/multimodallearning/DG-TTA</description>

      <title>Phase-shifted remote photoplethysmography for estimating heart rate and blood pressure from facial video</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04560v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human health can be critically affected by cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, arrhythmias, and stroke. Heart rate and blood pressure are important biometric information for the monitoring of cardiovascular system and early diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. Existing methods for estimating the heart rate are based on electrocardiography and photoplethyomography, which require contacting the sensor to the skin surface. Moreover, catheter and cuff-based methods for measuring blood pressure cause inconvenience and have limited applicability. Therefore, in this thesis, we propose a vision-based method for estimating the heart rate and blood pressure. This thesis proposes a 2-stage deep learning framework consisting of a dual remote photoplethysmography network (DRP-Net) and bounded blood pressure network (BBP-Net). In the first stage, DRP-Net infers remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals for the acral and facial regions, and these phase-shifted rPPG signals are utilized to estimate the heart rate. In the second stage, BBP-Net integrates temporal features and analyzes phase discrepancy between the acral and facial rPPG signals to estimate SBP and DBP values. To improve the accuracy of estimating the heart rate, we employed a data augmentation method based on a frame interpolation model. Moreover, we designed BBP-Net to infer blood pressure within a predefined range by incorporating a scaled sigmoid function. Our method resulted in estimating the heart rate with the mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.78 BPM, reducing the MAE by 34.31 % compared to the recent method, on the MMSE-HR dataset. The MAE for estimating the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were 10.19 mmHg and 7.09 mmHg. On the V4V dataset, the MAE for the heart rate, SBP, and DBP were 3.83 BPM, 13.64 mmHg, and 9.4 mmHg, respectively.</description>

      <title>Stable-Makeup: When Real-World Makeup Transfer Meets Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current makeup transfer methods are limited to simple makeup styles, making them difficult to apply in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce Stable-Makeup, a novel diffusion-based makeup transfer method capable of robustly transferring a wide range of real-world makeup, onto user-provided faces. Stable-Makeup is based on a pre-trained diffusion model and utilizes a Detail-Preserving (D-P) makeup encoder to encode makeup details. It also employs content and structural control modules to preserve the content and structural information of the source image. With the aid of our newly added makeup cross-attention layers in U-Net, we can accurately transfer the detailed makeup to the corresponding position in the source image. After content-structure decoupling training, Stable-Makeup can maintain content and the facial structure of the source image. Moreover, our method has demonstrated strong robustness and generalizability, making it applicable to varioustasks such as cross-domain makeup transfer, makeup-guided text-to-image generation and so on. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our approach delivers state-of-the-art (SOTA) results among existing makeup transfer methods and exhibits a highly promising with broad potential applications in various related fields.

      <title>ConsistencyDet: A Few-step Denoising Framework for Object Detection Using the Consistency Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07773v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Object detection, a quintessential task in the realm of perceptual computing, can be tackled using a generative methodology. In the present study, we introduce a novel framework designed to articulate object detection as a denoising diffusion process, which operates on the perturbed bounding boxes of annotated entities. This framework, termed \textbf{ConsistencyDet}, leverages an innovative denoising concept known as the Consistency Model. The hallmark of this model is its self-consistency feature, which empowers the model to map distorted information from any time step back to its pristine state, thereby realizing a \textbf{``few-step denoising''} mechanism. Such an attribute markedly elevates the operational efficiency of the model, setting it apart from the conventional Diffusion Model. Throughout the training phase, ConsistencyDet initiates the diffusion sequence with noise-infused boxes derived from the ground-truth annotations and conditions the model to perform the denoising task. Subsequently, in the inference stage, the model employs a denoising sampling strategy that commences with bounding boxes randomly sampled from a normal distribution. Through iterative refinement, the model transforms an assortment of arbitrarily generated boxes into definitive detections. Comprehensive evaluations employing standard benchmarks, such as MS-COCO and LVIS, corroborate that ConsistencyDet surpasses other leading-edge detectors in performance metrics. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ConsistencyDet-37D5.</description>

      <title>MagicPose4D: Crafting Articulated Models with Appearance and Motion Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the success of 2D and 3D visual generative models, there is growing interest in generating 4D content. Existing methods primarily rely on text prompts to produce 4D content, but they often fall short of accurately defining complex or rare motions. To address this limitation, we propose MagicPose4D, a novel framework for refined control over both appearance and motion in 4D generation. Unlike current 4D generation methods, MagicPose4D accepts monocular videos or mesh sequences as motion prompts, enabling precise and customizable motion control. MagicPose4D comprises two key modules: (i) Dual-Phase 4D Reconstruction Module, which operates in two phases. The first phase focuses on capturing the model's shape using accurate 2D supervision and less accurate but geometrically informative 3D pseudo-supervision without imposing skeleton constraints. The second phase extracts the 3D motion (skeleton poses) using more accurate pseudo-3D supervision, obtained in the first phase and introduces kinematic chain-based skeleton constraints to ensure physical plausibility. Additionally, we propose a Global-local Chamfer loss that aligns the overall distribution of predicted mesh vertices with the supervision while maintaining part-level alignment without extra annotations. (ii) Cross-category Motion Transfer Module, which leverages the extracted motion from the 4D reconstruction module and uses a kinematic-chain-based skeleton to achieve cross-category motion transfer. It ensures smooth transitions between frames through dynamic rigidity, facilitating robust generalization without additional training. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MagicPose4D significantly improves the accuracy and consistency of 4D content generation, outperforming existing methods in various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Alleviating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models through Hallucination-Induced Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15356v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated exceptional abilities in understanding multimodal data, they invariably suffer from hallucinations, leading to a disconnect between the generated text and the corresponding images. Almost all current visual contrastive decoding methods attempt to mitigate these hallucinations by introducing visual uncertainty information that appropriately widens the contrastive logits gap between hallucinatory and targeted ones. However, due to uncontrollable nature of the global visual uncertainty, they struggle to precisely induce the hallucinatory tokens, which severely limits their effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and may even lead to the generation of undesired hallucinations. To tackle this issue, we conducted the theoretical analysis to promote the effectiveness of contrast decoding. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel optimization strategy named Hallucination-Induced Optimization (HIO). This strategy seeks to amplify the contrast between hallucinatory and targeted tokens relying on a fine-tuned theoretical preference model (i.e., Contrary Bradley-Terry Model), thereby facilitating efficient contrast decoding to alleviate hallucinations in LVLMs. Extensive experimental research demonstrates that our HIO strategy can effectively reduce hallucinations in LVLMs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>GaussianRoom: Improving 3D Gaussian Splatting with SDF Guidance and Monocular Cues for Indoor Scene Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embodied intelligence requires precise reconstruction and rendering to simulate large-scale real-world data. Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently demonstrated high-quality results with real-time performance, it still faces challenges in indoor scenes with large, textureless regions, resulting in incomplete and noisy reconstructions due to poor point cloud initialization and underconstrained optimization. Inspired by the continuity of signed distance field (SDF), which naturally has advantages in modeling surfaces, we propose a unified optimization framework that integrates neural signed distance fields (SDFs) with 3DGS for accurate geometry reconstruction and real-time rendering. This framework incorporates a neural SDF field to guide the densification and pruning of Gaussians, enabling Gaussians to model scenes accurately even with poor initialized point clouds. Simultaneously, the geometry represented by Gaussians improves the efficiency of the SDF field by piloting its point sampling. Additionally, we introduce two regularization terms based on normal and edge priors to resolve geometric ambiguities in textureless areas and enhance detail accuracy. Extensive experiments in ScanNet and ScanNet++ show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis.</description>

      <title>Self-Calibrating 4D Novel View Synthesis from Monocular Videos Using Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has significantly elevated scene reconstruction efficiency and novel view synthesis (NVS) accuracy compared to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), particularly for dynamic scenes. However, current 4D NVS methods, whether based on GS or NeRF, primarily rely on camera parameters provided by COLMAP and even utilize sparse point clouds generated by COLMAP for initialization, which lack accuracy as well are time-consuming. This sometimes results in poor dynamic scene representation, especially in scenes with large object movements, or extreme camera conditions e.g. small translations combined with large rotations. Some studies simultaneously optimize the estimation of camera parameters and scenes, supervised by additional information like depth, optical flow, etc. obtained from off-the-shelf models. Using this unverified information as ground truth can reduce robustness and accuracy, which does frequently occur for long monocular videos (with e.g. &gt; hundreds of frames). We propose a novel approach that learns a high-fidelity 4D GS scene representation with self-calibration of camera parameters. It includes the extraction of 2D point features that robustly represent 3D structure, and their use for subsequent joint optimization of camera parameters and 3D structure towards overall 4D scene optimization. We demonstrate the accuracy and time efficiency of our method through extensive quantitative and qualitative experimental results on several standard benchmarks. The results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods for 4D novel view synthesis. The source code will be released soon at https://github.com/fangli333/SC-4DGS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate hyperspectral image (HSI) interpretation is critical for providing valuable insights into various earth observation-related applications such as urban planning, precision agriculture, and environmental monitoring. However, existing HSI processing methods are predominantly task-specific and scene-dependent, which severely limits their ability to transfer knowledge across tasks and scenes, thereby reducing the practicality in real-world applications. To address these challenges, we present HyperSIGMA, a vision transformer-based foundation model that unifies HSI interpretation across tasks and scenes, scalable to over one billion parameters. To overcome the spectral and spatial redundancy inherent in HSIs, we introduce a novel sparse sampling attention (SSA) mechanism, which effectively promotes the learning of diverse contextual features and serves as the basic block of HyperSIGMA. HyperSIGMA integrates spatial and spectral features using a specially designed spectral enhancement module. In addition, we construct a large-scale hyperspectral dataset, HyperGlobal-450K, for pre-training, which contains about 450K hyperspectral images, significantly surpassing existing datasets in scale. Extensive experiments on various high-level and low-level HSI tasks demonstrate HyperSIGMA's versatility and superior representational capability compared to current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, HyperSIGMA shows significant advantages in scalability, robustness, cross-modal transferring capability, real-world applicability, and computational efficiency. The code and models will be released at https://github.com/WHU-Sigma/HyperSIGMA.</description>

      <title>View-Invariant Pixelwise Anomaly Detection in Multi-object Scenes with Adaptive View Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual anomaly detection in the built environment is a valuable tool for applications such as infrastructure assessment, construction monitoring, security surveillance, and urban planning. Anomaly detection approaches are typically unsupervised and work by detecting deviations from an expected state where no assumptions are made exact type of deviation. Unsupervised pixel-level anomaly detection methods have been developed to successfully recognize and segment anomalies; however, existing techniques are designed for industrial settings with a fixed camera position. In the built environment, images are periodically captured by a camera operated manually or mounted on aerial or ground vehicles. The camera pose between successive collections may vary widely voiding a fundamental assumption in existing anomaly detection approaches. To address this gap, we introduce the problem of Scene Anomaly Detection (Scene AD), where the goal is to detect anomalies from two sets of images: one set without anomalies and one set that may or may not contain anomalies. No labeled semantic segmentation data are provided for training. We propose a novel network, OmniAD, to tackle Scene AD by refining the reverse distillation anomaly detection method, leading to a 40\% improvement in pixel-level anomaly detection. Additionally, we introduce two new data augmentation strategies that leverage novel view synthesis and camera localization to enhance generalization. We evaluate our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively on a new dataset, ToyCity the first Scene AD dataset featuring multiple objects as well as on the established single object centric dataset, MAD. Our method demonstrates marked improvement over baseline approaches, paving the way for robust anomaly detection in scenes with real-world camera pose variations commonly observed in the built environment. https://drags99.github.io/OmniAD/</description>

Abstract: Cognitive textual and visual reasoning tasks, including puzzles, series, and analogies, demand the ability to quickly reason, decipher, and evaluate patterns both textually and spatially. Due to extensive training on vast amounts of human-curated data, LLMs and VLMs excel in common-sense reasoning tasks, however still struggle with more complex reasoning that demands deeper cognitive understanding. We introduce NTSEBench, a new dataset designed to evaluate cognitive multi-modal reasoning and problem-solving skills of large models. The dataset contains 2728 multiple-choice questions, accompanied by a total of 4,642 images, categorized into 26 different types. These questions are drawn from the nationwide NTSE examination in India and feature a mix of visual and textual general aptitude challenges, designed to assess intelligence and critical thinking skills beyond mere rote learning. We establish baselines on the dataset using state-of-the-art LLMs and VLMs. To facilitate a comparison between open source and propriety models, we propose four distinct modeling strategies to handle different modalities -- text and images -- in the dataset instances.</description>

      <title>MedTrinity-25M: A Large-scale Multimodal Dataset with Multigranular Annotations for Medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces MedTrinity-25M, a comprehensive, large-scale multimodal dataset for medicine, covering over 25 million images across 10 modalities with multigranular annotations for more than 65 diseases. These multigranular annotations encompass both global information, such as modality and organ detection, and local information like ROI analysis, lesion texture, and region-wise correlations. Unlike the existing multimodal datasets, which are limited by the availability of image-text pairs, we have developed the first automated pipeline that scales up multimodal data by generating multigranular visual and textual annotations in the form of image-ROI-description triplets without the need for any paired text descriptions. Specifically, data from over 30 different sources have been collected, preprocessed, and grounded using domain-specific expert models to identify ROIs related to abnormal regions. We then build a comprehensive knowledge base and prompt multimodal large language models to perform retrieval-augmented generation with the identified ROIs as guidance, resulting in multigranular textual descriptions. Compared to existing datasets, MedTrinity-25M provides the most enriched annotations, supporting a comprehensive range of multimodal tasks such as captioning and report generation, as well as vision-centric tasks like classification and segmentation. We propose LLaVA-Tri by pretraining LLaVA on MedTrinity-25M, achieving state-of-the-art performance on VQA-RAD, SLAKE, and PathVQA, surpassing representative SOTA multimodal large language models. Furthermore, MedTrinity-25M can also be utilized to support large-scale pre-training of multimodal medical AI models, contributing to the development of future foundation models in the medical domain. We will make our dataset available.</description>

      <title>Content-decoupled Contrastive Learning-based Implicit Degradation Modeling for Blind Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implicit degradation modeling-based blind super-resolution (SR) has attracted more increasing attention in the community due to its excellent generalization to complex degradation scenarios and wide application range. How to extract more discriminative degradation representations and fully adapt them to specific image features is the key to this task. In this paper, we propose a new Content-decoupled Contrastive Learning-based blind image super-resolution (CdCL) framework following the typical blind SR pipeline. This framework introduces negative-free contrastive learning technique for the first time to model the implicit degradation representation, in which a new cyclic shift sampling strategy is designed to ensure decoupling between content features and degradation features from the data perspective, thereby improving the purity and discriminability of the learned implicit degradation space. In addition, we propose a detail-aware implicit degradation adapting module that can better adapt degradation representations to specific LR features by enhancing the basic adaptation unit's perception of image details, significantly reducing the overall SR model complexity. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real data show that our method achieves highly competitive quantitative and qualitative results in various degradation settings while obviously reducing parameters and computational costs, validating the feasibility of designing practical and lightweight blind SR tools.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-augmented Few-shot Medical Image Segmentation with Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical decision-making, but the scarcity of annotated data presents significant challenges. Few-shot segmentation (FSS) methods show promise but often require training on the target domain and struggle to generalize across different modalities. Similarly, adapting foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for medical imaging has limitations, including the need for finetuning and domain-specific adaptation. To address these issues, we propose a novel method that adapts DINOv2 and Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) for retrieval-augmented few-shot medical image segmentation. Our approach uses DINOv2's feature as query to retrieve similar samples from limited annotated data, which are then encoded as memories and stored in memory bank. With the memory attention mechanism of SAM 2, the model leverages these memories as conditions to generate accurate segmentation of the target image. We evaluated our framework on three medical image segmentation tasks, demonstrating superior performance and generalizability across various modalities without the need for any retraining or finetuning. Overall, this method offers a practical and effective solution for few-shot medical image segmentation and holds significant potential as a valuable annotation tool in clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Exploring Scene Affinity for Semi-Supervised LiDAR Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores scene affinity (AIScene), namely intra-scene consistency and inter-scene correlation, for semi-supervised LiDAR semantic segmentation in driving scenes. Adopting teacher-student training, AIScene employs a teacher network to generate pseudo-labeled scenes from unlabeled data, which then supervise the student network's learning. Unlike most methods that include all points in pseudo-labeled scenes for forward propagation but only pseudo-labeled points for backpropagation, AIScene removes points without pseudo-labels, ensuring consistency in both forward and backward propagation within the scene. This simple point erasure strategy effectively prevents unsupervised, semantically ambiguous points (excluded in backpropagation) from affecting the learning of pseudo-labeled points. Moreover, AIScene incorporates patch-based data augmentation, mixing multiple scenes at both scene and instance levels. Compared to existing augmentation techniques that typically perform scene-level mixing between two scenes, our method enhances the semantic diversity of labeled (or pseudo-labeled) scenes, thereby improving the semi-supervised performance of segmentation models. Experiments show that AIScene outperforms previous methods on two popular benchmarks across four settings, achieving notable improvements of 1.9% and 2.1% in the most challenging 1% labeled data.</description>

      <title>Attention-Guided Multi-scale Interaction Network for Face Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, CNN and Transformer hybrid networks demonstrated excellent performance in face super-resolution (FSR) tasks. Since numerous features at different scales in hybrid networks, how to fuse these multi-scale features and promote their complementarity is crucial for enhancing FSR. However, existing hybrid network-based FSR methods ignore this, only simply combining the Transformer and CNN. To address this issue, we propose an attention-guided Multi-scale interaction network (AMINet), which contains local and global feature interactions and encoder-decoder phase feature interactions. Specifically, we propose a Local and Global Feature Interaction Module (LGFI) to promote fusions of global features and different receptive fields' local features extracted by our Residual Depth Feature Extraction Module (RDFE). Additionally, we propose a Selective Kernel Attention Fusion Module (SKAF) to adaptively select fusions of different features within LGFI and encoder-decoder phases. Our above design allows the free flow of multi-scale features from within modules and between encoder and decoder, which can promote the complementarity of different scale features to enhance FSR. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our method consistently performs well with less computational consumption and faster inference.</description>

      <title>DetailCLIP: Detail-Oriented CLIP for Fine-Grained Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce DetailCLIP: A Detail-Oriented CLIP to address the limitations of contrastive learning-based vision-language models, particularly CLIP, in handling detail-oriented and fine-grained tasks like segmentation. While CLIP and its variants excel in the global alignment of image and text representations, they often struggle to capture the fine-grained details necessary for precise segmentation. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework that employs patch-level comparison of self-distillation and pixel-level reconstruction losses, enhanced with an attention-based token removal mechanism. This approach selectively retains semantically relevant tokens, enabling the model to focus on the image's critical regions aligned with the specific functions of our model, including textual information processing, patch comparison, and image reconstruction, ensuring that the model learns high-level semantics and detailed visual features. Our experiments demonstrate that DetailCLIP surpasses existing CLIP-based and traditional self-supervised learning (SSL) models in segmentation accuracy and exhibits superior generalization across diverse datasets. DetailCLIP represents a significant advancement in vision-language modeling, offering a robust solution for tasks that demand high-level semantic understanding and detailed feature extraction. https://github.com/KishoreP1/DetailCLIP.</description>

      <title>Mind the GAP: Glimpse-based Active Perception improves generalization and sample efficiency of visual reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human capabilities in understanding visual relations are far superior to those of AI systems, especially for previously unseen objects. For example, while AI systems struggle to determine whether two such objects are visually the same or different, humans can do so with ease. Active vision theories postulate that the learning of visual relations is grounded in actions that we take to fixate objects and their parts by moving our eyes. In particular, the low-dimensional spatial information about the corresponding eye movements is hypothesized to facilitate the representation of relations between different image parts. Inspired by these theories, we develop a system equipped with a novel Glimpse-based Active Perception (GAP) that sequentially glimpses at the most salient regions of the input image and processes them at high resolution. Importantly, our system leverages the locations stemming from the glimpsing actions, along with the visual content around them, to represent relations between different parts of the image. The results suggest that the GAP is essential for extracting visual relations that go beyond the immediate visual content. Our approach reaches state-of-the-art performance on several visual reasoning tasks being more sample-efficient, and generalizing better to out-of-distribution visual inputs than prior models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, integrating the local modeling capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the global dependency strengths of Transformers has created a sensation in the semantic segmentation community. However, substantial computational workloads and high hardware memory demands remain major obstacles to their further application in real-time scenarios. In this work, we propose a Lightweight Multiple-Information Interaction Network (LMIINet) for real-time semantic segmentation, which effectively combines CNNs and Transformers while reducing redundant computations and memory footprints. It features Lightweight Feature Interaction Bottleneck (LFIB) modules comprising efficient convolutions that enhance context integration. Additionally, improvements are made to the Flatten Transformer by enhancing local and global feature interaction to capture detailed semantic information. Incorporating a combination coefficient learning scheme in both LFIB and Transformer blocks facilitates improved feature interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LMIINet excels in balancing accuracy and efficiency. With only 0.72M parameters and 11.74G FLOPs (Floating Point Operations Per Second), LMIINet achieves 72.0\% mIoU at 100 FPS (Frames Per Second) on the Cityscapes test set and 69.94\% mIoU (mean Intersection over Union) at 160 FPS on the CamVid test dataset using a single RTX2080Ti GPU.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models in 3D Vision: A Survey</title>

Abstract: In recent years, 3D vision has become a crucial field within computer vision, powering a wide range of applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, augmented reality, and medical imaging. This field relies on accurate perception, understanding, and reconstruction of 3D scenes from 2D images or text data sources. Diffusion models, originally designed for 2D generative tasks, offer the potential for more flexible, probabilistic methods that can better capture the variability and uncertainty present in real-world 3D data. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art methods that use diffusion models for 3D visual tasks, including but not limited to 3D object generation, shape completion, point-cloud reconstruction, and scene construction. We provide an in-depth discussion of the underlying mathematical principles of diffusion models, outlining their forward and reverse processes, as well as the various architectural advancements that enable these models to work with 3D datasets. We also discuss the key challenges in applying diffusion models to 3D vision, such as handling occlusions and varying point densities, and the computational demands of high-dimensional data. Finally, we discuss potential solutions, including improving computational efficiency, enhancing multimodal fusion, and exploring the use of large-scale pretraining for better generalization across 3D tasks. This paper serves as a foundation for future exploration and development in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>UniGS: Modeling Unitary 3D Gaussians for Novel View Synthesis from Sparse-view Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13195v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce UniGS, a novel 3D Gaussian reconstruction and novel view synthesis model that predicts a high-fidelity representation of 3D Gaussians from arbitrary number of posed sparse-view images. Previous methods often regress 3D Gaussians locally on a per-pixel basis for each view and then transfer them to world space and merge them through point concatenation. In contrast, Our approach involves modeling unitary 3D Gaussians in world space and updating them layer by layer. To leverage information from multi-view inputs for updating the unitary 3D Gaussians, we develop a DETR (DEtection TRansformer)-like framework, which treats 3D Gaussians as queries and updates their parameters by performing multi-view cross-attention (MVDFA) across multiple input images, which are treated as keys and values. This approach effectively avoids `ghosting' issue and allocates more 3D Gaussians to complex regions. Moreover, since the number of 3D Gaussians used as decoder queries is independent of the number of input views, our method allows arbitrary number of multi-view images as input without causing memory explosion or requiring retraining. Extensive experiments validate the advantages of our approach, showcasing superior performance over existing methods quantitatively (improving PSNR by 4.2 dB when trained on Objaverse and tested on the GSO benchmark) and qualitatively. The code will be released at https://github.com/jwubz123/UNIG.</description>

      <title>ControlSR: Taming Diffusion Models for Consistent Real-World Image Super Resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present ControlSR, a new method that can tame Diffusion Models for consistent real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR). Previous Real-ISR models mostly focus on how to activate more generative priors of text-to-image diffusion models to make the output high-resolution (HR) images look better. However, since these methods rely too much on the generative priors, the content of the output images is often inconsistent with the input LR ones. To mitigate the above issue, in this work, we tame Diffusion Models by effectively utilizing LR information to impose stronger constraints on the control signals from ControlNet in the latent space. We show that our method can produce higher-quality control signals, which enables the super-resolution results to be more consistent with the LR image and leads to clearer visual results. In addition, we also propose an inference strategy that imposes constraints in the latent space using LR information, allowing for the simultaneous improvement of fidelity and generative ability. Experiments demonstrate that our model can achieve better performance across multiple metrics on several test sets and generate more consistent SR results with LR images than existing methods.

      <title>An End-to-End Robust Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation Network with Single-Step Conditional Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16308v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) with a Noise-Conditional Framework (NCF) remain challenging for 3D scene understanding tasks, as the complex geometric details in scenes increase the difficulty of fitting the gradients of the data distribution (the scores) from semantic labels. This also results in longer training and inference time for DDPMs compared to non-DDPMs. From a different perspective, we delve deeply into the model paradigm dominated by the Conditional Network. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end robust semantic Segmentation Network based on a Conditional-Noise Framework (CNF) of DDPMs, named CDSegNet. Specifically, CDSegNet models the Noise Network (NN) as a learnable noise-feature generator. This enables the Conditional Network (CN) to understand 3D scene semantics under multi-level feature perturbations, enhancing the generalization in unseen scenes. Meanwhile, benefiting from the noise system of DDPMs, CDSegNet exhibits strong noise and sparsity robustness in experiments. Moreover, thanks to CNF, CDSegNet can generate the semantic labels in a single-step inference like non-DDPMs, due to avoiding directly fitting the scores from semantic labels in the dominant network of CDSegNet. On public indoor and outdoor benchmarks, CDSegNet significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Devils in Middle Layers of Large Vision-Language Models: Interpreting, Detecting and Mitigating Object Hallucinations via Attention Lens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) significantly undermine their reliability, motivating researchers to explore the causes of hallucination. However, most studies primarily focus on the language aspect rather than the visual. In this paper, we address how LVLMs process visual information and whether this process causes hallucination. Firstly, we use the attention lens to identify the stages at which LVLMs handle visual data, discovering that the middle layers are crucial. Moreover, we find that these layers can be further divided into two stages: ''visual information enrichment'' and ''semantic refinement'' which respectively propagate visual data to object tokens and interpret it through text. By analyzing attention patterns during the visual information enrichment stage, we find that real tokens consistently receive higher attention weights than hallucinated ones, serving as a strong indicator of hallucination. Further examination of multi-head attention maps reveals that hallucination tokens often result from heads interacting with inconsistent objects. Based on these insights, we propose a simple inference-time method that adjusts visual attention by integrating information across various heads. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this approach effectively mitigates hallucinations in mainstream LVLMs without additional training costs.

      <description>arXiv:2411.16801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present BootComp, a novel framework based on text-to-image diffusion models for controllable human image generation with multiple reference garments. Here, the main bottleneck is data acquisition for training: collecting a large-scale dataset of high-quality reference garment images per human subject is quite challenging, i.e., ideally, one needs to manually gather every single garment photograph worn by each human. To address this, we propose a data generation pipeline to construct a large synthetic dataset, consisting of human and multiple-garment pairs, by introducing a model to extract any reference garment images from each human image. To ensure data quality, we also propose a filtering strategy to remove undesirable generated data based on measuring perceptual similarities between the garment presented in human image and extracted garment. Finally, by utilizing the constructed synthetic dataset, we train a diffusion model having two parallel denoising paths that use multiple garment images as conditions to generate human images while preserving their fine-grained details. We further show the wide-applicability of our framework by adapting it to different types of reference-based generation in the fashion domain, including virtual try-on, and controllable human image generation with other conditions, e.g., pose, face, etc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern 3D generation methods can rapidly create shapes from sparse or single views, but their outputs often lack geometric detail due to computational constraints. We present DetailGen3D, a generative approach specifically designed to enhance these generated 3D shapes. Our key insight is to model the coarse-to-fine transformation directly through data-dependent flows in latent space, avoiding the computational overhead of large-scale 3D generative models. We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively enhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches, from single-view to sparse multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DetailGen3D achieves high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while maintaining efficiency in training.</description>

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has been recently enabled by transformer-based diffusion models, but current T2V models lack capabilities in adhering to the real-world common knowledge and physical rules, due to their limited understanding of physical realism and deficiency in temporal modeling. Existing solutions are either data-driven or require extra model inputs, but cannot be generalizable to out-of-distribution domains. In this paper, we present PhyT2V, a new data-independent T2V technique that expands the current T2V model's capability of video generation to out-of-distribution domains, by enabling chain-of-thought and step-back reasoning in T2V prompting. Our experiments show that PhyT2V improves existing T2V models' adherence to real-world physical rules by 2.3x, and achieves 35% improvement compared to T2V prompt enhancers.

      <title>Feed-Forward Bullet-Time Reconstruction of Dynamic Scenes from Monocular Videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in static feed-forward scene reconstruction have demonstrated significant progress in high-quality novel view synthesis. However, these models often struggle with generalizability across diverse environments and fail to effectively handle dynamic content. We present BTimer (short for BulletTimer), the first motion-aware feed-forward model for real-time reconstruction and novel view synthesis of dynamic scenes. Our approach reconstructs the full scene in a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation at a given target ('bullet') timestamp by aggregating information from all the context frames. Such a formulation allows BTimer to gain scalability and generalization by leveraging both static and dynamic scene datasets. Given a casual monocular dynamic video, BTimer reconstructs a bullet-time scene within 150ms while reaching state-of-the-art performance on both static and dynamic scene datasets, even compared with optimization-based approaches.</description>

      <title>VidHalluc: Evaluating Temporal Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models for Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently shown significant advancements in video understanding, excelling in content reasoning and instruction-following tasks. However, hallucination, where models generate inaccurate or misleading content, remains underexplored in the video domain. Building on the observation that MLLM visual encoders often fail to distinguish visually different yet semantically similar video pairs, we introduce VidHalluc, the largest benchmark designed to examine hallucinations in MLLMs for video understanding. It consists of 5,002 videos, paired to highlight cases prone to hallucinations. VidHalluc assesses hallucinations across three critical dimensions: (1) action, (2) temporal sequence, and (3) scene transition. Comprehensive testing shows that most MLLMs are vulnerable to hallucinations across these dimensions. Furthermore, we propose DINO-HEAL, a training-free method that reduces hallucinations by incorporating spatial saliency from DINOv2 to reweight visual features during inference. Our results show that DINO-HEAL consistently improves performance on VidHalluc, achieving an average improvement of 3.02% in mitigating hallucinations across all tasks. Both the VidHalluc benchmark and DINO-HEAL code are available at https://people-robots.github.io/vidhalluc.</description>

      <title>Mr. DETR: Instructive Multi-Route Training for Detection Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10028v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing methods enhance the training of detection transformers by incorporating an auxiliary one-to-many assignment. In this work, we treat the model as a multi-task framework, simultaneously performing one-to-one and one-to-many predictions. We investigate the roles of each component in the transformer decoder across these two training targets, including self-attention, cross-attention, and feed-forward network. Our empirical results demonstrate that any independent component in the decoder can effectively learn both targets simultaneously, even when other components are shared. This finding leads us to propose a multi-route training mechanism, featuring a primary route for one-to-one prediction and two auxiliary training routes for one-to-many prediction. We enhance the training mechanism with a novel instructive self-attention that dynamically and flexibly guides object queries for one-to-many prediction. The auxiliary routes are removed during inference, ensuring no impact on model architecture or inference cost. We conduct extensive experiments on various baselines, achieving consistent improvements as shown in Figure 1. Project page: https://visual-ai.github.io/mrdetr</description>

      <title>IDArb: Intrinsic Decomposition for Arbitrary Number of Input Views and Illuminations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Capturing geometric and material information from images remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Traditional optimization-based methods often require hours of computational time to reconstruct geometry, material properties, and environmental lighting from dense multi-view inputs, while still struggling with inherent ambiguities between lighting and material. On the other hand, learning-based approaches leverage rich material priors from existing 3D object datasets but face challenges with maintaining multi-view consistency. In this paper, we introduce IDArb, a diffusion-based model designed to perform intrinsic decomposition on an arbitrary number of images under varying illuminations. Our method achieves accurate and multi-view consistent estimation on surface normals and material properties. This is made possible through a novel cross-view, cross-domain attention module and an illumination-augmented, view-adaptive training strategy. Additionally, we introduce ARB-Objaverse, a new dataset that provides large-scale multi-view intrinsic data and renderings under diverse lighting conditions, supporting robust training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IDArb outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. Moreover, our approach facilitates a range of downstream tasks, including single-image relighting, photometric stereo, and 3D reconstruction, highlighting its broad applications in realistic 3D content creation.</description>

      <title>Interact with me: Joint Egocentric Forecasting of Intent to Interact, Attitude and Social Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For efficient human-agent interaction, an agent should proactively recognize their target user and prepare for upcoming interactions. We formulate this challenging problem as the novel task of jointly forecasting a person's intent to interact with the agent, their attitude towards the agent and the action they will perform, from the agent's (egocentric) perspective. So we propose \emph{SocialEgoNet} - a graph-based spatiotemporal framework that exploits task dependencies through a hierarchical multitask learning approach. SocialEgoNet uses whole-body skeletons (keypoints from face, hands and body) extracted from only 1 second of video input for high inference speed. For evaluation, we augment an existing egocentric human-agent interaction dataset with new class labels and bounding box annotations. Extensive experiments on this augmented dataset, named JPL-Social, demonstrate \emph{real-time} inference and superior performance (average accuracy across all tasks: 83.15\%) of our model outperforming several competitive baselines. The additional annotations and code will be available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Where am I? Cross-View Geo-localization with Natural Language Descriptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization identifies the locations of street-view images by matching them with geo-tagged satellite images or OSM. However, most existing studies focus on image-to-image retrieval, with fewer addressing text-guided retrieval, a task vital for applications like pedestrian navigation and emergency response. In this work, we introduce a novel task for cross-view geo-localization with natural language descriptions, which aims to retrieve corresponding satellite images or OSM database based on scene text descriptions. To support this task, we construct the CVG-Text dataset by collecting cross-view data from multiple cities and employing a scene text generation approach that leverages the annotation capabilities of Large Multimodal Models to produce high-quality scene text descriptions with localization details. Additionally, we propose a novel text-based retrieval localization method, CrossText2Loc, which improves recall by 10% and demonstrates excellent long-text retrieval capabilities. In terms of explainability, it not only provides similarity scores but also offers retrieval reasons. More information can be found at https://yejy53.github.io/CVG-Text/ .</description>

      <title>Data-Free Group-Wise Fully Quantized Winograd Convolution via Learnable Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the revolutionary breakthroughs of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models for complex vision and downstream tasks, their extremely high computational and storage costs limit their usability. Quantization of diffusion models has been explored in recent works to reduce compute costs and memory bandwidth usage. To further improve inference time, fast convolution algorithms such as Winograd can be used for convolution layers, which account for a significant portion of computations in diffusion models. However, the significant quality loss of fully quantized Winograd using existing coarser-grained post-training quantization methods, combined with the complexity and cost of finetuning the Winograd transformation matrices for such large models to recover quality, makes them unsuitable for large-scale foundation models. Motivated by the presence of a large range of values in them, we investigate the impact of finer-grained group-wise quantization in quantizing diffusion models. While group-wise quantization can largely handle the fully quantized Winograd convolution, it struggles to deal with the large distribution imbalance in a sizable portion of the Winograd domain computation. To reduce range differences in the Winograd domain, we propose finetuning only the scale parameters of the Winograd transform matrices without using any domain-specific training data. Because our method does not depend on any training data, the generalization performance of quantized diffusion models is safely guaranteed. For text-to-image generation task, the 8-bit fully-quantized diffusion model with Winograd provides near-lossless quality (FID and CLIP scores) in comparison to the full-precision model. For image classification, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art Winograd PTQ method by 1.62% and 2.56% in top-1 ImageNet accuracy on ResNet18 and ResNet-34, respectively, with Winograd F(6, 3).</description>

      <title>DoubleDiffusion: Combining Heat Diffusion with Denoising Diffusion for Texture Generation on 3D Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03397v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of generating textures for 3D mesh assets. Existing approaches often rely on image diffusion models to generate multi-view image observations, which are then transformed onto the mesh surface to produce a single texture. However, due to the gap between multi-view images and 3D space, such process is susceptible to arange of issues such as geometric inconsistencies, visibility occlusion, and baking artifacts. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel approach that directly generates texture on 3D meshes. Our approach leverages heat dissipation diffusion, which serves as an efficient operator that propagates features on the geometric surface of a mesh, while remaining insensitive to the specific layout of the wireframe. By integrating this technique into a generative diffusion pipeline, we significantly improve the efficiency of texture generation compared to existing texture generation methods. We term our approach DoubleDiffusion, as it combines heat dissipation diffusion with denoising diffusion to enable native generative learning on 3D mesh surfaces.</description>

      <title>StarGen: A Spatiotemporal Autoregression Framework with Video Diffusion Model for Scalable and Controllable Scene Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05763v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large reconstruction and generative models have significantly improved scene reconstruction and novel view generation. However, due to compute limitations, each inference with these large models is confined to a small area, making long-range consistent scene generation challenging. To address this, we propose StarGen, a novel framework that employs a pre-trained video diffusion model in an autoregressive manner for long-range scene generation. The generation of each video clip is conditioned on the 3D warping of spatially adjacent images and the temporally overlapping image from previously generated clips, improving spatiotemporal consistency in long-range scene generation with precise pose control. The spatiotemporal condition is compatible with various input conditions, facilitating diverse tasks, including sparse view interpolation, perpetual view generation, and layout-conditioned city generation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate StarGen's superior scalability, fidelity, and pose accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

      <description>arXiv:2501.06897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce ActiveGAMER, an active mapping system that utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to achieve high-quality, real-time scene mapping and exploration. Unlike traditional NeRF-based methods, which are computationally demanding and restrict active mapping performance, our approach leverages the efficient rendering capabilities of 3DGS, allowing effective and efficient exploration in complex environments. The core of our system is a rendering-based information gain module that dynamically identifies the most informative viewpoints for next-best-view planning, enhancing both geometric and photometric reconstruction accuracy. ActiveGAMER also integrates a carefully balanced framework, combining coarse-to-fine exploration, post-refinement, and a global-local keyframe selection strategy to maximize reconstruction completeness and fidelity. Our system autonomously explores and reconstructs environments with state-of-the-art geometric and photometric accuracy and completeness, significantly surpassing existing approaches in both aspects. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets such as Replica and MP3D highlight ActiveGAMER's effectiveness in active mapping tasks.</description>

      <title>RePoseD: Efficient Relative Pose Estimation With Known Depth Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in monocular depth estimation methods (MDE) and their improved accuracy open new possibilities for their applications. In this paper, we investigate how monocular depth estimates can be used for relative pose estimation. In particular, we are interested in answering the question whether using MDEs improves results over traditional point-based methods. We propose a novel framework for estimating the relative pose of two cameras from point correspondences with associated monocular depths. Since depth predictions are typically defined up to an unknown scale or even both unknown scale and shift parameters, our solvers jointly estimate the scale or both the scale and shift parameters along with the relative pose. We derive efficient solvers considering different types of depths for three camera configurations: (1) two calibrated cameras, (2) two cameras with an unknown shared focal length, and (3) two cameras with unknown different focal lengths. Our new solvers outperform state-of-the-art depth-aware solvers in terms of speed and accuracy. In extensive real experiments on multiple datasets and with various MDEs, we discuss which depth-aware solvers are preferable in which situation. The code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Safe and Unsafe Corruptions via Anisotropy and Locality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-of-the-art machine learning systems are vulnerable to small perturbations to their input, where ``small'' is defined according to a threat model that assigns a positive threat to each perturbation. Most prior works define a task-agnostic, isotropic, and global threat, like the $\ell_p$ norm, where the magnitude of the perturbation fully determines the degree of the threat and neither the direction of the attack nor its position in space matter. However, common corruptions in computer vision, such as blur, compression, or occlusions, are not well captured by such threat models. This paper proposes a novel threat model called \texttt{Projected Displacement} (PD) to study robustness beyond existing isotropic and global threat models. The proposed threat model measures the threat of a perturbation via its alignment with \textit{unsafe directions}, defined as directions in the input space along which a perturbation of sufficient magnitude changes the ground truth class label. Unsafe directions are identified locally for each input based on observed training data. In this way, the PD threat model exhibits anisotropy and locality. Experiments on Imagenet-1k data indicate that, for any input, the set of perturbations with small PD threat includes \textit{safe} perturbations of large $\ell_p$ norm that preserve the true label, such as noise, blur and compression, while simultaneously excluding \textit{unsafe} perturbations that alter the true label. Unlike perceptual threat models based on embeddings of large-vision models, the PD threat model can be readily computed for arbitrary classification tasks without pre-training or finetuning. Further additional task annotation such as sensitivity to image regions or concept hierarchies can be easily integrated into the assessment of threat and thus the PD threat model presents practitioners with a flexible, task-driven threat specification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05979v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crafting magic and illusions is one of the most thrilling aspects of filmmaking, with visual effects (VFX) serving as the powerhouse behind unforgettable cinematic experiences. While recent advances in generative artificial intelligence have driven progress in generic image and video synthesis, the domain of controllable VFX generation remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel paradigm for animated VFX generation as image animation, where dynamic effects are generated from user-friendly textual descriptions and static reference images. Our work makes two primary contributions: (i) Open-VFX, the first high-quality VFX video dataset spanning 15 diverse effect categories, annotated with textual descriptions, instance segmentation masks for spatial conditioning, and start-end timestamps for temporal control. (ii) VFX Creator, a simple yet effective controllable VFX generation framework based on a Video Diffusion Transformer. The model incorporates a spatial and temporal controllable LoRA adapter, requiring minimal training videos. Specifically, a plug-and-play mask control module enables instance-level spatial manipulation, while tokenized start-end motion timestamps embedded in the diffusion process, alongside the text encoder, allow precise temporal control over effect timing and pace. Extensive experiments on the Open-VFX test set demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system in generating realistic and dynamic effects, achieving state-of-the-art performance and generalization ability in both spatial and temporal controllability. Furthermore, we introduce a specialized metric to evaluate the precision of temporal control. By bridging traditional VFX techniques with generative approaches, VFX Creator unlocks new possibilities for efficient and high-quality video effect generation, making advanced VFX accessible to a broader audience.</description>

Abstract: UAV-View Geo-Localization (UVGL) aims to achieve accurate localization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) by retrieving the most relevant GPS-tagged satellite images. However, existing methods heavily rely on pre-paired UAV-satellite images for supervised learning. Such dependency not only incurs high annotation costs but also severely limits scalability and practical deployment in open-world UVGL scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose an end-to-end self-supervised UVGL method. Our method leverages a shallow backbone network to extract initial features, employs clustering to generate pseudo labels, and adopts a dual-path contrastive learning architecture to learn discriminative intra-view representations. Furthermore, our method incorporates two core modules, the dynamic hierarchical memory learning module and the information consistency evolution learning module. The dynamic hierarchical memory learning module combines short-term and long-term memory to enhance intra-view feature consistency and discriminability. Meanwhile, the information consistency evolution learning module leverages a neighborhood-driven dynamic constraint mechanism to systematically capture implicit cross-view semantic correlations, thereby improving cross-view feature alignment. To further stabilize and strengthen the self-supervised training process, a pseudo-label enhancement strategy is introduced, which refines the quality of pseudo supervision. Our method ultimately constructs a unified cross-view feature representation space under self-supervised settings. Extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing self-supervised methods and even surpasses several state-of-the-art supervised methods.

      <title>VRM: Knowledge Distillation via Virtual Relation Matching</title>

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer the knowledge of a more capable yet cumbersome teacher model to a lightweight student model. In recent years, relation-based KD methods have fallen behind, as their instance-matching counterparts dominate in performance. In this paper, we revive relational KD by identifying and tackling several key issues in relation-based methods, including their susceptibility to overfitting and spurious responses. Specifically, we transfer novelly constructed affinity graphs that compactly encapsulate a wealth of beneficial inter-sample, inter-class, and inter-view correlations by exploiting virtual views and relations as a new kind of knowledge. As a result, the student has access to richer guidance signals and stronger regularisation throughout the distillation process. To further mitigate the adverse impact of spurious responses, we prune the affinity graphs by dynamically detaching redundant and unreliable edges. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed virtual relation matching (VRM) method over a range of models, architectures, and set-ups. For instance, VRM for the first time hits 74.0% accuracy for ResNet50-to-MobileNetV2 distillation on ImageNet, and improves DeiT-T by 14.44% on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet56 teacher. Thorough analyses are also conducted to gauge the soundness, properties, and complexity of our designs. Code and models will be released.</description>

Abstract: Existing vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have showcased an impressive capability to generalize well across various downstream tasks. These models leverage the synergy between visual and textual information, enabling them to understand and reason about the content present in images and text in a unified manner. This article provides a brief overview of CLIP based on few-shot prompt learning, including experimental data and technical characteristics of some methods. The purpose of this review is to provide a reference for researchers who have just started their research in generalizable prompting of CLIP through few-shot training for classification across 15 datasets and also to facilitate the integration of this field by researchers in other downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>PTDiffusion: Free Lunch for Generating Optical Illusion Hidden Pictures with Phase-Transferred Diffusion Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06186v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical illusion hidden picture is an interesting visual perceptual phenomenon where an image is cleverly integrated into another picture in a way that is not immediately obvious to the viewer. Established on the off-the-shelf text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model, we propose a novel training-free text-guided image-to-image (I2I) translation framework dubbed as \textbf{P}hase-\textbf{T}ransferred \textbf{Diffusion} Model (PTDiffusion) for hidden art syntheses. PTDiffusion harmoniously embeds an input reference image into arbitrary scenes described by the text prompts, producing illusion images exhibiting hidden visual cues of the reference image. At the heart of our method is a plug-and-play phase transfer mechanism that dynamically and progressively transplants diffusion features' phase spectrum from the denoising process to reconstruct the reference image into the one to sample the generated illusion image, realizing deep fusion of the reference structural information and the textual semantic information in the diffusion model latent space. Furthermore, we propose asynchronous phase transfer to enable flexible control to the degree of hidden content discernability. Our method bypasses any model training and fine-tuning process, all while substantially outperforming related text-guided I2I methods in image generation quality, text fidelity, visual discernibility, and contextual naturalness for illusion picture synthesis, as demonstrated by extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments. Our project is publically available at \href{https://xianggao1102.github.io/PTDiffusion_webpage/}{this web page}.</description>

Abstract: From image to video understanding, the capabilities of Multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) are increasingly powerful. However, most existing video understanding benchmarks are relatively short, which makes them inadequate for effectively evaluating the long-sequence modeling capabilities of MLLMs. This highlights the urgent need for a comprehensive and integrated long video understanding benchmark to assess the ability of MLLMs thoroughly. To this end, we propose ALLVB (ALL-in-One Long Video Understanding Benchmark). ALLVB's main contributions include: 1) It integrates 9 major video understanding tasks. These tasks are converted into video QA formats, allowing a single benchmark to evaluate 9 different video understanding capabilities of MLLMs, highlighting the versatility, comprehensiveness, and challenging nature of ALLVB. 2) A fully automated annotation pipeline using GPT-4o is designed, requiring only human quality control, which facilitates the maintenance and expansion of the benchmark. 3) It contains 1,376 videos across 16 categories, averaging nearly 2 hours each, with a total of 252k QAs. To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest long video understanding benchmark in terms of the number of videos, average duration, and number of QAs. We have tested various mainstream MLLMs on ALLVB, and the results indicate that even the most advanced commercial models have significant room for improvement. This reflects the benchmark's challenging nature and demonstrates the substantial potential for development in long video understanding.</description>

      <title>VisRL: Intention-Driven Visual Perception via Reinforced Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual understanding is inherently intention-driven - humans selectively focus on different regions of a scene based on their goals. Recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) enable flexible expression of such intentions through natural language, allowing queries to guide visual reasoning processes. Frameworks like Visual Chain-of-Thought have demonstrated the benefit of incorporating explicit reasoning steps, where the model predicts a focus region before answering a query. However, existing approaches rely heavily on supervised training with annotated intermediate bounding boxes, which severely limits scalability due to the combinatorial explosion of intention-region pairs. To overcome this limitation, we propose VisRL, the first framework that applies reinforcement learning (RL) to the problem of intention-driven visual perception. VisRL optimizes the entire visual reasoning process using only reward signals. By treating intermediate focus selection as an internal decision optimized through trial-and-error, our method eliminates the need for costly region annotations while aligning more closely with how humans learn to perceive the world. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that VisRL consistently outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating both its effectiveness and its strong generalization across different LMMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhangquanchen/VisRL.</description>

      <title>Astrea: A MOE-based Visual Understanding Model with Progressive Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) based on Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a pivotal paradigm in multimodal understanding, offering a powerful framework for integrating visual and linguistic information. However, the increasing complexity and diversity of tasks present significant challenges in coordinating load balancing across heterogeneous visual experts, where optimizing one specialist's performance often compromises others' capabilities. To address task heterogeneity and expert load imbalance, we propose Astrea, a novel multi-expert collaborative VLM architecture based on progressive pre-alignment. Astrea introduces three key innovations: 1) A heterogeneous expert coordination mechanism that integrates four specialized models (detection, segmentation, classification, captioning) into a comprehensive expert matrix covering essential visual comprehension elements; 2) A dynamic knowledge fusion strategy featuring progressive pre-alignment to harmonize experts within the VLM latent space through contrastive learning, complemented by probabilistically activated stochastic residual connections to preserve knowledge continuity; 3) An enhanced optimization framework utilizing momentum contrastive learning for long-range dependency modeling and adaptive weight allocators for real-time expert contribution calibration. Extensive evaluations across 12 benchmark tasks spanning VQA, image captioning, and cross-modal retrieval demonstrate Astrea's superiority over state-of-the-art models, achieving an average performance gain of +4.7\%. This study provides the first empirical demonstration that progressive pre-alignment strategies enable VLMs to overcome task heterogeneity limitations, establishing new methodological foundations for developing general-purpose multimodal agents.</description>

      <title>LVAgent: Long Video Understanding by Multi-Round Dynamical Collaboration of MLLM Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter significant challenges in modeling the temporal context within long videos. Currently, mainstream Agent-based methods use external tools (e.g., search engine, memory banks, OCR, retrieval models) to assist a single MLLM in answering long video questions. Despite such tool-based support, a solitary MLLM still offers only a partial understanding of long videos, resulting in limited performance. In order to better address long video tasks, we introduce LVAgent, the first framework enabling multi-round dynamic collaboration of MLLM agents in long video understanding. Our methodology consists of four key steps: 1. Selection: We pre-select appropriate agents from the model library to form optimal agent teams based on different tasks. 2. Perception: We design an effective retrieval scheme for long videos, improving the coverage of critical temporal segments while maintaining computational efficiency. 3. Action: Agents answer long video-related questions and exchange reasons. 4. Reflection: We evaluate the performance of each agent in each round of discussion and optimize the agent team for dynamic collaboration. The agents iteratively refine their answers by multi-round dynamical collaboration of MLLM agents. LVAgent is the first agent system method that outperforms all closed-source models (including GPT-4o) and open-source models (including InternVL-2.5 and Qwen2-VL) in the long video understanding tasks. Our LVAgent achieves an accuracy of 80% on four mainstream long video understanding tasks. Notably, on the LongVideoBench dataset, LVAgent improves accuracy by up to 13.3% compared with SOTA.</description>

      <title>4D LangSplat: 4D Language Gaussian Splatting via Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning 4D language fields to enable time-sensitive, open-ended language queries in dynamic scenes is essential for many real-world applications. While LangSplat successfully grounds CLIP features into 3D Gaussian representations, achieving precision and efficiency in 3D static scenes, it lacks the ability to handle dynamic 4D fields as CLIP, designed for static image-text tasks, cannot capture temporal dynamics in videos. Real-world environments are inherently dynamic, with object semantics evolving over time. Building a precise 4D language field necessitates obtaining pixel-aligned, object-wise video features, which current vision models struggle to achieve. To address these challenges, we propose 4D LangSplat, which learns 4D language fields to handle time-agnostic or time-sensitive open-vocabulary queries in dynamic scenes efficiently. 4D LangSplat bypasses learning the language field from vision features and instead learns directly from text generated from object-wise video captions via Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, we propose a multimodal object-wise video prompting method, consisting of visual and text prompts that guide MLLMs to generate detailed, temporally consistent, high-quality captions for objects throughout a video. These captions are encoded using a Large Language Model into high-quality sentence embeddings, which then serve as pixel-aligned, object-specific feature supervision, facilitating open-vocabulary text queries through shared embedding spaces. Recognizing that objects in 4D scenes exhibit smooth transitions across states, we further propose a status deformable network to model these continuous changes over time effectively. Our results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that 4D LangSplat attains precise and efficient results for both time-sensitive and time-agnostic open-vocabulary queries.</description>

      <title>PSF-4D: A Progressive Sampling Framework for View Consistent 4D Editing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11044v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instruction-guided generative models, especially those using text-to-image (T2I) and text-to-video (T2V) diffusion frameworks, have advanced the field of content editing in recent years. To extend these capabilities to 4D scene, we introduce a progressive sampling framework for 4D editing (PSF-4D) that ensures temporal and multi-view consistency by intuitively controlling the noise initialization during forward diffusion. For temporal coherence, we design a correlated Gaussian noise structure that links frames over time, allowing each frame to depend meaningfully on prior frames. Additionally, to ensure spatial consistency across views, we implement a cross-view noise model, which uses shared and independent noise components to balance commonalities and distinct details among different views. To further enhance spatial coherence, PSF-4D incorporates view-consistent iterative refinement, embedding view-aware information into the denoising process to ensure aligned edits across frames and views. Our approach enables high-quality 4D editing without relying on external models, addressing key challenges in previous methods. Through extensive evaluation on multiple benchmarks and multiple editing aspects (e.g., style transfer, multi-attribute editing, object removal, local editing, etc.), we show the effectiveness of our proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art 4D editing methods in diverse benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) Diffusion Models have achieved remarkable performance in generating high quality images. However, enabling precise control of continuous attributes, especially multiple attributes simultaneously, in a new domain (e.g., numeric values like eye openness or car width) with text-only guidance remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce the Attribute (Att) Adapter, a novel plug-and-play module designed to enable fine-grained, multi-attributes control in pretrained diffusion models. Our approach learns a single control adapter from a set of sample images that can be unpaired and contain multiple visual attributes. The Att-Adapter leverages the decoupled cross attention module to naturally harmonize the multiple domain attributes with text conditioning. We further introduce Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to the Att-Adapter to mitigate overfitting, matching the diverse nature of the visual world. Evaluations on two public datasets show that Att-Adapter outperforms all LoRA-based baselines in controlling continuous attributes. Additionally, our method enables a broader control range and also improves disentanglement across multiple attributes, surpassing StyleGAN-based techniques. Notably, Att-Adapter is flexible, requiring no paired synthetic data for training, and is easily scalable to multiple attributes within a single model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Videos, with their unique temporal dimension, demand precise grounded understanding, where answers are directly linked to visual, interpretable evidence. Despite significant breakthroughs in reasoning capabilities within Large Language Models, multi-modal reasoning - especially for videos - remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce VideoMind, a novel video-language agent designed for temporal-grounded video understanding. VideoMind incorporates two key innovations: (i) We identify essential capabilities for video temporal reasoning and develop a role-based agentic workflow, including a planner for coordinating different roles, a grounder for temporal localization, a verifier to assess temporal interval accuracy, and an answerer for question-answering. (ii) To efficiently integrate these diverse roles, we propose a novel Chain-of-LoRA strategy, enabling seamless role-switching via lightweight LoRA adaptors while avoiding the overhead of multiple models, thus balancing efficiency and flexibility. Extensive experiments on 14 public benchmarks, including 3 on grounded video question-answering (Grounded VideoQA), 6 on video temporal grounding (VTG), and 5 on general video question-answering (VideoQA), verify that our agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse video understanding tasks, underscoring its effectiveness in advancing video agent and long-form temporal reasoning.</description>

      <title>Think or Not Think: A Study of Explicit Thinking inRule-Based Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning for visual classification using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) and the role of the thinking process. We begin by exploring \textit{CLS-RL}, a method that leverages verifiable signals as rewards to encourage MLLMs to 'think' before classifying. Our experiments across \textbf{eleven} datasets demonstrate that CLS-RL achieves significant improvements over supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in both base-to-new generalization and few-shot learning scenarios. Notably, we observe a 'free-lunch' phenomenon where fine-tuning on one dataset unexpectedly enhances performance on others, suggesting that RL effectively teaches fundamental classification skills. However, we question whether the explicit thinking, a critical aspect of rule-based RL, is always beneficial or indispensable. Challenging the conventional assumption that complex reasoning enhances performance, we introduce \textit{No-Thinking-RL}, a novel approach that minimizes the model's thinking during fine-tuning by utilizing an equality accuracy reward. Our experiments reveal that No-Thinking-RL achieves superior in-domain performance and generalization capabilities compared to CLS-RL, while requiring significantly less fine-tuning time. This underscores that, contrary to prevailing assumptions, reducing the thinking process can lead to more efficient and effective MLLM fine-tuning for some visual tasks. Furthermore, No-Thinking-RL demonstrates enhanced performance on other visual benchmarks, such as a 6.4\% improvement on CVBench. We hope our findings provides insights into the impact of thinking in RL-based fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Image as an IMU: Estimating Camera Motion from a Single Motion-Blurred Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many robotics and VR/AR applications, fast camera motions cause a high level of motion blur, causing existing camera pose estimation methods to fail. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages motion blur as a rich cue for motion estimation rather than treating it as an unwanted artifact. Our approach works by predicting a dense motion flow field and a monocular depth map directly from a single motion-blurred image. We then recover the instantaneous camera velocity by solving a linear least squares problem under the small motion assumption. In essence, our method produces an IMU-like measurement that robustly captures fast and aggressive camera movements. To train our model, we construct a large-scale dataset with realistic synthetic motion blur derived from ScanNet++v2 and further refine our model by training end-to-end on real data using our fully differentiable pipeline. Extensive evaluations on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art angular and translational velocity estimates, outperforming current methods like MASt3R and COLMAP.</description>

      <title>FisherTune: Fisher-Guided Robust Tuning of Vision Foundation Models for Domain Generalized Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) excel in generalization due to large-scale pretraining, but fine-tuning them for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) while maintaining this ability remains challenging. Existing approaches either selectively fine-tune parameters or freeze the VFMs and update only the adapters, both of which may underutilize the VFMs' full potential in DGSS tasks. We observe that domain-sensitive parameters in VFMs, arising from task and distribution differences, can hinder generalization. To address this, we propose \textbf{FisherTune}, a robust fine-tuning method guided by the Domain-Related Fisher Information Matrix (DR-FIM). DR-FIM measures parameter sensitivity across tasks and domains, enabling selective updates that preserve generalization and enhance DGSS adaptability. FisherTune incorporates variational inference to stabilize DR-FIM estimation, treating parameters as Gaussian-distributed variables and leveraging pre-trained priors. Extensive experiments show that FisherTune achieves superior cross-domain segmentation while maintaining generalization, outperforming selective-parameter and adapter-based methods.</description>

      <title>Video-T1: Test-Time Scaling for Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the scale capability of increasing training data, model size, and computational cost, video generation has achieved impressive results in digital creation, enabling users to express creativity across various domains. Recently, researchers in Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded the scaling to test-time, which can significantly improve LLM performance by using more inference-time computation. Instead of scaling up video foundation models through expensive training costs, we explore the power of Test-Time Scaling (TTS) in video generation, aiming to answer the question: if a video generation model is allowed to use non-trivial amount of inference-time compute, how much can it improve generation quality given a challenging text prompt. In this work, we reinterpret the test-time scaling of video generation as a searching problem to sample better trajectories from Gaussian noise space to the target video distribution. Specifically, we build the search space with test-time verifiers to provide feedback and heuristic algorithms to guide searching process. Given a text prompt, we first explore an intuitive linear search strategy by increasing noise candidates at inference time. As full-step denoising all frames simultaneously requires heavy test-time computation costs, we further design a more efficient TTS method for video generation called Tree-of-Frames (ToF) that adaptively expands and prunes video branches in an autoregressive manner. Extensive experiments on text-conditioned video generation benchmarks demonstrate that increasing test-time compute consistently leads to significant improvements in the quality of videos.

      <title>EventMamba: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Locality with State Space Models for Event-Based Video Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19721v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging its robust linear global modeling capability, Mamba has notably excelled in computer vision. Despite its success, existing Mamba-based vision models have overlooked the nuances of event-driven tasks, especially in video reconstruction. Event-based video reconstruction (EBVR) demands spatial translation invariance and close attention to local event relationships in the spatio-temporal domain. Unfortunately, conventional Mamba algorithms apply static window partitions and standard reshape scanning methods, leading to significant losses in local connectivity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EventMamba--a specialized model designed for EBVR tasks. EventMamba innovates by incorporating random window offset (RWO) in the spatial domain, moving away from the restrictive fixed partitioning. Additionally, it features a new consistent traversal serialization approach in the spatio-temporal domain, which maintains the proximity of adjacent events both spatially and temporally. These enhancements enable EventMamba to retain Mamba's robust modeling capabilities while significantly preserving the spatio-temporal locality of event data. Comprehensive testing on multiple datasets shows that EventMamba markedly enhances video reconstruction, drastically improving computation speed while delivering superior visual quality compared to Transformer-based methods.</description>

      <title>Rerouting Connection: Hybrid Computer Vision Analysis Reveals Visual Similarity Between Indus and Tibetan-Yi Corridor Writing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This thesis employs a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture, in conjunction with a detailed anthropological framework, to investigate potential historical connections between the visual morphology of the Indus Valley script and pictographic systems of the Tibetan-Yi Corridor. Through an ensemble methodology of three target scripts across 15 independently trained models, we demonstrate that Tibetan-Yi Corridor scripts exhibit approximately six-fold higher visual similarity to the Indus script (61.7%-63.5%) than to the Bronze Age Proto-Cuneiform (10.2%-10.9%) or Proto-Elamite (7.6%-8.7%) systems. Additionally and contrarily to our current understanding of the networks of the Indus Valley Civilization, the Indus script unexpectedly maps closer to Tibetan-Yi Corridor scripts, with a mean cosine similarity of 0.629, than to the aforementioned contemporaneous West Asian signaries, both of which recorded mean cosine similarities of 0.104 and 0.080 despite their close geographic proximity and evident trade relations. Across various dimensionality reduction practices and clustering methodologies, the Indus script consistently clusters closest to Tibetan-Yi Corridor scripts. Our computational results align with qualitative observations of specific pictorial parallels in numeral systems, gender markers, and key iconographic elements; this is further supported by archaeological evidence of sustained contact networks along the ancient Shu-Shendu road in tandem with the Indus Valley Civilization's decline, providing a plausible transmission pathway. While alternative explanations cannot be ruled out, the specificity and consistency of observed similarities challenge conventional narratives of isolated script development and suggest more complex ancient cultural transmission networks between South and East Asia than previously recognized.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Visual Concept Blending Without Text Guidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel, zero-shot image generation technique called "Visual Concept Blending" that provides fine-grained control over which features from multiple reference images are transferred to a source image. If only a single reference image is available, it is difficult to isolate which specific elements should be transferred. However, using multiple reference images, the proposed approach distinguishes between common and unique features by selectively incorporating them into a generated output. By operating within a partially disentangled Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) embedding space (from IP-Adapter), our method enables the flexible transfer of texture, shape, motion, style, and more abstract conceptual transformations without requiring additional training or text prompts. We demonstrate its effectiveness across a diverse range of tasks, including style transfer, form metamorphosis, and conceptual transformations, showing how subtle or abstract attributes (e.g., brushstroke style, aerodynamic lines, and dynamism) can be seamlessly combined into a new image. In a user study, participants accurately recognized which features were intended to be transferred. Its simplicity, flexibility, and high-level control make Visual Concept Blending valuable for creative fields such as art, design, and content creation, where combining specific visual qualities from multiple inspirations is crucial.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Behavior and Lane Constraints Guided Trajectory Prediction Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction, as a critical component of autonomous driving systems, has attracted the attention of many researchers. Existing prediction algorithms focus on extracting more detailed scene features or selecting more reasonable trajectory destinations. However, in the face of dynamic and evolving future movements of the target vehicle, these algorithms cannot provide a fine-grained and continuous description of future behaviors and lane constraints, which degrades the prediction accuracy. To address this challenge, we present BLNet, a novel dualstream architecture that synergistically integrates behavioral intention recognition and lane constraint modeling through parallel attention mechanisms. The framework generates fine-grained behavior state queries (capturing spatial-temporal movement patterns) and lane queries (encoding lane topology constraints), supervised by two auxiliary losses, respectively. Subsequently, a two-stage decoder first produces trajectory proposals, then performs point-level refinement by jointly incorporating both the continuity of passed lanes and future motion features. Extensive experiments on two large datasets, nuScenes and Argoverse, show that our network exhibits significant performance gains over existing direct regression and goal-based algorithms.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Mist over 3D Vision-Language Understanding: Object-centric Evaluation with Chain-of-Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing 3D vision-language (3D-VL) benchmarks fall short in evaluating 3D-VL models, creating a "mist" that obscures rigorous insights into model capabilities and 3D-VL tasks. This mist persists due to three key limitations. First, flawed test data, like ambiguous referential text in the grounding task, can yield incorrect and unreliable test results. Second, oversimplified metrics such as simply averaging accuracy per question answering (QA) pair, cannot reveal true model capability due to their vulnerability to language variations. Third, existing benchmarks isolate the grounding and QA tasks, disregarding the underlying coherence that QA should be based on solid grounding capabilities. To unveil the "mist", we propose Beacon3D, a benchmark for 3D-VL grounding and QA tasks, delivering a perspective shift in the evaluation of 3D-VL understanding. Beacon3D features (i) high-quality test data with precise and natural language, (ii) object-centric evaluation with multiple tests per object to ensure robustness, and (iii) a novel chain-of-analysis paradigm to address language robustness and model performance coherence across grounding and QA. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art 3D-VL models on Beacon3D reveals that (i) object-centric evaluation elicits true model performance and particularly weak generalization in QA; (ii) grounding-QA coherence remains fragile in current 3D-VL models, and (iii) incorporating large language models (LLMs) to 3D-VL models, though as a prevalent practice, hinders grounding capabilities and has yet to elevate QA capabilities. We hope Beacon3D and our comprehensive analysis could benefit the 3D-VL community towards faithful developments.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Neural Networks Can (Meta-)Learn the Same-Different Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have come to match and exceed human performance in many settings, the tasks these models optimize for are largely constrained to the level of individual objects, such as classification and captioning. Humans remain vastly superior to CNNs in visual tasks involving relations, including the ability to identify two objects as `same' or `different'. A number of studies have shown that while CNNs can be coaxed into learning the same-different relation in some settings, they tend to generalize poorly to other instances of this relation. In this work we show that the same CNN architectures that fail to generalize the same-different relation with conventional training are able to succeed when trained via meta-learning, which explicitly encourages abstraction and generalization across tasks.</description>

      <title>TextCrafter: Accurately Rendering Multiple Texts in Complex Visual Scenes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the task of Complex Visual Text Generation (CVTG), which centers on generating intricate textual content distributed across diverse regions within visual images. In CVTG, image generation models often rendering distorted and blurred visual text or missing some visual text. To tackle these challenges, we propose TextCrafter, a novel multi-visual text rendering method. TextCrafter employs a progressive strategy to decompose complex visual text into distinct components while ensuring robust alignment between textual content and its visual carrier. Additionally, it incorporates a token focus enhancement mechanism to amplify the prominence of visual text during the generation process. TextCrafter effectively addresses key challenges in CVTG tasks, such as text confusion, omissions, and blurriness. Moreover, we present a new benchmark dataset, CVTG-2K, tailored to rigorously evaluate the performance of generative models on CVTG tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Introducing the Short-Time Fourier Kolmogorov Arnold Network: A Dynamic Graph CNN Approach for Tree Species Classification in 3D Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate classification of tree species based on Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) is essential for biodiversity conservation. While advanced deep learning models for 3D point cloud classification have demonstrated strong performance in this domain, their high complexity often hinders the development of efficient, low-computation architectures. In this paper, we introduce STFT-KAN, a novel Kolmogorov-Arnold network that integrates the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), which can replace the standard linear layer with activation. We implemented STFT-KAN within a lightweight version of DGCNN, called liteDGCNN, to classify tree species using the TLS data. Our experiments show that STFT-KAN outperforms existing KAN variants by effectively balancing model complexity and performance with parameter count reduction, achieving competitive results compared to MLP-based models. Additionally, we evaluated a hybrid architecture that combines MLP in edge convolution with STFT-KAN in other layers, achieving comparable performance to MLP models while reducing the parameter count by 50% and 75% compared to other KAN-based variants. Furthermore, we compared our model to leading 3D point cloud learning approaches, demonstrating that STFT-KAN delivers competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art method PointMLP lite with an 87% reduction in parameter count.</description>

      <title>WaveFormer: A 3D Transformer with Wavelet-Driven Feature Representation for Efficient Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have advanced medical image analysis by effectively modeling long-range dependencies, yet they often struggle in 3D settings due to substantial memory overhead and insufficient capture of fine-grained local features. We address these limitations with WaveFormer, a novel 3D-transformer that: i) leverages the fundamental frequency-domain properties of features for contextual representation, and ii) is inspired by the top-down mechanism of the human visual recognition system, making it a biologically motivated architecture. By employing discrete wavelet transformations (DWT) at multiple scales, WaveFormer preserves both global context and high-frequency details while replacing heavy upsampling layers with efficient wavelet-based summarization and reconstruction. This significantly reduces the number of parameters, which is critical for real-world deployment where computational resources and training times are constrained. Furthermore, the model is generic and easily adaptable to diverse applications. Evaluations on BraTS2023, FLARE2021, and KiTS2023 demonstrate performance on par with state-of-the-art methods while offering substantially lower computational complexity.</description>

      <title>On-device Sora: Enabling Training-Free Diffusion-based Text-to-Video Generation for Mobile Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present On-device Sora, the first model training-free solution for diffusion-based on-device text-to-video generation that operates efficiently on smartphone-grade devices. To address the challenges of diffusion-based text-to-video generation on computation- and memory-limited mobile devices, the proposed On-device Sora applies three novel techniques to pre-trained video generative models. First, Linear Proportional Leap (LPL) reduces the excessive denoising steps required in video diffusion through an efficient leap-based approach. Second, Temporal Dimension Token Merging (TDTM) minimizes intensive token-processing computation in attention layers by merging consecutive tokens along the temporal dimension. Third, Concurrent Inference with Dynamic Loading (CI-DL) dynamically partitions large models into smaller blocks and loads them into memory for concurrent model inference, effectively addressing the challenges of limited device memory. We implement On-device Sora on the iPhone 15 Pro, and the experimental evaluations show that it is capable of generating high-quality videos on the device, comparable to those produced by high-end GPUs. These results show that On-device Sora enables efficient and high-quality video generation on resource-constrained mobile devices. We envision the proposed On-device Sora as a significant first step toward democratizing state-of-the-art generative technologies, enabling video generation on commodity mobile and embedded devices without resource-intensive re-training for model optimization (compression). The code implementation is available at a GitHub repository(https://github.com/eai-lab/On-device-Sora).</description>

      <title>Learned Image Compression and Restoration for Digital Pathology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital pathology images play a crucial role in medical diagnostics, but their ultra-high resolution and large file sizes pose significant challenges for storage, transmission, and real-time visualization. To address these issues, we propose CLERIC, a novel deep learning-based image compression framework designed specifically for whole slide images (WSIs). CLERIC integrates a learnable lifting scheme and advanced convolutional techniques to enhance compression efficiency while preserving critical pathological details. Our framework employs a lifting-scheme transform in the analysis stage to decompose images into low- and high-frequency components, enabling more structured latent representations. These components are processed through parallel encoders incorporating Deformable Residual Blocks (DRB) and Recurrent Residual Blocks (R2B) to improve feature extraction and spatial adaptability. The synthesis stage applies an inverse lifting transform for effective image reconstruction, ensuring high-fidelity restoration of fine-grained tissue structures. We evaluate CLERIC on a digital pathology image dataset and compare its performance against state-of-the-art learned image compression (LIC) models. Experimental results demonstrate that CLERIC achieves superior rate-distortion (RD) performance, significantly reducing storage requirements while maintaining high diagnostic image quality. Our study highlights the potential of deep learning-based compression in digital pathology, facilitating efficient data management and long-term storage while ensuring seamless integration into clinical workflows and AI-assisted diagnostic systems.

      <title>Local Information Matters: Inference Acceleration For Grounded Conversation Generation Models Through Adaptive Local-Aware Token Pruning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grounded Conversation Generation (GCG) is an emerging vision-language task that requires models to generate natural language responses seamlessly intertwined with corresponding object segmentation masks. Recent models, such as GLaMM and OMG-LLaVA, achieve pixel-level grounding but incur significant computational costs due to processing a large number of visual tokens. Existing token pruning methods, like FastV and PyramidDrop, fail to preserve the local visual features critical for accurate grounding, leading to substantial performance drops in GCG tasks. To address this, we propose Adaptive Local-Aware Token Pruning (ALTP), a simple yet effective framework that accelerates GCG models by prioritizing local object information. ALTP introduces two key components: (1) Detail Density Capture (DDC), which uses superpixel segmentation to retain tokens in object-centric regions, preserving fine-grained details, and (2) Dynamic Density Formation (DDF), which dynamically allocates tokens based on information density, ensuring higher retention in semantically rich areas. Extensive experiments on the GranDf dataset demonstrate that ALTP significantly outperforms existing token pruning methods, such as FastV and PyramidDrop, on both GLaMM and OMG-LLaVA models. Notably, when applied to GLaMM, ALTP achieves a 90% reduction in visual tokens with a 4.9% improvement in AP50 and a 5.0% improvement in Recall compared to PyramidDrop. Similarly, on OMG-LLaVA, ALTP improves AP by 2.1% and mIOU by 3.0% at a 90% token reduction compared with PDrop.</description>

      <title>HumanDreamer: Generating Controllable Human-Motion Videos via Decoupled Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human-motion video generation has been a challenging task, primarily due to the difficulty inherent in learning human body movements. While some approaches have attempted to drive human-centric video generation explicitly through pose control, these methods typically rely on poses derived from existing videos, thereby lacking flexibility. To address this, we propose HumanDreamer, a decoupled human video generation framework that first generates diverse poses from text prompts and then leverages these poses to generate human-motion videos. Specifically, we propose MotionVid, the largest dataset for human-motion pose generation. Based on the dataset, we present MotionDiT, which is trained to generate structured human-motion poses from text prompts. Besides, a novel LAMA loss is introduced, which together contribute to a significant improvement in FID by 62.4%, along with respective enhancements in R-precision for top1, top2, and top3 by 41.8%, 26.3%, and 18.3%, thereby advancing both the Text-to-Pose control accuracy and FID metrics. Our experiments across various Pose-to-Video baselines demonstrate that the poses generated by our method can produce diverse and high-quality human-motion videos. Furthermore, our model can facilitate other downstream tasks, such as pose sequence prediction and 2D-3D motion lifting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objects produce different sounds when hit, and humans can intuitively infer how an object might sound based on its appearance and material properties. Inspired by this intuition, we propose Visual Acoustic Fields, a framework that bridges hitting sounds and visual signals within a 3D space using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our approach features two key modules: sound generation and sound localization. The sound generation module leverages a conditional diffusion model, which takes multiscale features rendered from a feature-augmented 3DGS to generate realistic hitting sounds. Meanwhile, the sound localization module enables querying the 3D scene, represented by the feature-augmented 3DGS, to localize hitting positions based on the sound sources. To support this framework, we introduce a novel pipeline for collecting scene-level visual-sound sample pairs, achieving alignment between captured images, impact locations, and corresponding sounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset to connect visual and acoustic signals in a 3D context. Extensive experiments on our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of Visual Acoustic Fields in generating plausible impact sounds and accurately localizing impact sources.

      <title>Self-Supervised Pretraining for Aerial Road Extraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks for aerial image segmentation require large amounts of labeled data, but high-quality aerial datasets with precise annotations are scarce and costly to produce. To address this limitation, we propose a self-supervised pretraining method that improves segmentation performance while reducing reliance on labeled data. Our approach uses inpainting-based pretraining, where the model learns to reconstruct missing regions in aerial images, capturing their inherent structure before being fine-tuned for road extraction. This method improves generalization, enhances robustness to domain shifts, and is invariant to model architecture and dataset choice. Experiments show that our pretraining significantly boosts segmentation accuracy, especially in low-data regimes, making it a scalable solution for aerial image analysis.</description>

      <title>MSCMNet: Multi-scale Semantic Correlation Mining for Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main challenge in the Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification (VI-ReID) task lies in how to extract discriminative features from different modalities for matching purposes. While the existing well works primarily focus on minimizing the modal discrepancies, the modality information can not thoroughly be leveraged. To solve this problem, a Multi-scale Semantic Correlation Mining network (MSCMNet) is proposed to comprehensively exploit semantic features at multiple scales and simultaneously reduce modality information loss as small as possible in feature extraction. The proposed network contains three novel components. Firstly, after taking into account the effective utilization of modality information, the Multi-scale Information Correlation Mining Block (MIMB) is designed to explore semantic correlations across multiple scales. Secondly, in order to enrich the semantic information that MIMB can utilize, a quadruple-stream feature extractor (QFE) with non-shared parameters is specifically designed to extract information from different dimensions of the dataset. Finally, the Quadruple Center Triplet Loss (QCT) is further proposed to address the information discrepancy in the comprehensive features. Extensive experiments on the SYSU-MM01, RegDB, and LLCM datasets demonstrate that the proposed MSCMNet achieves the greatest accuracy.</description>

      <title>SVInvNet: A Densely Connected Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Seismic Velocity Inversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a deep learning-based approach to seismic velocity inversion problem, focusing on both noisy and noiseless training datasets of varying sizes. Our Seismic Velocity Inversion Network (SVInvNet) introduces a novel architecture that contains a multi-connection encoder-decoder structure enhanced with dense blocks. This design is specifically tuned to effectively process time series data, which is essential for addressing the challenges of non-linear seismic velocity inversion. For training and testing, we created diverse seismic velocity models, including multi-layered, faulty, and salt dome categories. We also investigated how different kinds of ambient noise, both coherent and stochastic, and the size of the training dataset affect learning outcomes. SVInvNet is trained on datasets ranging from 750 to 6,000 samples and is tested using a large benchmark dataset of 12,000 samples. Despite its fewer parameters compared to the baseline model, SVInvNet achieves superior performance with this dataset. The performance of SVInvNet was further evaluated using the OpenFWI dataset and Marmousi-derived velocity models. The comparative analysis clearly reveals the effectiveness of the proposed model.</description>

      <title>Towards Adversarially Robust Dataset Distillation by Curvature Regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10045v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) allows datasets to be distilled to fractions of their original size while preserving the rich distributional information so that models trained on the distilled datasets can achieve a comparable accuracy while saving significant computational loads. Recent research in this area has been focusing on improving the accuracy of models trained on distilled datasets. In this paper, we aim to explore a new perspective of DD. We study how to embed adversarial robustness in distilled datasets, so that models trained on these datasets maintain the high accuracy and meanwhile acquire better adversarial robustness. We propose a new method that achieves this goal by incorporating curvature regularization into the distillation process with much less computational overhead than standard adversarial training. Extensive empirical experiments suggest that our method not only outperforms standard adversarial training on both accuracy and robustness with less computation overhead but is also capable of generating robust distilled datasets that can withstand various adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Rehearsal-free Federated Domain-incremental Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a rehearsal-free federated domain incremental learning framework, RefFiL, based on a global prompt-sharing paradigm to alleviate catastrophic forgetting challenges in federated domain-incremental learning, where unseen domains are continually learned. Typical methods for mitigating forgetting, such as the use of additional datasets and the retention of private data from earlier tasks, are not viable in federated learning (FL) due to devices' limited resources. Our method, RefFiL, addresses this by learning domain-invariant knowledge and incorporating various domain-specific prompts from the domains represented by different FL participants. A key feature of RefFiL is the generation of local fine-grained prompts by our domain adaptive prompt generator, which effectively learns from local domain knowledge while maintaining distinctive boundaries on a global scale. We also introduce a domain-specific prompt contrastive learning loss that differentiates between locally generated prompts and those from other domains, enhancing RefFiL's precision and effectiveness. Compared to existing methods, RefFiL significantly alleviates catastrophic forgetting without requiring extra memory space, making it ideal for privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained devices.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Domain Adaptation through Prompt Gradient Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09353v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prior Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods often aim to train a domain-invariant feature extractor, which may hinder the model from learning sufficiently discriminative features. To tackle this, a line of works based on prompt learning leverages the power of large-scale pre-trained vision-language models to learn both domain-invariant and specific features through a set of domain-agnostic and domain-specific learnable prompts. Those studies typically enforce invariant constraints on representation, output, or prompt space to learn such prompts. In contrast, we cast UDA as a multiple-objective optimization problem in which each objective is represented by a domain loss. Under this new framework, we propose to align per-objective gradients to foster consensus between them. Additionally, to prevent potential overfitting when fine-tuning this deep learning architecture, we penalize the norm of these gradients. To achieve these goals, we devise a practical gradient update procedure that can work under both single-source and multi-source UDA. Empirically, our method consistently outperforms other vision-language model adaptation methods. The implementation is available at https://github.com/VietHoang1512/PGA.</description>

      <title>Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient for Inverse Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03463v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have been effective in learning data priors for solving inverse problems. They leverage diffusion sampling steps for inducing a data prior while using a measurement guidance gradient at each step to impose data consistency. For general inverse problems, approximations are needed when an unconditionally trained diffusion model is used since the measurement likelihood is intractable, leading to inaccurate posterior sampling. In other words, due to their approximations, these methods fail to preserve the generation process on the data manifold defined by the diffusion prior, leading to artifacts in applications such as image restoration. To enhance the performance and robustness of diffusion models in solving inverse problems, we propose Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient (DiffStateGrad), which projects the measurement gradient onto a subspace that is a low-rank approximation of an intermediate state of the diffusion process. DiffStateGrad, as a module, can be added to a wide range of diffusion-based inverse solvers to improve the preservation of the diffusion process on the prior manifold and filter out artifact-inducing components. We highlight that DiffStateGrad improves the robustness of diffusion models in terms of the choice of measurement guidance step size and noise while improving the worst-case performance. Finally, we demonstrate that DiffStateGrad improves upon the state-of-the-art on linear and nonlinear image restoration inverse problems. Our code is available at https://github.com/Anima-Lab/DiffStateGrad.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Experts Made Personalized: Federated Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10114v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated prompt learning benefits federated learning with CLIP-like Vision-Language Model's (VLM's) robust representation learning ability through prompt learning. However, current federated prompt learning methods are habitually restricted to the traditional FL paradigm, where the participating clients are generally only allowed to download a single globally aggregated model from the server. While justifiable for training full-sized models under federated settings, in this work, we argue that this paradigm is ill-suited for lightweight prompts. By facilitating the clients to download multiple pre-aggregated prompts as fixed non-local experts, we propose Personalized Federated Mixture of Adaptive Prompts (pFedMoAP), a novel FL framework that personalizes the prompt learning process through the lens of Mixture of Experts (MoE). pFedMoAP implements a local attention-based gating network that learns to generate enhanced text features for better alignment with local image data, benefiting from both local and downloaded non-local adaptive prompt experts. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets under various federated settings demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed pFedMoAP algorithm. The code is available at https://github.com/ljaiverson/pFedMoAP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An ecosystem of Transformer-based models has been established by building large models with extensive data. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is a crucial technology for deploying these models to downstream tasks with minimal cost while achieving effective performance. Recently, Mamba, a State Space Model (SSM)-based model, has attracted attention as a potential alternative to Transformers. While many large-scale Mamba-based models have been proposed, efficiently adapting pre-trained Mamba-based models to downstream tasks remains unexplored. In this paper, we conduct an exploratory analysis of PEFT methods for Mamba. We investigate the effectiveness of existing PEFT methods for Transformers when applied to Mamba. We also modify these methods to better align with the Mamba architecture. Additionally, we propose new Mamba-specific PEFT methods that leverage the distinctive structure of Mamba. Our experiments indicate that PEFT performs more effectively for Mamba than Transformers. Lastly, we demonstrate how to effectively combine multiple PEFT methods and provide a framework that outperforms previous works. To ensure reproducibility, we will release the code after publication.</description>

      <title>A novel algorithm for optimizing bundle adjustment in image sequence alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bundle Adjustment (BA) model is commonly optimized using a nonlinear least squares method, with the Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M) algorithm being a typical choice. However, despite the L-M algorithm's effectiveness, its sensitivity to initial conditions often results in slower convergence when applied to poorly conditioned datasets, motivating the exploration of alternative optimization strategies. This paper introduces a novel algorithm for optimizing the BA model in the context of image sequence alignment for cryo-electron tomography, utilizing optimal control theory to directly optimize general nonlinear functions. The proposed Optimal Control Algorithm (OCA) exhibits superior convergence rates and effectively mitigates the oscillatory behavior frequently observed in L-M algorithm. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets were conducted to evaluate the algorithm's performance. The results demonstrate that the OCA achieves faster convergence compared to the L-M algorithm. Moreover, the incorporation of a bisection-based update procedure significantly enhances the OCA's performance, particularly in poorly initialized datasets. These findings indicate that the OCA can substantially improve the efficiency of 3D reconstructions in cryo-electron tomography.</description>

      <title>VERA: Explainable Video Anomaly Detection via Verbalized Learning of Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01095v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) has established a new paradigm in video anomaly detection (VAD): leveraging VLMs to simultaneously detect anomalies and provide comprehendible explanations for the decisions. Existing work in this direction often assumes the complex reasoning required for VAD exceeds the capabilities of pretrained VLMs. Consequently, these approaches either incorporate specialized reasoning modules during inference or rely on instruction tuning datasets through additional training to adapt VLMs for VAD. However, such strategies often incur substantial computational costs or data annotation overhead. To address these challenges in explainable VAD, we introduce a verbalized learning framework named VERA that enables VLMs to perform VAD without model parameter modifications. Specifically, VERA automatically decomposes the complex reasoning required for VAD into reflections on simpler, more focused guiding questions capturing distinct abnormal patterns. It treats these reflective questions as learnable parameters and optimizes them through data-driven verbal interactions between learner and optimizer VLMs, using coarsely labeled training data. During inference, VERA embeds the learned questions into model prompts to guide VLMs in generating segment-level anomaly scores, which are then refined into frame-level scores via the fusion of scene and temporal contexts. Experimental results on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that the learned questions of VERA are highly adaptable, significantly improving both detection performance and explainability of VLMs for VAD.</description>

      <title>HCMA-UNet: A Hybrid CNN-Mamba UNet with Axial Self-Attention for Efficient Breast Cancer Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Breast cancer lesion segmentation in DCE-MRI remains challenging due to heterogeneous tumor morphology and indistinct boundaries. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel hybrid segmentation network, HCMA-UNet, for lesion segmentation of breast cancer. Our network consists of a lightweight CNN backbone and a Multi-view Axial Self-Attention Mamba (MISM) module. The MISM module integrates Visual State Space Block (VSSB) and Axial Self-Attention (ASA) mechanism, effectively reducing parameters through Asymmetric Split Channel (ASC) strategy to achieve efficient tri-directional feature extraction. Our lightweight model achieves superior performance with 2.87M parameters and 126.44 GFLOPs. A Feature-guided Region-aware loss function (FRLoss) is proposed to enhance segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments on one private and two public DCE-MRI breast cancer datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency. FRLoss also exhibits good cross-architecture generalization capabilities. The source code is available at https://github.com/Haoxuanli-Thu/HCMA-UNet.</description>

      <title>RG-Attn: Radian Glue Attention for Multi-modality Multi-agent Cooperative Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cooperative perception offers an optimal solution to overcome the perception limitations of single-agent systems by leveraging Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication for data sharing and fusion across multiple agents. However, most existing approaches focus on single-modality data exchange, limiting the potential of both homogeneous and heterogeneous fusion across agents. This overlooks the opportunity to utilize multi-modality data per agent, restricting the system's performance. In the automotive industry, manufacturers adopt diverse sensor configurations, resulting in heterogeneous combinations of sensor modalities across agents. To harness the potential of every possible data source for optimal performance, we design a robust LiDAR and camera cross-modality fusion module, Radian-Glue-Attention (RG-Attn), applicable to both intra-agent cross-modality fusion and inter-agent cross-modality fusion scenarios, owing to the convenient coordinate conversion by transformation matrix and the unified sampling/inversion mechanism. We also propose two different architectures, named Paint-To-Puzzle (PTP) and Co-Sketching-Co-Coloring (CoS-CoCo), for conducting cooperative perception. PTP aims for maximum precision performance and achieves smaller data packet size by limiting cross-agent fusion to a single instance, but requiring all participants to be equipped with LiDAR. In contrast, CoS-CoCo supports agents with any configuration-LiDAR-only, camera-only, or LiDAR-camera-both, presenting more generalization ability. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both real and simulated cooperative perception datasets. The code is now available at GitHub.</description>

      <title>AnyTouch: Learning Unified Static-Dynamic Representation across Multiple Visuo-tactile Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visuo-tactile sensors aim to emulate human tactile perception, enabling robots to precisely understand and manipulate objects. Over time, numerous meticulously designed visuo-tactile sensors have been integrated into robotic systems, aiding in completing various tasks. However, the distinct data characteristics of these low-standardized visuo-tactile sensors hinder the establishment of a powerful tactile perception system. We consider that the key to addressing this issue lies in learning unified multi-sensor representations, thereby integrating the sensors and promoting tactile knowledge transfer between them. To achieve unified representation of this nature, we introduce TacQuad, an aligned multi-modal multi-sensor tactile dataset from four different visuo-tactile sensors, which enables the explicit integration of various sensors. Recognizing that humans perceive the physical environment by acquiring diverse tactile information such as texture and pressure changes, we further propose to learn unified multi-sensor representations from both static and dynamic perspectives. By integrating tactile images and videos, we present AnyTouch, a unified static-dynamic multi-sensor representation learning framework with a multi-level structure, aimed at both enhancing comprehensive perceptual abilities and enabling effective cross-sensor transfer. This multi-level architecture captures pixel-level details from tactile data via masked modeling and enhances perception and transferability by learning semantic-level sensor-agnostic features through multi-modal alignment and cross-sensor matching. We provide a comprehensive analysis of multi-sensor transferability, and validate our method on various datasets and in the real-world pouring task. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing methods, exhibits outstanding static and dynamic perception capabilities across various sensors.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Tutorial of the Histogram-based Image Segmentation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The histogram of an image is the accurate graphical representation of the numerical grayscale distribution and it is also an estimate of the probability distribution of image pixels. Therefore, histogram has been widely adopted to calculate the clustering means and partitioning thresholds for image segmentation. There have been many classical histogram-based image segmentation methods proposed and played important roles in both academics and industry. In this tutorial, the histories and recent advances of the histogram-based image segmentation techniques are first reviewed and then they are divided into four categories: (1) the means-based method, (2) the Gaussian-mixture-model-based method, (3) the entropy-based method and (4) the feature-points-based method. The purpose of this tutorial is threefold: 1) to teach the principles of the classical histogram-based image segmentation methods to the interested readers; 2) to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of these classical histogram-based image segmentation methods objectively; 3) to compare the performances of these classical histogram-based image segmentation methods with state-of-the-art deep learning based methods objectively.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14538v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: This study introduces a Vision-Language Model (VLM) leveraging SIGLIP and Gemma-3b architectures for automated acute tuberculosis (TB) screening. By integrating chest X-ray images and clinical notes, the model aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, particularly in resource-limited settings.
  Methods: The VLM combines visual data from chest X-rays with clinical context to generate detailed, context-aware diagnostic reports. The architecture employs SIGLIP for visual encoding and Gemma-3b for decoding, ensuring effective representation of acute TB-specific pathologies and clinical insights.
  Results: Key acute TB pathologies, including consolidation, cavities, and nodules, were detected with high precision (97percent) and recall (96percent). The model demonstrated strong spatial localization capabilities and robustness in distinguishing TB-positive cases, making it a reliable tool for acute TB diagnosis.
  Conclusion: The multimodal capability of the VLM reduces reliance on radiologists, providing a scalable solution for acute TB screening. Future work will focus on improving the detection of subtle pathologies and addressing dataset biases to enhance its generalizability and application in diverse global healthcare settings.</description>

      <title>Lie Detector: Unified Backdoor Detection via Cross-Examination Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Institutions with limited data and computing resources often outsource model training to third-party providers in a semi-honest setting, assuming adherence to prescribed training protocols with pre-defined learning paradigm (e.g., supervised or semi-supervised learning). However, this practice can introduce severe security risks, as adversaries may poison the training data to embed backdoors into the resulting model. Existing detection approaches predominantly rely on statistical analyses, which often fail to maintain universally accurate detection accuracy across different learning paradigms. To address this challenge, we propose a unified backdoor detection framework in the semi-honest setting that exploits cross-examination of model inconsistencies between two independent service providers. Specifically, we integrate central kernel alignment to enable robust feature similarity measurements across different model architectures and learning paradigms, thereby facilitating precise recovery and identification of backdoor triggers. We further introduce backdoor fine-tuning sensitivity analysis to distinguish backdoor triggers from adversarial perturbations, substantially reducing false positives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior detection performance, improving accuracy by 5.4%, 1.6%, and 11.9% over SoTA baselines across supervised, semi-supervised, and autoregressive learning tasks, respectively. Notably, it is the first to effectively detect backdoors in multimodal large language models, further highlighting its broad applicability and advancing secure deep learning.</description>

      <title>GyralNet Subnetwork Partitioning via Differentiable Spectral Modularity Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the structural and functional organization of the human brain requires a detailed examination of cortical folding patterns, among which the three-hinge gyrus (3HG) has been identified as a key structural landmark. GyralNet, a network representation of cortical folding, models 3HGs as nodes and gyral crests as edges, highlighting their role as critical hubs in cortico-cortical connectivity. However, existing methods for analyzing 3HGs face significant challenges, including the sub-voxel scale of 3HGs at typical neuroimaging resolutions, the computational complexity of establishing cross-subject correspondences, and the oversimplification of treating 3HGs as independent nodes without considering their community-level relationships. To address these limitations, we propose a fully differentiable subnetwork partitioning framework that employs a spectral modularity maximization optimization strategy to modularize the organization of 3HGs within GyralNet. By incorporating topological structural similarity and DTI-derived connectivity patterns as attribute features, our approach provides a biologically meaningful representation of cortical organization. Extensive experiments on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset demonstrate that our method effectively partitions GyralNet at the individual level while preserving the community-level consistency of 3HGs across subjects, offering a robust foundation for understanding brain connectivity.</description>

      <title>RainyGS: Efficient Rain Synthesis with Physically-Based Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of adding dynamic rain effects to in-the-wild scenes in a physically-correct manner. Recent advances in scene modeling have made significant progress, with NeRF and 3DGS techniques emerging as powerful tools for reconstructing complex scenes. However, while effective for novel view synthesis, these methods typically struggle with challenging scene editing tasks, such as physics-based rain simulation. In contrast, traditional physics-based simulations can generate realistic rain effects, such as raindrops and splashes, but they often rely on skilled artists to carefully set up high-fidelity scenes. This process lacks flexibility and scalability, limiting its applicability to broader, open-world environments. In this work, we introduce RainyGS, a novel approach that leverages the strengths of both physics-based modeling and 3DGS to generate photorealistic, dynamic rain effects in open-world scenes with physical accuracy. At the core of our method is the integration of physically-based raindrop and shallow water simulation techniques within the fast 3DGS rendering framework, enabling realistic and efficient simulations of raindrop behavior, splashes, and reflections. Our method supports synthesizing rain effects at over 30 fps, offering users flexible control over rain intensity -- from light drizzles to heavy downpours. We demonstrate that RainyGS performs effectively for both real-world outdoor scenes and large-scale driving scenarios, delivering more photorealistic and physically-accurate rain effects compared to state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>Exploiting Mixture-of-Experts Redundancy Unlocks Multimodal Generative Abilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we undertake the challenge of augmenting the existing generative capabilities of pre-trained text-only large language models (LLMs) with multi-modal generation capability while satisfying two core constraints: C1 preserving the preservation of original language generative capabilities with negligible performance degradation, and C2 adhering to a small parameter budget to learn the new modality, ensuring scalability and efficiency. In contrast to current approaches that add dedicated modules, thereby significantly increasing the parameter count, we propose a method that leverages the underutilized capacity inherent in deep models. Specifically, we exploit the parameter redundancy within Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) as a source of additional capacity for learning a new modality, enabling better parameter efficiency (C1). Moreover, we preserve the original language generation capabilities by applying low-rank adaptation exclusively to the tokens of the new modality (C2). Furthermore, we introduce a novel parameter initialization scheme based on the Gromov-Wasserstein distance to improve convergence and training stability. Through an extensive analysis of the routing mechanism, we uncover the emergence of modality-specific pathways and decreased redundancy within the experts that can efficiently unlock multi-modal generative capabilities. Overall, our method can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of contemporary LLMs, providing a new pathway for transitioning from uni-modal to multi-modal architectures.</description>

      <title>Nonhuman Primate Brain Tissue Segmentation Using a Transfer Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-human primates (NHPs) serve as critical models for understanding human brain function and neurological disorders due to their close evolutionary relationship with humans. Accurate brain tissue segmentation in NHPs is critical for understanding neurological disorders, but challenging due to the scarcity of annotated NHP brain MRI datasets, the small size of the NHP brain, the limited resolution of available imaging data and the anatomical differences between human and NHP brains. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach utilizing STU-Net with transfer learning to leverage knowledge transferred from human brain MRI data to enhance segmentation accuracy in the NHP brain MRI, particularly when training data is limited. The combination of STU-Net and transfer learning effectively delineates complex tissue boundaries and captures fine anatomical details specific to NHP brains. Notably, our method demonstrated improvement in segmenting small subcortical structures such as putamen and thalamus that are challenging to resolve with limited spatial resolution and tissue contrast, and achieved DSC of over 0.88, IoU over 0.8 and HD95 under 7. This study introduces a robust method for multi-class brain tissue segmentation in NHPs, potentially accelerating research in evolutionary neuroscience and preclinical studies of neurological disorders relevant to human health.</description>

      <title>OncoReg: Medical Image Registration for Oncological Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In modern cancer research, the vast volume of medical data generated is often underutilised due to challenges related to patient privacy. The OncoReg Challenge addresses this issue by enabling researchers to develop and validate image registration methods through a two-phase framework that ensures patient privacy while fostering the development of more generalisable AI models. Phase one involves working with a publicly available dataset, while phase two focuses on training models on a private dataset within secure hospital networks. OncoReg builds upon the foundation established by the Learn2Reg Challenge by incorporating the registration of interventional cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) with standard planning fan-beam CT (FBCT) images in radiotherapy. Accurate image registration is crucial in oncology, particularly for dynamic treatment adjustments in image-guided radiotherapy, where precise alignment is necessary to minimise radiation exposure to healthy tissues while effectively targeting tumours. This work details the methodology and data behind the OncoReg Challenge and provides a comprehensive analysis of the competition entries and results. Findings reveal that feature extraction plays a pivotal role in this registration task. A new method emerging from this challenge demonstrated its versatility, while established approaches continue to perform comparably to newer techniques. Both deep learning and classical approaches still play significant roles in image registration, with the combination of methods - particularly in feature extraction - proving most effective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information Visualization (InfoVis) systems utilize visual representations to enhance data interpretation. Understanding how visual attention is allocated is essential for optimizing interface design. However, collecting Eye-tracking (ET) data presents challenges related to cost, privacy, and scalability. Computational models provide alternatives for predicting gaze patterns, thereby advancing InfoVis research. In our study, we conducted an ET experiment with 40 participants who analyzed graphs while responding to questions of varying complexity within the context of digital forensics. We compared human scanpaths with synthetic ones generated by models such as DeepGaze, UMSS, and Gazeformer. Our research evaluates the accuracy of these models and examines how question complexity and number of nodes influence performance. This work contributes to the development of predictive modeling in visual analytics, offering insights that can enhance the design and effectiveness of InfoVis systems.</description>
