      <title>Optimal Threshold Signatures in Bitcoin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate the design of a threshold signature scheme as made possible on cryptocurrency protocols like Bitcoin. The funds are secured by an m-of-n threshold signature, where at least m signatures are needed to unlock the funds. A user designs this scheme knowing that a malicious attacker can also obtain the signatures with some probability. Higher thresholds offer more security, but also risk locking the user out of his own funds. The optimal threshold balances these twin effects. Interventions like increasing the security or usability of the signatures allow for higher thresholds. We model dynamic threshold signature schemes, where the probability of a user or attacker obtaining signatures decays with time. A dynamic threshold signature scheme is optimal, and increasing security or usability allows for higher thresholds and longer time locks.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Aware Sequential Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19525v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In settings like vaccination registries, individuals act after observing others, and the resulting public records can expose private information. We study privacy-preserving sequential learning, where agents add endogenous noise to their reported actions to conceal private signals. Efficient social learning relies on information flow, seemingly in conflict with privacy. Surprisingly, with continuous signals and a fixed privacy budget $(\epsilon)$, the optimal randomization strategy balances privacy and accuracy, accelerating learning to $\Theta_{\epsilon}(\log n)$, faster than the nonprivate $\Theta(\sqrt{\log n})$ rate. In the nonprivate baseline, the expected time to the first correct action and the number of incorrect actions diverge; under privacy with sufficiently small $\epsilon$, both are finite. Privacy helps because, under the false state, agents more often receive signals contradicting the majority; randomization then asymmetrically amplifies the log-likelihood ratio, enhancing aggregation. In heterogeneous populations, an order-optimal $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ rate is achievable when a subset of agents have low privacy budgets. With binary signals, however, privacy reduces informativeness and impairs learning relative to the nonprivate baseline, though the dependence on $\epsilon$ is nonmonotone. Our results show how privacy reshapes information dynamics and inform the design of platforms and policies.</description>

      <title>Testing Single Crossing Property with Stochastic Choice Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03985v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a typical model of private information and choice under uncertainty, a decision maker observes a signal, updates her prior beliefs using Bayes rule, and maximizes her expected utility. If the decision maker's utility function satisfies the single crossing property, and the information structure is ordered according to the monotone likelihood ratio, then the comparative statics exhibit monotonicity with respect to signals. We consider the restrictions placed by this model of signal processing on state conditional stochastic choice data. In particular, we show that this model rationalizes a state conditional stochastic choice dataset if and only if the dataset itself is ordered according to the monotone likelihood ratio.</description>

      <title>Tight Samurai Accountant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note applies tightness (Kattwinkel and Preusser (2025)) to the setting of Border and Sobel (1987, "Samurai Accountant: A Theory of Auditing and Plunder"). Border and Sobel characterize efficient mechanisms and argue that efficiency entails no loss of optimality. We characterize tight mechanisms and argue that tightness entails no loss of optimality. We show that tight mechanisms form a subset of efficient mechanisms. Therefore, tightness refines efficiency without loss of optimality. By characterizing tight mechanisms, one can replicate the insights from Border and Sobel (1987) and Chander and Wilde (1998). A novel insight is how and in which order the principal uses different instruments to provide incentives to different agent types. Further, we describe a procedure for constructing efficient mechanisms in a setting with a continuum of types.</description>

      <title>Information Design with Unknown Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05533v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information designers, such as online platforms, often do not know the beliefs of their receivers. We design learning algorithms so that the information designer can learn the receivers' prior belief from their actions through repeated interactions. Our learning algorithms achieve no regret relative to the optimality for the known prior at a fast speed, achieving a tight regret bound $\Theta(\log T)$ in general and a tight regret bound $\Theta(\log \log T)$ in the important special case of binary actions.</description>

      <title>Construct to Commitment: The Effect of Narratives on Economic Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how government-led narratives through mass media evolve from construct, a mechanism for framing expectations, into commitment, a sustainable pillar for growth. We propose the "Narratives-Construct-Commitment (NCC)" framework outlining the mechanism and institutionalization of narratives, and formalize it as a dynamic Bayesian game. Using the Innovation-Driven Development Strategy (2016) as a case study, we identify the narrative shock from high-frequency financial data and trace its impact using local projection method. By shaping expectations, credible narratives institutionalize investment incentives, channel resources into R\&amp;D, and facilitate sustained improvements in total factor productivity (TFP). Our findings strive to provide insights into the New Quality Productive Forces initiative, highlighting the role of narratives in transforming vision into tangible economic growth.</description>
