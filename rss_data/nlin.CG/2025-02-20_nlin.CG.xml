      <title>Elementary Cellular Automata as Multiplicative Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elementary cellular automata (ECA) are converted into multiplicative versions by using permuted n-dim Galois fields and octonion multiplication tables as binary pointers to each rule's Wolfram code truth table. This enables an extension of the binary ECA to complex numbers, identity solutions are found, produces a polynomial, and is implemented in Java.</description>

      <title>Kinetic modelling of economic markets with individual and collective transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two kinetic exchange models are proposed to explore the dynamics of closed economic markets characterized by random exchanges, saving propensities, and collective transactions. Model I simulates a system where individual transactions occur among agents with saving tendencies, along with collective transactions between groups. Model II restricts individual transactions to agents within the same group, but allows for collective transactions between groups. A three-step trading process--comprising intergroup transactions, intragroup redistribution, and individual exchanges--is developed to capture the dual-layered market dynamics. The saving propensity is incorporated using the Chakraborti-Chakrabarti model, applied to both individual and collective transactions. Results reveal that collective transactions increase wealth inequality by concentrating wealth within groups, as indicated by higher Gini coefficients and Kolkata indices. In contrast, individual transactions across groups mitigate inequality through more uniform wealth redistribution. The interplay between saving propensities and collective transactions governs deviation degree and entropy, which display inverse trends. Higher saving propensities lead to deviations from the Boltzmann-Gibbs equilibrium, whereas specific thresholds result in collective transaction dominance, producing notable peaks or troughs in these metrics. These findings underscore the critical influence of dual-layered market interactions on wealth distribution and economic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of degenerate stationary states in a boundary-driven dipole-conserving spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kinetically constrained spin chains serve as a prototype for structured ergodicity breaking in isolated quantum systems. We show that such a system exhibits a hierarchy of degenerate steady states when driven by incoherent pump and loss at the boundary. By tuning the relative pump and loss and how local the constraints are, one can stabilize mixed steady states, noiseless subsystems, and various decoherence-free subspaces, all of which preserve large amounts of information. We also find that a dipole-conserving bulk suppresses current in steady state. These exact results based on the flow in Hilbert space hold regardless of the specific Hamiltonian or drive mechanism. Our findings show that a competition of kinetic constraints and local drives can induce different forms of ergodicity breaking in open systems, which should be accessible in quantum simulators.</description>
