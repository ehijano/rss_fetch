      <title>Interacting Barrow holographic dark energy model in the presence of radiation and matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the effect of radiation in the interacting barrow holographic dark energy model for a non-flat universe. For both open and closed universes, we have obtained the evolution equation for the density parameters for dark energy, dark matter and radiation for a specific kind of interaction among the seven possible linear interactions; the analysis with the remaining six interactions will be updated soon in this manuscript. We have then numerically solved those coupled differential equations to show their behaviour with the redshift parameter. We have also found different epochs corresponding to dark energy-dark matter, dark energy-radiation and dark matter-radiation crossings. We have also obtained various observational constraints for our interacting Barrow holographic dark matter model using the Cosmic chronometer data and BAO data. In the upcoming version of the manuscript, we will add the observational constraints of our model using Pantheon data, also several calculations of other interaction scenarios will be added.</description>

      <title>Searching for intermediate mass ratio binary black hole mergers in the third observing run of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermediate mass ratio inspirals (IMRIs) of binary black holes with mass ratios $10^{-4}\lesssim q \lesssim 0.1$ are astrophysically interesting sources of gravitational waves. Mergers of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with stellar-mass black holes would be IMRIs, so their detection can help us probe the formation mechanisms of IMBHs. They can also help us perform precise tests of general relativity due to the presence of strong higher-order mode emission. We perform a search for aligned-spin IMRIs within the data of the two LIGO detectors in the third observing run (O3) of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration, including higher modes in the template banks for the first time. We use the IAS-HM pipeline for our search and construct template banks in the range $1/100 &lt; q&lt;1/18$ using the SEOBNRv5HM waveform model. Our banks retain a similar level of effectualness for IMRPhenomXHM and BHPTNRSur2dq1e3 waveforms, making our search results relatively robust against waveform systematics. We show that the sensitivity volume of the search increases by up to $\sim 500\%$ upon inclusion of higher modes. We do not find any significant candidates with inverse false alarm rate (IFAR) $&gt; 1$ year in the O3 data. This gives us upper limits on the IMRI merger rate in the local Universe, ranging from $\sim 30$ to $10^3$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ depending on the masses of the black holes in the binary. These constraints are consistent with rate predictions in the literature. Our projections indicate that we would be able to detect IMRIs or constrain some of their proposed formation channels in the fourth (O4) and fifth (O5) observing runs.</description>

      <title>Impact of a complex scalar spectator field on baryon asymmetry within spontaneous baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the framework of spontaneous baryogenesis by investigating the generation of baryon asymmetry when the inflaton, $\theta$, is minimally coupled with a complex spectator scalar field $\phi$, as $\theta^2|\phi|^2$. To do so, we also consider $\phi$ non-minimally coupled with the Ricci scalar curvature $R$ through a Yukawa-like interaction. We do not consider further interactions of the spectator field with the fermions of the Standard Model, considering it \emph{de facto} as a dark scalar field. In evaluating the violation of the baryon-number conservation during the reheating epoch, in a perfectly homogeneous and isotropic universe, we follow a semiclassical approach, where $\theta$, $\phi$ and gravity are considered as classical fields, whereas the fermions are quantized. We solve the equations of motion for the inflaton and spectator fields, respectively at first and zero-order in perturbation theory, neglecting at first stage the expansion of the universe. Afterwards, we quantify how the spectator field modifies the inflationary dynamics and thus find the baryon asymmetry produced via the inflaton decays into fermion-antifermion pairs by computing the corresponding decay amplitudes. We therefore obtain small first order correction to standard spontaneous baryogenesis and finally discuss the mass-mixing between fermions. Accordingly, the effects of considering the universe expansion are accounted, showing when the coupling between $\phi$ and $R$ becomes noticeable in altering the overall baryon asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation of gravitational waves from hyperbolic black hole encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems of two black holes with unbound orbits can produce a diverse array of gravitational wave signals with rich morphology. This parameter space encompasses both hyperbolic orbit scattering events and dynamical captures, including zoom-whirl orbits with multiple flybys and direct plunge mergers. These signals challenge traditional parameter estimation infrastructure, which is largely optimized for quasicircular inspiral binaries. In this work we discuss the adaptation of the Rapid Iterative FiTting (RIFT) algorithm to this problem using the TEOBResumSDALI waveform model which can simulate generic orbits. We present results from a study of simulated signals emulating a scatter and plunge event, utilizing the design sensitivity of the forthcoming Cosmic Explorer interferometer. Our analysis demonstrates that RIFT accurately recovers the mass, spins, and hyperbolic orbit parameters: the system energy and angular momentum defined at a fiducial initial separation.</description>

      <title>A Multimessenger Strategy for Downselecting the Orientations of Galactic Close White Dwarf Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The planned space-based gravitational wave detector, LISA, will provide a fundamentally new means of studying the orbital alignment of close white dwarf binaries. However, due to the inherent symmetry of their gravitational wave signals, a fourfold degeneracy arises in the transverse projections of their angular momentum vectors. In this paper, we demonstrate that by incorporating timing information from electromagnetic observations, such as radial velocity modulations and light curves, this degeneracy can be reduced to twofold.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian process framework for testing general relativity with gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave astronomy provides a promising avenue for the discovery of new physics beyond general relativity as it probes extreme curvature and ultra-relativistic dynamics. However, in the absence of a compelling alternative to general relativity, it is difficult to carry out an analysis that allows for a wide range of deviations. To that end, we introduce a Gaussian process framework to search for deviations from general relativity in gravitational-wave signals from binary black hole mergers with minimal assumptions. We employ a kernel that enforces our prior beliefs that - if gravitational waveforms deviate from the predictions of general relativity - the deviation is likely to be localised in time near the merger with some characteristic frequency. We demonstrate this formalism with simulated data and apply it to events from Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 3. We find no evidence for a deviation from general relativity. We limit the fractional deviation in gravitational-wave strain to as low as 7% (90% credibility) of the strain of GW190701_203306.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Backgrounds in the Gravitational Standard-Model Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider background fields within the gravitational sector of the Standard-Model Extension (SME) in a cosmological setting. Our analysis is divided into two parts. The first part addresses the consistency of nondynamical backgrounds in scenarios where diffeomorphism invariance is explicitly broken. Focusing on gravitational systems that admit Killing vector fields and possess a priori symmetries, we demonstrate that potential discrepancies between Riemannian geometry and dynamical equations can be avoided. The second part presents a direct application of various techniques developed by decomposing the modified Einstein equations along normal and tangential directions of the (3+1) decomposition. We show that nondynamical backgrounds can lead to accelerated cosmological expansion without requiring a cosmological constant, thereby opening new avenues for interpreting dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the stationary, uncharged, rotating, vacuum solution to Weyl conformal gravity. We elucidate the causal and ergoregion structure of the spacetimes found in the parameter space of the metric for positive mass. These are then compared to the corollary Kerr, Kerr-de Sitter, and Kerr-Anti-de Sitter solutions to general relativity. Additionally, we investigate and derive the extremal limits for both the horizons and ergosurfaces of the spacetimes.</description>

      <title>The Crossed Product, Modular (Tomita) Dynamics and its Role in the Transition of Type $III$ to Type $II_{\infty}$ v.Neumann Algebras and Connections to Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the role of the crossed product and the modular (Tomita) dynamics in the transition of type $III$ to type $II_{\infty}$ v.Neumann algebras which was recently observed in papers by Witten et al. In a preceding paper we argued that type $II_{\infty}$ v.Neumann algebras display certain features which we attributed to quantum gravity effects. We claim that the action of the modular evolution on the quantum fluctuations can be understood as an aspect of quantum gravity. We mention in this context the work of Sakharov on induced gravity. Furthermore we analyse the change of the properties of projectors and partial isometries in the transition from type $III$ to type $II_{\infty}$.</description>

      <title>Bouncing Bianchi Models with Deformed Commutation Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the anisotropic Bianchi I and Bianchi II models in vacuum in the framework of deformed commutation relations (DCRs). Working in a parametrisation of the spatial metric by a volume and two anisotropy variables, we propose modified Poisson brackets that for the volume alone reproduce the bounce dynamics of effective loop quantum cosmology (LQC), with additional modifications for anisotropy degrees of freedom. We derive effective Friedmann equations and observe cosmological bounces both in Bianchi I and Bianchi II. For Bianchi II, we find that the cosmological bounce now interacts with the usual reflection seen in the Kasner indices in various interesting ways, in close similarity again with what had been seen in LQC. This suggests that the DCR framework could model more general quantum-gravity inspired bounce scenarios in a relatively straightforward way.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Axionic Black-Hole Clouds as Seeds for Graviton Squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that both, standard general relativity (GR) and Chern-Simons (CS) gravity, the latter containing chiral gravitational anomaly terms, seed the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a multi-mode squeezed state. This involves the interaction of gravitons with the axionic cloud surrounding a superradiant Kerr (rotating) black hole background. The order of magnitude of the squeezing effect, specifically the number of graviton excitations in the squeezed vacuum, is estimated in the non-relativistic limit, relevant for the superradiance process. It is found analytically that the squeezing from the GR process of annihilation of two axions into two gravitons, dominates, by many orders of magnitude, that coming from the axion decay into two gravitons, induced by the higher-derivative CS term. It is also shown that significant squeezing effects are produced in the case of long-lived axionic clouds, whose lifetimes are much longer than the timescale for which superradiance is effective.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of nonlocal gravity black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the quasinormal modes of a new class of nonlocal static and spherically symmetric black hole (BH) solutions within the framework of the revised Deser-Woodard theory of gravity. These solutions are constructed as linear perturbations of the Schwarzschild spacetime and are characterized by an inverse power-law behavior of the lapse metric function. We derive the radial profiles of the effective potentials corresponding to scalar, electromagnetic and axial gravitational fluctuations on the BH background. Using the WKB method, complemented by Pad\'e approximants to regularize the trend of the effective potential near its peak, we compute the complex quasinormal mode frequencies associated with each type of perturbation. Our results are examined from both mathematical and physical perspectives, and are substantiated with references to existing literature. In particular, we compare the numerical outcomes with the predictions of the Schwarzschild metric to quantify deviations from the framework of general relativity. When all types of perturbations are combined, the relative deviations of the fundamental modes can reach up to $\sim 12\%$. Finally, we discuss the possibility to place observational bounds in the BH parameter space, based on the predicted sensitivities of future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

Abstract: We present the complete set of covariant equations that govern the locally rotationally symmetric torsion spacetimes sourced by Weyssenhoff fluid in Einstein-Cartan-Sciama-Kibble gravity. Using these equations, we can explore in detail the peculiar relationship between conformal structure and torsion. We develop a comprehensive scheme to categorize these torsional spacetimes into distinct classes. We explicitly analyze the properties of each class and obtain novel analytical solutions to the gravitational field equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore how a massless Tachyon field, when non-minimally coupled to gravity, affects gravitational memory, soft theorems, and symmetries near null infinity. We set up the model using both the Jordan and Einstein frames, work out the equations of motion and study the behavior of fields at large distances with the Bondi-Sachs gauge. The Tachyon adds a ``breathing'' polarization mode to the gravitational radiation, which modifies the Bondi mass loss formula and leaves a trace in the displacement memory effect. We also derived the leading and subleading soft factors, involving the radiation of a soft graviton or a soft scalar.</description>

      <title>Spacetime reconstruction by order and number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the random adjacency matrices induced by the chronological relations and i.i.d. samples of two spacetimes coincide in law if and only if the spacetimes in question are smoothly isometric. A similar result holds for weighted spacetimes. In the smooth framework of our article, this relaxes the hypotheses of the recent Gromov reconstruction theorem in Lorentzian signature by Braun-S\"amann from a.s. isometry of the respective time separation functions to a.s. order isometry. In a probabilistic way, our result makes a key paradigm of causal set theory rigorous: spacetime can be recovered by only knowing "order" and "number" of its points. It confirms a weak version of Bombelli's conjecture; therefore, it contributes to recent efforts of formalizing the Hauptvermutung (viz. fundamental conjecture) of causal set theory.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearities in Kerr Black Hole Ringdown from the Penrose Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a fully analytical approach to calculate the nonlinearities of the gravitational waves in the ringdown of a Kerr black hole in the eikonal limit. The corresponding quasi-normal modes are associated to the orbits of a closed circular null geodesic and the problem can be analyzed by taking the Penrose limit around it. We calculate analytically the amplitude and the phase of the quadratic quasi-normal modes as well as its dependence on the black hole spin.</description>

      <title>Dirty Black Holes, Clean Signals: Near-Horizon vs. Environmental Effects on Grey-Body Factors and Hawking Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grey-body factors are not only essential ingredients for computing the intensity of Hawking radiation, but also serve as characteristics of black hole's geometry that are closely related to their quasinormal modes. Importantly, they tend to be more stable under small deformations of the background spacetime. In this work, we carry out a detailed analysis of grey-body factors and Hawking radiation for a spherically symmetric black hole subject to localized deformations which do not alter the Hawking temperature: near-horizon modifications to simulate possible new physics or matter fields, and far-zone perturbations to model environmental or astrophysical effects. We show that environmental deformations have only a minor impact on the grey-body factors and Hawking radiation--unless the additional potential barrier created by the environment becomes comparable in height to the primary peak associated with the black hole itself, a scenario more relevant to nonlinear dynamics. In contrast, near-horizon deformations significantly affect the Hawking spectrum, particularly in the low-frequency regime.</description>

      <title>New cosmological solutions from type II de-Sitter gaugings in 4D $N=4$ gauged supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, which is a follow-up of arXiv:2102.06512, we document new cosmological solutions from four-dimensional $N=4$ matter-coupled supergravity. The solutions smoothly interpolate between a $dS_2\times S^2$ spacetime at $t\rightarrow -\infty$ and a $dS_4$ spacetime at $t\rightarrow +\infty$ and arise from the second-order equations of motion. Unlike the previously reported solutions in arXiv:2102.06512 that involve the diagonal $U(1)$ subgroup of both the electric and magnetic factors in the gauging, these solutions only require a single $U(1)$ factor from either the electric or magnetic part. Two additional features of these solutions that distinguish them from the previously presented solutions are the nonvanishing value of the dilaton $\phi$ and the fact that they are only admitted by the type II de-Sitter gauged theories.</description>

      <title>A Mid-Thirties Crisis: Dissecting the Properties of Gravitational Wave Sources Near the 35 Solar Mass Peak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One striking feature of binary black hole (BBH) mergers observed in the first decade of gravitational-wave astronomy is an excess of events with component masses around $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Multiple formation channels have been proposed to explain this excess. To distinguish among these channels, it is essential to examine their predicted population-level distributions across additional parameters. In this work, we focus on BBH mergers near the $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak and infer the population distributions of primary mass ($m_1$), mass ratio ($q$), effective spin ($\chi_{\rm eff}$), and redshift ($z$). We observe a gradual increase in the merger rate with $m_1$, rising by a factor of $3$ from $20\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ to a peak around $34\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, followed by a sharp, order-of-magnitude decline by $50\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. This population also shows a weak preference for equal-mass mergers and has a $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution skewed toward positive values, with a median of zero excluded at approximately $90\%$ confidence. We find no significant $q-\chi_{\rm eff}$ correlation in the $35\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak population, suggesting that lower-mass systems ($m_1&lt;20\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) likely drive the $q-\chi_{\rm eff}$ anti-correlation observed in the full BBH merger catalog. The redshift evolution of the merger rate is consistent with the cosmic star formation rate. We compare our findings with predictions from a wide range of formation channels. We find that common variants of the pair-instability supernova scenario, as well as hierarchical merger models, are incompatible with the observed features of the $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ population. Ultimately, none of the formation channels we consider can explain all or even most of the features observed in this population. The ''mid-thirties'' of black hole mergers are in crisis.</description>

      <title>Effect of symmetry energy on properties of rapidly rotating neutron stars and universal relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated universal relations for compact stars rotating at the Keplerian (mass-shedding) limit, which is
  highly relevant for understanding the rapidly rotating objects formed in the aftermath of a neutron star-neutron
  star merger. Our analysis is based on a set of nucleonic EoS featuring systematic variations in the symmetry
  energy slope parameter $L_{\rm sym}$ and the isoscalar skewness parameter $Q_{\rm sat}$, varied within ranges
  that are broadly consistent with current laboratory and astrophysical constraints. The global observable
  properties of isolated maximally rotating stars are examined, focusing on the mass-radius relation,
  moment of inertia, quadrupole moment, and the Keplerian (maximum) rotation frequency, as well as their
  variations in the $L_{\rm sym}$-$Q_{\rm sat}$ parameter space. Next, we demonstrate that, in the limit of Keplerian
  rotation, universal relations remain valid across the same set of EoSs characterized by varying $L_{\rm sym}$ and $Q_{\rm sat}$.
  In particular, we present explicit results for the moment of inertia and quadrupole moment as functions of compactness,
  as well as for the moment of inertia - quadrupole moment relation. All of these relations exhibit excellent universality,
  with deviations typically within a few percent and rarely exceeding 10\% across a wide range of parameters.
  These findings support the applicability of $I$-Love-$Q$-type universal relations in observational modeling
  of maximally rotating compact stars and the gravitational wave emitted by them, when accounting for significant
  variation in the symmetry energy and high-density behavior of the nuclear EoS.</description>

      <title>A theoretical prediction for the dipole in nearby distances using cosmography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmography is a widely applied method to infer kinematics of the Universe at small cosmological scales while remaining agnostic about the theory of gravity at play. Usually cosmologists invoke the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric in cosmographic analyses, however generalised approaches allow for analyses outside of any assumed geometrical model. These methods have great promise to be able to model-independently map the cosmic neighborhood where the Universe has not yet converged to isotropy. In this regime, anisotropies can bias parameter inferences if they are not accounted for, and thus must be included for precision cosmology analyses, even when the principle aim is to infer the background cosmology. In this paper, we develop a method to predict the dipole in luminosity distances that arises due to nearby inhomogeneities. This is the leading-order correction to the standard isotropic distance-redshift law. Within a very broad class of general-relativistic universe models, we provide an interpretation of the dipole in terms of the gradients in expansion rate and density which is free from any underlying background cosmology. We use numerical relativity simulations, with improved initial data methods, alongside fully relativistic ray tracing to test the power of our prediction. We find our prediction accurately captures the dipole signature in our simulations to within ~10% for redshifts $z\lesssim 0.07$ in reasonably smooth simulations. In the presence of more non-linear density fields, we find this reduces to $z\lesssim 0.02$. This represents up to an order of magnitude improvement with respect to what is achieved by naive, local cosmography-based predictions. Our paper thus addresses important issues regarding convergence properties of anisotropic cosmographic series expansions that would otherwise limit their applicability to very narrow redshift ranges.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Compact Object Binaries in the Lower Mass Gap with Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave event GW230529 was the first compact binary merger observation reported in the fourth observing run of the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA observatory network. The more massive component of the GW230529 source binary was inferred to contain a compact object in the lower mass gap, a purported gap between the most massive neutron stars and least massive black holes based on compact object observations in the Milky Way. However, the properties of the mass-gap object, such as its exact mass and spin, remain unresolved due to statistical uncertainties. To investigate the properties of the GW230529 source binary, we perform parameter estimation on a suite of simulated gravitational wave systems with similar parameters. We vary the intrinsic properties of the simulated systems, the detector noise properties, the signal-to-noise ratios, and the waveform model used in recovery. We find that the low signal-to-noise ratio of GW230529 is the key reason for the ambiguity in determining whether the mass of the primary object in the binary is consistent with a low-mass black hole or a high-mass neutron star, since the priors for the masses and spins have a significant impact on the posterior distribution. The inclusion of tidal effects in the waveform model also contributes to the observed degeneracies in the posteriors. We show that a higher signal-to-noise ratio in future observations of mass-gap gravitational wave sources will increase the precision of the measurements and allow us to determine whether the components are black holes or neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Radio emission from tidal disruption events produced by the collision between super-Eddington outflows and the circumnuclear medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we simulate the collision between outflows from the tidal disruption of a 1M$_\odot$ main sequence star around a $10^6$M$_\odot$ black hole and an initially spherically symmetric circumnuclear cloud. We launch super-Eddington outflows self-consistently by simulating the disruption of stars on both bound and unbound initial orbits using general relativistic smoothed particle hydrodynamics. We find shocks formed as early as $\sim 10~$days after the initial stellar disruption produce prompt radio emission. The shock radius ($\approx~10^{17}$~cm), velocity ($\sim 0.15$c) and total energy ($\sim 10^{51}$ erg) in our simulations match those inferred from radio observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs). We ray-trace to produce synthetic radio images and spectra to compare with the observations. While the TDE outflow is quasi-spherical, the synchrotron emitting region is aspherical but with reflection symmetry above and below the initial orbital plane. Our synthetic spectra show continuous decay in peak frequency, matching prompt radio TDE observations. Our model supports the hypothesis that synchrotron radio flares from TDEs result from the collision between outflows and the circumnuclear material.</description>

      <title>Slow Stable Self-bound Hybrid Star Can Relieve All Tensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some recent pulsar observations cannot naturally fit into the conventional picture of neutron stars: the compact objects associated with HESS J1731-347 and XTE J1814-338 have too small radii at the low-mass regime, while the secondary component of GW190814 is too massive for neutron stars to be compatible with constraints from the GW170817 event. In this study, we demonstrate that all these anomalous observations and tensions, together with other conventional ones such as recent NICER observations of PSR J0740+6620, J0030+0451, and PSR J0437-4715, can be naturally explained simultaneously by a new general type of hybrid stars that are self-bound and radially stable in the slow phase transition context, and by some subsets even in the rapid phase transition context also. As a proof of concept, we use hybrid quark stars, inverted hybrid stars, and hybrid strangeon stars as benchmark examples to explicitly demonstrate the advantage and feasibility of slow stable self-bound hybrid stars in relieving all tensions related to compact stars' masses, radii, and tidal deformabilities.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear reconstruction of general dark energy theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large variety and number of dark energy (DE) theories make it impractical to perform detailed analyses on a case-by-case basis, which has motivated proposals to ``parameterize" theories to reduce the size of theory space. The leading approach to do this is the effective field theory of dark energy (EFTofDE), which can describe general Horndeski-type theories with a small number of observationally accessible time-dependent functions. However, the EFTofDE primarily works for linear perturbations, and extending it to obtain a fully non-linear description of DE theories, which is critical for theories with screening mechanisms, is challenging. In this paper, we present a general method for reconstructing the non-linear DE Lagrangian from the background expansion history and certain linear-perturbation quantities, building upon the EFTofDE framework. Using numerical examples, we demonstrate that this method is applicable to a wide range of single-scalar-field dark energy and modified gravity theories, including quintessence, scalar-tensor theory, $k$-essence, and generalized cubic Galileon with shift symmetry. For each of these theories, we discuss the validity of the method and factors affecting its results. While this method involves solving differential equations, we find that the initial conditions are not important for quintessence, scalar-tensor theory and $k$-essence, while for shift-symmetric cubic Galileon, the generic tracker solution can help transform differential equations into algebraic equations. This offers a useful framework to connect cosmological observations at the background and linear-perturbation levels to the underlying non-linear dynamics of dark energy, and will enable cosmological simulations to analyze and examine DE theories systematically and in much greater detail.</description>

      <title>The principle of least action for random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the statistical properties of the physical action $S$ for random graphs, by treating the number of neighbors at each vertex of the graph (degree), as a scalar field. For each configuration (run) of the graph we calculate the Lagrangian of the degree field by using a lattice quantum field theory(LQFT) approach. Then the corresponding action is calculated by integrating the Lagrangian over all the vertices of the graph. We implement an evolution mechanism for the graph by removing one edge per a fundamental quantum of time, resulting in different evolution paths based on the run that is chosen at each evolution step. We calculate the action along each of these evolution paths, which allows us to calculate the probability distribution of $S$. We find that the distribution approaches the normal(Gaussian) form as the graph becomes denser, by adding more edges between its vertices. The maximum of the probability distribution of the action corresponds to graph configurations whose spacing between the values of $S$ becomes zero $\Delta S=0$, corresponding to the least-action (Hamilton) principle, which gives the path that the physical system follows classically. In addition, we calculate the fluctuations(variance) of the degree field showing that the graph configurations corresponding to the maximum probability of $S$, which follow the Hamilton's principle, have a balanced structure between regular and irregular graphs.</description>

      <title>Icarus's Orbit as the Ultimate Test for the Vulcan Hypothesis and General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General Relativity (GR) quantitatively accounts for the anomalous perihelion precession observed in several planets' orbits, with Mercury exhibiting the most significant deviation from Newtonian predictions. In the present work, I carry out an in-depth study comparing methods for calculating perihelion advance of inner planets using two methods, one based on the rotation of the Laplace-Runge-Lentz vector and the other on the evolution of the perihelion longitude. I show that, although the two methods predict almost identical perihelion advances for inner planets according to classical gravitational theory and the general relativity model, they give divergent results for the asteroid Icarus. Comparing numerical calculations of Icarus'perihelion advance with those predicted by Einstein's formula leads to the conclusion that only the method based on the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector offers a consistent explanation for the behavior of Icarus' perihelion advance. By incorporating the hypothetical planet Vulcan into the Newtonian gravitational model and analyzing its influence on the perihelion advances of the inner planets, I find that carefully selecting Vulcan's mass and orbital parameters yields a delicate balance between its semi-major axis and mass necessary to simultaneously match the observed perihelion advances of the inner planets. Vulcan, orbiting at a semi-major axis of 0.545 AU and possessing about one-third the mass of Mercury, could exert gravitational effects on Earth and Mars comparable to those predicted by GR. This Vulcan would cause an effect on Icarus' perihelion advance approximately nine times greater than the relativistic effect. Thus, precise observational data of Icarus's orbital dynamics offers a definitive means to either rule out this specific Vulcan hypothesis or, conversely, indicate the necessity of further refinement of GR's applications.</description>

      <title>Phases of Tree-decorated Dynamical Triangulations in 3D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work revisits the Euclidean Dynamical Triangulation (DT) approach to non-perturbative quantum gravity in three dimensions. Inspired by a recent combinatorial study by T. Budd and L. Lionni of a subclass of 3-sphere triangulations constructed from trees, called the \emph{triple-tree} class, we present a Monte Carlo investigation of DT decorated with a pair of spanning trees, one spanning the vertices and the other the tetrahedra of the triangulation. The complement of the pair of trees in the triangulation can be viewed as a bipartite graph, called the \emph{middle graph} of the triangulation. In the triple-tree class, the middle graph is restricted to be a tree, and numerical simulations have displayed a qualitatively different phase structure compared to standard DT. Relaxing this restriction, the middle graph comes with two natural invariants, namely the number of connected components and loops. Introducing corresponding coupling constants in the action, allows one to interpolate between the triple-tree class and unrestricted tree-decorated DT. Simulations of this extended model confirm the existence of a new phase, referred to as the \emph{triple-tree phase}, besides the familiar crumpled and branched polymer phases of DT. A statistical analysis of the phase transitions is presented, showing hints that the branched polymer to triple-tree phase transition is continuous.</description>

      <title>Toward graviton detection via photon-graviton quantum state conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A magnetic field enables the interconversion of photons and gravitons, yet the process is usually analysed only at the level of classical wave equations. We revisit photon-graviton conversion in a quantum field theoretic framework, allowing us to track the evolution of arbitrary quantum states. Treating the photons as squeezed coherent states and the gravitons as the squeezed vacuum expected for primordial gravitational waves, we derive analytic expressions for the conversion probability and show that it can be significantly enhanced compared to the conventional estimate. We further demonstrate that the conversion both swaps preexisting entanglement and generates genuinely new entanglement between the electromagnetic and gravitational sectors, which is impossible in any classical description. Detecting such nonclassical correlations would constitute compelling evidence for the quantization of gravity and offers a novel pathway toward graviton detection.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Fragmentation of the QCD Axion on the Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic misalignment, one of the most compelling scenarios for the non-thermal generation of axion dark matter, is generally accompanied by axion fragmentation, a process in which the energy of the axion condensate is transferred to its perturbations. The dynamics of fragmentation, at least in the context of dark matter production, have so far been studied semi-analytically using perturbation theory. In this work, we present the first classical lattice simulation of kinetic axion fragmentation in the context of dark matter production, focusing on parameters relevant to the QCD axion. Our findings indicate that the non-perturbative dynamics captured by the lattice lead to a significantly broader spectrum of axion fluctuations, with a sustained transfer of energy to mildly relativistic modes and with smaller occupation numbers compared to the linear approximation. As a consequence, the final dark matter abundance is typically O(1) lower than in the linear approximation, which is itself O(1) lower than the zero-mode-only prediction. This broadening and suppression of the spectrum could have a significant impact on axion mini-halo formation, one of the main experimental handles on kinetic fragmentation.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mass tension or suppressed growth rate of matter perturbations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assuming a minimal $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with three massive neutrinos, the joint analysis of Planck cosmic microwave background data, DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, and distance moduli measurements of Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon+ sample sets an upper bound on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.06$-$0.07$ eV, that lies barely above the lower limit from oscillation experiments. These constraints are mainly driven by mild differences in the inferred values of the matter density parameter across different probes that can be alleviated by introducing additional background-level degrees of freedom (e.g., by dynamical dark energy models). However, in this work we explore an alternative possibility. Since both $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ and massive neutrinos critically influence the growth of cosmic structures, we test whether the neutrino mass tension may originate from the way matter clusters, rather than from a breakdown of the $\Lambda$CDM expansion history. To this end, we introduce the growth index $\gamma$, which characterizes the rate at which matter perturbations grow. Deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM value ($\gamma \simeq 0.55$) can capture a broad class of models, including non-minimal dark sector physics and modified gravity. We show that allowing $\gamma$ to vary significantly relaxes the neutrino mass bounds to $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.13$-$0.2$ eV, removing any tension with terrestrial constraints without altering the inferred value of $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$. However, this comes at the cost of departing from standard growth predictions: to have $\sum m_\nu \gtrsim 0.06$ eV one needs $\gamma &gt; 0.55$, and we find a consistent preference for $\gamma &gt; 0.55$ at the level of $\sim 2\sigma$. This preference increases to $\sim 2.5$-$3\sigma$ when a physically motivated prior $\sum m_\nu \ge 0.06$ eV from oscillation experiments is imposed.</description>

      <title>$E_6$ Unification of Freeze-In Dark Matter and Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of \emph{freeze-in} dark matter production and baryogenesis in an $E_6$ extension of the Standard Model, featuring a residual $U(1)_{\psi'}$ gauge symmetry. This symmetry arises from a linear combination of $U(1)\chi$ and $U(1)_{\psi}$, both of which are subgroups of the $E_6$. The spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_{\psi'}$ symmetry governs the dynamics of a singlet fermion, which naturally serves as a freeze-in dark matter candidate. The dark matter mass arises from dimension-five operators, and a discrete symmetry ensures their stability. We show that freeze-in production from scalar decay can yield the correct relic abundance for dark matter masses between few MeV to a few hundred GeV. Simultaneously, heavy right-handed neutrinos generate light neutrino masses via the type-I seesaw and produce the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a new class of time periodic attractor solutions in scalar field cosmology, which we term Cosmological Frequency Combs (CFC). These solutions arise in exponential quintessence models with a phantom matter background and exhibit coherent phase-locked oscillations in the scalar field's normalized variables. We demonstrate that such dynamics induce modulations in observables like the Hubble parameter and growth rate, offering a dynamical mechanism to even address the H0 tension exactly. Our results uncover a previously unexplored phase of cosmic acceleration, linking the concept of frequency combs to large scale cosmological evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03509v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the scenario that the observable universe emerged from the vicinity of a negative mass ring singularity, and all content of the universe travels at the same group velocity close to the speed of light on a geodesic trajectory along the axis of rotation of the singularity. In appropriate coordinate parametrization and evaluated on the trajectory, we find that the metric tensor in the vicinity of the trajectory exhibits a conformal scale factor $a(\eta)$ with contraction and subsequent expansion properties that solve the horizon problem. We then introduce a static flow of gravitating radiation along the trajectory (perturbatively with respect to the mass scale of the singularity) to model a homogeneous radiation dominated universe. Solving the Einstein field equations with a physically motivated ansatz of metric perturbation then reveals that the effective conformal scale factor indeed grows asymptotically with the same power law as expected in a conventional radiation dominated universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06193v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the study of dark-energy compact stars in the context of modified Rastall teleparallel gravity. It is the first time that dark energy celestial phenomena have been explored in this modified gravitational theory. Employing the torsion-based functions, $f(T)$ and $h(T)$, we analyzed their effects in a spherically symmetric spacetime chosen as the interior geometry, while using the Schwarzschild geometry as an outer spacetime. In this study, we explored various dark energy stellar properties, including dark energy pressure components, energy conditions, and equation of state components. Our findings reveal that the observed negative behavior of these stellar properties served as compelling evidence, validating the presence of dark energy in stellar configurations. Detailed investigations of the energy conditions, pressure profiles, sound speeds, TOV equation, adiabatic index, gradients, mass function, compactness, and redshift function forecasts a comprehensive assessment, affirming the acceptability and realism of the investigated stellar configuration.</description>

      <title>The fermionic double smeared null energy condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy conditions are crucial for understanding why exotic phenomena such as traversable wormholes and closed timelike curves remain elusive. In this paper, we prove the Double Smeared Null Energy Condition (DSNEC) for the fermionic free theory in 4-dimensional flat Minkowski space-time, extending previous work on the same energy condition for the bosonic case [1][2] by adapting Fewster and Mistry's method [3] to the energy-momentum tensor $T_{++}$. A notable difference from previous works lies in the presence of the $\gamma_0 \gamma_+$ matrix in $T_{++}$, causing a loss of symmetry. This challenge is addressed by making use of its square-root matrix. We provide explicit analytic results for the massless case as well as numerical insights for the mass-dependence of the bound in the case of Gaussian smearing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08031v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new class of inflationary attractors in metric-affine gravity. Such class features a non-minimal coupling $\tilde\xi \, \Omega(\phi)$ with the Holst invariant $\tilde{\cal R}$ and an inflaton potential proportional to $\Omega(\phi)^2$. The attractor behaviour of the class takes place with two combined strong coupling limits. The first limit is realized at large $\tilde\xi$, which makes the theory equivalent to a $\tilde{\cal R}^2$ model. Then, the second limit considers a very small Barbero-Immirzi parameter which leads the inflationary predictions of the $\tilde{\cal R}^2$ model towards the ones of Starobinsky inflation. Because of the analogy with the renown $\xi$-attractors, we label this new class as $\tilde\xi$-attractors.</description>

      <title>Merging black holes with Cauchy-characteristic matching: Computation of late-time tails</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cauchy-characteristic matching (CCM) is a numerical-relativity technique that solves Einstein's equations on an effectively infinite computational domain, thereby eliminating systematic errors associated with artificial boundary conditions. Whether CCM can robustly handle fully nonlinear, dynamical spacetimes, such as binary black hole (BBH) mergers, has remained an open question. In this work, we provide a positive answer by presenting nine successful CCM simulations of BBHs; and demonstrate a key application of this method: computing late-time tails. Our results pave the path for systematic studies of late-time tails in BBH systems, and for producing highly accurate waveforms essential to next-generation gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Diffeomorphism Invariance Breaking in Gravity and Cosmological Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07848v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffeomorphism invariance breaking has been investigated in the literature in several contexts, including emergent General Relativity (GR). If GR emerges from an underlying theory without diffeomorphism invariance, there may be small violations of this symmetry at low energies. Since such small violations should not cause instabilities in cosmological evolution, it is a suitable framework for examining such symmetry-breaking effects. In this paper, the cosmological evolution with broken diffeomorphism invariance is investigated in the (modified) FLRW spacetime in the effective theory framework. The GR Lagrangian is augmented with all diffeomorphism-breaking but Lorentz-invariant terms in the leading order, namely, those involving two derivatives. The magnitudes of (minor) violations are kept general modulo the conditions for a healthy linearized theory. The analytic solutions of the scale factor in the full non-linear theory for the single-component universes are attempted; the radiation and vacuum solutions are found analytically, whereas the matter solution is worked out numerically since an analytic solution does not exist in the required form. It is observed that the solutions smoothly connect to those of GR in the limit of vanishing symmetry-breaking. The more realistic, two-component, and three-component universes are numerically studied, and no signs of unhealthy behavior are observed: minor diffeomorphism-violating modifications to GR at the level of two derivatives do not cause instabilities in the basic cosmological evolution.</description>

Abstract: We report on work using a newly developed code, SpheriCo.jl, that computes the gravitational collapse of a spherical scalar field, where the scalar can be either a classical field, or a quantum field operator. By utilising summation-by-parts methods for the numerical derivatives we are able to simulate the collapse longer than was possible previously due to enhanced numerical stability. We present a suite of tests for the code that tests its accuracy and stability, both for the classical and quantum fields. We are able to observe critical behavior of gravitational collapse for the classical setup, in agreement with expected results. The code is also used to compute two-point correlation functions, with results that hint at a non-trivial correlation across the horizon of Hawking quanta.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In scalar-tensor theories with derivative interactions, backgrounds spontaneously break local Lorentz invariance. We study the motion of perturbations of the scalar, "phonons", on these anisotropic time-dependent backgrounds in curved spacetimes. The phonons propagate on null geodesics of an effective acoustic spacetime which has its own metric and a connection featuring non-metricity with respect to the metric defined by gravity. These acoustic geodesics correspond to motion with four-acceleration in the usual spacetime. We indicate the differences and duality between the phonons' canonical four-momenta and four-velocities, and the analogies with photons in media. For an arbitrary moving observer, we covariantly define the phonon's energy, relative phase velocity, effective refraction index and mass tensor. We point out that true instabilities (ghosts, gradient) are observer independent, being identified by the acoustic metric's signature and determinant. However, apparent instabilities, such as complex phonon energies, can stem from an ill-posed Cauchy problem in certain observer frames. Negative phonon energies appear for supersonic observers, not signaling true instabilities, but leading to Cherenkov radiation. We extend this local picture to a global foliation, deriving the condition for a spatial slice to be a Cauchy surface for a well-posed initial value problem. This Hamiltonian is bounded if the foliation's comoving observer is subsonic. Otherwise, for a Killing vector timelike in both metrics, an alternative conserved charge that bounds motion exists. The action for perturbations yields an acoustically conserved asymmetric energy-momentum tensor (EMT), not conserved in the usual spacetime. Yet, with a timelike acoustic Killing vector, this EMT forms a current conserved in both the acoustic and usual spacetimes, with the acoustic Hamiltonian functional as its conserved charge.</description>

Abstract: Recently Hollands, Wald and Zhang proposed a new formula for the entropy of a dynamical black hole. We lift this construction to the dynamical cosmological event horizon of an asymptotically de Sitter spacetime. By introducing a nontrivial correction term in the formula for the entropy, we generalize Gibbons and Hawking's "first law of event horizons" to non-stationary eras. We also develop the non-stationary physical process first law between two arbitrary horizon cross-sections for the cosmological event horizon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many searches for continuous gravitational waves face significant computational challenges due to the need to explore large parameter spaces characterized by unknown parameters. Parameter-space metrics are used to predict the relative loss of signal power when the searched parameters differ from the true signal parameters. In this paper we present generalized parameter-space metrics for the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic (a detection statistic used in many searches) that improve upon previous idealized metrics by incorporating realistic effects such as data gaps and varying noise floors. We derive a new marginalized $\mathcal{F}$-statistic metric that is more accurate than the previous averaged $\mathcal{F}$-statistic metric, especially for short coherent segments. We also derive a more accurate semi-coherent metric that properly accounts for the signal-power variability over segments. We provide numerical tests illustrating that the new generalized metrics provide more accurate mismatch predictions than previous expressions. More accurate metrics can result in a reduced number of templates needed for a given search, a feature that could improve the sensitivity of future searches.</description>

      <title>Consistency relations bridging gravitational wave and large scale structure observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04574v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy provides a unified model independent theoretical framework to study the effects of dark energy and modified gravity. We show that applying the EFT to Horndeski theories it is possible to derive consistency relations (CR) between physically observable quantities, valid for different classes of theories defined by the brading parameter behavior, while leaving the other property functions free. As expected, the CRs are also valid for general relativity, and relate the effective gravitational constant, the slip parameter, the gravitational and electromagnetic waves (EMW) luminosity distances, the speed of gravitational waves (GW) and the sound speed. Inspired by the form of the CRs for no-brading and constant brading theories, we propose a generalized phenomenological consistency condition. We apply the CRs to map the large scale structure observational constraints on the effective gravitational constant and the slip parameter to GW-EMW distance ratio constraints. The CRs allow to probe the value of the effective gravitational constant and the slip parameter with multimessenger observations, independently from large scale structure observations.</description>

      <title>Diverse regular spacetimes using a parametrised density profile</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the construction of diverse regular spacetimes (black holes and defects) in General Relativity (GR) using a generic parametrised density profile (the Dekel-Zhao profile), which includes, for specific parameter choices, various well-known examples usually studied in the context of dark matter halos. Our solutions, in the Schwarzschild gauge, include new regular black holes as well as non-singular solutions representing spacetime defects. For a sub-class of metrics, a TOV equation approach with a chosen equation of state works. The status of the energy conditions and the issue of geodesic completeness are explored in detail. We also provide possible Lagrangian density constructions for the matter energy-momentum tensors. Further, we study the shadow radius of the new regular black holes, and compare our findings with available observational results from the EHT collaboration. Finally, for the defect solution, we present a model for a stable star (a gravastar) by explicit use of the junction conditions and obtain relevant consequences highlighting its characteristic features.</description>

      <title>Are gravitational waves consistent with other probes of gravity and dark energy?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has opened a new window on the Universe, allowing to obtain constraints on dark energy and gravity independent from other electromagnetic waves observations, such as large scale structure (LSS). For the purpose of investigating the consistency between different observations the effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy is a useful tool, allowing to derive model and parametrization independent consistency relations (CR) between the effective gravitational constant, the slip parameter, the gravitational and electromagnetic luminosity (EM) distance, and the speed of GWs. We test the constant brading CR, which is also satisfied by general relativity, by comparing for the first time the constraints obtained from LSS observations with those from GW events with and without electromagnetic counterparts, confirming the validity of the CR at the current level of experimental uncertainty. The event GW170817 and its electromagnetic counterpart provides a constraint of the effective gravitational constant with an accuracy comparable with LSS constraints, while the analysis of GW events without electromagnetic counterpart are consistent, but do not have a constraining power comparable to LSS observations. Beside allowing to test the consistency between independent observations, the CRs can be used to estimate the effective gravitational coupling with GWs at high redshift, where other observations are not available.</description>

      <title>Discovering the Dispersion of Gravitational Waves using Multi-Band Observation including Deci-Hertz: A Unique Probe to Cosmic Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dispersion in the speed of gravitational waves is a novel way to test the general theory of relativity and understand whether the origin of cosmic acceleration is due to any alternative theory of gravity. Several alternative theories of gravity predict dispersion in the gravitational wave signal in a frequency-dependent deviation from the speed of light at lower frequencies than accessible from current ground-based detectors. We show how a multi-band observation of gravitational wave signal combining deci-Hertz gravitational wave signal from LGWA (Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna) with ground-based detectors such as Cosmic Explorer or Einstein Telescope, and also including LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), we can probe the energy scale associated with effective theory of modified gravity scenarios by combining only $\mathcal{O}(10)$ high signal to noise ratio (SNR) with a precision of approximately $8.6\%$. This precision will further improve with the inclusion of more events as $\sqrt{N}$. In the future, this measurement will shed light on an unexplored domain of fundamental physics and will bring deeper insights into the phenomenon of cosmic acceleration. The operation of the gravitational wave detector in the deci-Hertz frequency band is key to exploring this frontier of fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits and gravitational waveforms in quantum-corrected black hole spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the periodic orbits of massive particles around two quantum-corrected black holes proposed in effective quantum gravity, and explore the quantum gravity effect on both the particle orbits and the associated gravitational wave signals. First, we analyze the geodesic motion of the massive particle around the black holes. We then study two important types of bound orbits of the massive particles, the marginally bound orbit and the innermost stable circular orbit. We find that, for the first black hole, increasing the quantum parameter $\zeta$ leads to larger orbital radii and reduced angular momenta for both orbits. In contrast, the second black hole shows $\zeta$-independent orbital radii and angular momenta. By analyzing the effective potential, we determine the allowed range of the energy and the angular momentum for bound orbits, with $\zeta$-dependence only for the first black hole. We further investigate periodic orbits with a fixed energy for both black holes, revealing that the parameter $\zeta$ similarly affects the orbits, although its effect is negligible in the second black hole. Finally, we calculate the gravitational waves emitted by the periodic orbits. The results demonstrate that increasing $\zeta$ leads to a significant phase delay for the first black hole, while only inducing a subtle phase advance for the second one. Therefore, we conclude that the first black hole can be distinguished from the Schwarzschild one through gravitational wave observations, whereas the second one cannot be effectively distinguished when the quantum correction is weak.</description>

      <title>Schwarzschild Black Holes Immersed in Born-Infeld Magnetic Fields and Their Observational Signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of Born-Infeld (BI) nonlinear electrodynamics on magnetic field configurations, photon orbits, and black hole shadows for Schwarzschild black holes immersed in magnetic fields. Assuming that the BI magnetic fields are asymptotically uniform and aligned with the polar axis, we solve the nonlinear magnetic field equations numerically using pseudospectral methods. Our analysis shows that nonlinear electromagnetic effects become prominent near the event horizon, particularly in the polar regions, where the magnetic field strength is significantly enhanced. This enhancement leads to closed photon orbits on the meridional plane becoming prolate, with noticeable stretching along the polar axis. Simulations of black hole images reveal that, at high observer inclinations, the shadow, which is circular in the Maxwell limit, becomes increasingly elongated along the polar direction as the nonlinear effects increase.</description>

      <title>Cosmological implications of hybrid metric-Palatini $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{R}_{\mu\nu}\mathcal{R}^{\mu\nu})$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hybrid metric-Palatini gravity with Lagrangian density $L =R+f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{R}_{\mu\nu}\mathcal{R}^{\mu\nu})$ is considered, where $R$ is the metric Ricci scalar and $\mathcal{R}_{\mu\nu}$ is the Palatini Ricci tensor. Contrary to the standard hybrid metric-Palatini theory, because of the term $\mathcal{R}_{\mu\nu}\mathcal{R}^{\mu\nu}$ in the action, the model can not be analytically transformed to a scalar-tensor theory. However, on top of a maximally symmetric space-times like the FRW universe, there is a way to solve for a metric compatible connection which we will follow in this paper. The cosmological implications of the resulting model will then be fully considered. The best fit values of the model and cosmological parameters will be obtained by confronting the model with the recent observational data on the Hubble parameter. We will see that the observational data can be explained very good in this model, but, significant deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model could be seen in derivatives of the Hubble parameter $q$, $j$ and $s$. We will perform a statefinder analysis for the model and show that its behavior differs from that of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Also, we will consider the recently proposed $Om$ diagnostics to categorize the dark energy type of the model and obtain the $\omega$-varying alternative of the model that mimics the Hubble flow.</description>

      <title>PixelPop: High Resolution Nonparameteric Inference of Gravitational-Wave Populations in Multiple Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16813v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origins of merging compact binaries observed by gravitational-wave detectors remains highly uncertain. Several astrophysical channels may contribute to the overall merger rate, with distinct formation processes imprinted on the structure and correlations in the underlying distributions of binary source parameters. In the absence of confident theoretical models, the current understanding of this population mostly relies on simple parametric models that make strong assumptions and are prone to misspecification. Recent work has made progress using more flexible nonparametric models, but detailed measurement of the multidimensional population remains challenging. In pursuit of this, we present PixelPop-a high resolution Bayesian nonparametric model to infer joint distributions and parameter correlations with minimal assumptions. PixelPop densely bins the joint parameter space and directly infers the merger rate in each bin, assuming only that bins are coupled to their nearest neighbors. We demonstrate this method on mock populations with and without bivariate source correlations, employing several statistical metrics for information gain and correlation significance to quantify our nonparametric results. We show that PixelPop correctly recovers the true populations within posterior uncertainties and offers a conservative assessment of population-level features and parameter correlations. Its flexibility and tractability make it a useful data-driven tool to probe gravitational-wave populations in multiple dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Formation channels of merging compact binaries imprint themselves on the distributions and correlations of their source parameters, but current understanding of this population is hindered by simplified parametric models. We overcome such limitations using PixelPop [Heinzel et al. (2025)]-our Bayesian nonparametric multidimensional population model. We analyze data from the first three LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs and make high resolution, minimally modeled measurements of the pairwise distributions of binary black hole masses, redshifts, and spins. We find no evidence that the mass spectrum evolves over redshift and show that such measurements are fundamentally limited by the detector horizon. We find support for correlations of the spin distribution with binary mass ratio and redshift, but at reduced significance compared to overly constraining parametric models. Confident data-driven conclusions about population-level correlations with flexible models like PixelPop will require more informative gravitational-wave catalogs.</description>

Abstract: We construct a relativistic quantum communication channel between two localized qubit systems, mediated by a relativistic quantum field, that can achieve the theoretical maximum for the quantum capacity in arbitrary curved spacetimes using the Unruh-DeWitt detector formalism. Using techniques from algebraic quantum field theory, we express the quantum capacity of the quantum communication channel purely in terms of the correlation functions of the field and the causal propagator for the wave equation. Consequently, the resulting quantum channel, and hence the quantum capacity, are by construction manifestly covariant, respect the causal structure of spacetime, and are independent of the details of the background geometry, topology, and the choice of Hilbert space (quasifree) representations of the field.</description>

      <title>Is the $w_0w_a$CDM cosmological parameterization evidence for dark energy dynamics partially caused by the excess smoothing of Planck CMB anisotropy data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the performance of the spatially-flat dynamical dark energy (DE) $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization, with redshift-dependent DE fluid equation of state parameter $w(z) = w_0 + w_a z/(1+z)$, with and without a varying CMB lensing consistency parameter $A_L$, against Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data (P18 and lensing) and a combination of non-CMB data composed of baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements that do not include DESI BAO data, Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae (SNIa) observations, Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] measurements, and growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) data points. From our most restrictive data set, P18+lensing+non-CMB, for the $w_0w_a$CDM+$A_L$ parameterization, we obtain $w_0=-0.879\pm 0.060$, $w_a=-0.39^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$, the asymptotic limit $w(z\to\infty) = w_0+w_a=-1.27^{+0.20}_{-0.17}$, and $A_L=1.078^{+0.036}_{-0.040}$ (all $1\sigma$ errors). This joint analysis of CMB and non-CMB data favors DE dynamics over a cosmological constant at $\sim 1\sigma$ and $A_L&gt;1$ at $\sim 2\sigma$, i.e. more smoothing of the Planck CMB anisotropy data than is predicted by the best-fit model. For the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization with $A_L=1$ the evidence in favor of DE dynamics is larger, $\sim 2\sigma$, suggesting that at least part of the evidence for DE dynamics comes from the excess smoothing of the Planck CMB anisotropy data. For the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization with $A_L=1$, there is a difference of $2.8\sigma$ between P18 and non-CMB cosmological parameter constraints and $2.7\sigma$ between P18+lensing and non-CMB constraints. When $A_L$ is allowed to vary these tensions reduced to $1.9\sigma$ and $2.1\sigma$ respectively. Our P18+lensing+non-CMB data compilation positively favors the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization without and with a varying $A_L$ parameter over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, and $w_0w_a$CDM+$A_L$ is also positively favored over $w_0w_a$CDM.</description>

      <title>Black Holes as Condensation Points of Fuzzy Dark Matter Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15465v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simulate the formation of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) cores in the presence of a Black Hole (BH) to explore whether BHs can serve as seeds for FDM core condensation. Our analysis is based on the core-condensation via the kinetic relaxation process for random initial conditions of the FDM. In a generic scenario the BH merges with a pre-collapsed mini-cluster formed in a random location, once they share location the core-condensation starts withe the FDM density centered at the black hole that during the process acquires a profile consistent with that of the stationary solution of the FDM+BH eigenvalue problem. These results indicate that BHs can indeed act as focal points for FDM core condensation. Furthermore, we find that the central density of the resulting FDM core depends on the mass of the BH, which due to its permanent motion relative to the FDM core during the evolution, produces a smaller core density for bigger BH masses; in this way the BH mass is a parameter leading to a new diversity of central FDM core densities. As a collateral result, for our analysis we revised the construction of stationary solutions of FDM+BH and found a phenomenological formula for the FDM density that can be used to fit FDM cores around BHs.</description>

      <title>Is excess smoothing of Planck CMB ansiotropy data partially responsible for evidence for dark energy dynamics in other $w(z)$CDM parametrizations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study spatially-flat dynamical dark energy parametrizations, $w(z)$CDM, with redshift-dependent dark energy equation of state parameter $w(z)$ expressed using three different quadratic and other polynomial forms (as functions of $1-a$, where $a$ is the scale factor), without and with a varying cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing consistency parameter $A_L$. We use Planck CMB anisotropy data (P18 and lensing) and a large, mutually-consistent non-CMB data compilation that includes Pantheon+ type Ia supernova, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), Hubble parameter ($H(z)$), and growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) measurements, but not recent DESI BAO data. The six $w(z)$CDM ($+A_L$) parametrizations show higher consistency between the CMB and non-CMB data constraints compared to the XCDM ($+A_L$) and $w_0 w_a$CDM ($+A_L$) cases. Constraints from the most-restrictive P18+lensing+non-CMB data compilation on the six $w(z)$CDM ($+A_L$) parametrizations indicate that dark energy dynamics is favored over a cosmological constant by $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ when $A_L = 1$, but only by $\gtrsim 1\sigma$ when $A_L$ is allowed to vary (and $A_L&gt;1$ at $\sim2\sigma$ significance). Non-CMB data dominate the P18+lensing+non-CMB compilation at low $z$ and favor quintessence-like dark energy. At high $z$ P18+lensing data dominate, favoring phantom-like dark energy with significance from $1.5\sigma$ to $2.9 \sigma$ when $A_L = 1$, and from $1.1\sigma$ to $1.8\sigma$ when $A_L$ varies. These results suggest that the observed excess weak lensing smoothing of some of the Planck CMB anistropy multipoles is partially responsible for the $A_L = 1$ cases $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ evidence for dark energy dynamics over a cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Relational Supersymmetry via the Dressing Field Method and Matter-Interaction Supergeometric Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relationality is the paradigmatic conceptual core of general-relativistic gauge field theory. It can be made manifest via the Dressing Field Method (DFM) of symmetry reduction, a systematic tool to achieve gauge-invariance by extracting the physical degrees of freedom representing relations among field variables. We review and further expand on some applications of the DFM to the very foundations of the supersymmetric framework, where it allows to build relational supersymmetric field theory and (dis)solves crucial issues. Furthermore, we elaborate on a novel approach within the relational supersymmetric field theory framework giving a unified description of fermionic matter fields and bosonic gauge fields, and thus close to Berezin's original motivation for the introduction of supergeometry in fundamental physics: a Matter-Interaction Supergeometric Unification (MISU). This new approach stands irrespective from the ultimate empirical status of standard supersymmetric field theory, about which it is agnostic.</description>

      <title>$T\overline{T}$ and the black hole interior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is ample evidence that the bulk dual of a $T\overline{T}$ deformed holographic CFT is a gravitational system with a finite area cutoff boundary. For states dual to black holes, the finite cutoff surface cannot be moved beyond the event horizon. We overcome this by considering an extension of the $T\overline{T}$ deformation with a boundary cosmological constant and a prescription for a sequence of flows that successfully pushes the cutoff boundary past the event horizon and arbitrarily close to the black hole singularity. We show how this sequence avoids the complexification of the deformed boundary energies. The approach to the singularity is reflected on the boundary by the approach of the deformed energies to an accumulation point in the limit of arbitrarily large distance in deformation space. We argue that this sequence of flows is automatically implemented by the gravitational path integral given only the values of the initial ADM charges and the area of the finite cutoff surface, suggesting a similar automatic boundary mechanism that keeps all the deformed energies real at arbitrary values of the deformation parameter. This leads to a natural definition of a deformed boundary canonical ensemble partition function that sums over the entire spectrum and remains real for any value of the deformation parameter. We find that this partition function displays Hagedorn growth at the scale set by the deformation parameter, which we associate to the region near the inner horizon in the bulk dual.</description>

      <title>What triggers type Ia supernovae: Prompt detonations from primordial black holes or companion stars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We set up and perform collision rate simulations between dark matter in the form of asteroid-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) and white dwarf stars. These encounters trigger prompt detonations and could be the key to solving the ignition mystery of type Ia supernovae. Our framework is flexible enough to cover the full range of progenitor white dwarf masses, host galaxy stellar masses, galactocentric radial offsets, and cosmic time. The rate distribution pattern is consistent with exhaustive literature observational determinations for a slightly extended log-normal PBH mass spectrum. Most strikingly, the so far unexplained brightness distribution comes out without finetuning. We find no severe contradictions, except that the inferred PBH mass scale is unpredicted from first principles.</description>

      <title>A Photon Cloud Induced from an Axion Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that the axion-photon coupling can lead to quantum stimulated emission of photons and classic exponential amplification of electromagnetic (EM) fields at half the axion mass frequency, when the axion density or the coupling constant is sufficiently large. In this work, we studied the EM photon cloud induced from an axion cloud around a Kerr black hole in the first order of the coupling constant classically. In the presence of a static EM background (like Wald extended solution) valid in realistic astrophysical environment, we found that an EM photon cloud emerges, oscillating at the same frequency as the axion cloud and growing exponentially in accordance with the axion cloud when the superradiant condition for the axion field is satisfied. Notably, the first-order study indicates that this photon cloud exists with no threshold for the coupling constant. The evolution of the EM photon cloud with time and azimuthal angle is obtained analytically while the cross-sectional distribution is solved numerically. Intriguingly, the induced EM field exhibits significantly different symmetries in contrast to the background EM field, which may serve as an indication of the existence of both an axion cloud and axion-photon coupling. Furthermore, in the near horizon region, the induced EM field has some overlap with the photon region as expected.</description>
