      <title>Optimizing omnigenity like quasisymmetry for stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Omnigenous magnetic fields, where the bounce-averaged radial drift vanishes, offer a promising solution to confine charged particles in fusion devices, particularly in stellarators. However, nonquasisymmetric omnigenity has remained underexplored due to the absence of a general optimization method. We introduce a novel approach for optimizing omnigenity. With simplicity comparable to quasisymmetry (QS) optimization, the new method unifies both QS and non-QS omnigenity optimization and can be further generalized to optimize configurations beyond omnigenity. Precisely omnigenous configurations with exceptional confinement and unprecedented compactness have been realized. Moreover, novel configurations like pseudosymmetry and piecewise omnigenity have been directly optimized for the first time. These advances enable efficient explorations of practical stellarator designs with enhanced confinement and engineering feasibility.</description>

      <title>Modelling of shattered pellet injection experiments on the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a shattered pellet injection (SPI) system the penetration and assimilation of the injected material depends on the speed and size distribution of the SPI fragments. ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) was recently equipped with a flexible SPI to study the effect of these parameters on disruption mitigation efficiency. In this paper we study the impact of different parameters on SPI assimilation with the 1.5D INDEX code. Scans of fragment sizes, speeds and different pellet compositions are carried out for single SPI into AUG H-mode plasmas. We use a semi-empirical thermal quench (TQ) onset condition to study the material assimilation trends. For mixed deuterium-neon pellets, smaller/faster fragments start to assimilate quicker. However, at the expected onset of the global reconnection event (GRE),larger/faster fragments end up assimilating more material. Variations in the injected neon content lead to a large difference in the assimilated neon for neon content below $&lt; 10^{21}$ atoms. For larger injected neon content, a self-regulating mechanism limits the variation in the amount of assimilated neon. We use a back-averaging model to simulate the plasmoid drift during pure deuterium injections with the back-averaging parameter determined by a interpretative simulation of an experimental pure deuterium injection discharge. Again, larger and faster fragments are found to lead to higher assimilation with the material assimilation limited to the plasma edge in general, due to the plasmoid drift. The trends of assimilation for varying fragment sizes, speeds and pellet composition qualitatively agree with the previously reported experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Density fluctuation-Mach number scaling in compressible, high plasma beta turbulence: in-situ space observations and high-Reynolds number simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of compressible fluctuations in a broad range of turbulent plasmas, from the intracluster medium to the solar wind, has been an active field of research in the past decades. Theoretical frameworks for weakly compressible MHD turbulence in an inhomogeneous background magnetic field predict a linear scaling of the normalized mass density fluctuation ($\delta \rho / \rho_0$), as a function of the turbulent Mach number ($\mathcal{M}_t$), $\delta \rho / \rho_0 \propto \mathcal{M}_t$. However, so far the scaling relation has been tested only using moderate to low plasma beta ($\beta \lesssim 1$) solar wind observational data where the compressibility is weak $\delta \rho / \rho_0 \sim 0.1$. Here, we combine NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission data in Earth's magnetosheath, where $\beta \sim 10$ is high, and $\beta \sim 1$ highly-compressible magnetohydrodynamic turbulence simulations at unprecedented resolutions. Both show that $\delta \rho / \rho_0 \propto \mathcal{M}_t$ holds across a broad range of $\delta \rho / \rho_0$, $\mathcal{M}_t$ and $\beta$, demonstrating that $\delta \rho / \rho_0 \propto \mathcal{M}_t$ is a robust compressible turbulence relation, going beyond the asymptotics of the weakly compressible theory. We discuss the findings in the context of understanding the nature of strongly compressible turbulent fluctuations and the driving parameter in astrophysical and space plasmas.</description>

      <title>Spin Transport Hydrodynamics of Polarized Deuterium-Tritium Fusion Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.11523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin transport equations for polarized deuterium-tritium (DT) fusion plasma are derived with the density matrix formulation, which are used to investigate the hydrodynamics of polarized DT-gas-filled targets during indirectly driven inertial confinement fusion implosions. The depolarization of DT ions by strong self-generated magnetic fields can be captured by the spin transport equation. The neutron yield, angular distribution and neutron beam polarization are obtained from three-dimensional spin transport hydrodynamics simulations of the target implosions. The simulation results indicate that an optimized spin alignment of the polarized target can reduce the depolarization of DT ions and the neutron beams induced by polar mode asymmetries in indirectly driven implosions.</description>

      <title>Magnetic mesh generation and field line reconstruction for scrape-off layer and divertor modeling in stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The design of divertor targets and baffles for optimal heat and particle exhaust from magnetically confined fusion plasmas requires a combination of fast, low-fidelity models (such as EMC3-lite [1]) for scoping studies and high-fidelity ones (such as EMC3-EIRENE [2]) for verification. Both of those approaches benefit from a magnetic flux tube mesh for fast interpolation and mapping of field line segments [3]. A new mesh generator for unstructured quadrilateral flux tubes with adaptive refinement is presented and integrated into FLARE [4]. For HSX with an extended first wall, it is found that several layers of flux tubes can span the entire half field period before splitting is required. This is an advantage over the traditional setup of the EMC3-EIRENE mesh where careful construction of several sub-domains is required already for the much tighter present first wall. The divide and conquer paradigm with unstructured mesh layout offers a powerful alternative for integration into optimization workflows. Further examples for W7-X and CTH are presented.</description>

      <title>An assessment of observational coverage and gaps for robust Sun to heliosphere integrated science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the generation and development of the continuous outflow from the Sun requires tracing the physical conditions from deep in the corona to the heliosphere. Detailed global observations of plasma state variables and the magnetic field are needed to provide critical constraints to the underlying physics driving models of the corona and solar wind. Key diagnostics of the solar wind require measurements at its formation site and during its outflow to continuously track it across rapidly changing regions of space. A unified view of the solar wind is only possible through coordinated remote and in situ observations that probe these different regions. Here, we discuss current observational coverage and gaps of different plasma properties and review recent coordinated studies. We highlight how these efforts may become more routine with the launch of upcoming and planned missions.</description>
