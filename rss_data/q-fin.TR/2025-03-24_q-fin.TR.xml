      <title>A Simple Strategy to Deal with Toxic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the trading activity between a broker and her clients (informed and uninformed traders) as an infinite-horizon stochastic control problem. We derive the broker's optimal dealing strategy in closed form and use this to introduce an algorithm that bypasses the need to calibrate individual parameters, so the dealing strategy can be executed in real-world trading environments. Finally, we characterise the discount in the price of liquidity a broker offers clients. The discount strikes the optimal balance between maximising the order flow from the broker's clients and minimising adverse selection losses to the informed traders.</description>

      <title>Informer in Algorithmic Investment Strategies on High Frequency Bitcoin Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article investigates the usage of Informer architecture for building automated trading strategies for high frequency Bitcoin data. Three strategies using Informer model with different loss functions: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Generalized Mean Absolute Directional Loss (GMADL) and Quantile loss, are proposed and evaluated against the Buy and Hold benchmark and two benchmark strategies based on technical indicators. The evaluation is conducted using data of various frequencies: 5 minute, 15 minute, and 30 minute intervals, over the 6 different periods. Although the Informer-based model with Quantile loss did not outperform the benchmark, two other models achieved better results. The performance of the model using RMSE loss worsens when used with higher frequency data while the model that uses novel GMADL loss function is benefiting from higher frequency data and when trained on 5 minute interval it beat all the other strategies on most of the testing periods. The primary contribution of this study is the application and assessment of the RMSE, GMADL, and Quantile loss functions with the Informer model to forecast future returns, subsequently using these forecasts to develop automated trading strategies. The research provides evidence that employing an Informer model trained with the GMADL loss function can result in superior trading outcomes compared to the buy-and-hold approach.</description>

      <title>Generating realistic metaorders from public data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel algorithm for generating realistic metaorders from public trade data, addressing a longstanding challenge in price impact research that has traditionally relied on proprietary datasets. Our method effectively recovers all established stylized facts of metaorders impact, such as the Square Root Law, the concave profile during metaorder execution, and the post-execution decay. This algorithm not only overcomes the dependence on proprietary data, a major barrier to research reproducibility, but also enables the creation of larger and more robust datasets that may increase the quality of empirical studies. Our findings strongly suggest that average realized short-term price impact is not due to information revelation (as in the Kyle framework) but has a mechanical origin which could explain the universality of the Square Root Law.</description>

      <title>Position building in competition is a game with incomplete information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines strategic trading under incomplete information, where firms lack full knowledge of key aspects of their competitors' trading strategies such as target sizes and market impact models. We extend previous work on competitive trading equilibria by incorporating uncertainty through the framework of Bayesian games. This allows us to analyze scenarios where firms have diverse beliefs about market conditions and each other's strategies. We derive optimal trading strategies in this setting and demonstrate how uncertainty significantly impacts these strategies compared to the complete information case.
  Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach to model the presence of non-strategic traders, even when strategic firms disagree on their characteristics. Our analysis reveals the complex interplay of beliefs and strategic adjustments required in such an environment. Finally, we discuss limitations of the current model, including the reliance on linear market impact and the lack of dynamic strategy adjustments, outlining directions for future research.</description>
