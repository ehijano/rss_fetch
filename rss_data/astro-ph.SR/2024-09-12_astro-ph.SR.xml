      <title>JWST imaging of the closest globular clusters -- IV. Chemistry, luminosity, and mass functions of the lowest-mass members in the NIRISS parallel fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observations of the two closest globular clusters, NGC 6121 and NGC 6397, taken with the NIRISS detector of JWST. The combination of our new JWST data with archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images allows us to compute proper motions, disentangle cluster members from field objects, and probe the main sequence (MS) of the clusters down to &lt;0.1 $M_\odot$ as well as the brighter part of the white-dwarf sequence. We show that theoretical isochrones fall short in modeling the low-mass MS and discuss possible explanations for the observed discrepancies. Our analysis suggests that the lowest-mass members of both clusters are significantly more metal-rich and oxygen-poor than their higher-mass counterparts. It is unclear whether the difference is caused by a genuine mass-dependent chemical heterogeneity, low-temperature atmospheric processes altering the observed abundances, or systematic shortcomings in the models. We computed the present-day local luminosity and mass functions of the two clusters; our data reveal a strong flattening of the mass function indicative of a significant preferential loss of low-mass stars in agreement with previous dynamical models for these two clusters. We have made our NIRISS astro-photometric catalogs and stacked images publicly available to the community.</description>

      <title>One month convection timescale on the surface of a giant evolved star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport of energy through convection is important during many stages of stellar evolution, and is best studied in our Sun or giant evolved stars. Features that are attributed to convection are found on the surface of massive red supergiant stars. Also for lower mass evolved stars, indications of convection are found, but convective timescales and sizes remain poorly constrained. Models indicate that convective motions are crucial for the production of strong winds that return the products of stellar nucleosynthesis into the interstellar medium. Here we report a series of reconstructed interferometric images of the surface of the evolved giant star R Doradus. The images reveal a stellar disc with prominent small scale features that provide the structure and motions of convection on the stellar surface. We find that the dominant structure size of the features on the stellar disc is $0.72\pm0.05$ astronomical units (au). We measure the velocity of the surface motions to vary between $-18$ and $+20$ km s$^{-1}$, which means the convective timescale is approximately one month. This indicates a possible difference between the convection properties of low-mass and high-mass evolved stars.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Bow-Shock Nebula around the Z Cam-type Cataclysmic Variable SY Cancri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the serendipitous discovery of a bow-shock nebula around the cataclysmic variable (CV) SY Cancri. In addition, SY Cnc lies near the edge of a faint Halpha-emitting nebula with a diameter of about 15'. The orientation of the bow shock is consistent with the direction of SY Cnc's proper motion. Nebulae are extremely rare around CVs, apart from those known to have undergone classical-nova (CN) outbursts; bow shocks and off-center nebulae are even more unusual. Nevertheless, the properties of SY Cnc and its nebulosity are strikingly similar to those of V341 Ara, another CV that is also associated with a bow shock and is likewise off-center with respect to its faint Halpha nebula. Both stars are binaries with optically thick accretion disks, belonging to the classes of Z Cam CVs or nova-like variables. We discuss three scenarios to explain the properties of the nebulae. They may have resulted from chance encounters with interstellar gas clouds, with the stars leaving in their wakes material that is recombining after being photoionized by UV radiation from the CVs. Alternatively, the large nebulae could be ejecta from unobserved CN outbursts in the recent past, which have been decelerated through collisions with the interstellar medium (ISM), while the stars continue to snowplow through the gas. Or the faint Halpha nebulae may be ambient ISM that was shock-ionized by a CN outburst in the past and is now recombining.</description>

      <title>The only inflated brown dwarf in an eclipsing white dwarf-brown dwarf binary: WD1032+011B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their short orbital periods and relatively high flux ratios, irradiated brown dwarfs in binaries with white dwarfs offer better opportunities to study irradiated atmospheres than hot Jupiters, which have lower planet-to-star flux ratios. WD1032+011 is an eclipsing, tidally locked white dwarf-brown dwarf binary with a 9950 K white dwarf orbited by a 69.7 M$_{Jup}$ brown dwarf in a 0.09 day orbit. We present time-resolved Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 spectrophotometric data of WD1032+011. We isolate the phase-dependent spectra of WD1032+011B, finding a 210 K difference in brightness temperature between the dayside and nightside. The spectral type of the brown dwarf is identified as L1 peculiar, with atmospheric retrievals and comparison to field brown dwarfs showing evidence for a cloud-free atmosphere. The retrieved temperature of the dayside is $1748^{+66}_{-67}$ K, with a nightside temperature of $1555^{+76}_{-62}$ K, showing an irradiation-driven temperature contrast coupled with inefficient heat redistribution from the dayside to the nightside. The brown dwarf radius is inflated, likely due to the constant irradiation from the white dwarf, making it the only known inflated brown dwarf in an eclipsing white dwarf-brown dwarf binary.</description>

      <title>Doppler velocity of $m=1$ high-latitude inertial mode over the last five sunspot cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the identified solar inertial modes, the high-latitude mode with azimuthal order $m=1$ (HL1) has the largest amplitude and plays a role in shaping the Sun's differential rotation profile. We aim to study the evolution of the HL1 mode parameters, utilizing Dopplergrams from the Mount Wilson Observatory (MWO), GONG, and HMI, covering together five solar cycles since 1967. We calculated the averages of line-of-sight Doppler signals over longitude, weighted by the sine of longitude with respect to the central meridian, as a proxy for zonal velocity at the surface. We measured the mode's power and frequency from these zonal velocities at high latitudes in sliding time windows of three years. We find that the amplitude of the HL1 mode undergoes very large variations, taking maximum values at the start of solar cycles 21, 22 and 25, and during the rising phases of cycles 23 and 24. The mode amplitude is anticorrelated with the sunspot number (corr=$-0.50$) but not correlated with the polar field strength. Over the period 1983-2022 the mode amplitude is strongly anticorrelated with the rotation rate at latitude $60^\circ$ (corr=$-0.82$), i.e., with the rotation rate near the mode's critical latitude. The mode frequency variations are small and display no clear solar cycle periodicity above the noise level ($\sim \pm 3$~nHz). Since about 1990, the mode frequency follows an overall decrease of $\sim 0.25$ nHz/year, consistent with the long-term decrease of the angular velocity at $60^\circ$ latitude. We expect that these very long time series of the mode properties will be key to constrain models and reveal the dynamical interactions between the high-latitude modes, rotation, and the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Kink instability of flux ropes in partially-ionised plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the solar atmosphere, flux ropes are subject to current driven instabilities that are crucial in driving plasma eruptions, ejections and heating. A typical ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) instability developing in flux ropes is the helical kink, which twists the flux rope axis. The growth of this instability can trigger magnetic reconnection, which can explain the formation of chromospheric jets and spicules, but its development has never been investigated in a partially-ionised plasma (PIP). Here we study the kink instability in PIP to understand how it develops in the solar chromosphere, where it is affected by charge-neutral interactions. Partial ionisation speeds up the onset of the non-linear phase of the instability, as the plasma $\beta$ of the isolated plasma is smaller than the total plasma $\beta$ of the bulk. The distribution of the released magnetic energy changes in fully and partially-ionised plasmas, with a larger increase of internal energy associated to the PIP cases. The temperature in PIP increases faster also due to heating terms from the two-fluid dynamics. PIP effects trigger the kink instability on shorter time scales, which is reflected in a more explosive chromospheric flux rope dynamics. These results are crucial to understand the dynamics of small-scale chromospheric structures - mini-filament eruptions - that this far have been largely neglected but could significantly contribute to chromospheric heating and jet formation.</description>

      <title>Revealing the elusive companion of the red giant binary 2MASSJ05215658+4359220 from UV HST and Astrosat-UVIT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole demographics in different environments is critical in view of recent results on massive-stars binarity, and of the multi-messenger detectability of compact objects mergers. But the identification and characterization of non-interacting black holes is elusive, especially in the sparse field stellar population. A candidate non-interactive black hole (BH)+red giant (RG) binary system, 2MASSJ05215658+4359220, was identified by Thompson et al.(2019). We obtained Astrosat/UVIT Far-Ultraviolet (FUV) imaging and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) UV-optical imaging and spectroscopy of the source, to test possible scenarios for the optically-elusive companion. HST/STIS spectra from about 1,600 to 10,230Ang are best fit by the combination of two stellar sources, a red giant with Teff=4250 (uncertainty 150K), logg=2.0, Radius_RG=27.8Rsun (assuming a single-temperature atmosphere), and a subgiant companion with Teff=6,000K, Radius_comp=2.7Rsun, or Teff=5,270K, Radius_comp=4.2Rsun using models with one-tenth or one-third solar metallicity respectively, logg=3.0, extinction E(B-V)=0.50(uncertainty 0.2), adopting the DR3 Gaia distance D=2,463pc (uncertainty 120pc). No FUV data existed prior to our programs. STIS spectra give an upper limit of 10e-17ergs cm-2 s-1 Ang-1 shortward of 2300Ang; an upper limit of &gt;25.7ABmag was obtained in two UVIT FUV broad-bands. The non-detection of FUV flux rules out a compact companion such as a hot WD. The STIS spectrum shows strong MgII lambda2800Ang emission, typical of chromospherically active red giants. The masses inferred by comparison with evolutionary tracks, about 1 Msun for the red giant and between 1.1 and 1.6Msun for the subgiant companion, suggest past mass transfer, although the red giant currently does not fill its Roche lobe. WFC3 imaging in F218W, F275W, F336W, F475W, and F606W shows an unresolved source in all filters.</description>

      <title>A Unified Phenomenology of Ion Heating in Low-$\beta$ Plasmas: Test-Particle Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that two prominent theories of ion heating in low-$\beta$ collisionless plasmas -- stochastic and quasi-linear heating -- represent similar physical processes in turbulence with different normalized cross helicities. To capture both, we propose a simple phenomenology based on the power in scales at which critically balanced fluctuations reach their smallest parallel scale. Simulations of test ions interacting with turbulence confirm our scalings across a wide range of different ion and turbulence properties, including with a steep ion-kinetic transition range as relevant to the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Implementation of thermal conduction energy transfer models in the Bifrost Solar atmosphere MHD code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Thermal conductivity provides important contributions to the energy evolution of the upper solar atmosphere, behaving as a non-linear concentration-dependent diffusion equation. Recently, different methods have been offered as best-fit solutions to these problems in specific situations, but their effectiveness and limitations are rarely discussed. Aims. We rigorously test the different implementations of solving the conductivity flux, in the massively-parallel magnetohydrodynamics code, Bifrost, with the aim of specifying the best scenarios for the use of each method. Methods: We compare the differences and limitations of explicit versus implicit methods, and analyse the convergence of a hyperbolic approximation. Among the tests, we use a newly derived 1st-order self-similar approximation to compare the efficacy of each method analytically in a 1D pure-thermal test scenario. Results: We find that although the hyperbolic approximation proves the most accurate and the fastest to compute in long-running simulations, there is no optimal method to calculate the mid-term conductivity with both accuracy and efficiency. We also find that the solution of this approximation is sensitive to the initial conditions, and can lead to faster convergence if used correctly. Hyper-diffusivity is particularly useful in aiding the methods to perform optimally. Conclusions: We discuss recommendations for the use of each method within more complex simulations, whilst acknowledging the areas of opportunity for new methods to be developed.</description>

      <title>XUV irradiation of young planetary atmospheres. Results from a joint XMM-Newton and HST observation of HIP67522</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evaporation and the chemistry of the atmospheres of warm and hot planets are strongly determined by the high-energy irradiation they receive from their parent stars. This is more crucial among young extra-solar systems, due to the high activity of stars at early ages. In particular, the EUV part of the stellar spectra drives significant processes of photo-chemical interaction, but it is not directly measurable due to strong interstellar absorption and the lack of sufficiently sensitive instrumentation. An alternative approach is to derive synthetic spectra from the analysis of FUV and X-ray emission lines, that allow to estimate the missed flux in the EUV band. We performed joint and simultaneous spectroscopy of HIP 67522 with XMM-Newton and HST aimed at reconstructing the full high-energy spectrum of this 17 Myr old solar-type (G0) star, which is the youngest known transiting multi-planet system at present time. We performed a time-resolved spectral analysis of the observations, including quiescent emission and flaring variability. Then, we derived the Emission Measure Distribution (EMD) vs. temperature of the chromospheric and coronal plasma from the high-resolution spectra obtained in X-rays with RGS and in FUV with COS. We derived broad-band X-ray and EUV luminosities from the synthetic spectrum based on the EMD, that allowed us to test alternative EUV vs. X-ray scaling laws available in literature. We also employed the total XUV flux received by the inner planet of the system to estimate its instantaneous atmospheric mass loss rate. We confirm that HIP 67522 is a very active star with a hot corona, reaching plasma temperatures above 20 MK even in quiescent state. Its EUV/X-ray flux ratio falls in between the predictions of the two scaling laws we have tested, indicating an important spread in the stellar properties, that requires further investigation.</description>

      <title>Measuring Sub-Kelvin Variations in Stellar Temperature with High-Resolution Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of stellar variability often relies on the measurement of selected activity indicators such as coronal emission lines and non-thermal emissions. On the flip side, the effective stellar temperature is normally seen as one of the key fundamental parameters (with mass and radius) to understanding the basic physical nature of a star and its relation with its environment (e.g., planetary instellation). We present a novel approach for measuring disk-averaged temperature variations to sub-Kelvin accuracy inspired by algorithms developed for precision radial velocity. This framework uses the entire content of the spectrum, not just pre-identified lines, and can be applied to existing data obtained with high-resolution spectrographs. We demonstrate the framework by recovering the known rotation periods and temperature modulation of Barnard star and AU Mic in datasets obtained in the infrared with SPIRou at CHFT and at optical wavelengths on $\epsilon$ Eridani with HARPS at ESO 3.6-m telescope. We use observations of the transiting hot Jupiter HD189733\,b, obtained with SPIRou, to show that this method can unveil the minute temperature variation signature expected during the transit event, an effect analogous to the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect but in temperature space. This method is a powerful new tool for characterizing stellar activity, and in particular temperature and magnetic features at the surfaces of cool stars, affecting both precision radial velocity and transit spectroscopic observations. We demonstrate the method in the context of high-resolution spectroscopy but the method could be used at lower resolution.</description>

      <title>Photospheric signatures of CME onset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are solar eruptions that involve large-scale changes to the magnetic topology of an active region. There exists a range of models for CME onset which are based on twisted or sheared magnetic field above a polarity inversion line (PIL). We present observational evidence that topological changes at PILs, in the photosphere, form a key part of CME onset, as implied by many models. In particular, we study the onset of 30 CMEs and investigate topological changes in the photosphere by calculating the magnetic winding flux, using the \texttt{ARTop} code. By matching the times and locations of winding signatures with CME observations produced by the \texttt{ALMANAC} code, we confirm that these signatures are indeed associated with CMEs. Therefore, as well as presenting evidence that changes in magnetic topology at the photosphere are a common signature of CME onset, our approach also allows for the finding of the source location of a CME within an active region.</description>

      <title>Stellar energetic particle and cosmic ray effects in exoplanetary atmospheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energetic particles, in the form of stellar energetic particles and cosmic rays, can lead to disequilibrium chemical effects in exoplanetary atmospheres. In Earth-like atmospheres, energetic particles can drive the formation of prebiotic molecules, the building blocks of life. Here instead, I study the transport of energetic particles through a hydrogen-dominated exoplanet atmosphere and calculate the resulting ionisation rate of molecular hydrogen using a Monte Carlo energetic particle transport model. I focus on a GJ436 b-like atmosphere at orbital distances between 0.01-0.2 au which includes the orbital distance of the exoplanet GJ436 b (0.028 au). I found that stellar energetic particles lead to high ionisation rates in a GJ436 b-like atmosphere between 0.01-0.2 au. These results motivate the use of chemical models of gas giant atmospheres including energetic particle ionisation to ultimately produce synthetic James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Ariel transmission spectra in the future.</description>

      <title>Simulating stellar coronal rain and slingshot prominences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have numerically demonstrated that simulated cool star coronae naturally form condensations. If the star rotates slowly, with a co-rotation radius greater than the Alfv\'{e}n radius (i.e. $R_{\mathrm{K}} &gt; R_{\mathrm{A}}$), these condensations will form below the co-rotation radius $R_{\mathrm{K}}$ and simply fall back to the stellar surface as coronal rain. If, however, the star is more rapidly rotating, ($R_{\mathrm{K}} &lt; R_{\mathrm{A}}$), not only rain will form but also ``slingshot prominences''. In this case, condensations collect into a large mass reservoir around the co-rotation radius, from which periodic centrifugal ejections occur. In this case, some $51\%$ of the coronal mass is cold gas, either in rain or prominences. We find that 21\% of the mass lost by our simulated fast rotating star is cold gas. Studies of stellar mass-loss from the hot wind do not consider this component of the wind and therefore systematically underestimate mass-loss rates of these stars. Centrifugal ejections happen periodically, between every 7.5 - 17.5 hours with masses clustering around $10^{16}$ g, These results agree well with observational statistics. Contrasting the fast and slow rotating magnetospheres, we find that there are two distinct types of solutions, high lying and low lying loops. Low lying loops only produce coronal rain whereas high lying loops produce both rain and slingshots.</description>

      <title>Waste Heat and Habitability: Constraints from Technological Energy Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Waste heat production represents an inevitable consequence of energy conversion as per the laws of thermodynamics. Based on this fact, by using simple theoretical models, we analyze constraints on the habitability of Earth-like terrestrial planets hosting putative technological species and technospheres characterized by persistent exponential growth of energy consumption and waste heat generation: in particular, we quantify the deleterious effects of rising surface temperature on biospheric processes and the eventual loss of liquid water. Irrespective of whether these sources of energy are ultimately stellar or planetary (e.g., nuclear, fossil fuels) in nature, we demonstrate that the loss of habitable conditions on such terrestrial planets may be expected to occur on timescales of $\lesssim 1000$ years, as measured from the start of the exponential phase, provided that the annual growth rate of energy consumption is of order $1\%$. We conclude by discussing the types of evolutionary trajectories that might be feasible for industrialized technological species, and sketch the ensuing implications for technosignature searches.</description>

      <title>Alpha decay law of excited nuclei and its role in stellar decay rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\alpha$ decay is one of the prominent decay modes in the nucleosynthesis of heavy and super-heavy elements synthesized at temperatures of the order of Giga Kelvin. To facilitate the investigation of the role played by the $\alpha$ decay half-lives of thermally excited nuclei in nucleosynthesis calculations, an empirical formula based on a model for the $\alpha$ decay of nuclei in their ground and excited states to daughter nuclei in their ground or excited states is presented. Constants appearing in the analytical expression for the $\alpha$ decay half-life obtained within the model are treated as adjustable parameters and fitted to experimental data on 342 $\alpha$ decays in the range of 82 $\le Z_p \le$ 94, to obtain an excitation energy-dependent decay law. Under the assumption that thermal equilibrium has been reached between nuclear states, temperature ($T$)-dependent half-lives, $t_{1/2}(T)$, for several of the experimentally studied $\alpha$ emitters with 65 $\le Z_p \le$ 94 are presented using available data on the half-lives of excited nuclei. Though the general trend is a decrease in $t_{1/2}(T)$ at elevated temperatures, exceptional cases with increased half-lives are found in the case of some isomeric states. A list of such isomers provided in this work motivates future work involving considerations of their thermal equilibration and role in shaping kilonova light curves.</description>

      <title>The IXPE View of Neutron Star Low-Mass X-ray Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-mass X-ray binaries hosting weakly magnetized neutron stars (NS-LMXBs) are among the brightest sources in the X-ray sky. Since 2021, the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) has provided new measurements of the X-ray polarization of these sources. IXPE observations have revealed that most NS-LMXBs are significantly polarized in the X-rays, providing unprecedented insight into the geometry of their accretion flow. In this review paper, we summarize the first results obtained by IXPE on NS-LMXBs, the emerging trends within each class of sources (atoll/Z), and possible physical interpretations.</description>

      <title>Twenty-three New Heartbeat Star Systems Discovered Based on TESS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heartbeat stars (HBSs) are ideal astrophysical laboratories to study the formation and evolution of binary stars in eccentric orbits and the internal structural changes of their components under strong tidal action. We discover 23 new HBSs based on TESS photometric data. The orbital parameters, including orbital period, eccentricity, orbital inclination, argument of periastron, and epoch of periastron passage of these HBSs are derived by using a corrected version of Kumar et al.'s model based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The preliminary results show that these HBSs have orbital periods in the range from 2.7 to 20 days and eccentricities in the range from 0.08 to 0.70. The eccentricity-period relation of these objects shows a positive correlation between eccentricity and period, and also shows the existence of orbital circularization. The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram shows that the HBSs are not all located in a particular area. The distribution of the derived parameters suggests a selection bias within the TESS survey towards massive HBSs with shorter orbital periods, higher temperatures and luminosities. These objects are a very useful source to study the structure and evolution of eccentricity orbit binaries and to extend the TESS HBS catalog.</description>

      <title>Searching for Stellar Activity Cycles using Flares: The Short and Long Timescale Activity Variations of TIC-272272592</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine 4 years of Kepler 30-min data, and 5 Sectors of TESS 2-min data for the dM3 star KIC-8507979/TIC-272272592. This rapidly rotating (P=1.2 day) star has previously been identified as flare active, with a possible long-term decline in its flare output. Such slow changes in surface magnetic activity are potential indicators of Solar-like activity cycles, which can yield important information about the structure of the stellar dynamo. We find that while TIC-272272592 shows evidence for both short and long timescale variations in its flare activity, it is unlikely physically motivated. Only a handful of stars have been subjected to such long baseline point-in-time flare studies, and we urge caution in comparing results between telescopes due to differences in bandpass, signal to noise, and cadence. In this work, we develop an approach to measure variations in the flare frequency distributions over time, which is quantified as a function of the observing baseline. For TIC-272272592, we find a $2.7\sigma$ detection of a Sector which has a flare deficit, therefore indicating the short term variation could be a result of sampling statistics. This quantifiable approach to describing flare rate variation is a powerful new method for measuring the months-to-years changes in surface magnetic activity, and provides important constraints on activity cycles and dynamo models for low mass stars.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Accretion-Driven Starquakes in Recycled Millisecond Pulsars using Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recycled millisecond pulsars are susceptible to starquakes as they are continuously accreting matter from their binary companion. A starquake happens when the rotational frequency of the star crosses its breaking frequency. In this study, we perform a model analysis of an accreting neutron star suffering a starquake. We analyze two models: a spherical star with accreting mountains and a deformed star with accreting mountains. We find that as the star crosses the breaking frequency and suffers a starquake there is a sudden change in the continuous gravitational wave signal arriving from them. It is interesting to note that the amplitude of the gravitational wave signals increases suddenly for the spherical star. In contrast, for the deformed star, the amplitude of the continuous gravitational wave signal decreases suddenly. This sudden change in the continuous gravitational wave signal in recycled millisecond pulsars can be a unique signature for such pulsars undergoing a starquake.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from mergers of Population III binary black holes: roles played by two evolution channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) signal from binary black hole (BBH) mergers is a promising probe of Population III (Pop III) stars. To fully unleash the power of the GW probe, one important step is to understand the relative importance and features of different BBH evolution channels. We model two channels, isolated binary stellar evolution (IBSE) and nuclear star cluster-dynamical hardening (NSC-DH), in one theoretical framework based on the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH, under various assumptions on Pop III initial mass function (IMF), initial binary statistics and high-$z$ nuclear star clusters (NSCs). The NSC-DH channel contributes $\sim 8-95\%$ of Pop III BBH mergers across cosmic history, with higher contributions achieved by initially wider binary stars, more top-heavy IMFs, and more abundant high-$z$ NSCs. The dimensionless stochastic GW background (SGWB) produced by Pop III BBH mergers has peak values $\Omega^{\rm peak}_{\rm GW}\sim 10^{-11}-8\times 10^{-11}$ around observer-frame frequencies $\nu\sim 10-100\ \rm Hz$. The Pop III contribution can be a non-negligible ($\sim 2-32\%$) component in the total SGWB at $\nu\lesssim 10\ \rm Hz$. The estimated detection rates of Pop III BBH mergers by the Einstein Telescope are $\sim 6-230\ \rm yr^{-1}$ and $\sim 30-1230\ \rm yr^{-1}$ for the NSC-DH and IBSE channels, respectively. Pop III BBH mergers in NSCs are more massive than those from IBSE, so they dominate the Pop III SGWB below $20$ Hz in most cases. Besides, the detection rate of Pop III BBH mergers involving at least one intermediate-mass BH above $100\ \rm M_\odot$ by the Einstein Telescope is $\sim 0.5-200\ \rm yr^{-1}$ in NSCs but remains below $0.1\ \rm yr^{-1}$ for IBSE.</description>
