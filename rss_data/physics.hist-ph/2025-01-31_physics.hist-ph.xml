      <title>Deriving the Born Rule from a model of the quantum measurement process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06375v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum mechanics postulate called the Born Rule attributes a probabilistic meaning to a wave function. This paper derives the Born Rule from other quantum principles along with a model of the measurement process.
  The nondeterministic nature of quantum measurements is hypothesized to arise from an ignorance of the quantum states of a measuring device's microscopic components. Their interactions with a system to be measured are modeled heuristically with any member of a particular class of stochastic processes, each of which generate the Born Rule. One member of the class appears particularly compatible with properties expected of quantum interactions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Freedom in Parton Language: the Birth of Perturbative QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I review the contributions of Giorgio Parisi to perturbative QCD. Concentrated in a decade, they mark the transition of the theory of strong interactions from a set of loosely connected ideas based on models, to a quantum field theory that is now an integral part of the standard model of fundamental interactions. Parisi's contributions have established at a very early stage ideas, methods and tools that are now standard, and in several cases anticipated results that only became prominent in the XXIst century.</description>
