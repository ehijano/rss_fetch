      <title>Party Ideologies and Political Polarization-Driven Conflicts: A Study of the Global South</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-World War II armed conflicts have often been viewed with higher scrutiny in order to avoid a full-scale global war. This scrutiny has led to the establishment of determinants of war such as poverty, inequalities, literacy, and many more. There is a gap that exists in probing countries in the Global South for political party fragmentation and examining ideology-driven polarization's effect on armed conflicts. This paper fills this gap by asking the question: How does political identity-induced polarization affect conflicts in the Global South region? Polarization indices are created based on socially relevant issues and party stances from the V-Party Dataset. Along with control variables, they are tested against the response variables conflict frequency and conflict severity created from the UCDP (Uppsala Conflict Data Program). Through Chow's test, Regional Structural Breaks are found between regions when accounting for polarization-conflict dynamics. A multilevel mixed effects modelling approach is used to create region-specific models to find what types of polarization affect conflict in different geographies and their adherence to normative current developments. The paper highlights that vulnerable regions of the world are prone to higher polarization-induced violence. Modelling estimates indicate polarization of party credo on Minority Rights, Rejection of Political Violence, Religious Principles, and Political Pluralism are strong proponents of cultivated violence. The Global South's inhibitions and slow progress towards development are caused by hindrances from armed conflicts; this paper's results show self-inflicted political instability and fragmentation's influence on these events, making the case for urgency in addressing and building inter-group homogeneity and tolerance.</description>

      <title>Vector fields as a framework for modelling the mobility of commodities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commodities, including livestock, flow through trade networks globally, with trajectories that can be effectively captured using mobility pattern modelling approaches similar to those used in human mobility studies. However, documenting these movements comprehensively presents significant challenges; it can be unrealistic, costly, and may conflict with data protection regulations. As a result, mobility datasets typically contain uncertainties due to sparsity and limitations in data collection. Origin-destination (OD) representations offer a powerful framework for modelling movement patterns and are widely adopted in mobility studies. However, these matrices possess inherent limitations: locations absent from the OD framework lack spatial information on potential mobility directions and intensities. This spatial incompleteness creates analytical gaps across different geographical scales, constraining our ability to characterise movement patterns in underrepresented areas. In this study, we introduce a vector-field-based method to address these data challenges, transforming OD data into vector fields capturing spatial flow patterns comprehensively enabling us to study mobility directions solidly. We use cattle trade data from Minas Gerais, Brazil, as our case study for commodity flows. This region's large livestock trading network makes it an ideal test case. Cattle movements are significant as they affect disease transmission, including foot-and-mouth disease. Accurately modelling these flows allows better surveillance and control strategies. Our vector-field approach reveals fundamental patterns in commodity mobility and can infer movement information for unrepresented locations. Our approach offers an alternative to traditional network-based models, enhancing our capacity to infer mobility patterns from incomplete datasets and advancing our understanding of large-scale commodity trades.</description>

      <title>Bounded confidence dynamics generates opinion cascades on a growing scale-free network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the pairwise bounded confidence model on scale-free networks where new agents regularly arrive over time. The probability that arriving agents form links to preexisting ones depends on both agent degree and opinion proximity. In parameter value ranges where both factors impact the link choice, a new phenomenon is observed. Minor clusters continuously form on the periphery of the opinion space and remain stable for a time, before suddenly merging with a major cluster in the network. We label these processes as "opinion cascades", and analyse their origin and behavior. They are triggered by the arrival of agents acting as "bridges" between the previously disconnected minor and major clusters. Lastly, we propose theoretical approximations to describe the varying shapes and merging behavior of opinion cascades under different conditions.</description>

      <title>Adversarial control of synchronization in complex oscillator networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates adversarial attacks, a concept from deep learning, designed to control synchronization dynamics through strategically crafted minimal perturbations. We propose a gradient-based optimization method that identifies small phase perturbations to dramatically enhance or suppress collective synchronization in Kuramoto oscillator networks. Our approach formulates synchronization control as an adversarial optimization problem, computing gradients of the order parameter with respect to oscillator phases to determine optimal perturbation directions. Results demonstrate that extremely small phase perturbations applied to network oscillators can achieve significant synchronization control across diverse network architectures. Our analysis reveals that synchronization enhancement is achievable across various network sizes, while synchronization suppression becomes particularly effective in larger networks, with effectiveness scaling favorably with network size. The method is systematically validated on canonical model networks including scale-free and small-world topologies, and real-world networks representing power grids and brain connectivity patterns. This adversarial framework represents a novel paradigm for synchronization management by introducing deep learning concepts to networked dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Cost of institutional incentives for promoting cooperation in $2\times2$ games and collective risk games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prosocial behaviours, which appear to contradict Darwinian principles of individual payoff maximisation, have been extensively studied across multiple disciplines. Cooperation, requiring a personal cost for collective benefits, is widespread in nature and has been explained through mechanisms such as kin selection, direct and indirect reciprocity, and network reciprocity. Institutional incentives, which reward cooperation and punish anti-social behaviour, offer a promising approach to fostering cooperation in groups of self-interested individuals. This study investigates the behaviour of the cost functions associated with these types of interventions, using both analytical and numerical methods. Focusing on reward, punishment, and hybrid schemes, we analyse their associated cost functions under evolutionary dynamics governed by Fermi's rule, exploring their asymptotic behaviour in the limits of neutral drift and strong selection. Our analysis focuses on two game types: General $2\times2$ Games (with particular attention paid to the cooperative and defective Prisoner's Dilemma) and the Collective Risk Game. In addition to deriving key analytical results, we use numerical simulations to study how parameters such as the intensity of selection affect the behaviour of the aforementioned incentive cost functions.</description>

      <title>Evidence of equilibrium dynamics in human social networks evolving in time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11635v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How do networks of relationships evolve over time? We analyse a dataset tracking the social interactions of 900 individuals over four years. Despite continuous shifts in individual relationships, the macroscopic structural properties of the network remain stable, fluctuating within predictable bounds. We connect this stability to the concept of equilibrium in statistical physics. Specifically, we demonstrate that the probabilities governing network dynamics are stationary over time, and key features like degree, edge, and triangle abundances align with theoretical predictions from equilibrium dynamics. Moreover, the dynamics satisfies the detailed balance condition. Remarkably, equilibrium persists despite constant turnover as people join, leave, and change connections. This suggests that equilibrium arises not from specific individuals but from the balancing act of human needs, cognitive limits, and social pressures. Practically, this equilibrium simplifies data collection, supports methods relying on single network snapshots (like Exponential Random Graph Models), and aids in designing interventions for social challenges. Theoretically, it offers new insights into collective human behaviour, revealing how emergent properties of complex social systems can be captured by simple mathematical models.</description>

      <title>On the transmission of texts: written cultures as complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our knowledge of past cultures relies considerably on written material. For centuries, texts have been copied, altered, then transmitted or lost - eventually, from surviving documents, philologists attempt to reconstruct text phylogenies ("stemmata"), and past written cultures. Nonetheless, fundamental questions on the extent of losses, representativeness of surviving artefacts, and the dynamics of text genealogies have remained open since the earliest days of philology. To address these, we radically rethink the study of text transmission through a complexity science approach, integrating stochastic modelling, computer simulations, and data analysis, in a parsimonious mindset akin to statistical physics and evolutionary biology. Thus, we design models that are simple and general, while accounting for diachrony and other key aspects of the dynamical process underlying text phylogenies, such as the extinction of entire branches or trees. On the well-known case study of Medieval French chivalric literature, we find that up to 60% of texts and 99% of manuscripts were lost (consistent with recent synchronic "biodiversity" analyses). We also settle a hundred-year-old controversy on the bifidity of stemmata. Further, our null model suggests that pure chance ("drift") is not the only mechanism at play, and we provide a theoretical and empirical framework for future investigation.</description>

      <title>On the class of coding optimality of human languages and the origins of Zipf's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we present a new class of optimality for coding systems. Members of that class are displaced linearly from optimal coding and thus exhibit Zipf's law, namely a power-law distribution of frequency ranks. Within that class, Zipf's law, the size-rank law and the size-probability law form a group-like structure. We identify human languages that are members of the class. All languages showing sufficient agreement with Zipf's law are potential members of the class. In contrast, there are communication systems in other species that cannot be members of that class for exhibiting an exponential distribution instead but dolphins and humpback whales might. We provide a new insight into plots of frequency versus rank in double logarithmic scale. For any system, a straight line in that scale indicates that the lengths of optimal codes under non-singular coding and under uniquely decodable encoding are displaced by a linear function whose slope is the exponent of Zipf's law. For systems under compression and constrained to be uniquely decodable, such a straight line may indicate that the system is coding close to optimality. Our findings provide support for the hypothesis that Zipf's law originates from compression.</description>
