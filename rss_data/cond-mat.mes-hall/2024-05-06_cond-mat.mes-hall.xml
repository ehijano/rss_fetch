      <title>Ferromagnetic resonance response in square artificial spin ice: roles of geometry in vertex dynamics and magnetic configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial spin ice (ASI) represents a class of uniquely structured superlattices comprising geometrically arranged interacting nanomagnets. This arrangement facilitates the exploration of magnetic frustration phenomena and related spin wave dynamics, contributing to the field of magnonics. In this work, we present a compressive study of spin wave dynamics in square ASI lattices using micromagnetic simulations, explicitly focusing on ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and oscillation modes. We investigate how variations in the aspect ratio of nanomagnets dimensions influence magnetic excitations in both saturated and remanent states. We analyze the frequency variations of FMR peaks corresponding to edges and bulk oscillation modes in relation to both magnetic configuration and nanomagnets dimensions. We emphasize the remanent state of square ASI vertex configurations, particularly focusing on their characteristic energy states (Type I, Type II, Type III, and Type IV), while detailing how symmetries influence oscillation modes. We observe distinct FMR responses originating from vertices, exhibiting unique characteristics for each energy state. Our results offer a potential method of utilizing the FMR technique to identify energy states in ASI systems.</description>

      <title>Fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect in a semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the search of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effects, the conventional wisdom is to start from a flat Chern band isolated from the rest of the Hilbert space by bandgap, so that many-body interaction can be projected to a landscape that mimics a Landau level. Here we report the finding of FQAH in a 2D semimetal. Described by a 2{\pi}-flux dice lattice, the model features a flat band in touching with a dispersive lower band, where the band touching is symmetry-protected from being gapped by electron interaction. At 1/3 and 2/3 filling of the gapless flat band, FQAH phases are found using density matrix renormalisation group calculations taking into accounts all bands. Symmetry breaking to gap the band touching can turn the semimetal into a Chern insulator while keeping the Chern band nearly flat, but counter-intuitively this suppresses the FQAH, as the gap opening introduces strong inhomogeneity to the quantum geometry. We show an optical scheme to realize the 2{\pi}-flux dice lattice for cold atoms. Our finding uncovers a new arena for the exploration of fractional quantum Hall physics in addition to the Landau levels and Chern insulators.</description>

      <title>Strategies for enhancing spin-shuttling fidelities in Si/SiGe quantum wells with random-alloy disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent coupling between distant qubits is needed for any scalable quantum computing scheme. In quantum dot systems, one proposal for long-distance coupling is to coherently transfer electron spins across a chip in a moving potential. Here, we use simulations to study challenges for spin shuttling in Si/SiGe heterostructures caused by the valley degree of freedom. We show that for devices with valley splitting dominated by alloy disorder, one can expect to encounter pockets of low valley splitting, given a long-enough shuttling path. At such locations, inter-valley tunneling leads to dephasing of the spin wavefunction, substantially reducing the shuttling fidelity. We show how to mitigate this problem by modifying the heterostructure composition, or by varying the vertical electric field, the shuttling velocity, the shape and size of the dot, or the shuttling path. We further show that combinations of these strategies can reduce the shuttling infidelity by several orders of magnitude, putting shuttling fidelities sufficient for error correction within reach.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Configurational Spectral Splitting between Trion and Charged Exciton in a Monolayer Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body electron-hole complexes in a semiconductor are important both from a fundamental physics point of view and for practical device applications. A three-body system of electrons (e) and holes (h) (2e1h, or 1e2h) in a two-band semiconductor is commonly believed to be associated with two spectral peaks for the exciton and trion (or charged exciton), respectively. But both the validity of this understanding and the physical meaning of a trion or charged exciton have not been thoroughly examined. From the physics point of view, there are two different configurations, (e)(eh) or (eeh), which could be considered charged exciton and trion, respectively. Here (...) represents an irreducible cluster with respect to Coulomb interactions. In this paper, we consider these issues related to the 2e1h three-body problem theoretically and experimentally using monolayer MoTe2 as an example. Our theoretical tools involve the three-body Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) and the cluster expansion technique, especially their correspondence. Experimentally, we measure the photoluminescence spectrum on a gate-controlled monolayer MoTe2. We found two spectral peaks that are 21 and 4 meV, respectively, below the exciton peak, in contrast to the single "trion" peak from the conventional understanding. We show that, while the three-body BSE in a two-band model can reproduce all spectral features, the cluster-expansion technique shows that the two peaks correspond to the charged exciton (e)(eh) and trion (eeh), respectively. In other words, there is a spectral splitting due to the two different many-body configurations. Furthermore, we find that the trion only exists in the intervalley case, while the charged exciton exists both for the intervalley and intravalley cases.</description>

      <title>Giant effective $g$-factor due to spin bifurcations in polariton condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict giant susceptibility of spin-bifurcating polariton condensates to externally applied permanent magnetic field. In the presence of spin-anisotropic polariton-polariton interactions, the condensate spontaneously takes an elliptically polarised state, {whose perturbation dynamics can be interpreted in terms of the presence of strong effective magnetic field} significantly surpassing the external one. Surprisingly, this behaviour of the addressed strongly out-of-equilibrium system in the vicinity of a critical point exhibits intriguing analogy with the second-order phase transition. The predicted field-enhancement effect can be utilized for creation of topologically nontrivial states of Bogoliubov's excitations existing on top of the polariton condensate.</description>

      <title>All optical control of bubble and skyrmion breathing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the dynamics of topologically protected spin objects by all optical means promises enormous potential for future spintronic applications. Excitation of bubbles and skyrmions in ferrimagnetic [Fe(0.35 nm)/Gd(0.40 nm)]$_{160}$ multilayers by ultrashort laser pulses leads to a periodic modulation of the core diameter of these spin objects, the so-called breathing mode. We demonstrate versatile amplitude and phase control of this breathing using a double excitation scheme, where the observed dynamics is controlled by the excitation delay. We gain insight into both the time scale on which the breathing mode is launched and the role of the spin object size on the dynamics. Our results demonstrate that ultrafast optical excitation allows for precise tuning of the spin dynamics of trivial and non-trivial spin objects, showing a possible control strategy in device applications.</description>

      <title>A proximitized quantum dot in germanium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planar germanium quantum wells have recently been shown to host a hard-gapped superconductor-semiconductor interface. Additionally, quantum dot spin qubits in germanium are well-suited for quantum information processing, with isotopic purification to a nuclear spin-free material expected to yield long coherence times. Therefore, as one of the few group IV materials with the potential to host superconductor-semiconductor hybrid devices, proximitized quantum dots in germanium are a crucial ingredient towards topological superconductivity and novel qubit modalities. Here we demonstrate a quantum dot (QD) in a Ge/SiGe heterostructure proximitized by a platinum germanosilicide (PtGeSi) superconducting lead (SC), forming a SC-QD-SC junction. We show tunability of the QD-SC coupling strength, as well as gate control of the ratio of charging energy and the induced gap. We further exploit this tunability by exhibiting control of the ground state of the system between even and odd parity. Furthermore, we characterize the critical magnetic field strengths, finding a robust critical out-of-plane field of 0.91(5) T. Finally we explore sub-gap spin splitting in the device, observing rich physics in the resulting spectra, that we model using a zero-bandwidth model in the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov limit. The demonstration of controllable proximitization at the nanoscale of a germanium quantum dot opens up the physics of novel spin and superconducting qubits, and Josephson junction arrays in a group IV material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin waves, the fundamental excitations in magnetic materials, are promising candidates for realizing low-dissipation information processing in spintronics. The ability to visualize and manipulate coherent spin-wave transport is crucial for the development of spin wave-based devices. We use a recently discovered method utilizing nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers, point defects in the diamond lattice, to measure spin waves in thin film magnetic insulators by detecting their magnetic stray field. We experimentally demonstrate enhanced contrast in the detected wavefront amplitudes by imaging spin waves underneath a reference stripline and phenomenologically model the results. By extracting the spin wave dispersion and comparing NV center based spin wave measurements to spin wave imaging conducted through the well-established time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect, we discuss the advantages and limitations of employing NV centers as spin wave sensors.</description>

      <title>Effect of Helium Ion Implantation on 3C-SiC Nanomechanical String Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum devices enable novel functionalities by combining the benefits of different subsystems. Particularly, point defects in nanomechanical resonators made of diamond or silicon carbide (SiC) have been proposed for precise magnetic field sensing and as versatile quantum transducers. However, the realization of a hybrid system may involve tradeoffs in the performance of the constituent subsystems. In a spin-mechanical system, the mechanical properties of the resonator may suffer from the presence of engineered defects in the crystal lattice. This may severely restrict the performance of the resulting device and needs to be carefully explored. Here, we focus on the impact of defects on high Q nanomechanical string resonators made of pre-stressed 3C-SiC grown on Si(111). We use helium ion implantation to create point defects and study their accumulated effect on the mechanical performance. Using Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, we present a method to determine Young's modulus and the pre-stress of the strings. We find that Young's modulus is not modified by implantation. Under implantation doses relevant for single defect or defect ensemble generation, both tensile stress and damping rate also remain unaltered. For higher implantation dose, both exhibit a characteristic change.</description>

      <title>Probing fragile topology with a screw dislocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fragile topology, akin to twisted bilayer graphene and the exotic phases therein, is a notable topological class with intriguing properties. However, due to its unique nature and the lack of bulk-edge correspondence, the experimental signature of fragile topology has been under debated since its birth. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that fragile topological phases with filling anomaly can be probed via screw dislocations, despite that they do not support gapless edge states. Using a designer hexagonal phononic crystal with a fragile topological band gap, we find that 1D gapless bound modes can emerge at a screw dislocation due to the bulk fragile topology. We then establish a connection between our system and the twisted boundary condition via the gauge invariance principle and illustrate that such an emergent phenomenon is an intrinsic property of fragile topological phases with filling anomaly. We observe experimentally the 1D topological bound states using the pump-probe measurements of their dispersion and wavefunctions, which unveils a novel bulk-defect correspondence of fragile topology and a powerful tool for probing fragile topological phases and materials.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-enforced metal-insulator transition and topological adiabatic charge pump in sliding bilayers of threefold symmetric materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sliding bilayers are systems that exploit the possibility of relatively translating two monolayers along a specific direction in real space, such that different stackings could be implemented in the process. This simple approach allows for manipulating the electronic properties of layered materials similarly as in twisted multilayers. In this work, the sliding of bilayers, composed of one type of monolayer with spatial symmetry described by space group P$\bar{3}1m$ is studied. Using a minimal tight-binding model along with symmetry analysis, we propose two effects that arise in a specific sliding direction. First, the sliding-induced control of the band gap magnitude, which produces a metal-insulator transition, is demonstrated. In addition, the potential to achieve a topological adiabatic charge pump for cyclic sliding is discussed. For each effect, we also present material implementations using first-principles calculations. Bilayer GaS is selected for the metal-insulator transition and bilayer transition metal dichalcogenide ZrS$_2$ is found to display the topological pump effect. Both realizations show good agreement with the predictions of the model.</description>

      <title>Interaction-controlled transport in a two-dimensional massless-massive Dirac system: Transition from degenerate to nondegenerate regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resistivity of two-dimensional (2D) metals generally exhibits insensitivity to electron-electron scattering. However, it's worth noting that Galilean invariance may not hold true in systems characterized by a spectrum containing multiple electronic branches or in scenarios involving electron-hole plasma. In the context of our study, we focus on 2D electrons confined within a triple quantum well (TQW) based on HgTe. This system displays a coexistence of energy bands featuring both linear and parabolic-like spectra at low energy and, therefore, lacks the Galilean invariance. This research employs a combined theoretical and experimental approach to investigate the transport properties of this two-component system across various regimes. By manipulating carrier density and temperature, we tune our system from a fully degenerate regime, where resistance follows a temperature-dependent behavior proportional to $T^2$, to a regime where both types of electrons adhere to Boltzmann statistics. In the non-degenerate regime, electron interactions lead to resistance that is weakly dependent on temperature. Notably, our experimental observations closely align with the theoretical predictions derived in this study. This work establishes the HgTe-based TQW as a promising platform for exploring different interaction dominant scenarios for the massless-massive Dirac system.9 pages, 8 figures</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic hopfions are localized magnetic solitons with a nonzero 3D topological charge (Hopf index). Herein, an analytical calculation of the magnetic hopfion gyrovector is presented and it is shown that it does not vanish even in an infinite sample. The calculation method is based on the concept of the emergent magnetic field. The particular case of the simplest nontrivial toroidal hopfion with the Hopf index $\|Q_H\|=1$ in the cylindrical magnetic dot is considered and dependencies of the gyrovector components on the dot sizes are calculated. Nonzero hopfion gyrovector is important in any description of the hopfion dynamics within the collective coordinate Thieles approach.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Freezing in Exactly Solvable Models of Driven Chaotic Quantum Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The late-time equilibrium behavior of generic interacting models is determined by the coupled hydrodynamic equations associated with the globally conserved quantities. In the presence of an external time-dependent drive, non-integrable systems typically thermalize to an effectively infinite-temperature state, losing all memory of their initial states. However, in the presence of a large time-periodic Floquet drive, there exist special points in phase-space where the strongly interacting system develops approximate {\it emergent} conservation laws. Here we present results for an exactly solvable model of two coupled chaotic quantum dots with multiple orbitals interacting via random two and four-fermion interactions in the presence of a Floquet drive. We analyze the phenomenology of dynamically generated freezing using a combination of exact diagonalization, and field-theoretic analysis in the limit of a large number of electronic orbitals. The model displays universal freezing behavior irrespective of whether the theory is averaged over the disorder configurations or not. We present explicit computations for the growth of many-body chaos and entanglement entropy, which demonstrates the long-lived coherence associated with the interacting degrees of freedom even at late-times at the dynamically frozen points. We also compute the slow timescale that controls relaxation away from exact freezing in a high-frequency expansion.</description>

Abstract: The critical point of a topological phase transition is described by a conformal field theory (CFT), where the finite-size corrections to the ground state energy are uniquely related to its central charge. We study the finite-size scaling of the energy of non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with parity and time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. We find that under open boundary condition (OBC), the energy scaling $E(L)\sim c/L$ reveals a negative central charge $c=-2$ at the non-Hermitian critical point, indicative of a non-unitary CFT. Furthermore, we discover a universal scaling function capturing the flow of a system from Dirac CFT with $c=1$ to a non-unitary CFT with $c=-2$. The scaling function demonstrates distinct behaviors at topologically non-trivial and trivial sides of critical points. Notably, within the realm of topological criticality, the scaling function exhibits an universal rise-dip-rise pattern, manifesting a characteristic singularity inherent in the non-Hermitian topological critical points. The analytic expression of the scaling function has been derived and is in good agreement with the numerical results.</description>

      <title>Quantifying spectral signatures of non-Markovianity beyond Born-Redfield master equation</title>

Abstract: Memory or time-non-local effects in open quantum dynamics pose theoretical as well as practical challenges in the understanding and control of noisy quantum systems. While there has been a comprehensive and concerted effort towards developing diagnostics for non-Markovian dynamics, all existing measures rely on time-domain measurements which are typically slow and expensive as they require averaging several runs to resolve small transient features on a broad background, and scale unfavorably with system size and complexity. In this work, we propose a spectroscopic measure of non-Markovianity which can detect persistent non-Markovianity in the system steady state. In addition to being experimentally viable, the proposed measure has a direct information theoretic interpretation: a large value indicates the information loss per unit bandwidth of making the Markov approximation. In the same vein, we derive a frequency-domain quantum master equation (FD-QME) that goes beyond the standard Born-Redfield description and retains the full memory of the state of the reduced system. Using the FD-QME and the proposed measure, we are able to reliably diagnose and quantify non-Markovianity in several system-environment settings including those with environmental correlations and retardation effects.</description>

      <title>Theory of nonlinear terahertz susceptibility in ferroelectrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An analytical theory is developed for predicting the nonlinear susceptibility of ionic polarization to continuous electromagnetic waves in both bulk and strained thin film ferroelectrics. Using a perturbation method for solving the nonlinear equation of motion for ionic polarization within the framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory, the full second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor is derived as a function of frequency, temperature, and strain. The theory predicts the coexistence of a significantly enhanced second-order dielectric susceptibility and a relatively low dielectric loss in BaTiO3 films with a strain-stabilized monoclinic ferroelectric phase and in a strained SrTiO3 film near its temperature-driven second-order ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition. This work establishes a theoretical framework for predicting and exploiting nonlinear interactions between THz waves and ferroelectric materials, and more generally, suggests exciting opportunities to strain-engineer nonlinear dynamical properties of ferroelectrics beyond the static and quasi-static limits.</description>

      <title>Imaging thermally fluctuating N\`eel vectors in van der Waals antiferromagnet NiPS3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying antiferromagnetic domains is essential for fundamental physics and potential spintronics applications. Despite its importance, few systematic studies have been performed on van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnets (AFMs) domains with high spatial resolutions, and direct probing of the N\`eel vectors remains challenging. In this work, we found a multidomain in vdW AFM NiPS3, a material extensively investigated for its exotic magnetic exciton. We employed photoemission electron microscopy combined with the X-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD-PEEM) to image the NiPS3's magnetic structure. The nanometer-spatial resolution of XMLD-PEEM allows us to determine local N\`eel vector orientations and discover thermally fluctuating N\'eel vectors that are independent of the crystal symmetry even at 65 K, well below TN of 155 K. We demonstrate a Ni ions' small in-plane orbital moment anisotropy is responsible for the weak magneto-crystalline anisotropy. The observed multidomain's thermal fluctuations may explain the broadening of magnetic exciton peaks at higher temperatures.</description>

      <title>Multiple Topological Phase Transitions Unveiling Gapless Topological Superconductivity in Magnet/Unconventional Superconductor Hybrid Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework for generating gapless topological superconductivity (GTSC) hosting Majorana flat edge modes (MFEMs) in the presence of a two-dimensional (2D) array of magnetic adatoms with noncollinear spin texture deposited on top of a unconventional superconductor. Our observations reveal two distinct topological phase transitions within the emergent Shiba band depending on the exchange coupling strength ($J$) between magnetic adatom spins and superconducting electrons: the first one designates transition from gapless non-topological to gapless topological phase at lower $J$, while the second one denotes transition from gapless topological to a trivial gapped superconducting phase at higher $J$. The gapless topological superconducting phase survives at intermediate values of $J$, hosting MFEMs. Further, we investigate the nature of the bulk effective pairings which indicate that GTSC appears due to the interplay between pseudo "$s$-wave" and pseudo "$p_{x}+p_y$" types of pairing. Consequently, our study opens a promising avenue for the experimental realization of GTSC in 2D Shiba lattice based on $d$-wave superconductors as a high-temperature platform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate that the hallmarks of correlation and fermionization in a one-dimensional exciton-polaritons gas can be observed with state-of-the-art technology. Our system consists of a chain of excitonic quantum dots coupled to a photonic waveguide, with a low filling of polaritons. We analytically identify the Tonks-Girardeau, Tavis-Cummings and mean-field limits and relate them to different regimes of the excitonic anharmonicity and photonic bandwidth. Using matrix-product states, we numerically calculate the ground-state energies, correlation functions and dynamic structure factor of the system. In particular, the latter has a finite weight in the Lieb-Liniger hole branch, and the density-density correlator displays Friedel-like oscillations for realistic parameters, which reveal the onset of fermionization close to the Tonks-Girardeau regime. Our work encourages future experiments aimed at observing, for the first time and in spite of the moderate excitonic anharmonicity, strongly correlated exciton-polariton physics.</description>

      <title>Field-Effect Josephson Diode via Asymmetric Spin-Momentum-Locking States</title>

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Josephson diodes dangle the possibility of extending conventional non-reciprocal electronics into the realm of superconductivity. While a strong magnetic field is recognized for enhancing diode efficiency, it concurrently poses a risk of undermining the essential superconductivity required for non-dissipative devices. To circumvent the need for magnetic-based tuning, we propose a field-effect Josephson diode based on the electrostatic gate control of finite momentum Cooper pairs in asymmetric spin-momentum-locking states. We propose two possible implementations of our gate-controlled mechanism: (i) a topological field-effect Josephson diode in time-reversal-broken quantum spin Hall insulators; and (ii) semiconductor-based field-effect Josephson diodes attainable in current experimental setups involving a Zeeman field and spin-orbit coupling. Notably, the diode efficiency is highly enhanced in the topological field-effect Josephson diode because the current carried by the asymmetric helical edge states is topologically protected and can be tuned by local gates. In the proposed Josephson diode, the combination of gates and asymmetric spin-momentum-locking nature is equivalent to that of a magnetic field, thus providing an alternative electrical operation in designing nonreciprocal superconducting devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01726v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional (2D) droplets of noninteracting electrons in a strong magnetic field, placed in a confining potential with arbitrary shape. Using semiclassical methods adapted to the lowest Landau level, we obtain near-Gaussian energy eigenstates that are localized on level curves of the potential and have a position-dependent height. This one-particle insight allows us to deduce explicit formulas for expectation values of local many-body observables, such as density and current, in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, correlations along the edge are long-ranged and inhomogeneous. As we show, this is consistent with the system's universal low-energy description as a free 1D chiral conformal field theory of edge modes, known from earlier works in simple geometries. A delicate interplay between radial and angular dependencies of eigenfunctions ultimately ensures that the theory is homogeneous in terms of the canonical angle variable of the potential, despite its apparent inhomogeneity in terms of more na\"ive angular coordinates. Finally, we propose a scheme to measure the anisotropy by subjecting the droplet to microwave radiation; we compute the corresponding absorption rate and show that it depends on the droplet's shape and the waves' polarization. These results, both local and global, are likely to be observable in solid-state systems or quantum simulators of 2D electron gases with a high degree of control on the confining potential.</description>

Abstract: A novel mixed quantum-classical approach to simulating nonadiabatic dynamics of molecules at metal surfaces is presented. The method combines the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion approach for the quantum electronic degrees of freedom with Langevin dynamics for the classical degrees of freedom, namely, low-frequency vibrational modes within the molecule. The approach extends previous mixed quantum-classical methods based on Langevin equations to models containing strong electron-electron or quantum electronic-vibrational interactions, while maintaining a nonperturbative and non-Markovian treatment of the molecule-metal coupling. To demonstrate the approach, nonequilibrium transport observables are calculated for a molecular nanojunction containing strong interactions.</description>

      <title>Nuclear spin relaxation mediated by donor-bound and free electrons in wide CdTe quantum wells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nuclear spin systems in CdTe/(Cd,Zn)Te and CdTe/(Cd,Mg)Te quantum wells (QW) are studied using a multistage technique combining optical pumping and Hanle effect-based detection. The samples demonstrate drastically different nuclear spin dynamics in zero and weak magnetic fields. In CdTe/(Cd,Zn)Te, the nuclear spin relaxation time is found to strongly increase with the magnetic field, growing from 3 s in zero field to tens of seconds in a field of 25 G. In CdTe/(Cd,Mg)Te the relaxation is an order of magnitude slower, and it is field-independent up to at least 70 G. The differences are attributed to the nuclear spin relaxation being mediated by different kinds of resident electrons in these QWs. In CdTe/(Cd,Mg)Te, a residual electron gas trapped in the QW largely determines the relaxation dynamics. In CdTe/(Cd,Zn)Te, the fast relaxation in zero field is due to interaction with localized donor-bound electrons. Nuclear spin diffusion barriers form around neutral donors when the external magnetic field exceeds the local nuclear field, which is about $B_L\approx$0.4 G in CdTe. This inhibits nuclear spin diffusion towards the donors, slowing down relaxation. These findings are supported by theoretical modeling. In particular, we show that the formation of the diffusion barrier is made possible by several features specific to CdTe: (i) the large donor binding energy (about 10 meV), (ii) the low abundance of magnetic isotopes (only $\approx$30 % of nuclei have nonzero spin), and (iii) the absence of nuclear quadrupole interactions between nuclei. The two latter properties are also favorable to nuclear spin cooling via optical pumping followed by adiabatic demagnetization. Under non-optimized conditions we have reached sub-microkelvin nuclear spin temperatures in both samples, lower than all previous results obtained in GaAs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by experimental reports on chirality induced spin selectivity, we investigate a minimal model that allows us to calculate the charge and spin conductances through helical molecules analytically. The spin-orbit interaction is assumed to be non-vanishing on the molecule and negligible in the reservoirs (leads). The band-structure of the molecule features four helical modes with spin-momentum locking that are analogous of edge-currents in the quantum spin Hall effect. While charge is conserved and therefore the charge current is independent of where it is measured, - reservoirs or molecule, - our detailed calculations reveal that the spin currents in the left and right lead are equal in magnitudes but with opposite signs (in linear response).
  We predict that transport currents flowing through helical molecules are accompanied by a spin accumulation in the contact region with the same magnetization direction for source and drain. Further, we predict that the spin-conductance can be extracted directly from measuring the (quasi-static) spin accumulation - rather than the spin current itself, which is very challenging to obtain experimentally.</description>

Abstract: Spin and charge are the two most important degrees of freedom of electrons. Their interplay lies at the heart of numerous strongly correlated phenomena including Hubbard model physics and high temperature superconductivity. Such interplay for bosons, on the other hand, is largely unexplored in condensed matter systems. Here we demonstrate a unique realization of the spin-1/2 Bose-Hubbard model through excitons in a semiconducting moir\'e superlattice. We find evidence of a transient in-plane ferromagnetic (FM-$xy$) order of exciton spin - here valley pseudospin - around exciton filling $\nu_{ex}$ = 1, which transitions into a FM-$z$ order both with increasing exciton filling and a small magnetic field of 10 mT. The phase diagram is different from the fermion case and is qualitatively captured by a simple phenomenological model, highlighting the unique consequence of Bose-Einstein statistics. Our study paves the way for engineering exotic phases of matter from spinor bosons, as well as for unconventional devices in optics and quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Topological Corner Modes by Composite Wannier States in Glide-Symmetric Photonic Crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Second-order topological insulators can be characterized by their bulk polarization, which is believed to be intrinsically connected to the center of the Wannier function. In this study, we demonstrate the existence of second-order topological insulators that feature a pair of partially degenerate photonic bands. These arise from the nonsymmorphic glide symmetry in an all-dielectric photonic crystal. The center of the maximally localized Wannier function (MLWF) is consistently located at the origin but is not equivalent with respect to the sum of constituent polarizations. As a result, topological corner modes can be identified by the distinctly hybridized MLWFs that truncate at the sample boundary. Through full-wave numerical simulations paired with microwave experiments, the second-order topology is clearly confirmed and characterized. These topological corner states exhibit notably unique modal symmetries, which are made possible by the inversion of the Wannier bands. Our results provide an alternative approach to explore higher-order topological physics with significant potential for applications in integrated and quantum photonics.</description>

Abstract: Building a fault-tolerant quantum computer will require vast numbers of physical qubits. For qubit technologies based on solid state electronic devices, integrating millions of qubits in a single processor will require device fabrication to reach a scale comparable to that of the modern CMOS industry. Equally importantly, the scale of cryogenic device testing must keep pace to enable efficient device screening and to improve statistical metrics like qubit yield and voltage variation. Spin qubits based on electrons in Si have shown impressive control fidelities but have historically been challenged by yield and process variation. Here we present a testing process using a cryogenic 300 mm wafer prober to collect high-volume data on the performance of hundreds of industry-manufactured spin qubit devices at 1.6 K. This testing method provides fast feedback to enable optimization of the CMOS-compatible fabrication process, leading to high yield and low process variation. Using this system, we automate measurements of the operating point of spin qubits and probe the transitions of single electrons across full wafers. We analyze the random variation in single-electron operating voltages and find that the optimized fabrication process leads to low levels of disorder at the 300 mm scale. Together these results demonstrate the advances that can be achieved through the application of CMOS industry techniques to the fabrication and measurement of spin qubit devices.</description>
