      <title>Cryogenic Characterization of Low-Frequency Noise in 40-nm CMOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an extensive characterization of the low-frequency noise (LFN) at room temperature (RT) and cryogenic temperature (4.2 K) of 40-nm bulk-CMOS transistors. The noise is measured over a wide range of bias conditions and geometries to generate a comprehensive overview of LFN in this technology. While the RT results are in-line with the literature and the foundry models, the cryogenic behavior diverges in many aspects. These deviations include changes with respect to RT in magnitude and bias dependence that are conditional on transistor type and geometry, and even an additional systematic Lorentzian feature that is common among individual devices. Furthermore, we find the scaling of the average LFN with the area and its variability to be similar between RT and 4.2 K, with the cryogenic scaling reported systematically for the first time. The findings suggest that, as no consistent decrease of LFN at lower temperatures is observed while the white noise is reduced, the impact of LFN for precision analog design at cryogenic temperatures gains a more predominant role.</description>

      <title>Design of a Rectangular Linear Microstrip Patch Antenna Array for 5G Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and characterization of a rectangular microstrip patch antenna array optimized for operation within the Ku-band frequency range. The antenna array is impedance-matched to 50 Ohms and utilizes a microstrip line feeding mechanism for excitation. The design maintains compact dimensions, with the overall antenna occupying an area of 29.5x7 mm. The antenna structure is modelled on an R03003 substrate material, featuring a dielectric constant of 3, a low-loss tangent of 0.0009, and a thickness of 1.574 mm. The substrate is backed by a conducting ground plane, and the array consists of six radiating patch elements positioned on top. Evaluation of the designed antenna array reveals a resonant frequency of 18GHz, with a -10 dB impedance bandwidth extending over 700MHz. The antenna demonstrates a high gain of 7.51dBi, making it well-suited for applications in 5G and future communication systems. Its compact form factor, cost-effectiveness, and broad impedance and radiation coverage further underscore its potential in these domains.</description>

      <title>Self-dispersion-managed adiabatic frequency conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dispersion management of few-cycle pulses is crucial for ultrafast optics and photonics. Often, nontrivial dispersion is compensated using complex optical systems or minimized through careful design of waveguides. Here, we present dispersion-managed adiabatic frequency conversion enabling efficient downconversion of an 11.1-fs near-IR pulse to an 11.6-fs mid-IR pulse spanning an octave of bandwidth from 2-4 $\mu$m. The adiabatic frequency converter is designed to impart a constant group delay over the entire bandwidth, eliminating the need for complex dispersion management and opening a new avenue for dispersion engineering in ultrafast optics and photonics. Notably, dispersion engineering through the position-dependent conversion position of an adiabatic conversion device constitutes an additional mechanism for dispersion control in ultrafast optics and photonics while maintaining high conversion efficiency for broadband pulses.</description>

      <title>Capturing dynamics and thermodynamics of a three-level quantum heat engine via programmable quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research employs the Kraus representation and Sz.-Nagy dilation theorem to model a three-level quantum heat on quantum circuits, investigating its dynamic evolution and thermodynamic performance. The feasibility of the dynamic model is validated by tracking the changes of population. On the basis of reinforcement learning algorithm, the optimal cycle of the quantum heat engine for maximal average power is proposed and verified by the thermodynamic model. The stability of quantum circuit simulations is scrutinized through a comparative analysis of theoretical and simulated results, predicated on an orthogonal test. These results affirm the practicality of simulating quantum heat engines on quantum circuits, offering potential for substantially curtailing the experimental expenses associated with the construction of such engines.</description>

      <title>Structural, electronic, and optical properties of 6H-SiC layers synthesized by implantation of carbon ions into silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systematic studies of the gradual fabrication by means of carbon ion-implantation of high-quality 6H-SiC layers on silicon surfaces have been carried out. The fluence of carbon ions varied from 5*10^15 cm-2 to 10^17 cm-2. Results of first-principle calculations, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy demonstrate the amorphization of silicon substrate without any tendency to the segregation of carbon in the samples synthesized at low fluencies. The formation of a SiO2-like structure at this stage was also detected. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), XRD, and Raman spectroscopy demonstrate that an increase in carbon content at 10^17 cm-2 fluence leads to the growth of 6H-SiC films on the surface of the amorphous silicon substrate. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) data obtained also demonstrates the decreasing of surface roughens after the formation of SiC film. XPS and Raman spectra suggest that excessive carbon content leaves the SiC matrix via the formation of an insignificant amount of partially oxidized carbon nanostructures. Optical measurements also support the claim of high-quality 6H-SiC film formation in the samples synthesized at 10^17 cm-2 fluence and demonstrate the absence of any detectable contribution of nanostructures formed from excessive carbon on the optical properties of the material under study.</description>

      <title>Observation and manipulation of charge carrier distribution at the SiO$_2$/Si interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using low-energy muons, we map the charge carrier concentration as a function of depth and electric field across the \SiOSi interface up to a depth of \SI{100}{\nano\meter} in Si-based MOS capacitors. The results show that the formation of the anisotropic bond-centered muonium \MuBCz state in Si serves as a direct measure of the local changes in electronic structures. Different band-bending conditions could be distinguished, and the extension of the depletion width was directly extracted using the localized stopping and probing depth of the muons. Furthermore, electron build-up on the Si side of the \SiOO/Si interface, caused by the mirror charge induced by the fixed positive charge in the oxide and the image force effect, was observed. Our work represents a significant extension of the application of the muon spin rotation technique ($\mu$SR) and lays the foundation for further research on direct observation of charge carrier density manipulation at technologically important semiconductor device interfaces.</description>

      <title>Error-Free and Current-Driven Synthetic Antiferromagnetic Domain Wall Memory Enabled by Channel Meandering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new type of multi-bit and energy-efficient magnetic memory based on current-driven, field-free, and highly controlled domain wall motion. A meandering domain wall channel with precisely interspersed pinning regions provides the multi-bit capability of a magnetic tunnel junction. The magnetic free layer of the memory device has perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, so that spin-orbit torques induce efficient domain wall motion. Using micromagnetic simulations, we find two pinning mechanisms that lead to different cell designs: two-way switching and four-way switching. The memory cell design choices and the physics behind these pinning mechanisms are discussed in detail. Furthermore, we show that switching reliability and speed may be significantly improved by replacing the ferromagnetic free layer with a synthetic antiferromagnetic layer. Switching behavior and material choices will be discussed for the two implementations.</description>

      <title>Full Silicon Pillar-based 1D Optomechanical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanomechanical resonators can serve as ultrasensitive, miniaturized force probes. While vertical structures like nanopillars are ideal for this purpose, transducing their motion is challenging. Pillar-based photonic crystals (PhCs) offer a potential solution by integrating optical transduction within the pillars. However, achieving high-quality PhCs is hindered by inefficient vertical light confinement. Here, we present a full-silicon 1D photonic crystal cavity based on nanopillars as a new platform with great potential for applications in force sensing and biosensing areas. Its unit cell consists of a silicon pillar with larger diameter at its top portion than at the bottom, which allows vertical light confinement and an energy bandgap in the near infrared range for transverse-magnetic (TM) polarization. We experimentally demonstrate optical cavities with Q-factors exceeding 1e3 constructed by inserting a defect within a periodic arrangement of this type of pillars. Given the fact that that each nanopillar naturally behaves as a nanomechanical cantilever, the fabricated geometries are excellent optomechanical (OM) photonic crystal cavities in which the mechanical motion of each nanopillar composing the cavity can be optically transduced. These novel geometries display enhanced mechanical properties, cost-effectiveness, integration possibilities, and scalability, and opens and new path in front of the widely used suspended Si beam OM cavities made on silicon-on-insulator.</description>

      <title>Heat Transfer Coefficients of Moving Particle Beds from Flow-Dependent Particle Bed Thermal Conductivity and Near-Wall Resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determination of heat transfer coefficients for flowing packed particle beds is essential to the design of particle heat exchangers, and other thermal processes. While such dense granular flows fall into the well-known plug-flow regime, the discrete nature of granular materials alters the thermal transport processes in both the near-wall and bulk regions of flowing particle beds from their stationary counterparts. As a result, heat transfer correlations based on the stationary particle bed thermal conductivity could be inadequate for flowing particles in a heat exchanger. Earlier works have achieved reasonable agreement with experiments by treating granular media as a plug-flow continuum with a near-wall thermal resistance in series. However, the properties of the continuum were often obtained from measurements on stationary beds owing to the difficulty of flowing bed measurements. In this work, it was found that the properties of a stationary bed are highly sensitive to the method of particle packing and there is a decrease in the particle bed thermal conductivity and increase in the near-wall thermal resistance, measured as an effective air gap thickness, on the onset of particle flow. These variations in the thermophysical properties of stationary and flowing particle beds can lead to errors in heat transfer coefficient calculations. Therefore, the heat transfer coefficients for granular flows were calculated using experimentally determined flowing particle bed thermal conductivity and near-wall air gap for ceramic particles -CARBOCP40/100(275 um), HSP40/70(404um) and HSP16/30(956um); at velocities of 5-15mms-1; and temperatures of 300-650C. The thermal conductivity and air gap values for CP40/100 and HSP40/70 were further used to calculate heat transfer coefficients across different particle bed temperatures and velocities for different parallel-plate heat exchanger dimensions.</description>

      <title>Optimized Signal Estimation in Nanomechanical Photothermal Sensing via Thermal Response Modelling and Kalman Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an advanced thermal response model for micro- and nanomechanical systems in photothermal sensing, designed to balance speed and precision. Our model considers the two time constants of the nanomechanical element and the supporting chip, triggered by photothermal heating, enabling precise photothermal input signal estimation through Kalman filtering. By integrating heat transfer and noise models, we apply an adaptive Kalman filter optimized for FPGA systems in real-time or offline. This method, used for photothermal infrared (IR) spectroscopy with nanomechanical resonators and a quantum cascade laser (QCL) in step-scan mode, enhances response speed beyond standard low-pass filters, reducing the effects of drift and random walk. Analytical calculations show the significant impact of the thermal expansion coefficients' ratio on the frequency response. The adaptive Kalman filter, informed by the QCL's input characteristics, accelerates the system's response, allowing rapid and precise IR spectrum generation. The use of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and PSD analysis for system identification further refines our approach, promising fast and accurate nanomechanical photothermal sensing.</description>

      <title>Micromechanical Origin of Heat Transfer to Granular Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heat transfer to a granular flow is comprised of two resistances in series: near the wall and within the bulk particle bed, neither of which is well understood due to the lack of experimental probes to separate their respective contribution. Here, we use a frequency modulated photothermal technique to separately quantify the thermal resistances in the near-wall and the bulk bed regions of particles in flowing states. Compared to the stationary state, the flowing leads to a higher near-wall resistance and a lower thermal conductivity of bulk beds. Coupled with discrete element method simulation, we show that the near-wall resistance can be explained by particle diffusion in granular flows.</description>

      <title>A silicon photonics waveguide-coupled colloidal quantum dot photodiode sensitive beyond 1.6 um</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Silicon photonics faces a persistent challenge in extending photodetection capabilities beyond the 1.6 um wavelength range, primarily due to the lack of appropriate epitaxial materials. Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) present a promising solution here, offering distinct advantages such as infrared wavelength tunability, cost-effectiveness, and facile deposition. Their unique properties position them as a potential candidate for enabling photodetection in silicon photonics beyond the conventional telecom wavelength, thereby expanding the potential applications and capabilities within this domain. In this study, we have successfully integrated lead sulfide (PbS) colloidal quantum dot photodiodes (QDPDs) onto silicon waveguides using standard process techniques. The integrated photodiodes exhibit a remarkable responsivity of 1.3 A/W (with an external quantum efficiency of 74.8%) at a wavelength of 2.1 um, a low dark current of only 106 nA and a bandwidth of 1.1 MHz under a -3 V bias. To demonstrate the scalability of our integration approach, we have developed a compact 8-channel spectrometer incorporating an array of QDPDs. This achievement marks a significant step toward realizing a cost-effective photodetector solution for silicon photonics, particularly tailored for a wide range of sensing applications around the 2 um wavelength range.</description>
