      <title>Externally definable fsg groups in NIP theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every fsg group externally definable in an NIP structure is definably isomorphic to a group interpretable in it. Our proof relies on honest definitions and a group chunk result reconstructing a hyper-definable group from its multiplication given generically with respect to a translation invariant definable Keisler measure on it. We obtain related results on externally (type-)definable sets and groups, including a proof of a conjecture of Eleftheriou on fsg groups in real closed valued fields, and a description of externally definable, definably amenable subgroups of definable groups.</description>

      <title>A Galois correspondence for automorphism groups of structures with the Lascar Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing the $\omega$-categorical context, we introduce a notion, which we call the Lascar Property, that allows for a fine analysis of the topological isomorphisms between automorphism groups of countable structures satisfying this property. In particular, under the assumption of the Lascar Property, we exhibit a definable Galois correspondence between pointwise stabilizers of finitely generated Galois algebraically closed subsets of $M$ and finitely generated Galois algebraically closed subsets of $M$. We use this to characterize the group of automorphisms of $\mathrm{Aut}(M)$, for $M$ the countable saturated model of $\mathrm{ACF}_0$, $\mathrm{DCF}_0$, or the theory of infinite $\mathrm{K}$-vector spaces, generalizing results of Evans $\&amp;$ Lascar, and Konnerth, while at the same time subsuming the analysis from [11] for $\omega$-categorical structures with weak elimination of imaginaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes are concerned with the existence and the basic properties of the set-theoretic universes for nonstandard analysis, compiled by a beginner in the subject. It assumes a basic background in first-order logic, though the necessary material is revised in Appendix A. Needless to say, none of the material presented here is original, but has been adapted from standard sources.</description>

      <title>Universal Gluing and Contextual Choice: Categorical Logic and the Foundations of Analytic Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new categorical and constructive foundation for analytic approximation based on a Contextual Choice Principle (CCP), which enforces locality and compatibility in the construction of mathematical objects. Central to our approach is the Universal Embedding and Linear Approximation Theorem (UELAT), which establishes that functions in broad spaces -- including C(K), Sobolev spaces W^{k,p}(Omega), and distributions D'(Omega) -- can be explicitly approximated by finite-rank linear projections, each with a constructive, algorithmically verifiable certificate of accuracy.
  These constructions are governed categorically by a functorial adjunction between local logical probes and analytic models, making analytic existence both formally certifiable and programmatically extractable. As a key result, we prove a uniform certificate stability theorem, ensuring that approximation certificates persist under uniform convergence.
  The CCP avoids classical pathologies (e.g., non-measurable sets, Banach--Tarski paradoxes) by eliminating non-constructive choice and replacing it with a coherent, local-to-global semantic logic. Our framework strengthens the foundations of constructive analysis while contributing tools relevant to formal verification, type-theoretic proof systems, and computational mathematics.</description>

      <title>Extending conceptual completeness via virtual ultracategories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of virtual ultracategory. From a topological point of view, this notion can be seen as a categorification of relational $\beta$-algebras. From a categorical point of view, virtual ultracategories generalize ultracategories in the same way that multicategories generalize monoidal categories. From a logical point of view, whereas the points of a coherent topos form an ultracategory, the points of an arbitrary topos form a virtual ultracategory. We then extend Makkai--Lurie's conceptual completeness: a topos with enough points can be reconstructed from its virtual ultracategory of points.</description>

Abstract: We show that in the $\mathbb{P}_{\max}$ extension of a certain Chang-type model of determinacy, if $\kappa\in\{\omega_1, \omega_2, \omega_3\}$, then the restriction of the club filter on $\kappa\cap\mathrm{Cof}(\omega)$ to HOD is an ultrafilter in HOD. This answers Question 4.11 of [BNH23] raised by Ben-Neria and Hayut.</description>

      <title>{$T$}-convexity, Weakly Immediate Types, and {$T$}-$\lambda$-Spherical Completions of o-minimal Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that ordered exponential fields with a compatible non-trivial valuation cannot be spherically complete, but there are some that are ``complete enough''. This paper gives analogues of Kaplansky's theorem on maximally valued fields that hold for a suitable class of elementary extensions of some ordered exponential fields with a compatible valuation. More precisely it does so for models of any theory $T_{\text{convex}}$ given by the expansion of a fixed complete o-minimal theory of ordered fields $T$, by a predicate $\mathcal{O}$ for a non-trivial $T$-convex valuation ring. For $\lambda$ an uncountable cardinal, say that a unary type $p(x)$ over a model of $T_{\text{convex}}$ is \emph{$\lambda$-bounded weakly immediate} if its cut is defined by an empty intersection of fewer than $\lambda$ many nested valuation balls. Call an elementary extension \emph{$\lambda$-bounded wim-constructible} if it is obtained as a transfinite composition of extensions each generated by one element whose type is $\lambda$-bounded weakly immediate. I show that $\lambda$-bounded wim-constructible extensions do not extend the residue-field sort and that any two wim-constructible extensions can be amalgamated in an extension which is again $\lambda$-bounded wim-constructible over both. A consequence of this is that given an uncountable cardinal $\lambda$, every model of $T_{\text{convex}}$ has a unique-up-to-isomorphism $\lambda$-spherically complete $\lambda$-bounded wim-constructible extension providing an analogue of Kaplansky's theorem. I call this extension the $T$-$\lambda$-spherical completion. Another consequence is that $T_{\mathrm{convex}}$ is \emph{definably spherically complete}. When $T$ is power bounded wim-constructible extensions are just the immediate extensions. I discuss the example of power bounded theories expanded by $\exp$ (\emph{simply exponential} theories).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the combinatorial structure of the set of maximal antichains in a Boolean algebra ordered by almost refinement. We also consider the reaping relation and its associated cardinal invariants, focusing in particular on reduced powers of Boolean algebras. As an application, we obtain that, on the one hand, the ultrafilter number of the Cohen algebra is greater than or equal to the cofinality of the meagre ideal and, on the other hand, a suitable parametrized diamond principle implies that the ultrafilter number of the Cohen algebra is equal to $\aleph_1$.</description>

      <title>Prime Factorization in Models of PV$_1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming that no family of polynomial-size Boolean circuits can factorize a constant fraction of all products of two $n$-bit primes, we show that the bounded arithmetic theory $\text{PV}_1$, even when augmented by the sharply bounded choice scheme $BB(\Sigma^b_0)$, cannot prove that every number has some prime divisor. By the completeness theorem, it follows that under this assumption there is a model $M$ of $\text{PV}_1$ that contains a nonstandard number $m$ which has no prime factorization.</description>

Abstract: In the area of Tame Geometry, different model-theoretic tameness conditions are established and their relationships are analyzed. We construct a subfield $K$ of the real numbers that lacks several of such tameness properties. As our main result, we present a first-order formula in the language of rings that defines a non-Borel set in $K$. Moreover, $K$ has the independence property and admits both archimedean and non-archimedean orderings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To cater to the needs of (Zero Knowledge) proofs for (mathematical) proofs, we describe a method to transform formal sentences in 2x2 - matrices over multivariate polynomials with integer coefficients, such that usual proof-steps like modus-ponens or the substitution are easy to compute from the matrices corresponding to the terms or formulas used as arguments. By evaluating the polynomial variables in random elements of a suitably chosen finite field, the proof is replaced by a numeric sequence. Only the values corresponding to the axioms have to be computed from scratch. The values corresponding to derived formulas are computed from the values corresponding to their ancestors by applying the homomorphic properties. On such sequences, various Zero Knowledge methods can be applied.</description>

      <title>Coslice Colimits in Homotopy Type Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We contribute to the theory of (homotopy) colimits inside homotopy type theory. The heart of our work characterizes the connection between colimits in coslices of a universe, called coslice colimits, and colimits in the universe (i.e., ordinary colimits). To derive this characterization, we find an explicit construction of colimits in coslices that is tailored to reveal the connection. We use the construction to derive properties of colimits. Notably, we prove that the forgetful functor from a coslice creates colimits over trees. We also use the construction to examine how colimits interact with orthogonal factorization systems and with cohomology theories. As a consequence of their interaction with orthogonal factorization systems, all pointed colimits (special kinds of coslice colimits) preserve $n$-connectedness, which implies that higher groups are closed under colimits on directed graphs. We have formalized our main construction of the coslice colimit functor in Agda. The code for this paper is available at https://github.com/PHart3/colimits-agda .</description>

      <title>Robust No-Arbitrage under Projective Determinacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drawing on set theory, this paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the structural condition of mathematical finance under Knightian uncertainty. We adopt a projective framework in which all components of the model -- prices, priors and trading strategies -- are treated uniformly in terms of measurability. This contrasts with the quasi-sure setting of Bouchard and Nutz, in which prices are Borel-measurable and graphs of local priors are analytic sets, while strategies and stochastic kernels inherit only universal measurability. In our projective framework, we establish several characterizations of the robust no-arbitrage condition, already known in the quasi-sure setting, but under significantly more elegant and consistent assumptions. These characterisations have important applications, in particular, the existence of solutions to the robust utility maximization problem. To do this, we work within the classical Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC), augmented by the axiom of Projective Determinacy (PD). The (PD) axiom, a well-established axiom of descriptive set theory, guarantees strong regularity properties for projective sets and projective functions.</description>

      <title>Locality in Residuated-Lattice Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-valued models generalise the structures from classical model theory by defining truth values for a model with an arbitrary algebra. Just as algebraic varieties provide semantics for many non-classical propositional logics, models defined over algebras in a variety provide the semantics for the corresponding non-classical predicate logics. In particular models defined over varieties of residuated lattices represent the model theory for first-order substructrual logics.
  In this paper we study the extent to which the classical locality theorems from Hanf and Gaifman hold true in the residuated lattice setting. We demonstrate that the answer is sensitive both to how locality is understood in the generalised context and the behaviour of the truth-defining algebra. In the case of Hanf's theorem, we will show that the theorem fails for the natural understanding of local neighbourhoods, but is recoverable in one special case for well-connected residuated lattices. For Gaifman's theorem, rather than consider Gaifman normal forms directly we focus on the main lemma of the theorem from textbook proofs. We prove that for a number of different understandings of locality, provided the algebra is well-behaved enough to express locality in its syntax, this main lemma can be recovered. In each case we will see that importance of an order-interpreting connective which creates a link between the modelling relation between models and formulas and the valuation function from formulas into the algebra.</description>
