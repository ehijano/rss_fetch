      <title>Decoupling Power Quality Issues in Grid-Microgrid Network Using Microgrid Building Blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microgrids are evolving as promising options to enhance reliability of the connected transmission and distribution systems. Traditional design and deployment of microgrids require significant engineering analysis. Microgrid Building Blocks (MBB), consisting of modular blocks that integrate seamlessly to form effective microgrids, is an enabling concept for faster and broader adoption of microgrids. Back-to-Back converter placed at the point of common coupling of microgrid is an integral part of the MBB. This paper presents applications of MBB to decouple power quality issues in grid-microgrid network serving power quality sensitive loads such as data centers, new grid-edge technologies such as vehicle-to-grid generation, and serving electric vehicle charging loads during evacuation before disaster events. Simulation results show that MBB effectively decouples the power quality issues across networks and helps maintain good power quality in the power quality sensitive network based on the operational scenario.</description>

      <title>On the design of stabilizing FIR controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it has been observed that finite impulse response controllers are an excellent basis for encrypted control, where privacy-preserving controller evaluations via special cryptosystems are the main focus. Beneficial properties of FIR filters are also well-known from digital signal processing, which makes them preferable over infinite impulse response filters in many applications. Their appeal extends to feedback control, offering design flexibility grounded solely on output measurements. However, designing FIR controllers is challenging, which motivates this work. To address the design challenge, we initially show that FIR controller designs for linear systems can equivalently be stated as static or dynamic output feedback problems. After focusing on the existence of stabilizing FIR controllers for a given plant, we tailor two common design approaches for output feedback to the case of FIR controllers. Unfortunately, it will turn out that the FIR characteristics add further restrictions to the LMI-based approaches. Hence, we finally turn to designs building on non-convex optimization, which provide satisfactory results for a selection of benchmark systems.</description>

      <title>An Econometric Analysis of Large Flexible Cryptocurrency-mining Consumers in Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, power grids have seen a surge in large cryptocurrency mining firms, with individual consumption levels reaching 700MW. This study examines the behavior of these firms in Texas, focusing on how their consumption is influenced by cryptocurrency conversion rates, electricity prices, local weather, and other factors. We transform the skewed electricity consumption data of these firms, perform correlation analysis, and apply a seasonal autoregressive moving average model for analysis. Our findings reveal that, surprisingly, short-term mining electricity consumption is not correlated with cryptocurrency conversion rates. Instead, the primary influencers are the temperature and electricity prices. These firms also respond to avoid transmission and distribution network (T\&amp;D) charges -- famously known as four Coincident peak (4CP) charges -- during summer times. As the scale of these firms is likely to surge in future years, the developed electricity consumption model can be used to generate public, synthetic datasets to understand the overall impact on power grid. The developed model could also lead to better pricing mechanisms to effectively use the flexibility of these resources towards improving power grid reliability.</description>

      <title>Controllability and Observability of Temporal Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous complex systems, such as those arisen in ecological networks, genomic contact networks, and social networks, exhibit higher-order and time-varying characteristics, which can be effectively modeled using temporal hypergraphs. However, analyzing and controlling temporal hypergraphs poses significant challenges due to their inherent time-varying and nonlinear nature, while most existing methods predominantly target static hypergraphs. In this article, we generalize the notions of controllability and observability to temporal hypergraphs by leveraging tensor and nonlinear systems theory. Specifically, we establish tensor-based rank conditions to determine the weak controllability and observability of temporal hypergraphs. The proposed framework is further demonstrated with synthetic and real-world examples.</description>

      <title>Robust Input Shaping Vibration Control via Extended Kalman Filter-Incorporated Residual Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of industry, the vibration control of flexible structures and underactuated systems has been increasingly gaining attention. Input shaping technology enables stable performance for high-speed motion in industrial motion systems. However, existing input shapers generally suffer from the ineffective control performance due to the neglect of observation errors. To address this critical issue, this paper proposes an Extended Kalman Filter-incorporated Residual Neural Network-based input Shaping (ERS) model for vibration control. Its main ideas are two-fold: a) adopting an extended Kalman filter to address a vertical flexible beam's model errors; and b) adopting a residual neural network to cascade with the extended Kalman filter for eliminating the remaining observation errors. Detailed experiments on a real dataset collected from a vertical flexible beam demonstrate that the proposed ERS model has achieved significant vibration control performance over several state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Accounts of using the Tustin-Net architecture on a rotary inverted pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this report we investigate the use of the Tustin neural network architecture (Tustin-Net) for the identification of a physical rotary inverse pendulum. This physics-based architecture is of particular interest as it builds on the known relationship between velocities and positions. We here aim at discussing the advantages, limitations and performance of Tustin-Nets compared to first-principles grey-box models on a real physical apparatus, showing how, with a standard training procedure, the former can hardly achieve the same accuracy as the latter. To address this limitation, we present a training strategy based on transfer learning that yields Tustin-Nets that are competitive with the first-principles model, without requiring extensive knowledge of the setup as the latter.</description>

      <title>Modularized data-driven approximation of the Koopman operator and generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) is a widely-used data-driven approach to learn an approximation of the Koopman operator. Consequently, it provides a powerful tool for data-driven analysis, prediction, and control of nonlinear dynamical (control) systems. In this work, we propose a novel modularized EDMD scheme tailored to interconnected systems. To this end, we utilize the structure of the Koopman generator that allows to learn the dynamics of subsystems individually and thus alleviates the curse of dimensionality by considering observable functions on smaller state spaces. Moreover, our approach canonically enables transfer learning if a system encompasses multiple copies of a model as well as efficient adaption to topology changes without retraining. We provide finite-data bounds on the estimation error using tools from graph theory. The efficacy of the method is illustrated by means of various numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Star-shaped Tilted Hexarotor Maneuverability: Analysis of the Role of the Tilt Cant Angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star-shaped Tilted Hexarotors are rapidly emerging for applications highly demanding in terms of robustness and maneuverability. To ensure improvement in such features, a careful selection of the tilt angles is mandatory. In this work, we present a rigorous analysis of how the force subspace varies with the tilt cant angles, namely the tilt angles along the vehicle arms, taking into account gravity compensation and torque decoupling to abide by the hovering condition. Novel metrics are introduced to assess the performance of existing tilted platforms, as well as to provide some guidelines for the selection of the tilt cant angle in the design phase.</description>

      <title>A Stable Polygamy Approach to Spectrum Access with Channel Reuse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new and broader formulation of the stable marriage problem (SMP), called the stable polygamy problem (SPP), where multiple individuals from a larger group $L$ of $|L|$ individuals can be matched with a single individual from a smaller group $S$ of $|S|$ individuals. Each individual $\ell \in L$ possesses a social constraint set $C_{\ell}$ that contains a subset of $L$ with whom they cannot coexist harmoniously. We define a generalized concept of stability based on the preference and constraints of the individuals. We explore two common settings: common utility, where the utility of a match is the same for individuals from both sets, and preference ranking, where each individual has a preference ranking for every other individual in the opposite set. Our analysis is conducted using a novel graph-theoretical framework.
  The classic SMP has been investigated in recent years for spectrum access to match cells or users to channels, where only one-to-one matching is allowed. By contrast, the new SPP formulation allows us to solve more general models with channel reuse, where multiple users may access the same channel simultaneously. Interestingly, we show that classic algorithms, such as propose and reject (P&amp;R), and Hungarian method are no longer efficient in the polygamy setting.
  We develop efficient algorithms to solve the SPP in polynomial time, tailored for implementations in spectrum access with channel reuse. We analytically show that our algorithm always solves the SPP with common utility. While the SPP with preference ranking cannot be solved by any algorithm in all cases, we prove that our algorithm effectively solves it in specific graph structures representing strong and weak interference regimes. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms across various spectrum access scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Hybrid Hospital: Balancing On-Site and Remote Hospitalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid hospitals offer on-site and remote hospitalization through telemedicine. These new healthcare models require novel operational policies to balance costs, efficiency, and patient well-being. Our study addresses two first-order questions: (i) how to direct patient admission and call-in based on individual characteristics and proximity and (ii) how to determine the optimal allocation of medical resources between these two hospitalization options and among different patient types.
  We develop a model that uses Brownian Motion to capture the patient's health evolution during remote/on-site hospitalization and during travel. Under cost-minimizing call-in policies, we find that remote hospitalization can be cost-effective for moderately distant patients, as the optimal call-in threshold is non-monotonic in the patient's travel time. Subject to scarce resources, the optimal solution structure becomes equivalent to a simultaneous, identically sized increase of remote and on-site costs under abundant resources. When limited resources must be divided among multiple patient types, the optimal thresholds shift in non-obvious ways as resource availability changes. Finally, we develop a practical and efficient policy that allows for swapping an on-site patient with a remote patient when the latter is called-in and sufficient resources are not available to treat both on-site.
  Contrary to the widely held view that telemedicine can mitigate rural and non-rural healthcare disparities, our research suggests that on-site care may actually be more cost-effective than remote hospitalization for patients in distant locations, due to (potentially overlooked) risks during patient travel. This finding may be of particular concern in light of the growing number of ``hospital deserts'' amid recent rural hospital closures, as these communities may in fact not be well-served through at-home care.</description>

      <title>Data-driven MPC with terminal conditions in the Koopman framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) with terminal conditions in the Koopman framework using extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) to generate a data-based surrogate model for prediction and optimization. We rigorously show recursive feasibility and prove practical asymptotic stability w.r.t. the approximation accuracy. To this end, finite-data error bounds are employed. The construction of the terminal conditions is based on recently derived proportional error bounds to ensure the required Lyapunov decrease. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed data-driven predictive controller including the design procedure to construct the terminal region and controller.</description>

      <title>Impact of the Inflation Reduction Act and Carbon Capture on Transportation Electrification for a Net-Zero Western U.S. Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrification of transportation is critical to mitigate Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. The United States (U.S.) government's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 introduces policies to promote the electrification of transportation. In addition to electrifying transportation, clean energy technologies such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) may play a major role in achieving a net-zero energy system. Utilizing scenarios simulated by the U.S. version of the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM-USA), we analyze the individual and compound contributions of the IRA and CCS to reach a clean U.S. grid by 2035 and net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. We analyze the contributions based on three metrics: i) transportation electrification rate, ii) transportation fuel mix, and iii) spatio-temporal charging loads. Our findings indicate that the IRA significantly accelerates transportation electrification in the near-term (until 2035). In contrast, CCS technologies, by enabling the continued use of internal combustion vehicles while still advancing torward net-zero, potentially suppresses the rate of transportation electrification in the long-term. This study underscores how policy and technology innovation can interact and sensitivity studies with different combination are essential to characterize the potential contributions of each to the transportation electrification.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01463v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider interaction between the small amplitude travelling waves ("sound") and the shock waves in the transmission line containing both nonlinear capacitors and nonlinear inductors. We calculate for the "sound" wave the coefficient of reflection from (the coefficient of transmission through) the shock wave. These coefficients are expressed in terms of the wave speeds and the wave impedances. When only the capacitors or only the inductors are nonlinear, the coefficients are expressed in terms of the wave speeds only. We explicitly include into consideration of the shocks the dissipation, introducing ohmic resistors shunting the inductors and also in series with the capacitors. This allows us to describe the shocks as physical objects of finite width and study their profiles. In some particular cases the profiles were obtained in terms of elementary functions.</description>

      <title>Distributed alternating gradient descent for convex semi-infinite programs over a network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a first-order distributed algorithm for solving a convex semi-infinite program (SIP) over a time-varying network. In this setting, the objective function associated with the optimization problem is a summation of a set of functions, each held by one node in a network. The semi-infinite constraint, on the other hand, is known to all agents. The nodes collectively aim to solve the problem using local data about the objective and limited communication capabilities depending on the network topology. Our algorithm is built on three key ingredients: consensus step, gradient descent in the local objective, and local gradient descent iterations in the constraint at a node when the estimate violates the semi-infinite constraint. The algorithm is constructed, and its parameters are prescribed in such a way that the iterates held by each agent provably converge to an optimizer. That is, as the algorithm progresses, the estimates achieve consensus, and the constraint violation and the error in the optimal value are bounded above by vanishing terms. A simulation example illustrates our results.</description>

      <title>Deep Analysis of Time Series Data for Smart Grid Startup Strategies: A Transformer-LSTM-PSO Model Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grid startup, an integral component of the power system, holds strategic importance for ensuring the reliability and efficiency of the electrical grid. However, current methodologies for in-depth analysis and precise prediction of grid startup scenarios are inadequate. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method based on the Transformer-LSTM-PSO model. This model uniquely combines the Transformer's self-attention mechanism, LSTM's temporal modeling capabilities, and the parameter tuning features of the particle swarm optimization algorithm. It is designed to more effectively capture the complex temporal relationships in grid startup schemes. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements, with our model achieving lower RMSE and MAE values across multiple datasets compared to existing benchmarks, particularly in the NYISO Electric Market dataset where the RMSE was reduced by approximately 15% and the MAE by 20% compared to conventional models. Our main contribution is the development of a Transformer-LSTM-PSO model that significantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of smart grid startup predictions. The application of the Transformer-LSTM-PSO model represents a significant advancement in smart grid predictive analytics, concurrently fostering the development of more reliable and intelligent grid management systems.</description>

Abstract: Recent research has shown that smaller language models can acquire substantial reasoning abilities when fine-tuned with reasoning exemplars crafted by a significantly larger teacher model. We explore this paradigm for the financial domain, focusing on the challenge of answering questions that require multi-hop numerical reasoning over financial texts. We assess the performance of several smaller models that have been fine-tuned to generate programs that encode the required financial reasoning and calculations. Our findings demonstrate that these fine-tuned smaller models approach the performance of the teacher model.
  To provide a granular analysis of model performance, we propose an approach to investigate the specific student model capabilities that are enhanced by fine-tuning. Our empirical analysis indicates that fine-tuning refines the student models ability to express and apply the required financial concepts along with adapting the entity extraction for the specific data format. In addition, we hypothesize and demonstrate that comparable financial reasoning capability can be induced using relatively smaller datasets.</description>

Abstract: In this dissertation, we investigate the issue of robust localization in swarms of heterogeneous mobile agents with multiple and time-varying sensing modalities. Our focus is the development of filter-based and decoupled estimators under the assumption that agents possess communication and processing capabilities. Based on the findings from Distributed Collaborative State Estimation and modular sensor fusion, we propose a novel Kalman filter decoupling paradigm, which is termed Isolated Kalman Filtering (IKF). This paradigm is formally discussed and the treatment of delayed measurement is studied. The impact of approximation made was investigated on different observation graphs and the filter credibility was evaluated on a linear system in a Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, we propose a multi-agent modular sensor fusion approach based on the IKF paradigm, in order to cooperatively estimate the global state of a multi-agent system in a distributed way and fuse information provided by different on-board sensors in a computationally efficient way. As a consequence, this approach can be performed distributed among agents, while (i) communication between agents is only required at the moment of inter-agent joint observations, (ii) one agent acts as interim master to process state corrections isolated, (iii) agents can be added and removed from the swarm, (iv) each agent's full state can vary during mission (each local sensor suite can be truly modular), and (v) delayed and multi-rate sensor updates are supported. Extensive evaluation on realistic simulated and real-world data sets show that the proposed Isolated Kalman Filtering (IKF) paradigm, is applicable for both, truly modular single agent estimation and distributed collaborative multi-agent estimation problems.</description>

Abstract: Giardia lamblia is a flagellate intestinal protozoan with global distribution causing the disease known as giardiasis. This parasite is responsable for 35.1% of outbreaks of diarrhea caused by contaminated water which and mainly affects children in whom it can cause physical and cognitive impairment. In this paper, we consider a model of population dynamics to represent the behavior of Giardia lamblia in vitro, taking into account its mutation characteristic that guarantees to the protozoan resistance to the drug metronidazole. Different from what is found in the literature, it is pursued as the control objective the extermination of the protozoan considering that the parameters of the model are uncertain and only the partial measurement of the state vector is possible. On these assumptions, a control law is designed and the stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously proved. Simulation and experimental results illustrate the benefits of the proposed population control method of Giardia lamblia.</description>

      <title>Control-Coherent Koopman Modeling: A Physical Modeling Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The modeling of nonlinear dynamics based on Koopman operator theory, which is originally applicable only to autonomous systems with no control, is extended to non-autonomous control system without approximation to input matrix B. Prevailing methods using a least square estimate of the B matrix may result in an erroneous input matrix, misinforming the controller about the structure of the input matrix in a lifted space. Here, a new method for constructing a Koopman model that comprises the exact input matrix B is presented. A set of state variables are introduced so that the control inputs are linearly involved in the dynamics of actuators. With these variables, a lifted linear model with the exact control matrix, called a Control-Coherent Koopman Model, is constructed by superposing control input terms, which are linear in local actuator dynamics, to the Koopman operator of the associated autonomous nonlinear system. The proposed method is applied to multi degree-of-freedom robotic arms and multi-cable manipulation systems. Model Predictive Control is applied to the former. It is demonstrated that the prevailing Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (DMDc) using an approximate control matrix B does not provide a satisfactory result, while the Control-Coherent Koopman Model performs well with the correct B matrix.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Complex-Frequency Control of Grid-Forming Converters</title>

Abstract: Complex droop control, alternatively known as dispatchable virtual oscillator control (dVOC), stands out for its unique capabilities in synchronization and voltage stabilization among existing control strategies for grid-forming converters. Complex droop control leverages the novel concept of ``complex frequency'', thereby establishing a coupled connection between active and reactive power inputs and frequency and rate-of-change-of voltage outputs. However, its reliance on static droop gains limits its ability to exhibit crucial dynamic response behaviors required in future power systems. To address this limitation, this paper introduces dynamic complex-frequency control, upgrading static droop gains with dynamic transfer functions to enhance the richness and flexibility in dynamic responses for frequency and voltage control. Unlike existing approaches, the complex-frequency control framework treats frequency and voltage dynamics collectively, ensuring small-signal stability for frequency synchronization and voltage stabilization simultaneously. The control framework is validated through detailed numerical case studies on the IEEE nine-bus system, also showcasing its applicability in multi-converter setups.</description>

      <title>Remaining Discharge Energy Prediction for Lithium-Ion Batteries Over Broad Current Ranges: A Machine Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries have found their way into myriad sectors of industry to drive electrification, decarbonization, and sustainability. A crucial aspect in ensuring their safe and optimal performance is monitoring their energy levels. In this paper, we present the first study on predicting the remaining energy of a battery cell undergoing discharge over wide current ranges from low to high C-rates. The complexity of the challenge arises from the cell's C-rate-dependent energy availability as well as its intricate electro-thermal dynamics especially at high C-rates. To address this, we introduce a new definition of remaining discharge energy and then undertake a systematic effort in harnessing the power of machine learning to enable its prediction. Our effort includes two parts in cascade. First, we develop an accurate dynamic model based on integration of physics with machine learning to capture a battery's voltage and temperature behaviors. Second, based on the model, we propose a machine learning approach to predict the remaining discharge energy under arbitrary C-rates and pre-specified cut-off limits in voltage and temperature. The experimental validation shows that the proposed approach can predict the remaining discharge energy with a relative error of less than 3% when the current varies between 0~8 C for an NCA cell and 0~15 C for an LFP cell. The approach, by design, is amenable to training and computation.</description>

      <title>Distributed Online Feedback Optimization for Real-time Distribution System Voltage Regulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the real-time distribution system voltage regulation problem employing online feedback optimization (OFO) and short-range communication between physical neighbours. OFO does not need an accurate grid topology nor estimated consumption of non-controllable loads, affords fast calculations, and demonstrates robustness to uncertainties due to its feedback-based nature. These characteristics render it particularly suitable for real-time distribution system applications. However, many OFO controllers require centralized communication, which lack robustness to single-point failures. This paper proposes a distributed OFO design based on a nested feedback optimization strategy and analyzes its convergence. Numerical results reveal that the proposed design achieves satisfactory voltage regulation and outperforms other distributed approaches.</description>

      <title>Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability in Reinforcement Learning: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent literature has proposed approaches that learn control policies with high performance while maintaining safety guarantees. Synthesizing Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachable sets has become an effective tool for verifying safety and supervising the training of reinforcement learning-based control policies for complex, high-dimensional systems. Previously, HJ reachability was restricted to verifying low-dimensional dynamical systems primarily because the computational complexity of the dynamic programming approach it relied on grows exponentially with the number of system states. In recent years, a litany of proposed methods addresses this limitation by computing the reachability value function simultaneously with learning control policies to scale HJ reachability analysis while still maintaining a reliable estimate of the true reachable set. These HJ reachability approximations are used to improve the safety, and even reward performance, of learned control policies and can solve challenging tasks such as those with dynamic obstacles and/or with lidar-based or vision-based observations. In this survey paper, we review the recent developments in the field of HJ reachability estimation in reinforcement learning that would provide a foundational basis for further research into reliability in high-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Real-time Event Recognition of Long-distance Distributed Vibration Sensing with Knowledge Distillation and Hardware Acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fiber-optic sensing, especially distributed optical fiber vibration (DVS) sensing, is gaining importance in internet of things (IoT) applications, such as industrial safety monitoring and intrusion detection. Despite their wide application, existing post-processing methods that rely on deep learning models for event recognition in DVS systems face challenges with real-time processing of large sample data volumes, particularly in long-distance applications. To address this issue, we propose to use a four-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) with ResNet as the teacher model for knowledge distillation. This results in a significant improvement in accuracy, from 83.41% to 95.39%, on data from previously untrained environments. Additionally, we propose a novel hardware design based on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) to further accelerate model inference. This design replaces multiplication with binary shift operations and quantizes model weights, enabling high parallelism and low latency. Our implementation achieves an inference time of 0.083 ms for a spatial-temporal sample covering a 12.5 m fiber length and 0.256 s time frame. This performance enables real-time signal processing over approximately 38.55 km of fiber, about $2.14\times$ the capability of an Nvidia GTX 4090 GPU. The proposed method greatly enhances the efficiency of vibration pattern recognition, promoting the use of DVS as a smart IoT system. The data and code are available at https://github.com/HUST-IOF/Efficient-DVS.</description>

      <title>Contextual Tuning of Model Predictive Control for Autonomous Racing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.02710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning-based model predictive control has been widely applied in autonomous racing to improve the closed-loop behaviour of vehicles in a data-driven manner. When environmental conditions change, e.g., due to rain, often only the predictive model is adapted, but the controller parameters are kept constant. However, this can lead to suboptimal behaviour. In this paper, we address the problem of data-efficient controller tuning, adapting both the model and objective simultaneously. The key novelty of the proposed approach is that we leverage a learned dynamics model to encode the environmental condition as a so-called context. This insight allows us to employ contextual Bayesian optimization to efficiently transfer knowledge across different environmental conditions. Consequently, we require fewer data to find the optimal controller configuration for each context. The proposed framework is extensively evaluated with more than 3'000 laps driven on an experimental platform with 1:28 scale RC race cars. The results show that our approach successfully optimizes the lap time across different contexts requiring fewer data compared to other approaches based on standard Bayesian optimization.</description>

Abstract: Mathematical modeling of lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) is a primary challenge in advanced battery management. This paper proposes two new frameworks to integrate physics-based models with machine learning to achieve high-precision modeling for LiBs. The frameworks are characterized by informing the machine learning model of the state information of the physical model, enabling a deep integration between physics and machine learning. Based on the frameworks, a series of hybrid models are constructed, through combining an electrochemical model and an equivalent circuit model, respectively, with a feedforward neural network. The hybrid models are relatively parsimonious in structure and can provide considerable voltage predictive accuracy under a broad range of C-rates, as shown by extensive simulations and experiments. The study further expands to conduct aging-aware hybrid modeling, leading to the design of a hybrid model conscious of the state-of-health to make prediction. The experiments show that the model has high voltage predictive accuracy throughout a LiB's cycle life.</description>

Abstract: Feedback-evolving games is a framework that models the co-evolution between payoff functions and an environmental state. It serves as a useful tool to analyze many social dilemmas such as natural resource consumption, behaviors in epidemics, and the evolution of biological populations. However, it has primarily focused on the dynamics of a single population of agents. In this paper, we consider the impact of two populations of agents that share a common environmental resource. We focus on a scenario where individuals in one population are governed by an environmentally ``responsible" incentive policy, and individuals in the other population are environmentally ``irresponsible". An analysis on the asymptotic stability of the coupled system is provided, and conditions for which the resource collapses are identified. We then derive consumption rates for the irresponsible population that optimally exploit the environmental resource, and analyze how incentives should be allocated to the responsible population that most effectively promote the environment via a sensitivity analysis.</description>

      <title>An agent design with goal reaching guarantees for enhancement of learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18118v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning is commonly concerned with problems of maximizing accumulated rewards in Markov decision processes. Oftentimes, a certain goal state or a subset of the state space attain maximal reward. In such a case, the environment may be considered solved when the goal is reached. Whereas numerous techniques, learning or non-learning based, exist for solving environments, doing so optimally is the biggest challenge. Say, one may choose a reward rate which penalizes the action effort. Reinforcement learning is currently among the most actively developed frameworks for solving environments optimally by virtue of maximizing accumulated reward, in other words, returns. Yet, tuning agents is a notoriously hard task as reported in a series of works. Our aim here is to help the agent learn a near-optimal policy efficiently while ensuring a goal reaching property of some basis policy that merely solves the environment. We suggest an algorithm, which is fairly flexible, and can be used to augment practically any agent as long as it comprises of a critic. A formal proof of a goal reaching property is provided. Comparative experiments on several problems under popular baseline agents provided an empirical evidence that the learning can indeed be boosted while ensuring goal reaching property.</description>

Abstract: Street intersection counts and densities are fundamental measures in transport geography and urban planning. Conventional street network data and analysis tools often lead to significant overcounting of these measures. This study investigates the causes of such overcounting and proposes remedies. It introduces algorithms to streamline urban street network models through edge simplification and node consolidation, which enhance computational efficiency and improve accuracy in network measures like intersection counts, street segment lengths, and node degrees. The algorithms are validated and subjected to a global empirical assessment to evaluate the extent of count bias. These findings highlight the prevalence of this bias and underscore the necessity for better methods to mitigate inaccuracies in intersection representation.</description>

      <title>A Complete Set of Quadratic Constraints for Repeated ReLU and Generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper derives a complete set of quadratic constraints (QCs) for the repeated ReLU. The complete set of QCs is described by a collection of matrix copositivity conditions. We also show that only two functions satisfy all QCs in our complete set: the repeated ReLU and flipped ReLU. Thus our complete set of QCs bounds the repeated ReLU as tight as possible up to the sign invariance inherent in quadratic forms. We derive a similar complete set of incremental QCs for repeated ReLU, which can potentially lead to less conservative Lipschitz bounds for ReLU networks than the standard LipSDP approach. The basic constructions are also used to derive the complete sets of QCs for other piecewise linear activation functions such as leaky ReLU, MaxMin, and HouseHolder. Finally, we illustrate the use of the complete set of QCs to assess stability and performance for recurrent neural networks with ReLU activation functions. We rely on a standard copositivity relaxation to formulate the stability/performance condition as a semidefinite program. Simple examples are provided to illustrate that the complete sets of QCs and incremental QCs can yield less conservative bounds than existing sets.</description>

Abstract: Electricity Consumption Profiles (ECPs) are crucial for operating and planning power distribution systems, especially with the increasing numbers of various low-carbon technologies such as solar panels and electric vehicles. Traditional ECP modeling methods typically assume the availability of sufficient ECP data. However, in practice, the accessibility of ECP data is limited due to privacy issues or the absence of metering devices. Few-shot learning (FSL) has emerged as a promising solution for ECP modeling in data-scarce scenarios. Nevertheless, standard FSL methods, such as those used for images, are unsuitable for ECP modeling because (1) these methods usually assume several source domains with sufficient data and several target domains. However, in the context of ECP modeling, there may be thousands of source domains with a moderate amount of data and thousands of target domains. (2) Standard FSL methods usually involve cumbersome knowledge transfer mechanisms, such as pre-training and fine-tuning, whereas ECP modeling requires more lightweight methods. (3) Deep learning models often lack explainability, hindering their application in industry. This paper proposes a novel FSL method that exploits Transformers and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for ECP modeling to address the above-described issues. Results show that our method can accurately restore the complex ECP distribution with a minimal amount of ECP data (e.g., only 1.6\% of the complete domain dataset) while it outperforms state-of-the-art time series modeling methods, maintaining the advantages of being both lightweight and interpretable.
