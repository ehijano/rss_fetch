      <title>A Model-based Multi-Agent Personalized Short-Video Recommender System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender selects and presents top-K items to the user at each online request, and a recommendation session consists of several sequential requests. Formulating a recommendation session as a Markov decision process and solving it by reinforcement learning (RL) framework has attracted increasing attention from both academic and industry communities. In this paper, we propose a RL-based industrial short-video recommender ranking framework, which models and maximizes user watch-time in an environment of user multi-aspect preferences by a collaborative multi-agent formulization. Moreover, our proposed framework adopts a model-based learning approach to alleviate the sample selection bias which is a crucial but intractable problem in industrial recommender system. Extensive offline evaluations and live experiments confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method over alternatives. Our proposed approach has been deployed in our real large-scale short-video sharing platform, successfully serving over hundreds of millions users.</description>

      <title>RankSHAP: a Gold Standard Feature Attribution Method for the Ranking Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several works propose various post-hoc, model-agnostic explanations for the task of ranking, i.e. the task of ordering a set of documents, via feature attribution methods. However, these attributions are seen to weakly correlate and sometimes contradict each other. In classification/regression, several works focus on \emph{axiomatic characterization} of feature attribution methods, showing that a certain method uniquely satisfies a set of desirable properties. However, no such efforts have been taken in the space of feature attributions for the task of ranking. We take an axiomatic game-theoretic approach, popular in the feature attribution community, to identify candidate attribution methods for ranking tasks. We first define desirable axioms: Rank-Efficiency, Rank-Missingness, Rank-Symmetry and Rank-Monotonicity, all variants of the classical Shapley axioms. Next, we introduce Rank-SHAP, a feature attribution algorithm for the general ranking task, which is an extension to classical Shapley values. We identify a polynomial-time algorithm for computing approximate Rank-SHAP values and evaluate the computational efficiency and accuracy of our algorithm under various scenarios. We also evaluate its alignment with human intuition with a user study. Lastly, we theoretically examine popular rank attribution algorithms, EXS and Rank-LIME, and evaluate their capacity to satisfy the classical Shapley axioms.</description>

      <title>Stability of Explainable Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable Recommendation has been gaining attention over the last few years in industry and academia. Explanations provided along with recommendations in a recommender system framework have many uses: particularly reasoning why a suggestion is provided and how well an item aligns with a user's personalized preferences. Hence, explanations can play a huge role in influencing users to purchase products. However, the reliability of the explanations under varying scenarios has not been strictly verified from an empirical perspective. Unreliable explanations can bear strong consequences such as attackers leveraging explanations for manipulating and tempting users to purchase target items that the attackers would want to promote. In this paper, we study the vulnerability of existent feature-oriented explainable recommenders, particularly analyzing their performance under different levels of external noises added into model parameters. We conducted experiments by analyzing three important state-of-the-art (SOTA) explainable recommenders when trained on two widely used e-commerce based recommendation datasets of different scales. We observe that all the explainable models are vulnerable to increased noise levels. Experimental results verify our hypothesis that the ability to explain recommendations does decrease along with increasing noise levels and particularly adversarial noise does contribute to a much stronger decrease. Our study presents an empirical verification on the topic of robust explanations in recommender systems which can be extended to different types of explainable recommenders in RS.</description>

      <title>Robust Explainable Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable Recommender Systems is an important field of study which provides reasons behind the suggested recommendations. Explanations with recommender systems are useful for developers while debugging anomalies within the system and for consumers while interpreting the model's effectiveness in capturing their true preferences towards items. However, most of the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) explainable recommenders could not retain their explanation capability under noisy circumstances and moreover are not generalizable across different datasets. The robustness of the explanations must be ensured so that certain malicious attackers do not manipulate any high-stake decision scenarios to their advantage, which could cause severe consequences affecting large groups of interest. In this work, we present a general framework for feature-aware explainable recommenders that can withstand external attacks and provide robust and generalized explanations. This paper presents a novel framework which could be utilized as an additional defense tool, preserving the global explainability when subject to model-based white box attacks. Our framework is simple to implement and supports different methods regardless of the internal model structure and intrinsic utility within any model. We experimented our framework on two architecturally different feature-based SOTA explainable algorithms by training them on three popular e-commerce datasets of increasing scales. We noticed that both the algorithms displayed an overall improvement in the quality and robustness of the global explainability under normal as well as noisy environments across all the datasets, indicating the flexibility and mutability of our framework.</description>

      <title>Diversity of What? On the Different Conceptualizations of Diversity in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diversity is a commonly known principle in the design of recommender systems, but also ambiguous in its conceptualization. Through semi-structured interviews we explore how practitioners at three different public service media organizations in the Netherlands conceptualize diversity within the scope of their recommender systems. We provide an overview of the goals that they have with diversity in their systems, which aspects are relevant, and how recommendations should be diversified. We show that even within this limited domain, conceptualization of diversity greatly varies, and argue that it is unlikely that a standardized conceptualization will be achieved. Instead, we should focus on effective communication of what diversity in this particular system means, thus allowing for operationalizations of diversity that are capable of expressing the nuances and requirements of that particular domain.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Retrieval Systems in the Real World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research paper presents a comprehensive analysis of integrating advanced language models with search and retrieval systems in the fields of information retrieval and natural language processing. The objective is to evaluate and compare various state-of-the-art methods based on their performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The analysis explores different combinations of technologies, including Azure Cognitive Search Retriever with GPT-4, Pinecone's Canopy framework, Langchain with Pinecone and different language models (OpenAI, Cohere), LlamaIndex with Weaviate Vector Store's hybrid search, Google's RAG implementation on Cloud VertexAI-Search, Amazon SageMaker's RAG, and a novel approach called KG-FID Retrieval. The motivation for this analysis arises from the increasing demand for robust and responsive question-answering systems in various domains. The RobustQA metric is used to evaluate the performance of these systems under diverse paraphrasing of questions. The report aims to provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each method, facilitating informed decisions in the deployment and development of AI-driven search and retrieval systems.</description>

      <title>Ah, that's the great puzzle: On the Quest of a Holistic Understanding of the Harms of Recommender Systems on Children</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Children come across various media items online, many of which are selected by recommender systems (RS) primarily designed for adults. The specific nature of the content selected by RS to display on online platforms used by children - although not necessarily targeting them as a user base - remains largely unknown. This raises questions about whether such content is appropriate given children's vulnerable stages of development and the potential risks to their well-being.
  In this position paper, we reflect on the relationship between RS and children, emphasizing the possible adverse effects of the content this user group might be exposed to online. As a step towards fostering safer interactions for children in online environments, we advocate for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to undertake a more comprehensive examination of the impact of RS on children - one focused on harms. This would result in a more holistic understanding that could inform the design and deployment of strategies that would better suit children's needs and preferences while actively mitigating the potential harm posed by RS; acknowledging that identifying and addressing these harms is complex and multifaceted.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Recommendation via Multivariate Policy Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world recommender systems often need to balance multiple objectives when deciding which recommendations to present to users. These include behavioural signals (e.g. clicks, shares, dwell time), as well as broader objectives (e.g. diversity, fairness). Scalarisation methods are commonly used to handle this balancing task, where a weighted average of per-objective reward signals determines the final score used for ranking. Naturally, how these weights are computed exactly, is key to success for any online platform. We frame this as a decision-making task, where the scalarisation weights are actions taken to maximise an overall North Star reward (e.g. long-term user retention or growth). We extend existing policy learning methods to the continuous multivariate action domain, proposing to maximise a pessimistic lower bound on the North Star reward that the learnt policy will yield. Typical lower bounds based on normal approximations suffer from insufficient coverage, and we propose an efficient and effective policy-dependent correction for this. We provide guidance to design stochastic data collection policies, as well as highly sensitive reward signals. Empirical observations from simulations, offline and online experiments highlight the efficacy of our deployed approach.</description>

      <title>How to Diversify any Personalized Recommender? A User-centric Pre-processing approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to improve the diversity of Top-N recommendations while maintaining recommendation performance. Our approach employs a user-centric pre-processing strategy aimed at exposing users to a wide array of content categories and topics. We personalize this strategy by selectively adding and removing a percentage of interactions from user profiles. This personalization ensures we remain closely aligned with user preferences while gradually introducing distribution shifts. Our pre-processing technique offers flexibility and can seamlessly integrate into any recommender architecture. To evaluate our approach, we run extensive experiments on two publicly available data sets for news and book recommendations. We test various standard and neural network-based recommender system algorithms. Our results show that our approach generates diverse recommendations, ensuring users are exposed to a wider range of items. Furthermore, leveraging pre-processed data for training leads to recommender systems achieving performance levels comparable to, and in some cases, better than those trained on original, unmodified data. Additionally, our approach promotes provider fairness by facilitating exposure to minority or niche categories.</description>

      <title>FairEvalLLM. A Comprehensive Framework for Benchmarking Fairness in Large Language Model Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework for evaluating fairness in recommender systems powered by Large Language Models (RecLLMs), addressing the need for a unified approach that spans various fairness dimensions including sensitivity to user attributes, intrinsic fairness, and discussions of fairness based on underlying benefits. In addition, our framework introduces counterfactual evaluations and integrates diverse user group considerations to enhance the discourse on fairness evaluation for RecLLMs.
  Our key contributions include the development of a robust framework for fairness evaluation in LLM-based recommendations and a structured method to create \textit{informative user profiles} from demographic data, historical user preferences, and recent interactions. We argue that the latter is essential for enhancing personalization in such systems, especially in temporal-driven scenarios. We demonstrate the utility of our framework through practical applications on two datasets, LastFM-1K and ML-1M. We conduct experiments on a subsample of 80 users from each dataset, testing and assessing the effectiveness of various prompt construction scenarios and in-context learning, comprising more than 50 scenarios. This results in more than 4000 recommendations (80 * 50 = 4000). Our study reveals that while there are no significant unfairness issues in scenarios involving sensitive attributes, some concerns remain. However, in terms of intrinsic fairness, which does not involve direct sensitivity, unfairness across demographic groups remains significant. The code and data used for this paper are available at: \url{https://shorturl.at/awBFM}.</description>

      <title>Comparing Personalized Relevance Algorithms for Directed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an interactive Web platform that, given a directed graph, allows identifying the most relevant nodes related to a given query node. Besides well-established algorithms such as PageRank and Personalized PageRank, the demo includes Cyclerank, a novel algorithm that addresses some of their limitations by leveraging cyclic paths to compute personalized relevance scores. Our demo design enables two use cases: (a) algorithm comparison, comparing the results obtained with different algorithms, and (b) dataset comparison, for exploring and gaining insights into a dataset and comparing it with others. We provide 50 pre-loaded datasets from Wikipedia, Twitter, and Amazon and seven algorithms. Users can upload new datasets, and new algorithms can be easily added. By showcasing efficient algorithms to compute relevance scores in directed graphs, our tool helps to uncover hidden relationships within the data, which makes of it a valuable addition to the repertoire of graph analysis algorithms.</description>

      <title>Tabular Embedding Model (TEM): Finetuning Embedding Models For Tabular RAG Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent times Large Language Models have exhibited tremendous capabilities, especially in the areas of mathematics, code generation and general-purpose reasoning. However for specialized domains especially in applications that require parsing and analyzing large chunks of numeric or tabular data even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models struggle. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to solving domain-specific tabular data analysis tasks by presenting a unique RAG workflow that mitigates the scalability issues of existing tabular LLM solutions. Specifically, we present Tabular Embedding Model (TEM), a novel approach to fine-tune embedding models for tabular Retrieval-Augmentation Generation (RAG) applications. Embedding models form a crucial component in the RAG workflow and even current SOTA embedding models struggle as they are predominantly trained on textual datasets and thus underperform in scenarios involving complex tabular data. The evaluation results showcase that our approach not only outperforms current SOTA embedding models in this domain but also does so with a notably smaller and more efficient model structure.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Agent for Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the current digital era, the rapid spread of misinformation on online platforms presents significant challenges to societal well-being, public trust, and democratic processes, influencing critical decision making and public opinion. To address these challenges, there is a growing need for automated fake news detection mechanisms. Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, prompting exploration into their potential for verifying news claims. Instead of employing LLMs in a non-agentic way, where LLMs generate responses based on direct prompts in a single shot, our work introduces FactAgent, an agentic approach of utilizing LLMs for fake news detection. FactAgent enables LLMs to emulate human expert behavior in verifying news claims without any model training, following a structured workflow. This workflow breaks down the complex task of news veracity checking into multiple sub-steps, where LLMs complete simple tasks using their internal knowledge or external tools. At the final step of the workflow, LLMs integrate all findings throughout the workflow to determine the news claim's veracity. Compared to manual human verification, FactAgent offers enhanced efficiency. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of FactAgent in verifying claims without the need for any training process. Moreover, FactAgent provides transparent explanations at each step of the workflow and during final decision-making, offering insights into the reasoning process of fake news detection for end users. FactAgent is highly adaptable, allowing for straightforward updates to its tools that LLMs can leverage within the workflow, as well as updates to the workflow itself using domain knowledge. This adaptability enables FactAgent's application to news verification across various domains.</description>

      <title>Automating the Analysis of Public Saliency and Attitudes towards Biodiversity from Digital Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring public attitudes toward wildlife provides crucial insights into our relationship with nature and helps monitor progress toward Global Biodiversity Framework targets. Yet, conducting such assessments at a global scale is challenging. Manually curating search terms for querying news and social media is tedious, costly, and can lead to biased results. Raw news and social media data returned from queries are often cluttered with irrelevant content and syndicated articles. We aim to overcome these challenges by leveraging modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools. We introduce a folk taxonomy approach for improved search term generation and employ cosine similarity on Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency vectors to filter syndicated articles. We also introduce an extensible relevance filtering pipeline which uses unsupervised learning to reveal common topics, followed by an open-source zero-shot Large Language Model (LLM) to assign topics to news article titles, which are then used to assign relevance. Finally, we conduct sentiment, topic, and volume analyses on resulting data. We illustrate our methodology with a case study of news and X (formerly Twitter) data before and during the COVID-19 pandemic for various mammal taxa, including bats, pangolins, elephants, and gorillas. During the data collection period, up to 62% of articles including keywords pertaining to bats were deemed irrelevant to biodiversity, underscoring the importance of relevance filtering. At the pandemic's onset, we observed increased volume and a significant sentiment shift toward horseshoe bats, which were implicated in the pandemic, but not for other focal taxa. The proposed methods open the door to conservation practitioners applying modern and emerging NLP tools, including LLMs "out of the box," to analyze public perceptions of biodiversity during current events or campaigns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topic pages aggregate useful information about an entity or concept into a single succinct and accessible article. Automated creation of topic pages would enable their rapid curation as information resources, providing an alternative to traditional web search. While most prior work has focused on generating topic pages about biographical entities, in this work, we develop a completely automated process to generate high-quality topic pages for scientific entities, with a focus on biomedical concepts. We release TOPICAL, a web app and associated open-source code, comprising a model pipeline combining retrieval, clustering, and prompting, that makes it easy for anyone to generate topic pages for a wide variety of biomedical entities on demand. In a human evaluation of 150 diverse topic pages generated using TOPICAL, we find that the vast majority were considered relevant, accurate, and coherent, with correct supporting citations. We make all code publicly available and host a free-to-use web app at: https://s2-topical.apps.allenai.org</description>

      <title>Semi-Parametric Retrieval via Binary Token Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The landscape of information retrieval has broadened from search services to a critical component in various advanced applications, where indexing efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and freshness are increasingly important yet remain less explored. To address these demands, we introduce Semi-parametric Vocabulary Disentangled Retrieval (SVDR). SVDR is a novel semi-parametric retrieval framework that supports two types of indexes: an embedding-based index for high effectiveness, akin to existing neural retrieval methods; and a binary token index that allows for quick and cost-effective setup, resembling traditional term-based retrieval. In our evaluation on three open-domain question answering benchmarks with the entire Wikipedia as the retrieval corpus, SVDR consistently demonstrates superiority. It achieves a 3% higher top-1 retrieval accuracy compared to the dense retriever DPR when using an embedding-based index and an 9% higher top-1 accuracy compared to BM25 when using a binary token index. Specifically, the adoption of a binary token index reduces index preparation time from 30 GPU hours to just 2 CPU hours and storage size from 31 GB to 2 GB, achieving a 90% reduction compared to an embedding-based index.</description>

      <title>A quantitative and typological study of Early Slavic participle clauses and their competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis is a corpus-based, quantitative, and typological analysis of the functions of Early Slavic participle constructions and their finite competitors ($jegda$-'when'-clauses). The first part leverages detailed linguistic annotation on Early Slavic corpora at the morphosyntactic, dependency, information-structural, and lexical levels to obtain indirect evidence for different potential functions of participle clauses and their main finite competitor and understand the roles of compositionality and default discourse reasoning as explanations for the distribution of participle constructions and $jegda$-clauses in the corpus. The second part uses massively parallel data to analyze typological variation in how languages express the semantic space of English $when$, whose scope encompasses that of Early Slavic participle constructions and $jegda$-clauses. Probabilistic semantic maps are generated and statistical methods (including Kriging, Gaussian Mixture Modelling, precision and recall analysis) are used to induce cross-linguistically salient dimensions from the parallel corpus and to study conceptual variation within the semantic space of the hypothetical concept WHEN.</description>

      <title>REASONS: A benchmark for REtrieval and Automated citationS Of scieNtific Sentences using Public and Proprietary LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic citation generation for sentences in a document or report is paramount for intelligence analysts, cybersecurity, news agencies, and education personnel. In this research, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) are capable of generating references based on two forms of sentence queries: (a) Direct Queries, LLMs are asked to provide author names of the given research article, and (b) Indirect Queries, LLMs are asked to provide the title of a mentioned article when given a sentence from a different article. To demonstrate where LLM stands in this task, we introduce a large dataset called REASONS comprising abstracts of the 12 most popular domains of scientific research on arXiv. From around 20K research articles, we make the following deductions on public and proprietary LLMs: (a) State-of-the-art, often called anthropomorphic GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, suffers from high pass percentage (PP) to minimize the hallucination rate (HR). When tested with Perplexity.ai (7B), they unexpectedly made more errors; (b) Augmenting relevant metadata lowered the PP and gave the lowest HR; (c) Advance retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using Mistral demonstrates consistent and robust citation support on indirect queries and matched performance to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. The HR across all domains and models decreased by an average of 41.93% and the PP was reduced to 0% in most cases. In terms of generation quality, the average F1 Score and BLEU were 68.09% and 57.51%, respectively; (d) Testing with adversarial samples showed that LLMs, including the Advance RAG Mistral, struggle to understand context, but the extent of this issue was small in Mistral and GPT-4-Preview. Our study con tributes valuable insights into the reliability of RAG for automated citation generation tasks.</description>

      <title>Distillation Matters: Empowering Sequential Recommenders to Match the Performance of Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Owing to their powerful semantic reasoning capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been effectively utilized as recommenders, achieving impressive performance. However, the high inference latency of LLMs significantly restricts their practical deployment. To address this issue, this work investigates knowledge distillation from cumbersome LLM-based recommendation models to lightweight conventional sequential models. It encounters three challenges: 1) the teacher's knowledge may not always be reliable; 2) the capacity gap between the teacher and student makes it difficult for the student to assimilate the teacher's knowledge; 3) divergence in semantic space poses a challenge to distill the knowledge from embeddings. To tackle these challenges, this work proposes a novel distillation strategy, DLLM2Rec, specifically tailored for knowledge distillation from LLM-based recommendation models to conventional sequential models. DLLM2Rec comprises: 1) Importance-aware ranking distillation, which filters reliable and student-friendly knowledge by weighting instances according to teacher confidence and student-teacher consistency; 2) Collaborative embedding distillation integrates knowledge from teacher embeddings with collaborative signals mined from the data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DLLM2Rec, boosting three typical sequential models with an average improvement of 47.97%, even enabling them to surpass LLM-based recommenders in some cases.</description>

      <title>Recommenadation aided Caching using Combinatorial Multi-armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study content caching with recommendations in a wireless network where the users are connected through a base station equipped with a finite-capacity cache. We assume a fixed set of contents with unknown user preferences and content popularities. We can recommend a subset of the contents to the users which encourages the users to request these contents. Recommendation can thus be used to increase cache hits. We formulate the cache hit optimization problem as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB). We propose a UCB-based algorithm to decide which contents to cache and recommend. We provide an upper bound on the regret of our algorithm. We numerically demonstrate the performance of our algorithm and compare it to state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>
