      <title>Group Probability Decoding of Turbo Product Codes over Higher-Order Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary turbo product codes (TPCs) are powerful error-correcting codes constructed from short component codes. Traditionally, turbo product decoding passes log likelihood ratios (LLRs) between the component decoders, inherently losing information when bit correlation exists. Such correlation can arise exogenously from sources like intersymbol interference and endogenously during component code decoding. To preserve these correlations and improve performance, we propose turbo product decoding based on group probabilities. We theoretically predict mutual information and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gains of group over bit-probability decoding. To translate these theoretical insights to practice, we revisit non-binary TPCs that naturally support group-probability decoding. We show that any component list decoder that takes group probabilities as input and outputs block-wise soft-output can partially preserve bit correlation, which we demonstrate with symbol-level ORBGRAND combined with soft-output GRAND (SOGRAND). Our results demonstrate that group-probability-based turbo product decoding achieves SNR gains of up to 0.3 dB for endogenous correlation and 0.7 dB for exogenous correlation, compared to bit-probability decoding.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Empowered In-Vehicular Channel Modeling and Wireless Planning in the Terahertz Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology has emerged as a key enabler of intelligent transportation systems, while the Terahertz (THz) band offers abundant spectrum resources to support ultra-high-speed and low-latency V2X communications. This paper investigates the in-vehicle wireless channel in the 300~GHz band. First, channel measurement based on vector-network-analyzer (VNA) is conducted under typical V2X scenarios, including with/without human, and window-on/off cases. Then, a digital twin (DT) of the vehicle is constructed from high-resolution point cloud data and a measurement-based material property database. The DT is integrated into an open-source ray-tracing (RT) simulator, Sionna, to model multipath propagation. The DT-empowered simulation results are analyzed and validated with the measurement data, showing strong agreement and validating the feasibility. Finally, a hybrid ray-tracing-statistic channel model is established, combining the RT results and measurement data. Leveraging the validated model, further wireless planning is carried out, including signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) analysis, coverage probability evaluation, and optimal transmitter (Tx) placement. These findings provide valuable insights for the design and deployment of future THz in-vehicle communication systems.</description>

      <title>Variable-Length Joint Source-Channel Coding for Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a key challenge faced by joint source-channel coding (JSCC) in digital semantic communication (SemCom): the incompatibility between existing JSCC schemes that yield continuous encoded representations and digital systems that employ discrete variable-length codewords. It further results in feasibility issues in achieving physical bit-level rate control via such JSCC approaches for efficient semantic transmission. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end coding (E2EC) framework to tackle it. The semantic coding problem is formed by extending the information bottleneck (IB) theory over noisy channels, which is a tradeoff between bit-level communication rate and semantic distortion. With a structural decomposition of encoding to handle code length and content respectively, we can construct an end-to-end trainable encoder that supports the direct compression of a data source into a finite codebook. To optimize our E2EC across non-differentiable operations, e.g., sampling, we use the powerful policy gradient to support gradient-based updates. Experimental results illustrate that E2EC achieves high inference quality with low bit rates, outperforming representative baselines compatible with digital SemCom systems.</description>

      <title>Symbol Detection in Multi-channel Multi-tag Ambient Backscatter Communication Under IQ Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) offers low-cost and low-power connectivity for Internet of Things (IoT), where a backscatter tag (BT) modulates incident signals transmitted by an ambient radio frequency (RF) source and reflects them to its associated AmBC receiver. In multi-channel multi-tag AmBC, one of major challenges from the aspect of symbol detection is the image channel crosstalk, which is induced by the inevitable in-phase/quadrature (IQ) imbalance. To address this issue, in this paper, we study symbol detection in multi-channel multi-tag AmBC under IQ imbalance. Considering the differential encoding scheme at the BTs, we propose a novel symbol detection model that incorporates IQ imbalance parameters, the presence or absence of both the incident signal and the backscattered signal of the image channel. On this basis, considering an energy difference detector at the AmBC receiver, we derive the closed-form expressions for the bit error rate (BER) as well as the near-optimal detection threshold to minimize BER. However, calculating the near-optimal detection threshold requires prior information, such as the IQ imbalance parameters, the presence probability of the incident signal of the image channel and the backscattered signal of the image channel, the signal power of the ambient RF source, and the noise power, which are typically unknown to the AmBC receiver in practice. To eliminate the need for the prior information, we propose a threshold estimation method using the received samples. Numerical results indicate that under IQ imbalance, directly using the existing method leads to a significant degradation in BER performance. However, this degradation can be effectively mitigated by our derived detection threshold.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Downlink-Uplink Spectrum Sharing between Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 6G networks are expected to integrate low Earth orbit satellites to ensure global connectivity by extending coverage to underserved and remote regions. However, the deployment of dense mega-constellations introduces severe interference among satellites operating over shared frequency bands. This is, in part, due to the limited flexibility of conventional frequency division duplex (FDD) systems, where fixed bands for downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) transmissions are employed. In this work, we propose dynamic re-assignment of FDD bands for improved interference management in dense deployments and evaluate the performance gain of this approach. To this end, we formulate a joint optimization problem that incorporates dynamic band assignment, user scheduling, and power allocation in both directions. This non-convex mixed integer problem is solved using a combination of equivalence transforms, alternating optimization, and state-of-the-art industrial-grade mixed integer solvers. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach of dynamic FDD band assignment significantly enhances system performance over conventional FDD, achieving up to 94\% improvement in throughput in dense deployments.</description>

      <title>Analysis of SINR Coverage in LEO Satellite Networks through Spatial Network Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new analytical framework, developed based on the spatial network calculus, for performance assessment of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks. Specifically, we model the satellites' spatial positions as a strong ball-regulated point process on the sphere. Under this model, proximal points in space exhibit a locally repulsive property, reflecting the fact that intersatellite links are protected by a safety distance and would not be arbitrarily close. Subsequently, we derive analytical lower bounds on the conditional coverage probabilities under Nakagami-$m$ and Rayleigh fading, respectively. These expressions have a low computational complexity, enabling efficient numerical evaluations. We validate the effectiveness of our theoretical model by contrasting the coverage probability obtained from our analysis with that estimated from a Starlink constellation. The results show that our analysis provides a tight lower bound on the actual value and, surprisingly, matches the empirical simulations almost perfectly with a 1 dB shift. This demonstrates our framework as an appropriate theoretical model for LEO satellite networks.</description>

      <title>Robust Dynamic Coded Distributed Storage with Partially Storage Constrained Servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of Robust Dynamic Coded Distributed Storage (RDCDS) with partially storage constrained servers where the goal is to enable robust (resilient to server dropouts) and efficient (as measured by the communication costs) read and update operations, subject to the constraint that the storage at $S$ out of $N$ servers is limited by $1/K_c$ the size of the message. Building upon previously established converse arguments and achievability schemes by Jia et al., in this work we develop a set of new converse arguments and coding designs that enable us to completely characterize the fundamental limits of RDCDS with partially storage constrained servers, i.e., the minimum number of available servers for feasible update operation and the minimum communication costs for read and update operations across various server dropout scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized Hamming weights (GHWs) of a linear code C extend the concept of minimum distance, which is the minimum cardinality of the support of all one-dimensional subspaces of C, to the minimum cardinality of the support of all r-dimensional subspaces of the code. In this work, we introduce Cartesian square-free codes, which are linear codes generated by evaluating square-free monomials over a Cartesian set. We use commutative algebraic tools, specifically the footprint bound, to provide explicit formulas for some of the GHWs of this family of codes, and we show how we can translate these results to evaluation codes over the projective space.</description>

      <title>A General Ziv-Zakai Bound for DoA Estimation in MIMO Radar Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper derives a Ziv-Zakai Bound (ZZB) on the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) estimation in co-located Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) radar systems and provides closed-form expressions that hold for multi-target scenarios. Unlike classical results that address single-input multiple-output systems with complex Gaussian input signals, the developed ZZB in this paper explicitly accounts for a general input covariance matrix, target radar cross-section statistics and multiple snapshot effects, and admits a compact expression that reveals the dependence of the MSE on the number of transmit antennas, number of targets, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and the transmit covariance matrix. Numerical simulations validate the tightness of the ZZB in the a priori dominated region and show how the increase of the number of transmit antennas compresses the threshold SNR for the transition to the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) while the variation of the number of targets shifts the bound's behavior across SNR regimes. The analytical results and numerical simulations demonstrate that the ZZB is tighter than the CRB, particularly in the low SNR regime.</description>

      <title>Feature Importance Guided Random Forest Learning with Simulated Annealing Based Hyperparameter Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for enhancing Random Forest classifiers by integrating probabilistic feature sampling and hyperparameter tuning via Simulated Annealing. The proposed framework exhibits substantial advancements in predictive accuracy and generalization, adeptly tackling the multifaceted challenges of robust classification across diverse domains, including credit risk evaluation, anomaly detection in IoT ecosystems, early-stage medical diagnostics, and high-dimensional biological data analysis. To overcome the limitations of conventional Random Forests, we present an approach that places stronger emphasis on capturing the most relevant signals from data while enabling adaptive hyperparameter configuration. The model is guided towards features that contribute more meaningfully to classification and optimizing this with dynamic parameter tuning. The results demonstrate consistent accuracy improvements and meaningful insights into feature relevance, showcasing the efficacy of combining importance aware sampling and metaheuristic optimization.</description>

Abstract: Consider a projective variety $X \subset \mathbb{P}^n$ (over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero), together with a (reduced) simple normal crossings divisor $E \subset \mathbb{P}^n$, where the degrees of both $X$ and $E$ are at most $d$. We show there is a pair $(n',d')$ which can be explicitly computed in terms of $(n,d)$, such that $(X,E)$ has a log resolution of singularities $(X',E')$, where $(X',E')$ can be embedded in $\mathbb{P}^{n'}$ and both $X'$ and $E'$ have degrees at most $d'$ in $\mathbb{P}^{n'}$.</description>

      <title>Generative Decoding of Compressed CSI for MIMO Precoding Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive MIMO systems can enhance spectral and energy efficiency, but they require accurate channel state information (CSI), which becomes costly as the number of antennas increases. While machine learning (ML) autoencoders show promise for CSI reconstruction and reducing feedback overhead, they introduce new challenges with standardization, interoperability, and backward compatibility. Also, the significant data collection needed for training makes real-world deployment difficult. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose an ML-based, decoder-only solution for compressed CSI. Our approach uses a standardized encoder for CSI compression on the user side and a site-specific generative decoder at the base station to refine the compressed CSI using environmental knowledge. We introduce two training schemes for the generative decoder: An end-to-end method and a two-stage method, both utilizing a goal-oriented loss function. Furthermore, we reduce the data collection overhead by using a site-specific digital twin to generate synthetic CSI data for training. Our simulations highlight the effectiveness of this solution across various feedback overhead regimes.</description>

      <title>DMA-aided MU-MISO Systems for Power Splitting SWIPT via Lorentzian-Constrained Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an optimal power splitting and beamforming design for co-located simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) users in Dynamic Metasurface Antenna (DMA)-aided multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems. The objective is to minimize transmit power while meeting users signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and energy harvesting (EH) requirements. The problem is solved via an alternating optimization framework based on semidefinite programming (SDP), where metasurface tunability follows Lorentzian-constrained holography (LCH). In contrast to traditional beamforming architectures, DMA-assisted architectures reduce the need for RF chains and phase shifters but require optimization under the Lorentzian constraint limiting the amplitude and phase optimizations. Hence, the proposed method integrates several LCH schemes, including the recently proposed adaptive-radius LCH (ARLCH), and evaluates nonlinear EH models and circuit noise effects. Simulation results show that the proposed design significantly reduces transmit power compared with baseline methods, highlighting the efficiency of ARLCH and optimal power splitting in DMA-assisted SWIPT systems.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Meets 6G and Beyond: Diffusion Models for Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communications mark a paradigm shift from bit-accurate transmission toward meaning-centric communication, essential as wireless systems approach theoretical capacity limits. The emergence of generative AI has catalyzed generative semantic communications, where receivers reconstruct content from minimal semantic cues by leveraging learned priors. Among generative approaches, diffusion models stand out for their superior generation quality, stable training dynamics, and rigorous theoretical foundations. However, the field currently lacks systematic guidance connecting diffusion techniques to communication system design, forcing researchers to navigate disparate literatures. This article provides the first comprehensive tutorial on diffusion models for generative semantic communications. We present score-based diffusion foundations and systematically review three technical pillars: conditional diffusion for controllable generation, efficient diffusion for accelerated inference, and generalized diffusion for cross-domain adaptation. In addition, we introduce an inverse problem perspective that reformulates semantic decoding as posterior inference, bridging semantic communications with computational imaging. Through analysis of human-centric, machine-centric, and agent-centric scenarios, we illustrate how diffusion models enable extreme compression while maintaining semantic fidelity and robustness. By bridging generative AI innovations with communication system design, this article aims to establish diffusion models as foundational components of next-generation wireless networks and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel Mutual Information (MI) estimator that fundamentally reframes the discriminative approach. Instead of training a classifier to discriminate between joint and marginal distributions, we learn a normalizing flow that transforms one into the other. This technique produces a computationally efficient and precise MI estimate that scales well to high dimensions and across a wide range of ground-truth MI values.</description>

      <title>Nyquist Signaling Modulation (NSM): An FTN-Inspired Paradigm Shift in Modulation Design for 6G and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nyquist Signaling Modulations (NSMs) are a new signaling paradigm inspired by faster-than-Nyquist principles but based on a distinct approach that enables controlled inter-symbol interference through carefully designed finite-impulse-response filters. NSMs can operate in any number of dimensions, including mixed-dimensional configurations, offering wide flexibility in filter design, optional energy balancing, and preservation of the 2-ASK minimum squared Euclidean distance (MSED). Both real and rational tapped filters are investigated, and closed-form expressions are derived for the optimal real-tap filters in the one-dimensional case (MS-PRS), providing analytical insight and strong agreement with simulated bit-error behavior across wide SNR ranges. The paradigm is conceptually expanded through an analog Low-Density Generator Matrix (LDGM) formulation, which broadens the NSM family and unifies modulation and coding within a single, structurally coherent framework. When combined with LDPC coding, it enables efficient and naturally synergistic interaction between the analog modulation and the digital LDPC code. Alternatively, when analog LDGM is employed for both source coding and modulation, a simple and harmonious joint source-channel-modulation structure emerges. In both configurations, the constituent blocks exhibit dual graph-based architectures suited to message passing, achieving high flexibility and complexity-efficient operation. Collectively, these results establish promising physical-layer directions for future 6G communication systems.</description>

      <title>On the Performance of Low-complexity Decoders of LDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19266v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient decoding is crucial to high-throughput and power-sensitive wireless communication scenarios. A theoretical analysis of the performance-complexity tradeoff toward low-complexity decoding is required for a better understanding of the fundamental limits in the above-mentioned scenarios. This study aims to explore the performance of LDPC codes under belief propagation (BP) decoding with complexity constraints. In other words, for a small number of iterations, we present a closed-form lower bound on the bit error rate (BER) of LDPC codes as a function of complexity. Specifically, for the regular LDPC code ensembles, the dominant term in the order of the lower bound we provide matches that of the upper bound given by Lentmaier. Furthermore, for irregular LDPC code ensembles, in addition to adopting the approach used for regular codes, we also propose a method to iteratively obtain the lower bound on the average BER.</description>

      <title>Testing Tensor Products of Algebraic Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in locally testable codes and quantum LDPCs based on robust testability of tensor product codes, we explore the local testability of tensor products of (an abstraction of) algebraic geometry codes. Such codes are parameterized by, in addition to standard parameters such as block length $n$ and dimension $k$, their genus $g$. We show that the tensor product of two algebraic geometry codes is robustly locally testable provided $n = \Omega((k+g)^2)$. Apart from Reed-Solomon codes, this seems to be the first explicit family of two-wise tensor codes of high dual distance that is robustly locally testable by the natural test that measures the expected distance of a random row/column from the underlying code.</description>

      <title>Weighted Sum Rate Optimization for Movable Antenna Enabled Near-Field ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been recognized as one of the key technologies capable of simultaneously improving communication and sensing services in future wireless networks. Moreover, the introduction of recently developed movable antennas (MAs) has the potential to further increase the performance gains of ISAC systems. Achieving these gains can pose a significant challenge for MA-enabled ISAC systems operating in the near-field due to the corresponding spherical wave propagation. Motivated by this, in this paper we maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) for communication users while maintaining a minimal sensing requirement in an MA-enabled near-field ISAC system. To achieve this goal, we propose an algorithm that optimizes the sensing receive combiner, the communication precoding matrices, the sensing transmit beamformer and the positions of the users' MAs in an alternating manner. Simulation results show that using MAs in near-field ISAC systems provides a substantial performance advantage compared to near-field ISAC systems with only fixed antennas. Additionally, we demonstrate that the highest WSR is obtained when larger weights are allocated to the users placed closer to the BS, and that the sensing performance is significantly more affected by the minimum sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold compared to the communication performance.</description>

      <title>L2T-Hyena: Enhancing State-Space Models with an Adaptive Learn-to-Teach Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to computationally intensive architectures like Transformers, particularly for sequence modeling. However, a fundamental challenge in their training is the reliance on static loss functions, which may not be optimal across all learning stages. To address this issue, in this paper a hybrid model integrating the Hyena architecture with a Dynamic Loss Network (DLN) is proposed which is guided by a Learn-to-Teach (L2T) approach (L2T-DLN). In this framework, the Hyena model is a student, and its loss function is optimized adaptively. A teacher model, leveraging a memory of the student's past performance, guides the DLN in dynamically balancing the primary cross-entropy loss and a regularization term. Experiments on the Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset show that our approach significantly improves language modeling performance. Our proposed model achieved a validation Perplexity of 102.6, a notable improvement over the 110.4 achieved by a baseline Hyena model using a static loss function. This research indicates that combining SSMs with adaptive loss function markedly enhances the quality and efficiency of deep learning models for sequential data, showing potential for applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP), time-series analysis, and biological signal processing.</description>

      <title>Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Capacity-Achieving Private Information Retrieval with Adversarial Servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Private information retrieval (PIR) is a mechanism for efficiently downloading messages while keeping the index of the desired message secret from the servers. PIR schemes have been extended to various scenarios with adversarial servers: PIR schemes where some servers are unresponsive or return noisy responses are called robust PIR and Byzantine PIR, respectively; PIR schemes where some servers collude to reveal the index are called colluding PIR. The information-theoretic upper bound on the download efficiency of these PIR schemes has been proved in previous studies. However, systematic ways to construct PIR schemes that achieve the upper bound are not known. In order to construct a capacity-achieving PIR schemes systematically, it is necessary to clarify the conditions that the queries should satisfy. This paper proves the necessary and sufficient conditions for capacity-achieving PIR schemes.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed deep learning and compressive collocation for high-dimensional diffusion-reaction equations: practical existence theory and numerics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01539v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On the forefront of scientific computing, Deep Learning (DL), i.e., machine learning with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), has emerged a powerful new tool for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). It has been observed that DNNs are particularly well suited to weakening the effect of the curse of dimensionality, a term coined by Richard E. Bellman in the late `50s to describe challenges such as the exponential dependence of the sample complexity, i.e., the number of samples required to solve an approximation problem, on the dimension of the ambient space. However, although DNNs have been used to solve PDEs since the `90s, the literature underpinning their mathematical efficiency in terms of numerical analysis (i.e., stability, accuracy, and sample complexity), is only recently beginning to emerge. In this paper, we leverage recent advancements in function approximation using sparsity-based techniques and random sampling to develop and analyze an efficient high-dimensional PDE solver based on DL. We show, both theoretically and numerically, that it can compete with a novel stable and accurate compressive spectral collocation method for the solution of high-dimensional, steady-state diffusion-reaction equations with periodic boundary conditions. In particular, we demonstrate a new practical existence theorem, which establishes the existence of a class of trainable DNNs with suitable bounds on the network architecture and a sufficient condition on the sample complexity, with logarithmic or, at worst, linear scaling in dimension, such that the resulting networks stably and accurately approximate a diffusion-reaction PDE with high probability.</description>

      <title>GDNSQ: Gradual Differentiable Noise Scale Quantization for Low-bit Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantized neural networks can be viewed as a chain of noisy channels, where rounding in each layer reduces capacity as bit-width shrinks; the floating-point (FP) checkpoint sets the maximum input rate. We track capacity dynamics as the average bit-width decreases and identify resulting quantization bottlenecks by casting fine-tuning as a smooth, constrained optimization problem. Our approach employs a fully differentiable Straight-Through Estimator (STE) with learnable bit-width, noise scale and clamp bounds, and enforces a target bit-width via an exterior-point penalty; mild metric smoothing (via distillation) stabilizes training. Despite its simplicity, the method attains competitive accuracy down to the extreme W1A1 setting while retaining the efficiency of STE.</description>

      <title>Some theoretical improvements on the tightness of PAC-Bayes risk certificates for neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents four theoretical contributions that improve the usability of risk certificates for neural networks based on PAC-Bayes bounds. First, two bounds on the KL divergence between Bernoulli distributions enable the derivation of the tightest explicit bounds on the true risk of classifiers across different ranges of empirical risk. The paper next focuses on the formalization of an efficient methodology based on implicit differentiation that enables the introduction of the optimization of PAC-Bayesian risk certificates inside the loss/objective function used to fit the network/model. The last contribution is a method to optimize bounds on non-differentiable objectives such as the 0-1 loss. These theoretical contributions are complemented with an empirical evaluation on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. In fact, this paper presents the first non-vacuous generalization bounds on CIFAR-10 for neural networks. Code to reproduce all experiments is available at github.com/Diegogpcm/pacbayesgradients.</description>

      <title>Short Blocks, Fast Sensing: Finite Blocklength Tradeoffs in RIS-Assisted ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a cornerstone for future sixth-generation (6G) networks, enabling simultaneous connectivity and environmental awareness. However, practical realization faces significant challenges, including residual self-interference (SI) in full-duplex systems and performance degradation of short-packet transmissions under finite blocklength (FBL) constraints. This work studies a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted full-duplex ISAC system serving multiple downlink users while tracking a moving target, explicitly accounting for SI and FBL effects in both communication and sensing. We formulate an optimization framework to minimize service adaptation gaps while ensuring sensing reliability, solved via alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. Numerical results show that short blocklengths enable fast adaptation but raise radar outage from fewer pulses and motion sensitivity. Longer blocklengths improve signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and reduce outages but allow motion to degrade sensing. A "sweet spot" arises where blocklength and beamformer allocation optimize throughput and sensing, seen as a local minimum in radar SINR variance. RIS-assisted optimization identifies this balance, achieving reliable communication and radar sensing jointly.</description>

      <title>Quantum Key Distribution via Charge Teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum key distribution (QKD) primitive based on charge teleportation: by Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) on an entangled many-body ground state, Alice's one-bit choice steers the sign of a local charge shift at Bob, which directly encodes the key bit. Relative to energy teleportation schemes, the charge signal is bit-symmetric, measured in a single basis, and markedly more robust to realistic noise and model imperfections. We instantiate the protocol on transverse-field Ising models, star-coupled and one-dimensional chain, obtain closed-form results for two qubits, and for larger systems confirm performance via exact diagonalization, circuit-level simulations, and a proof-of-principle hardware run. We quantify resilience to classical bit flips and local quantum noise, identifying regimes where sign integrity, and hence key correctness, is preserved. These results position charge teleportation as a practical, low-rate QKD primitive compatible with near-term platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classifier-guided diffusion models have emerged as a powerful approach for conditional image generation, but they suffer from overconfident predictions during early denoising steps, causing the guidance gradient to vanish. This paper introduces two complementary contributions to address this issue. First, we propose a differentiable calibration objective based on the Smooth Expected Calibration Error (Smooth ECE), which improves classifier calibration with minimal fine-tuning and yields measurable improvements in Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Second, we develop enhanced sampling guidance methods that operate on off-the-shelf classifiers without requiring retraining. These include tilted sampling with batch-level reweighting, adaptive entropy-regularized sampling to preserve diversity, and a novel f-divergence-based sampling strategy that strengthens class-consistent guidance while maintaining mode coverage. Experiments on ImageNet 128x128 demonstrate that our divergence-regularized guidance achieves an FID of 2.13 using a ResNet-101 classifier, improving upon existing classifier-guided diffusion methods while requiring no diffusion model retraining. The results show that principled calibration and divergence-aware sampling provide practical and effective improvements for classifier-guided diffusion.</description>
