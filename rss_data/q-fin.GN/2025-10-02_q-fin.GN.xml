      <title>Board Gender Diversity and Carbon Emissions Performance: Insights from Panel Regressions, Machine Learning and Explainable AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the European Union introducing gender quotas on corporate boards, this study investigates the impact of board gender diversity (BGD) on firms' carbon emission performance (CEP). Using panel regressions and advanced machine learning algorithms on data from European firms between 2016 and 2022, the analyses reveal a significant non-linear relationship. Specifically, CEP improves with BGD up to an optimal level of approximately 35 percent, beyond which further increases in BGD yield no additional improvement in CEP. A minimum threshold of 22 percent BGD is necessary for meaningful improvements in CEP. To assess the legitimacy of CEP outcomes, this study examines whether ESG controversies affect the relationship between BGD and CEP. The results show no significant effect, suggesting that the effect of BGD is driven by governance mechanisms rather than symbolic actions. Additionally, structural equation modelling (SEM) indicates that while environmental innovation contributes to CEP, it is not the mediating channel through which BGD promotes CEP. The results have implications for academics, businesses, and regulators.</description>

      <title>TaxSolver: A methodology to realize optimal income tax reform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Across the globe there are growing calls to streamline and improve ever more complex income tax codes. Executing reform has proven difficult. Even when the desired outcomes are clear, the tools to design fitting reforms are lacking. To remedy this, we developed \texttt{TaxSolver}: a methodology to help policymakers realize optimal tax reform. \texttt{TaxSolver} allows policymakers to focus solely on what they aim to achieve with a reform -- like redistributing wealth, incentivizing labor market participation or reducing complexity -- and the guarantees within which reform is acceptable -- like limited fluctuations in taxpayer incomes or shocks to overall tax revenue. Given these goals and fiscal guarantees, \texttt{TaxSolver} finds the optimal set of tax rules that satisfies all the criteria or shows that the set of demands are not mathematically feasible. We illustrate \texttt{TaxSolver} by reforming various simulated examples of tax codes, including some that reflect the complexity and size of a real-world tax system.</description>
