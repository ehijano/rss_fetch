      <title>Evaluating financial tail risk forecasts: Testing Equal Predictive Ability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides comprehensive simulation results on the finite sample properties of the Diebold-Mariano (DM) test by Diebold and Mariano (1995) and the model confidence set (MCS) testing procedure by Hansen et al. (2011) applied to the asymmetric loss functions specific to financial tail risk forecasts, such as Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES). We focus on statistical loss functions that are strictly consistent in the sense of Gneiting (2011a). We find that the tests show little power against models that underestimate the tail risk at the most extreme quantile levels, while the finite sample properties generally improve with the quantile level and the out-of-sample size. For the small quantile levels and out-of-sample sizes of up to two years, we observe heavily skewed test statistics and non-negligible type III errors, which implies that researchers should be cautious about using standard normal or bootstrapped critical values. We demonstrate both empirically and theoretically how these unfavorable finite sample results relate to the asymmetric loss functions and the time varying volatility inherent in financial return data.</description>

      <title>A Gibbs Sampler for Efficient Bayesian Inference in Sign-Identified SVARs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new algorithm for inference based on SVARs identified with sign restrictions. The key insight of our algorithm is to break apart from the accept-reject tradition associated with sign-identified SVARs. We show that embedding an elliptical slice sampling within a Gibbs sampler approach can deliver dramatic gains in speed and turn previously infeasible applications into feasible ones. We provide a tractable example to illustrate the power of the elliptical slice sampling applied to sign-identified SVARs. We demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithm by applying it to a well-known small-SVAR model of the oil market featuring a tight identified set as well as to large SVAR model with more than 100 sign restrictions.</description>

      <title>Difference-in-Differences with a Continuous Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.02637v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes difference-in-differences designs with a continuous treatment. We show that treatment effect on the treated-type parameters can be identified under a generalized parallel trends assumption that is similar to the binary treatment setup. However, interpreting differences in these parameters across different values of the treatment can be particularly challenging due to selection bias that is not ruled out by the parallel trends assumption. We discuss alternative, typically stronger, assumptions that alleviate these challenges. We also provide a variety of treatment effect decomposition results, highlighting that parameters associated with popular linear two-way fixed-effect (TWFE) specifications can be hard to interpret, \emph{even} when there are only two time periods. We introduce alternative estimation procedures that do not suffer from these drawbacks and show in an application that they can lead to different conclusions.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity analysis of the perturbed utility stochastic traffic equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel sensitivity analysis framework for the perturbed utility route choice (PURC) model and the accompanying stochastic traffic equilibrium model. We provide general results that determine the marginal change in link flows following a marginal change in link costs across the network in the cases of flow-independent and flow-dependent link costs. We derive analytical sensitivity expressions for the Jacobian of the individual optimal PURC flow and equilibrium link flows with respect to link cost parameters under mild differentiability assumptions. Numerical examples illustrate the robustness of our method, demonstrating its use for estimating equilibrium link flows after link cost shifts, identifying critical design parameters, and quantifying uncertainty in performance predictions. The findings have implications for network design, pricing strategies, and policy analysis in transportation planning and economics, providing a bridge between theoretical models and real-world applications.</description>
