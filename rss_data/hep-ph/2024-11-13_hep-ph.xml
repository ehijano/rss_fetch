      <title>Searching for a squark LSP of the first two families at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse relevant signals expected at the LHC for a squark of the first two families as the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). The discussion is established in the framework of the $\mu\nu$SSM, where the presence of $R$-parity violating couplings involving right-handed neutrinos solves simultaneously the $\mu$-problem and the accommodation of neutrino masses and mixing angles. The squarks are pair produced and decay dominantly to a neutrino and a quark. They also have two sub-dominant three body decays to quark, Higgs and neutrino/charged lepton. The decays can be prompt or displaced, depending on the regions of the parameter space of the model. We focus the analyses on right up-down-type squarks and left up-type squarks, since left down-type squarks cannot be the LSP because of D-term contributions. We compare the predictions of these scenarios with ATLAS and CMS searches for prompt and long-lived particles. To analyse the parameter space we sample the $\mu\nu$SSM for a squark LSP, paying special attention to reproduce the current experimental data on neutrino and Higgs physics, as well as flavour observables. Because of the contribution of squark-squark final states to the production cross section, the results depend on the squark family. In particular, for a right strange squark LSP, the lower limit on the mass is $1646$ GeV, corresponding to an upper limit on the decay length of $54.7$ mm, and for a right (left) scharm LSP, the limits are $1625$ ($1357$) GeV and $13.4$ ($1.9$) mm. However, the first family of squarks as LSP turns out to be excluded, unless the gluino is heavier than $7$ TeV, which produces a limit on the squark mass of $1800$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Right-Handed Neutrino Masses from the Electroweak Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy right-handed neutrinos are highly motivated due to their connection with the origin of neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism. If the right-handed neutrino Majorana mass is at or below the weak scale, direct experimental discovery of these states is possible in laboratory experiments. However, there is no a priori basis to expect right-handed neutrinos to be so light since the Majorana mass is a technically natural parameter and could comfortably reside at any scale, including at scales far above the weak scale. Here we explore the possibility that the right-handed neutrino Majorana mass originates from electroweak symmetry breaking. Working within an effective theory with two Higgs doublets, nonzero lepton number is assigned to the bilinear operator built from the two Higgs fields, which is then coupled to the right-handed neutrino mass operator. In tandem with the neutrino Yukawa coupling, following electroweak symmetry breaking a seesaw mechanism operates, generating the light SM neutrino masses along with right-handed neutrinos with masses below the electroweak scale. This scenario leads to novel phenomenology in the Higgs sector, which may be probed at the LHC and at future colliders. There are also interesting prospects for neutrinoless double beta decay and lepton flavor violation. We also explore some theoretical aspects of the scenario, including the technical naturalness of the effective field theory and ultraviolet completions of the right-handed neutrino Majorana mass.</description>

      <title>Feynman Rules in the Two-Higgs Doublet Model Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a complete set of Feynman rules in the general two-Higgs doublet model effective field theory where the effects of additional new physics are parametrized by operators up to mass dimension-six. We calculate the physical Higgs spectrum, contributions to the couplings and masses of electroweak gauge bosons and fermions, and all contact interactions arising from dimension-six operators. We also present results in specific limits and types, which include the $CP$-conserving limit, alignment limit, and the four types of two-Higgs doublet models: type-I, -II, -X, and -Y. We discuss the differences between the two-Higgs doublet model effective field theory and the renormalizable two-Higgs doublet model or the standard model effective field theory. We create a FeynRules model package for calculating all Feynman rules in the general effective field theory and its specific limits and types.</description>

      <title>New Physics Hiding at the Ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Is field space infinite? If not, it either loops back on itself or ends altogether. Periodic boundary conditions are of course familiar, but field space endpoints--which appear in real-world systems--are far less explored. In this paper we argue that boundaries in field space are generic, radiatively stable structures that allow for new physics at very low scales not ruled out by experiment. Such boundaries are delocalized in field space from the vacuum, so they can only be accessed by coherent fields or high multiplicity processes, both of which are weakly constrained observationally. Low multiplicity interactions do not detect the boundary and instead perceive a "mirage cutoff" that is parametrically higher than the true cutoff of the theory. Hence, field space boundaries are deformations of the standard model that are Lorentz invariant, local, unitary at low energies, and experimentally unconstrained. We comment on the possibility of field space boundaries on the long-range force carriers and the Higgs, as well as possible implications for the hierarchy problem.</description>

      <title>Subtraction of the $t\bar{t}$ contribution in $tW\bar{b}$ production at the one-loop level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $tW\bar{b}$ production contributes to the real corrections to the $tW$ cross section. It would interfere with the top quark pair production, causing difficulties in a clear definition of the $tW{\bar b}$ events. The subtraction of the $t\bar{t}$ contributions has been performed in the diagram removal or diagram subtraction schemes for the tree-level processes. However, these schemes rely on the ability to identify the double resonant diagrams and thus can not be extended to loop diagrams. We propose a new scheme to subtract the $t\bar{t}$ contributions by power expansion of the squared amplitude in the resonant region. In order to cancel the infra-red divergences of the loop amplitudes, a widely used method is to introduce the dipole counter-terms, an ingredient in calculations of the full next-to-leading order QCD corrections. In our scheme, these counter-terms are also power-expanded. As a proof of principle, we calculate the one-loop correction to the $d\bar{d}\to \bar{b}Wt$ process, and present the invariant mass distribution of the $W\bar{b}$ system.</description>

      <title>Analytic decay width of the Higgs boson to massive bottom quarks at order $\alpha_s^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Higgs boson decay into bottom quarks is the dominant decay channel contributing to its total decay width, which can be used to measure the bottom quark Yukawa coupling and mass. This decay width has been computed up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^4)$ for the process induced by the bottom quark Yukawa coupling, assuming massless final states, and the corresponding corrections beyond $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$ are found to be less than $0.2\%$. We present an analytical result for the decay into massive bottom quarks at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ that includes the contribution from the top quark Yukawa coupling induced process. We have made use of the optical theorem, canonical differential equations and the regular basis in the calculation and expressed the result in terms of multiple polylogarithms and elliptic functions. We propose a systematic and unified procedure to derive the $\epsilon$-factorized differential equation for the three-loop kite integral family, which includes the three-loop banana integrals as a sub-sector. We find that the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ corrections increase the decay width, relative to the result up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$, by $1\%$ due to the large logarithms $\log^i (m_H^2/m_b^2)$ with $ 1\le i \le 4 $ in the small bottom quark mass limit. The coefficient of the double logarithms is proportional to $C_A-C_F$, which is the typical color structure in the resummation of soft quark contributions at subleading power.</description>

      <title>Constraining Dark Matter Models with a Light Mediator from CDEX-10 Experiment at China Jinping Underground Laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for nuclear recoil signals of dark matter models with a light mediator using data taken from a p-type point-contact germanium detector of the CDEX-10 experiment at the China Jinping Underground Laboratory. The 90% confidence level upper limits on the DM-nucleon interaction cross section from 205.4 kg-day exposure data are derived, excluding new parameter space in 2~5 GeV DM mass when the mediator mass is comparable to or lighter than the typical momentum transfer. We further interpret our results to constrain a specific self-interacting dark matter model with a light mediator coupling to the photon through kinetic mixing, and set experimental limits on the model parameter region favored by astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Isospin breaking corrections in $2\pi$ production in tau decays and $e^+e^-$ annihilation: consequences for the muon $g-2$ and CVC tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the isospin-breaking corrections relating the $e^+e^-$ hadronic cross-section and the tau decay spectral function, focusing on the di-pion channel, that gives the dominant contribution to the hadronic vacuum polarization piece of the muon $g-2$. We test different types of electromagnetic and weak form factors and show that both, the Gounaris-Sakurai and a dispersive-based approach, describe accurately $\tau$ lepton and $e^+e^-$ data (less when KLOE measurements are included in the fits) and comply reasonably well with analyticity constraints. From these results we obtain the isospin-breaking contribution to the conserved vector current (CVC) prediction of the ${\rm BR}(\tau \to \pi\pi\nu_{\tau})$ and to the $2\pi$ hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon $g-2$, in agreement with previous determinations and with similar precision. Our results abound in the convenience of using tau data-based results in the updated data-driven prediction of the muon $g-2$ in the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Wormhole-Induced ALP Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-perturbative gravitational effects induce explicit global symmetry breaking terms within axion models. These exponentially suppressed terms in the potential give a mass contribution to the axion-like particles (ALPs). In this work we investigate this scenario with a scalar field charged under a global $U(1)$ symmetry and having a non-minimal coupling to gravity. Given the exponential dependence, the ALP can retain a mass spanning a wide range, which can act as a dark matter component. We specify pre-inflationary and post-inflationary production mechanisms of these ALPs, with the former from the misalignment mechanism and the latter from both the misalignment and cosmic-string decay. We identify the allowed parameter ranges that explain the dark matter abundance for both a general inflation case and a case where the radial mode scalar drives inflation, each in metric and Palatini formalisms. We show that the ALP can be the dominant component of the dark matter in a wide range of its mass, $m_{a} \in [10^{-21}~\mathrm{eV},\, \mathrm{TeV}]$, depending on the inflationary scenario and the $U(1)$ breaking scale. These results indicate that ALPs can be responsible for our dark matter abundance within a setup purely from non-perturbative gravitational effects.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity Study of Supernova Neutrinos for Mass Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernovae represent some of the most energetically explosive events in the universe, with a substantial fraction of their released gravitational energy carried away by neutrinos. This study evaluates the sensitivity of three next-generation neutrino detectors which are Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K), and the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) to supernova neutrinos, specifically focusing on their ability to discern between normal and inverted mass hierarchies. We utilize three different flux models: Bollig, Tamborra and Nakazato, employing the SNEWPY software to simulate the expected neutrino fluxes from core-collapse supernovae. These models highlight the variability in the predictions due to different progenitors and simulation methods. By analyzing the event rates across various interaction channels and implementing the adiabatic Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) effect on the neutrino flux, we have calculated the expected detection rates for each detector. Our results indicate that sensitivities range from ${\sim}3\sigma$ to ${\sim}9\sigma$ for DUNE, ${\sim}4\sigma$ to ${\sim}16\sigma$ for Hyper-K and ${\sim}1.7\sigma$ to ${\sim}6.7\sigma$ for JUNO depending on distance and flux model, with sensitivity diminishing significantly at larger distances. This work underscores the potential of future neutrino observatories to enhance our understanding of fundamental physics through the study of supernova neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal Dark Matter in $U(1)_{B-L}$ Extension of Inert Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an extension of the Inert Doublet Model (IDM) that explains both neutrino masses and dark matter (DM) in the intermediate-mass range by incorporating a $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry. This additional symmetry enables the inclusion of right-handed neutrinos, providing a natural mechanism for neutrino mass generation. While the CP-even component of the inert doublet can serve as a DM candidate, its thermal relic abundance is insufficient to match the observed DM density. To address this, we introduce a non-thermal production mechanism, where a heavy scalar associated with the $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry decays into the inert doublet scalar, yielding a viable relic abundance at low reheating temperatures. We also examine both direct and indirect detection prospects for this DM candidate and assess the model against current experimental constraints.</description>

Abstract: Infrared singularities in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) are captured by the Soft function, which can be calculated efficiently using Feynman diagrams known as webs. The starting point for calculating Soft function using webs is to compute the web mixing matrices using a well known replica trick algorithm. We present a package implemented in Mathematica to calculate these mixing matrices. Along with the package, we provide several state-of-the art computations.</description>

      <title>NLO QCD effects on angular observables in single Higgs production at electron-proton collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Properties of the Higgs boson ($H$) at current and future particle colliders are crucial to explore new physics beyond the standard model. In particular, experimental and theoretical outlooks at future colliders drive interest in Higgs to gauge boson couplings. Single Higgs production via vector-boson fusion allows probing Higgs couplings with massive vector bosons ($V = W, Z$). We consider electron-proton (eP) collider to study these couplings due to the low background. In a recent study, we considered the most general anomalous Higgs-vector boson ($HVV$) couplings and explored the potential of eP collider in constraining the parameters of $HVV$ couplings. Our results were based on leading order predictions in perturbation theory. We include further Next to Leading Order (NLO) corrections of Quantum Chromodynamic (QCD) in Standard Model signal to make precise predictions. In this talk, I will present the effect of NLO QCD corrections on the standard model and anomalous $HVV$ couplings.</description>

      <title>Centrality definition in e+A collisions at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the feasibility of defining centrality in electron-ion collisions at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) by examining the correlation between the impact parameter and several observables, including total energy, total transverse momentum, and total number of particles. Using the BeAGLE Monte Carlo generator, we simulate e+Au and e+Ru collisions at different energies and analyze the correlation between the impact parameter and these observables across different kinematic regions. Our findings indicate that the correlation is weak in the central rapidity region but becomes stronger in the forward and far-forward rapidity regions. However, the correlation is not sufficiently robust to allow for precise centrality determination. We conclude that defining centrality in electron-ion collisions is more challenging than in ion-ion collisions, necessitating further studies to develop a robust centrality definition for the EIC.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By introducing ansatz and using a PDF at the $N^3LO$ approximation in this paper, we have studied the structure of the nucleons in generalized parton distributions (GPDs). For this purpose, the form factors and the electric radius of nucleons, as well as the quark's form factors, are calculated in this paper. These calculations give important new information about the nucleons and the distribution of partons within them. The results are analyzed, and to validate them, the abstract emphasizes the importance of comparing the results with existing research and experimental data. By varying the free appropriate parameters of the new ansatz, the study seeks to optimize the model, ensure its suitability for accurately describing the nucleon's internal structure, and provide valuable insights about the distribution of partons.</description>

      <title>New Physics effects with right-handed neutrinos in semileptonic decay $B_c^+ \to B_s \mu^+ \nu_{\mu}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the Standard Model with the general effective Hamiltonian for the quark level transition $c \to s \ell \nu$ with a complete set of four fermion operators including right-handed neutrinos. The current experimental measurements in charm decays are compatible with the Standard Model predictions and are used to constrain the new physics. With the available experimental data, we fit a $\chi^2$ function to get the best-fit values of the NP WCs. We investigate the impact of allowed new physics in the observables such as differential branching fraction, forward-backward asymmetry, lepton polarization asymmetry, and convexity parameter in the semileptonic decay $B_c^+ \to B_s \mu^+ \nu_{\mu}$. The different types of new physics scenarios have significant effects on these considered observables. The future experimental information of these observables can help to disentangle the structure of new physics.</description>

      <title>Complete Two-loop Renormalization Group Equation of the Weinberg Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the renormalization group equation (RGE) of the lepton-number-violating Weinberg operator with the particle content of the Standard Model (SM), thus completing the set of two-loop RGEs of the SM effective field theory up to dimension 5. We identify new diagrams that could increase the rank of the Wilson coefficient of the Weinberg operator, and we calculate the complete two-loop RGE for the neutrino mass eigenvalues and leptonic mixing matrix. We also briefly discuss some phenomenological implications of the RGEs.</description>

      <title>Cosmological perturbations in a generalised axion-like dark energy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the cosmological evolution of a generalised axion-like field that drives the late-time acceleration of the Universe. This model can exhibit tracking behaviour which alleviates the coincidence problem. The cosmological perturbations are carried within a multi-fluid approach where the scalar field is described by a non-adiabatic fluid, i.e., whose speed of sound at the rest frame is different from the adiabatic one. The cosmological perturbations are solved since the radiation-dominated epoch and imposing initial adiabatic conditions for matter, radiation and the dark energy component, for modes well outside the Hubble horizon in the past. We analyse the homogeneous curvature perturbation, gravitational potential and dark energy perturbations in this model, as well as the matter power spectrum and f{\sigma}8. We discuss which parameters of the model are more favoured observationally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heavy quark mass in QGP is related to the heavy quark potential at a large distance. In this study we test three different heavy quark potentials, namely, the free energy, the internal energy of the heavy quark pair in QGP, and the unscreened potential, which was recently proposed by the HotQCD Collaboration, through the thermal production of charm quarks in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC. We find that the free energy potential overestimates charm production in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC, while the unscreened potential produces results closest to the experimental data from the ALICE Collaboration among the three potentials.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Reformation in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBH) can arise in a wide range of scenarios, from inflation to first-order phase transitions. Light PBHs, such as those produced during preheating or at the GUT scale, could induce an early matter-dominated phase given a moderate initial abundance. During the early matter-domination, the growth of initial PBH density perturbations can trigger collapse on horizon scales, producing much heavier PBHs. While the remaining original PBHs evaporate and reheat the Universe, these massive reformed PBHs survive for an extended period of time, producing potentially observable signatures at the present. We study this PBH reformation scenario and show that those reformed PBHs can emit significant quantities of gamma rays detectable by the next generation of experiments. The rapid reheating after matter domination generates a coincident stochastic gravitational wave background, which could be within range of the upcoming CMB-S4 experiment. The PBH reformation scenario provides an intriguing possibility of decoupling the current PBH population and the initial formation mechanism from early Universe physics, while providing opportunities for observation through multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>A rich structure of renormalization group flows for Higgs-like models in 4 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider $2$ coupled Higgs doublets which transform in the usual way under SU(2)$\otimes$U(1). By constructing certain marginal operators that break time reversal symmetry, we can obtain a rich pattern of renormalization group (RG) flows which includes lines of fixed points and more interestingly, cyclic RG flows which are rather generic. The hamiltonian is pseudo-hermitian, $H^\dagger = {\cal K} H {\cal K}$ with ${\cal K}^2 =1$, however it still enjoys real eigenvalues and a unitary time evolution. Upon spontaneous symmetry breaking, the Higgs fields have an infinite number of vacuum expectation values $v_n$ which satisfy ``Russian Doll" scaling $v_n \sim e^{2 n \lambda}$ where $n=1,2,3,\ldots$ and $\lambda$ is the period of one RG cycle which is an RG invariant. We speculate that this Russian Doll RG flow can perhaps explain the origin of ``families" in the Standard Model of particle physics.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the global structure of the recently discovered family of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$-invariant potentials describing inflationary $\alpha$-attractors. These potentials have an inflationary plateau consisting of the fundamental domain and its images fully covering the upper part of the Poincar\'e half-plane. Meanwhile, the lower part of the half-plane is covered by an infinitely large number of ridges, which, at first glance, are too sharp to support inflation. However, we show that this apparent sharpness is just an illusion created by hyperbolic geometry, and each of these ridges is physically equivalent to the inflationary plateau in the upper part of the Poincar\'e half-plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physics community relies on index notation to effectively manipulate types of tensors. This paper introduces the first formally verified implementation of index notation in the interactive theorem prover Lean 4. By integrating index notation into Lean, we bridge the gap between traditional physics notation and formal verification tools, making it more accessible for physicists to write and prove results within Lean. We also open up a new avenue through which AI tools can be used to prove results related to tensors in physics. Behind the scenes our implementation leverages a novel application of category theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of ultralight axions (ULAs) on the differential brightness temperature fluctuations of neutral hydrogen at the post-reionization stage. Unique structure suppression features under the influence of ULAs are studied from angular correlations of the neutral hydrogen signals observed at different frequencies. Moreover, ULAs can behave like dark energy or dark matter at different mass regimes, implying that the fraction of the ULA energy density would be correlated with the sum of neutrino masses and the parameters of the dark energy equation of state for dark matter and dark energy like ULAs, respectively. We have explored the parameter space for the ULA physics and possible degeneracies among dark energy, neutrinos, and ULAs using the theoretical angular correlation functions expected from future intensity mapping surveys.</description>

      <title>The hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the muon $g-2$ at long distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present our lattice QCD result for the long-distance part of the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution, $(a_\mu^{\rm hvp})^{\rm LD}$, to the muon $g-2$ in the time-momentum representation. This is the numerically dominant, and at the same time the most challenging part regarding statistical precision. Our calculation is based on ensembles with dynamical up, down and strange quarks, employing the O($a$)-improved Wilson fermion action with lattice spacings ranging from $0.035-0.099$ fm. In order to reduce statistical noise in the long-distance part of the correlator to the per-mille level, we apply low-mode averaging and combine it with an explicit spectral reconstruction. Our result is $(a_\mu^{\rm hvp})^{\rm LD} = 423.2(4.2)_{\rm stat}(3.4)_{\rm syst}\times 10^{-10}$ in isospin-symmetric QCD, where the pion decay constant is used to set the energy scale. When combined with our previous results for the short- and intermediate-distance window observables and after including all sub-dominant contributions as well as isospin-breaking corrections, we obtain the total leading-order hadronic vacuum polarization contribution as $a_\mu^{\rm hvp} = 724.9(5.0)_{\rm stat}(4.9)_{\rm syst}\times 10^{-10}$. Our result displays a tension of 3.9 standard deviations with the data-driven estimate published in the 2020 White Paper, but leads to a SM prediction for the total muon anomalous magnetic moment that agrees with the current experimental average.</description>

      <title>Large Field Polynomial Inflation in Palatini $f(R,\phi)$ Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the Palatini formalism to investigate the dynamics of large-field inflation using a renormalizable polynomial inflaton potential in the context of $f(R,\phi)$ gravity. Assuming instant reheating, we make a comparative analysis of large-field polynomial inflation (PI). We first consider the minimal and non-minimal coupling of inflaton in $R$ gravity, and then we continue with the minimally and non-minimally coupled inflaton in $f(R,\phi)$ gravity. We scan the parameter space for the inflationary predictions ($n_s$ and $r$) consistent with the Planck and BICEP/Keck 2018 results as well as the sensitivity forecast of the future CMB-S4 and depict the compliant regions in the $\phi_0-\beta$ plane where $\phi_0$ and $\beta$ are two parameters of polynomial inflation model which control the saddle point of the potential and the flatness in the vicinity of this point respectively. We find that a substantial portion of the parameter space aligns with the observational data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Berry curvature and topological aspects of a spin-one color superconductor. In the ultra-relativistic limit, the ground state is the color-spin locking phase (CSL) with the pairing between quarks of opposite chirality. Li and Haldane show that for generic Cooper pairs formed by Weyl fermions that carry opposite chirality, the gap function must have topologically protected nodes. However, the CSL phase has been known as a fully gapped system and lacks any nodes within one-flavor Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We present a general formulation relating the total topological number associated with the nodal structure and the monopole charges of the Berry curvature, including the color structure of the pair quarks. In the CSL phase, the contribution from the chirality, which is assumed to lead to the nodes within the conventional argument, is canceled out by the novel color contribution. Moreover, this non-trivial color Berry structure is manifested through the presence of gapless quasi-particles that exhibit the "color" helicity $\pm 1$, resulting in total monopole charges of $\pm 3/2$ rather than $\pm 1/2$ of a single Weyl fermion.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh effective action for hydrodynamics with approximate symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic theories with approximate symmetries in the recently developed effective action approach on the Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) contour. We employ the method of spurious symmetry transformation for small explicit symmetry-breaking parameters to systematically constrain symmetry-breaking effects in the non-equilibrium effective action for hydrodynamics. We apply our method to the hydrodynamic theory of chiral symmetry in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at finite temperature and density and its explicit breaking by quark masses. We show that the spurious symmetry and the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) relation dictate that the Ward-Takahashi identity for the axial symmetry, i.e., the partial conservation of axial vector current (PCAC) relation, contains a relaxational term proportional to the axial chemical potential, whose kinetic coefficient is at least of the second order in the quark mass. In the phase where the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken, and the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone pions appear as hydrodynamic variables, this relaxation effect is subleading compared to the conventional pion mass term in the PCAC relation, which is of the first order in the quark mass. On the other hand, in the chiral symmetry-restored phase, we show that our relaxation term, which is of the second order in the quark mass, becomes the leading contribution to the axial charge relaxation. Therefore, the leading axial charge relaxation mechanism is parametrically different in the quark mass across a chiral phase transition.</description>

      <title>How neutron star properties disfavor a nuclear chiral density wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold and dense matter may break rotational symmetry spontaneously and thus form an anisotropic phase in the interior of neutron stars. We consider the concrete example of an anisotropic chiral condensate in the form of a chiral density wave. Employing a nucleon-meson model and taking into account fermionic vacuum fluctuations, we improve and extend previous results by imposing the conditions of electric charge neutrality and electroweak equilibrium, by allowing for a more general form of the vector meson self-interactions, and by including properties of pure neutron matter into the fit of the model parameters. We find that the conditions inside neutron stars postpone the onset of the chiral density wave to larger densities compared to isospin-symmetric nuclear matter. While this still allows for the construction of stars with an anisotropic core, we find that the chiral density wave is energetically preferred only in a corner of the parameter space where matter is too soft to generate stars with realistic masses. Therefore, taking into account constraints from astrophysical data, our calculation predicts an isotropic neutron star core.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new class of inflationary attractors in metric-affine gravity. Such class features a non-minimal coupling $\tilde\xi \, \Omega(\phi)$ with the Holst invariant $\tilde{R}$ and an inflaton potential proportional to $\Omega(\phi)^2$. The attractor behaviour of the class takes place with two combined strong coupling limits. The first limit is realized at large $\tilde\xi$, which makes the theory equivalent to a $\tilde{R}^2$ model. Then, the second limit considers a very small Barbero-Immirzi parameter which leads the inflationary predictions of the $\tilde{R}^2$ model towards the ones of Starobinsky inflation. Because of the analogy with the renown $\xi$-attractors, we label this new class as $\tilde\xi$-attractors.</description>

      <title>Composite 2-Higgs Doublet Model: Strong Effects on Higgs Pair Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how effects of compositeness emerging in a Composite 2-Higgs Doublet Model can enter Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs pair production at the Large Hadron Collider in both resonant and non-resonant mode. Such effects can arise from modified trilinear Higgs self-couplings and top-Yukawa couplings as well as from loops of new heavy quarks and additional quartic Higgs-fermion interactions. In the resonant case, significant distortions of the Breit- Wigner shape of a new scalar state decaying into the two SM-like Higgs states may occur due to interference effects amongst not only the SM-like diagrams but also those involving the new heavy quarks. In the non-resonant case, a modification of the underlying line-shape and a local maximum at twice a new heavy quark mass appear simultaneously. We quantify these effects by taking into account the relevant theoretical and latest experimental bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09487v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How to describe loop corrections of gravitation is a fundamental challenge in the quantization of Einstein gravity. In this paper, we give it a try in UV-free scheme, including one-loop propagator and two-loop vertex, and the results are effective for graviton loops. This indicates that both loops of the renormalizable Standard Model and the non-renormalizable Einstein gravity can be described in a unified way.</description>

      <title>Locally finite two-loop amplitudes for electroweak production through gluon fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The computation of two-loop amplitudes for the production of multiple Higgs and electroweak gauge bosons via gluon fusion with exact dependence on quark masses relies primarily on numerical methods. We propose a framework that enables their numerical evaluation in momentum space. The method is inspired by the factorization of infrared divergences in QCD scattering amplitudes. It extends techniques introduced for electroweak gauge boson production from quark-antiquark annihilation to processes with external gluons. By combining diagrammatic integrands, we make use of local cancellations between diagrams that automatically eliminate most non-factoring infrared singularities. With a limited number of counterterms, we then derive two-loop integrands for which all soft and collinear singularities factorize locally. We hope that the local subtraction techniques presented in this article will play a useful role in extending the local factorization formalism to two-loop amplitudes for arbitrary processes.</description>

      <title>Note on Klein-Nishina effect in strong-field QED: the case of nonlinear Compton scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suitably normalized differential probabilities of one-photon emission in external electromagnetic fields are compared to quantify the transit of nonlinear Compton scattering to linear Compton scattering, described by the Klein-Nishina formula, and to constant crossed field treatment. The known Klein-Nishina suppression at large energies is further enforced by increasing field intensity. In view of the Ritus-Narozhny conjecture, we demonstrate that different paths in the field intensity vs. energy plane towards large values of the quantum non-linearity parameter $\chi$ facilitate significantly different asymptotic dependencies, both in the Klein-Nishina regime and the constant crossed field regime and in between.</description>

      <title>Minimal solution to the axion isocurvature problem from a nonminimal coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main limitation for preinflationary breaking of Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry is the upper bound on the Hubble rate during inflation from axion isocurvature fluctuations. This leads to a tension between high scale inflation and QCD axions with grand unified theory (GUT) scale decay constants, which reduces the potential for a detection of tensor modes at next generation cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. We propose a mechanism that explicitly breaks PQ symmetry via nonminimal coupling to gravity, that lifts the axion mass above the Hubble scale during inflation and has negligible impact on today's axion potential. The initially heavy axion gets trapped at an intermediate minimum during inflation given by the phase of the nonminimal coupling, before it moves to its true $CP$-conserving minimum after inflation. During this stage it undergoes coherent oscillations around an adiabatically decreasing minimum, which slightly dilutes the axion energy density, while still being able to explain the observed dark matter relic abundance. This scenario can be tested by the combination of next generation CMB surveys like CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD with haloscopes such as ABRACADABRA, DMRadio or CASPEr-Electric.</description>

      <title>Novel first-order phase transition and critical points in SU(3) Yang-Mills theory with spatial compactification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics and phase structure of $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills theory on $\mathbb{T}^2\times\mathbb{R}^2$ in Euclidean spacetime in an effective-model approach. The model incorporates two Polyakov loops along two compactified directions as dynamical variables, and is constructed to reproduce thermodynamics on $\mathbb{T}^2\times\mathbb{R}^2$ measured on the lattice. The model analysis indicates the existence of a novel first-order phase transition on $\mathbb{T}^2\times\mathbb{R}^2$ in the deconfined phase, which terminates at critical points that should belong to the two-dimensional $Z_2$ universality class. We argue that the interplay of the Polyakov loops induced by their cross term in the Polyakov-loop potential is responsible for the manifestation of the first-order transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the production of hyperon resonances in the $p\bar{p}\to\bar{\Lambda}\Sigma\eta$ reaction within an effective Lagrangian approach. The model includes the production of $\Sigma(1750)$ and $\Lambda(1670)$ in the intermediate state excited by the $K$ and $K^*$ meson exchanges between the initial proton and antiproton. Due to the large coupling of $\Sigma(1750)\Sigma\eta$ vertex, $\Sigma(1750)$ is found a significant contribution near the threshold in this reaction. We provide total and differential cross section predictions for the reation and discuss the possible influence of $\Sigma(1750)\Sigma\eta$ vertex coupling and model parameters, which will be useful in future experimental studies. This reaction can provide a platform for studying the features of $\Sigma(1750)$ resonance, especially the coupling to $\Sigma\eta$ channel.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Bulk Fields: No-Go Conjectures for Braneworld Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work establishes a series of no-go conjectures that impose rigorous constraints on the localization of bulk fields in braneworld scenarios, specifically affecting gauge and spinor fields within five-dimensional spacetimes. Our approach differs from traditional methods as it does not rely on specific equations of motion, making our results broadly applicable across various braneworld models. These no-go conditions reveal fundamental limitations in field localization, challenging the feasibility of embedding fields on the brane. For instance, our analysis demonstrates that existing models fail to achieve consistent localization for gauge and spinor fields. Additionally, one of our conditions indicates that the effective Lagrangian on the brane cannot exhibit conformal invariance.</description>

      <title>The Ghent Hybrid Model in NuWro: a new neutrino single-pion production model in the GeV regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino-induced single-pion production constitutes an essential interaction channel in modern neutrino oscillation experiments, with its products building up a significant fraction of the observable hadronic final states. Frameworks of oscillation analyses strongly rely on Monte Carlo neutrino event generators, which provide theoretical predictions of neutrino interactions on nuclear targets. Thus, it is crucial to integrate state-of-the-art single-pion production models with Monte Carlo simulations to prepare for the upcoming systematics-dominated landscape of neutrino measurements. In this work, we present the implementation of the Ghent Hybrid model for neutrino-induced single-pion production in the NuWro Monte Carlo event generator. The interaction dynamics includes coherently-added contributions from nucleon resonances and a non-resonant background, merged into the pythia branching predictions in the deep-inelastic regime, as instrumented by NuWro. This neutrino-nucleon interaction model is fully incorporated into the nuclear framework of the generator, allowing it to account for the influence of both initial- and final-state nuclear medium effects. We compare the predictions of this integrated implementation with recent pion production data from accelerator-based neutrino experiments. The results of the novel model show improved agreement of the generator predictions with the data and point to the significance of the refined treatment of the description of pion-production processes beyond the $\Delta$ region.</description>

Abstract: We project the reach of future lepton colliders for measuring CKM elements from direct observations of $W$ decays. We focus our attention to $|V_{cs}|$ and $|V_{cb}|$ determinations, using FCC-ee as case study. We employ state-of-the-art jet flavor taggers to obtain the projected sensitivity, and scan over tagger performances to show their effect. We conclude that future lepton collider can sizeably improve the sensitivity on $|V_{cs}|$ and $|V_{cb}|$, albeit the achievable reach will strongly depend on the level of systematic uncertainties on tagger parameters.</description>

For small values of the time, we present analytical series expansions; for large values of the time, we present numerical series expansions which overcome the problems showed by na\"ive asymptotic expansions. These results are to be employed in lattice QCD determinations of hadronic vacuum polarization contributions to the muon $g$-$2$ at next-to-leading order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15116v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Z5 two-component dark matter model within the framework of the Type-II seesaw mechanism. Due to the new annihilation processes related to triplets, the light component cannot necessarily be dominant in the dark matter relic density, which is different from the Z5 two-component dark matter model in the SM. The model is considered to explain the excess of electron-positron flux measured by the AMS-02 Collaborations in this work, which is encouraged by the decay of the triplets arising from dark matter annihilations in the Galactic halo. We discuss the cases of the light and heavy components determining dark matter density within a viable parameter space satisfying relic density and direct detection constraints, and by fitting the antiproton spectrum observed in the PAMELA and AMS experiments, we find that the parameter space is flexible and the electron-positron flux excess can be obtained in both cases with the mass of two dark matter particles being larger than that of the triplets'.</description>

Abstract: The gravitational form factors (GFFs) of pions are calculated from a top-down holographic quantum chromodynamics (QCD) approach with momentum transfer dependence for the first time. It is important because the GFFs of hadrons have information on the internal stress distribution that may provide insight into the mechanism of how QCD forms hadrons. The forward limit value of this GFFs, i.e. the D-term, was also obtained. Furthermore, in this approach, we observe the so-called glueball dominance, in which pions have gravitational interactions via infinite glueball spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The production of three Higgs bosons could be a stretch goal for the LHC and a strategic case for future colliders. In this work, we analyse the phenomenological prospects of (neutral) triple Higgs compared to di-Higgs boson production, for a range of Higgs-sector extensions from a strong first-order electroweak phase transition perspective. In parallel, we include constraints from existing exotics and Higgs boson measurements that further limit the parameter space of such models. Resonance contributions offer large modifications in particular for triple Higgs production, albeit starting from a small SM expectation. With enhancements of order 40 over the SM, however, experimental efforts to obtain limits at the HL-LHC are well-motivated and well-placed. This is further highlighted by the potential of these processes to inform the investigation of the thermal history of our universe.</description>

Abstract: We present the first calculation of same-sign WW scattering at the LHC in the fully leptonic decay channel including the modelling of polarisation for intermediate electroweak bosons and radiative corrections up to NLO EW+QCD accuracy. The predictions rely on a pole expansion and on the split of polarisation states at matrix-element level. Doubly-polarised and unpolarised signals are investigated together with full off-shell results. A detailed phenomenlogical analysis is carried out focusing on differential observables that discriminate between polarisation states, paving the way for refined polarisation-oriented analyses of vector-boson scattering with Run-3 LHC data.</description>

To this end, we rederive the dimension-6 SMEFT coefficients resulting from integrating out the kinetically-mixed (`malaphoric') $Z^\prime$ field. The kinetic mixing provides a family-universal component to the couplings of the $Z^\prime$ field, which can improve fits to lepton flavour universality observables. We show how kinetic mixing improves the best fit of the $B_3-L_2$ model to $b\rightarrow s$ data by 7.3 units of $\chi^2$ while remaining compatible with other relevant data sets such as electroweak precision observables and measurements of $e^+ e^- \rightarrow \ell^+ \ell^-$ at LEP2.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the Migdal transition probabilities in electron-atom inelastic cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16911v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Migdal transition probabilities for dark matter scattering are compared to the total single-electron inelastic cross sections of electron-atom scattering for isolated Ar and Xe. The comparison is done by expressing the electron-atom scattering cross section by connecting the Migdal probability. The resultant differences are around $30 \ \%$ for Ar and $80 \ \%$ for Xe in $\sim$ 1 keV of incoming electron energy. The transition is dominated from the $3p$ shell electrons for Ar. For Xe, $5p$ states dominate the contribution, but, $4d$ states give $\sim 40\ \%$ contribution at 1 keV. The differences for Xe atom will become better for high energy because of the approximation and lack of data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the renormalization constant of the pseudoscalar operator defined with a non-anticommuting $\gamma_5$ in dimensional regularization up to four-loop order in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Furthermore, by virtue of renormalization-group invariance of the relation between the scalar and the pseudoscalar operator, we predict the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ factor of the renormalization constant for the latter at five-loop order in QCD.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons Induced Thermal Friction on Axion Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19906v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics and interactions of the solitonic domain walls that occur in realistic axion electrodynamics models including the Chern-Simons interaction, $a\epsilon_{\mu\nu\lambda\sigma}F^{\mu\nu} F^{\lambda\sigma}$, between an axion $a(x)$ of mass $m_a$, and a massless U(1) gauge field, e.g. EM, interacting with strength $\alpha=e^2/4\pi$ with charged matter, e.g. electron-positron pairs. In particular, in the presence of a U(1) gauge-and-matter relativistic thermal plasma we study the friction experienced by the walls due to the Chern-Simons term. Utilizing the linear response method we include the collective effects of the plasma, as opposed to purely particle scattering across the wall (as is done in previous treatments) which is valid only in the thin wall regime that is rarely applicable in realistic cases. We show that the friction depends on the Lorentz-$\gamma$-factor-dependent inverse thickness of the wall in the plasma frame, $\ell^{-1} \sim \gamma m_a$, compared to the three different plasma scales, the temperature $T$, the Debye mass $m_D\sim\sqrt{\alpha} T$, and the damping rate $\Gamma \sim \alpha^2 T$, and elucidate the underlying physical intuition for this behavior. (For friction in the thin-wall-limit we correct previous expressions in the literature.) We further consider the effects of long-range coherent magnetic fields that are possibly present in the early universe and compare their effect with that of thermal magnetic fields. Finally, we briefly discuss the possible early universe consequences of our results for domain wall motion and network decay, stochastic gravitational wave production from domain wall networks, and possible primordial black hole production from domain wall collapse, though a more complete discussion of these topics is reserved for a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Detecting the flavor content of the vacuum using the Dirac operator spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.05380v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the overlap Dirac spectrum on three gauge ensembles generated using $2+1$-flavor domain wall fermions. The three ensembles have different lattice spacings and two of them have quark masses tuned to the physical point. The spectral density is determined up to $\lambda\sim$100 MeV with subpercentage statistical uncertainty. We find that the density is close to a constant below $\lambda\sim$ 20 MeV as predicted by chiral perturbative theory ($\chi$PT), and then increases linearly due to the strange quark mass. By fitting to the next-to-leading order $\chi$PT form and using the non-perturbative RI/MOM renormalization, the $\rm SU(2)$ (keeping the strange quark mass at the physical point) and $\rm SU(3)$ chiral condensates at $\overline{\textrm{MS}}$ 2 GeV are determined to be $\Sigma=(265.4(0.5)(4.2)\ \textrm{MeV})^3$ and $\Sigma_0=(234.3(0.5)(25.8)\ \textrm{MeV})^3$, respectively. The pion decay constants are also determined to be $F=84.1(1.9)(8.0)$ and $F_0=58.6(0.5)(10.0)$ MeV. The systematic errors are carefully estimated including the effects of fitting ranges and the uncertainty of low-energy constant $L_6$. We also show that one can resolve the sea flavor content of the sea quarks and constrain their masses with {$\sim10\%-20\%$} statistical uncertainties using the Dirac spectral density.</description>

      <title>Universe as Klein-Gordon Eigenstates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.01557v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate Friedmann's equations as second-order linear differential equations. This is done using techniques related to the Schwarzian derivative that selects the $\beta$-times $t_\beta:=\int^t a^{-2\beta}$, where $a$ is the scale factor. In particular, it turns out that Friedmann's equations are equivalent to the eigenvalue problems $$ O_{1/2} \Psi=\frac{\Lambda}{12}\Psi \ , \qquad O_1 a =\frac{\Lambda}{3} a \ , $$ which is suggestive of a measurement problem. $O_{\beta}(\rho,p)$ are space-independent Klein-Gordon operators, depending only on energy density and pressure, and related to the Klein-Gordon Hamilton-Jacobi equations. The $O_\beta$'s are also independent of the spatial curvature, labeled by $k$, and absorbed in $$ \Psi=\sqrt a e^{\frac{i}{2}\sqrt{k}\eta} \ . $$ The above pair of equations is the unique possible linear form of Friedmann's equations unless $k=0$, in which case there are infinitely many pairs of linear equations. Such a uniqueness just selects the conformal time $\eta\equiv t_{1/2}$ among the $t_\beta$'s, which is the key to absorb the curvature term. An immediate consequence of the linear form is that it reveals a new symmetry of Friedmann's equations in flat space.</description>

      <title>Chiral and flavor oscillations in a hyperentangled neutrino state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In addition to flavor oscillations, Dirac neutrinos also undergo the so-called chiral oscillations, a consequence of the free-particle dynamics under the Dirac equation. Such a transition between different chiralities affect the flavor transitions, but also can generate non-trivial correlations between the internal degrees of freedom of the particle. In this paper, we show that the state of a massive oscillating neutrino produced by weak interaction process, is an hyperentangled state, in which flavor, chirality, and spin exhibit non-trivial correlations. Using complete complementarity relations, we show that both chiral and flavor oscillations redistribute correlations and coherence in time among different partitions of the system. In a similar way, we consider a spin entangled lepton-antineutrino pair and show that there is a dynamical redistribution of spin-spin entanglement into correlations and coherence between the other degrees-of-freedom. Our analysis provides a complete characterization of the quantum correlations involved in lepton-antineutrino pairs and in single particle neutrino evolution, and provides a further insight on possible routes to interpret and measure chiral oscillations.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a Monte Carlo simulation generated with the GiBUU model for neutrino experiments. The simulation generates realistic neutrino event samples, contributing to the prediction and interpretation of experimental outcomes. The results showcase the performance of the GiBUU-based simulation framework, emphasizing its fidelity to the original GiBUU cross-section model. This first implementation enables future work on developing the infrastructure to propagate systematic uncertainties. These contributions enhance the precision of experimental predictions and provide a platform for further exploration in future studies.</description>

Abstract: At the earliest stage of ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions the produced matter is a highly populated system of gluons called glasma which can be approximately described in terms of classical chromodynamic fields. Although the system's dynamics is governed by Yang-Mills equations, glasma evolution is shown to strongly resemble hydrodynamic behaviour.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Interacting Dark Energy Models from the DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation and DES Supernovae Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent results from the first year baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data released by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernova (SN) data, have shown a detection of significant deviation from a cosmological constant for dark energy. In this work, we utilize the latest DESI BAO data in combination with the SN data from the full five-year observations of the Dark Energy Survey and the CMB data from the Planck satellite to explore potential interactions between dark energy and dark matter. We consider four typical forms of the interaction term $Q$. Our findings suggest that interacting dark energy (IDE) models with $Q \propto \rho_{\rm de}$ support the presence of an interaction where dark energy decays into dark matter. Specifically, the deviation from $\Lambda$CDM for the IDE model with $Q=\beta H_0\rho_{\rm de}$ reaches the $3\sigma$ level. These models yield a lower value of Akaike information criterion than the $\Lambda$CDM model, indicating a preference for these IDE models based on the current observational data. For IDE models with $Q\propto\rho_{\rm c}$, the existence of interaction depends on the form of the proportionality coefficient $\Gamma$. The IDE model with $Q=\beta H\rho_{\rm c}$ yields $\beta=0.0003\pm 0.0011$, which essentially does not support the presence of the interaction. In general, whether the observational data support the existence of interaction is closely related to the model. Our analysis helps to elucidate which type of IDE model can better explain the current observational data.</description>

      <title>Origin of Black Hole Spin in Lower-Mass-Gap Black Hole-Neutron Star Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During the fourth observing run, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration reported the detection of a coalescing compact binary (GW230529$_{-}$181500) with component masses estimated at $2.5-4.5\, M_\odot$ and $1.2-2.0\, M_\odot$ with 90\% credibility. Given the current constraints on the maximum neutron star (NS) mass, this event is most likely a lower-mass-gap (LMG) black hole-neutron star (BHNS) binary. The spin magnitude of the BH, especially when aligned with the orbital angular momentum, is critical in determining whether the NS is tidally disrupted. An LMG BHNS merger with a rapidly spinning BH is an ideal candidate for producing electromagnetic counterparts. However, no such signals have been detected. In this study, we employ a detailed binary evolution model, incorporating new dynamical tide implementations, to explore the origin of BH spin in an LMG BHNS binary. If the NS forms first, the BH progenitor (He-rich star) must begin in orbit shorter than 0.35 days to spin up efficiently, potentially achieving a spin magnitude of $\chi_{\rm BH} &gt; 0.3$. Alternatively, if a non-spinning BH (e.g., $M_{\rm BH} = 3.6\, M_\odot$) forms first, it can accrete up to $\sim 0.2\, M_\odot$ via Case BA mass transfer (MT), reaching a spin magnitude of $\chi_{\rm BH} \sim 0.18$ under Eddington-limited accretion. With a higher Eddington accretion limit (i.e., 10.0 $\Dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$), the BH can attain a significantly higher spin magnitude of $\chi_{\rm BH} \sim\,0.65$ by accreting approximately $1.0\, M_\odot$ during Case BA MT phase.</description>

      <title>First constraints on general neutrino interactions based on KATRIN data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precision measurement of the tritium $\beta$-decay spectrum performed by the KATRIN experiment provides a unique way to search for general neutrino interactions (GNI). All theoretical allowed GNI terms involving neutrinos are incorporated into a low-energy effective field theory, and can be identified by specific signatures in the measured tritium $\beta$-spectrum. In this paper an effective description of the impact of GNI on the $\beta$-spectrum is formulated and the first constraints on the effective GNI parameters are derived based on the 4 million electrons collected in the second measurement campaign of KATRIN in 2019. In addition, constraints on selected types of interactions are investigated, thereby exploring the potential of KATRIN to search for more specific new physics cases, including a right-handed W boson, a charged Higgs or leptoquarks.</description>

      <title>Proton decay in de Sitter environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01892v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The decay of proton in the de Sitter environment is governed by the temperature $T=H/\pi$, where $H$ is the Hubble parameter. This temperature is twice larger than the Gibbons-Hawking temperature $T_{\rm GH}=H/2\pi$. This demonstrates the physical difference of two processes. The temperature $T=H/\pi$ determines the proton decay rate in the local process which takes well inside the cosmological horizon. While the Gibbons-Hawking temperature can be related to the processes which involve the Hawking photons or other particles radiated from the cosmological horizon. The same temperature $T=H/\pi$ determines the radiation of electron-positron pairs by positron or by other object in the de Sitter environment. Creation of matter and its thermalization in the de Sitter heat bath leads to the energy exchange between matter and quantum vacuum and finally to the decay of the de Sitter state towards the Minkowski vacuum. The lesson for the Unruh effect is also discussed. One may expect the similar separation of effects governed by two different temperatures: the effects related to the Rindler horizon with the Unruh temperature $T_{\rm U}=a/2\pi$ and the local radiation with $T=a/\pi=2T_{\rm U}$.</description>
