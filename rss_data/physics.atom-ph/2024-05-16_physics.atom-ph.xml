      <title>Relativistic EELS scattering cross-sections for microanalysis based on Dirac solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rich information of electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) comes from the complex inelastic scattering process whereby fast electrons transfer energy and momentum to atoms, exciting bound electrons from their ground states to higher unoccupied states. To quantify EELS, the common practice is to compare the cross-sections integrated within an energy window or fit the observed spectrum with theoretical differential cross-sections calculated from a generalized oscillator strength (GOS) database with experimental parameters. The previous Hartree-Fock-based and DFT-based GOS are calculated from Schr\"odinger's solution of atomic orbitals, which does not include the full relativistic effects. Here, we attempt to go beyond the limitations of the Schr\"odinger solution in the GOS tabulation by including the full relativistic effects using the Dirac equation within the local density approximation, which is particularly important for core-shell electrons of heavy elements with strong spin-orbit coupling. This has been done for all elements in the periodic table (up to Z = 118) for all possible excitation edges using modern computing capabilities and parallelization algorithms. The relativistic effects of fast incoming electrons were included to calculate cross-sections that are specific to the acceleration voltage. We make these tabulated GOS available under an open-source license to the benefit of both academic users as well as allowing integration into commercial solutions.</description>

      <title>Controlling $^{229}$Th isomeric state population in a VUV transparent crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radioisotope Th-229 is renowned for its extraordinarily low-energy, long-lived nuclear first-excited state. This isomeric state can be excited by VUV lasers and the transition from the ground state has been proposed as a reference transition for ultra-precise nuclear clocks. Such nuclear clocks will find multiple applications, ranging from fundamental physics studies to practical implementations. Recent investigations extracted valuable constraints on the nuclear transition energy and lifetime, populating the isomer in stochastic nuclear decay of U-233 or Ac-229.
  However, to assess the feasibility and performance of the (solid-state) nuclear clock concept, time-controlled excitation and depopulation of the $^{229}$Th isomer together with time-resolved monitoring of the radiative decay are imperative.
  Here we report the population of the $^{229}$Th isomeric state through resonant X-ray pumping and detection of the radiative decay in a VUV transparent $^{229}$Th-doped CaF$_2$ crystal. The decay half-life is measured to $447\pm 25$ s, with a transition wavelength of $148.18 \pm 0.42$ nm and a radiative decay fraction consistent with unity. Furthermore, we report a new ``X-ray quenching'' effect which allows to de-populate the isomer on demand and effectively reduce the half-life by at least a factor 50. Such controlled quenching can be used to significantly speed up the interrogation cycle in future nuclear clock schemes.
  Our results show that full control over the $^{229}$Th nuclear isomer population can be achieved in a crystal environment. In particular, non-radiative decay processes that might lead to a broadening of the isomer transition linewidth are negligible, paving the way for the development of a compact and robust solid-state nuclear clock. Further studies are needed to reveal the underlying physical mechanism of the X-ray quenching effect.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking and non-ergodicity in a driven-dissipative ensemble of multi-level atoms in a cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dissipative light-matter systems can display emergent collective behavior. Here, we report a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry-breaking phase transition in a system of multi-level $^{87}$Rb atoms strongly coupled to a weakly driven two-mode optical cavity. In the symmetry-broken phase, non-ergodic dynamics manifests in the emergence of multiple stationary states with disjoint basins of attraction. This feature enables the amplification of a small atomic population imbalance into a characteristic macroscopic cavity transmission signal. Our experiment does not only showcase strongly dissipative atom-cavity systems as platforms for probing non-trivial collective many-body phenomena, but also highlights their potential for hosting technological applications in the context of sensing, density classification, and pattern retrieval dynamics within associative memories.</description>

      <title>Geometric Ramsey Interferometry with a Tripod Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ramsey interferometry is a key technique for precision spectroscopy and to probe the coherence of quantum systems. Typically, an interferometer is constructed using two quantum states and involves a time-dependent interaction with two short resonant electromagnetic pulses. Here, we explore a different type of Ramsey interferometer where we perform quantum state manipulations by geometrical means, eliminating the temporal dependence of the interaction. We use a resonant tripod scheme in ultracold strontium atoms where the interferometric operation is restricted to a two-dimensional dark-state subspace in the dressed-state picture. The observed interferometric phase accumulation is due to an effective geometric scalar term in the dark-state subspace, which remarkably does not vanish during the free evolution time when the light-matter interaction is turned off. This study opens the door for more robust interferometers operating on multiple input-output ports.</description>

      <title>{\AE} codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diatomic molecular codes [arXiv:1911.00099] are designed to encode quantum information in the orientation of a diatomic molecule, allowing error correction from small torques and changes in angular momentum. Here, we directly study noise native to atomic and molecular platforms -- spontaneous emission, stray electromagnetic fields, and Raman scattering -- and show that diatomic molecular codes fail against this noise. We derive simple necessary and sufficient conditions for codes to protect against such noise. We also identify existing and develop new absorption-emission (\AE) codes that are more practical than molecular codes, require lower average momentum, can directly protect against photonic processes up to arbitrary order, and are applicable to a broader set of atomic and molecular systems.</description>
