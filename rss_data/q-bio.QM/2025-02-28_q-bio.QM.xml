      <title>Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Large Language Models to Predict SERCA-Binding Protein Fragments from Cardiac Proteomics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in various natural language processing tasks, including their application to proteomics data to classify protein fragments. In this study, we curated a limited mass spectrometry dataset with 1000s of protein fragments, consisting of proteins that appear to be attached to the endoplasmic reticulum in cardiac cells, of which a fraction was cloned and characterized for their impact on SERCA, an ER calcium pump. With this limited dataset, we sought to determine whether LLMs could correctly predict whether a new protein fragment could bind SERCA, based only on its sequence and a few biophysical characteristics, such as hydrophobicity, determined from that sequence. To do so, we generated random sequences based on cloned fragments, embedded the fragments into a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) database to group them by similarity, then fine-tuned large language model (LLM) prompts to predict whether a novel sequence could bind SERCA. We benchmarked this approach using multiple open-source LLMs, namely the Meta/llama series, and embedding functions commonly available on the Huggingface repository. We then assessed the generalizability of this approach in classifying novel protein fragments from mass spectrometry that were not initially cloned for functional characterization. By further tuning the prompt to account for motifs, such as ER retention sequences, we improved the classification accuracy by and identified several proteins predicted to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum and bind SERCA, including Ribosomal Protein L2 and selenoprotein S. Although our results were based on proteomics data from cardiac cells, our approach demonstrates the potential of LLMs in identifying novel protein interactions and functions with very limited proteomic data.</description>

      <title>Homeostatic Kinematic Growth Model for Arteries -- Residual Stresses and Active Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple kinematic growth model for muscular arteries is presented which allows the incorporation of residual stresses such that a homeostatic in-vivo stress state under physiological loading is obtained. To this end, new evolution equations for growth are proposed, which avoid issues with instability of final growth states known from other kinematric growth models. These evolution equations are connected to a new set of growth driving forces. By introducing a formulation using the principle Cauchy stresses, reasonable in vivo stress distributions can be obtained while ensuring realistic geometries of arteries after growth. To incorporate realistic Cauchy stresses for muscular arteries under varying loading conditions, which appear in vivo, e.g., due to physical activity, the growth model is combined with a newly proposed stretch-dependent model for smooth muscle activation. To account for the changes of geometry and mechanical behavior during the growth process, an optimization procedure is described which leads to a more accurate representation of an arterial ring and its mechanical behavior after the growth-related homogenization of the stresses is reached. Based thereon, parameters are adjusted to experimental data of a healthy middle cerebral artery of a rat showing that the proposed model accurately describes real material behavior. The successful combination of growth and active response indicates that the new growth model can be used without problems for modeling active tissues under various conditions.</description>

      <title>Purported quantitative support for multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into humans is an artefact of an imbalanced hypothesis testing framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A prominent report claimed substantial support for two introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into humans using a calculation that combined phylodynamic inferences and epidemic models. Inspection of the calculation identifies an imbalance in the hypothesis testing framework that confounds this result; the single-introduction model was tested against more stringent conditions than the two-introduction model. Here, I show that when the two-introduction model is tested against the same conditions, the support disappears.</description>

      <title>How cancer emerges: Data-driven universal insights into tumorigenesis via hallmark networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cancer is a complex disease driven by dynamic regulatory shifts that cannot be fully captured by individual molecular profiling. We employ a data-driven approach to construct a coarse-grained dynamic network model based on hallmark interactions, integrating stochastic differential equations with gene regulatory network data to explore key macroscopic dynamic changes in tumorigenesis. Our analysis reveals that network topology undergoes significant reconfiguration before hallmark expression shifts, serving as an early indicator of malignancy. A pan-cancer examination across $15$ cancer types uncovers universal patterns, where Tissue Invasion and Metastasis exhibits the most significant difference between normal and cancer states, while the differences in Reprogramming Energy Metabolism are the least pronounced, consistent with the characteristic features of tumor biology. These findings reinforce the systemic nature of cancer evolution, highlighting the potential of network-based systems biology methods for understanding critical transitions in tumorigenesis.</description>

      <title>Impilict Runge-Kutta based sparse identification of governing equations in biologically motivated systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying governing equations in physical and biological systems from datasets remains a long-standing challenge across various scientific disciplines, providing mechanistic insights into complex system evolution. Common methods like sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) often rely on precise derivative estimations, making them vulnerable to data scarcity and noise. This study presents a novel data-driven framework by integrating high order implicit Runge-Kutta methods (IRKs) with the sparse identification, termed IRK-SINDy. The framework exhibits remarkable robustness to data scarcity and noise by leveraging the lower stepsize constraint of IRKs. Two methods for incorporating IRKs into sparse regression are introduced: one employs iterative schemes for numerically solving nonlinear algebraic system of equations, while the other utilizes deep neural networks to predict stage values of IRKs. The performance of IRK-SINDy is demonstrated through numerical experiments on benchmark problems with varied dynamical behaviors, including linear and nonlinear oscillators, the Lorenz system, and biologically relevant models like predator-prey dynamics, logistic growth, and the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Results indicate that IRK-SINDy outperforms conventional SINDy and the RK4-SINDy framework, particularly under conditions of extreme data scarcity and noise, yielding interpretable and generalizable models.</description>

      <title>NExT-Mol: 3D Diffusion Meets 1D Language Modeling for 3D Molecule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D molecule generation is crucial for drug discovery and material design. While prior efforts focus on 3D diffusion models for their benefits in modeling continuous 3D conformers, they overlook the advantages of 1D SELFIES-based Language Models (LMs), which can generate 100% valid molecules and leverage the billion-scale 1D molecule datasets. To combine these advantages for 3D molecule generation, we propose a foundation model -- NExT-Mol: 3D Diffusion Meets 1D Language Modeling for 3D Molecule Generation. NExT-Mol uses an extensively pretrained molecule LM for 1D molecule generation, and subsequently predicts the generated molecule's 3D conformers with a 3D diffusion model. We enhance NExT-Mol's performance by scaling up the LM's model size, refining the diffusion neural architecture, and applying 1D to 3D transfer learning. Notably, our 1D molecule LM significantly outperforms baselines in distributional similarity while ensuring validity, and our 3D diffusion model achieves leading performances in conformer prediction. Given these improvements in 1D and 3D modeling, NExT-Mol achieves a 26% relative improvement in 3D FCD for de novo 3D generation on GEOM-DRUGS, and a 13% average relative gain for conditional 3D generation on QM9-2014. Our codes and pretrained checkpoints are available at https://github.com/acharkq/NExT-Mol.</description>

      <title>Association of normalization, non-differentially expressed genes and data source with machine learning performance in intra-dataset or cross-dataset modelling of transcriptomic and clinical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cross-dataset testing is critical for examining machine learning (ML) model's performance. However, most studies on modelling transcriptomic and clinical data only conducted intra-dataset testing. It is also unclear whether normalization and non-differentially expressed genes (NDEG) can improve cross-dataset modeling performance of ML. We thus aim to understand whether normalization, NDEG and data source are associated with performance of ML in cross-dataset testing. The transcriptomic and clinical data shared by the lung adenocarcinoma cases in TCGA and ONCOSG were used. The best cross-dataset ML performance was reached using transcriptomic data alone and statistically better than those using transcriptomic and clinical data. The best balance accuracy, area under curve and accuracy were significantly better in ML algorithms training on TCGA and tested on ONCOSG than those trained on ONCOSG and tested on TCGA (p&lt;0.05 for all). Normalization and NDEG greatly improved intra-dataset ML performances in both datasets, but not in cross-dataset testing. Strikingly, modelling transcriptomic data of ONCOSG alone outperformed modelling transcriptomic and clinical data whereas including clinical data in TCGA did not significantly impact ML performance, suggesting limited clinical data value or an overwhelming influence of transcriptomic data in TCGA. Performance gains in intra-dataset testing were more pronounced for ML models trained on ONCOSG than TCGA. Among the six ML models compared, Support vector machine was the most frequent best-performer in both intra-dataset and cross-dataset testing. Therefore, our data show data source, normalization and NDEG are associated with intra-dataset and cross-dataset ML performance in modelling transcriptomic and clinical data.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for cerebral blood vessels' malformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cerebral aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations are life-threatening hemodynamic pathologies of the brain. While surgical intervention is often essential to prevent fatal outcomes, it carries significant risks both during the procedure and in the postoperative period, making the management of these conditions highly challenging. Parameters of cerebral blood flow, routinely monitored during medical interventions or with modern noninvasive high-resolution imaging methods, could potentially be utilized in machine learning-assisted protocols for risk assessment and therapeutic prognosis. To this end, we developed a linear oscillatory model of blood velocity and pressure for clinical data acquired from neurosurgical operations. Using the method of Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy), the parameters of our model can be reconstructed online within milliseconds from a short time series of the hemodynamic variables. The identified parameter values enable automated classification of the blood-flow pathologies by means of logistic regression, achieving an accuracy of 73 \%}. Our results demonstrate the potential of this model for both diagnostic and prognostic applications, providing a robust and interpretable framework for assessing cerebral blood vessel conditions.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Estimation of Tea Flowering Based on an Improved YOLOv5 and ANN Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tea flowers play a crucial role in taxonomic research and hybrid breeding for the tea plant. Tea flowering consumes the plant's nutrients, and flower thinning can regulate carbon-nitrogen metabolism, enhancing the yield and quality of young shoots. As traditional methods of observing tea flower traits are labor-intensive and inaccurate, we propose an effective framework for tea flowering quantifying. In this study, a highly representative and diverse dataset was constructed by collecting flower images from 29 tea accessions. Based on this dataset, the TflosYOLO model was built on the YOLOv5 architecture and enhanced with the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) network, which is the first model to offer a viable solution for detecting tea flowers and predicting flower quantities. The TflosYOLO model achieved an mAP50 of 0.874, outperforming YOLOv5, YOLOv7 and YOLOv8. Furthermore, this model was tested on 34 datasets encompassing 26 tea accessions, five flowering stages, various lighting conditions, and pruned/unpruned plants, demonstrating high generalization and robustness. The correlation coefficient ($ R^2 $) between the predicted and actual flower counts was 0.974. Additionally, the TFSC (Tea Flowering Stage Classification) model - a novel Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was designed for automatic classification of the flowering stages. TFSC achieved an accuracy of 0.899. Dynamic analysis of flowering across 29 tea accessions in 2023 and 2024 was conducted, revealed significant variability in flower quantity and dynamics, with genetically similar accessions showing more consistent flowering patterns. This framework provides a solution for quantifying tea flowering, and can serve as a reference for precision horticulture.</description>

      <title>BioMaze: Benchmarking and Enhancing Large Language Models for Biological Pathway Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The applications of large language models (LLMs) in various biological domains have been explored recently, but their reasoning ability in complex biological systems, such as pathways, remains underexplored, which is crucial for predicting biological phenomena, formulating hypotheses, and designing experiments. This work explores the potential of LLMs in pathway reasoning. We introduce BioMaze, a dataset with 5.1K complex pathway problems derived from real research, covering various biological contexts including natural dynamic changes, disturbances, additional intervention conditions, and multi-scale research targets. Our evaluation of methods such as CoT and graph-augmented reasoning, shows that LLMs struggle with pathway reasoning, especially in perturbed systems. To address this, we propose PathSeeker, an LLM agent that enhances reasoning through interactive subgraph-based navigation, enabling a more effective approach to handling the complexities of biological systems in a scientifically aligned manner. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/zhao-ht/BioMaze.</description>
