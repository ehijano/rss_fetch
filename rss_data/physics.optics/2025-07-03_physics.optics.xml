      <title>Electron Excitation Probability in Dielectrics under Two-color Intense Laser Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-color laser fields offer significantly enhanced control over electron excitation dynamics under ultrashort intense laser pulses compared to monochromatic fields. However, their strong nonlinearity necessitates computationally expensive first-principles calculations to accurately predict ionization dynamics. To overcome this challenge, we derive an analytical expression for the ionization rate in dielectrics subjected to intense two-color laser fields, refining the theoretical framework introduced in JPSJ {\bf 88}, 024706 (2019). By benchmarking our formula against first-principles calculations based on time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) for $\alpha$-quartz, we demonstrate that our model captures the essential physics of ionization dynamics with remarkable qualitative accuracy, despite employing certain approximations. This analytical approach not only provides deeper physical insight but also offers a computationally efficient alternative for predicting strong-field interactions in dielectrics.</description>

      <title>Low-dispersion low free-spectral-range Mach-Zehnder interferometer with long straight path lengths on silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple Mach-Zehnder interferometers are constructed using fiber-Bragg grating couplers, y-branches, silicon waveguides, and/or broadband splitters in silicon on insulator strip waveguides to test the effect of variation in waveguide length between consecutive bends on the transmission gain spectrum, free-spectral range, group refractive index, and dispersion. Dispersion is mitigated by increasing the path length between consecutive bends of minimum radius. With long linear waveguide sections, a free spectral range of 0.41 nm is achieved.</description>

      <title>Polarization and tranverse mode nonlinear dynamics in a broad-area VCSEL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically analyze the nonlinear dynamics and routes to chaos in a broad-area vertical cavity surface-emitting laser (BA-VCSEL) in free-running operation. Accounting for the onset of higher order transverse modes (TMs) unveils additional bifurcations at higher currents not found for single-mode VCSELs (SM-VCSELs). The resulting dynamics involves competition between polarization modes with different transverse profiles and shows good qualitative agreement with recent experimental observations.</description>

      <title>A Novel Intensity-Based Criterion for Determining Exceptional Point in PT-Symmetry Coupled Array of Optical Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigated the propagation pattern and the site-to-site correlation function in a PT-symmetric waveguide array with different input quantum states. Recognizing the stark difference in propagation pattern before and after the PT symmetry-breaking point, we have developed a novel, straightforward intensity-based criterion to determine the exceptional point (EP). This new criterion shows excellent agreement with those obtained by directly computing the Hamiltonian's eigenvalues. Given the computational complexity of Hamiltonian diagonalization, our proposed criterion provides a highly efficient and valuable alternative for identifying the PT symmetry-breaking point.</description>

      <title>Harnessing coherent-wave control for sensing applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging techniques such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and diffuse optical tomography (DOT) achieve deep, non-invasive sensing in turbid media, but they are constrained by the photon budget. Wavefront shaping (WFS) can enhance signal strength via interference at specific locations within scattering media, enhancing light-matter interactions and potentially extending the penetration depth of these techniques. Interpreting the resulting measurements rests on the knowledge of optical sensitivity - a relationship between detected signal changes and perturbations at a specific location inside the medium. However, conventional diffusion-based sensitivity models rely on assumptions that become invalid under coherent illumination. In this work, we develop a microscopic theory for optical sensitivity that captures the inherent interference effects that diffusion theory necessarily neglects. We analytically show that under random illumination, the microscopic and diffusive treatments coincide. Using our microscopic approach, we explore WFS strategies for enhancing optical sensitivity beyond the diffusive result. We demonstrate that the input state obtained through phase conjugation at a given point inside the system leads to the largest enhancement of optical sensitivity but requires an input wavefront that depends on the target position. In sharp contrast, the maximum remission eigenchannel leads to a global enhancement of the sensitivity map with a fixed input wavefront. This global enhancement equals to remission enhancement and preserves the spatial distribution of the sensitivity, making it compatible with existing DOT reconstruction algorithms. Our results establish the theoretical foundation for integrating wavefront control with diffuse optical imaging, enabling deeper tissue penetration through improved signal strength in biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Bound States in the Continuum-Induced Second Harmonic Generation Enhancement in High-$Q$ Triple Dielectric Nanoresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-$Q$ optical nanocavities are fundamental to modern optics and photonics, enabling enhanced light-matter interactions. Previous studies have demonstrated that high-$Q$ supercavity modes can be constructed within a single dielectric resonator by leveraging quasi-bound states in the continuum. However, their $Q$-factors are limited to few tens or hundreds when such a resonator is subwavelength scale. Here, we propose a general recipe for achieving high-$Q$ resonances with $Q&gt;10,000$ in triple subwavelength dielectric resonators. This is realized through destructive interference between two resonant modes, optimized by structural tuning. Multipole analysis confirms that destructive interference across radiation channels suppresses loss, forming the ultrahigh-$Q$ states. These resonances can be efficiently excited by azimuthally polarized light due to improved mode overlap. As a key application, we demonstrate efficient second harmonic generation under this excitation, achieving a conversion efficiency of $6.6\%$ at an incident intensity of 0.78 GW/cm$^2$. Our results may find exciting applications in developing ultracompact photonic devices with superior performance.</description>

      <title>Simple analytical approach to the analysis of plasmonic phenomena in dome-shaped protrusions and depressions on metal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple and efficient analytical model is proposed for analyzing plasmonic phenomena arising in nanoscale defects on metal surfaces, specifically low aspect ratio dome-shaped protrusions and depressions. The model enables the calculation, using a straightforward formula, of the polarization charge density on the defect surface and its associated plasmonic near-field, accurately accounting for the defect geometry and incident light wave parameters. It further effectively incorporates the resonant properties of the defects within the electrostatic approximation, making it possible to calculate the correction to the Born approximation for the defect dipole moment. The analytical results obtained under the electrostatic approximation are validated through full-wave numerical simulations utilizing the finite element method. The proposed analytical approach will be valuable for modeling diverse phenomena pertinent to the development of guided-wave plasmonic devices, micro- and nanoscale light manipulation devices, metamaterials, and hybrid optoelectronic circuits, as well as for addressing light scattering problems, especially those involving surface plasmon polariton waves.</description>

      <title>POST: Photonic Swin Transformer for Automated and Efficient Prediction of PCSEL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work designs a model named POST based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) approach. Across single, double, and even triple lattices, as well as various non-circular complex hole structures, POST enables prediction of multiple optical properties of photonic crystal layers in Photonic Crystal Surface Emitting Lasers (PCSELs) with high speed and accuracy, without requiring manual intervention, which serves as a comprehensive surrogate for the optical field simulation. In the predictions of Quality Factor (Q) and Surface-emitting Efficiency (SE) for PCSEL, the R-squared values reach 0.909 and 0.779, respectively. Additionally, it achieves nearly 5,000 predictions per second, significantly lowering simulation costs. The precision and speed of POST predictions lay a solid foundation for future ultra-complex model parameter tuning involving dozens of parameters. It can also swiftly meets designers' ad-hoc requirements for evaluating photonic crystal properties. The database used for training the POST model is derived from predictions of different photonic crystal structures using the Coupled-Wave Theory (CWT) model. This dataset will be made publicly available to foster interdisciplinary research advancements in materials science and computer science.</description>

      <title>Dissipative structures in one- and two-dimensional Kerr cavities with a spatially periodic pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of periodic driving and dissipation is a fundamental feature of nonequilibrium physics. We elaborate a scenario for the formation of dissipative multi-spot excitations (MSEs) in Kerr cavities, modeled by the one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) Lugiato-Lefever (LL) equations, which include a spatially periodic pump (SPP). First, we demonstrate that the SPP produces three novel exact periodic solutions of the LL equation, expressed in terms of the $\mathrm{sn}$, $\mathrm{cn}$, and $\mathrm{dn}$ elliptic functions. By means of numerical methods, we explore the modulational instability (MI) and transverse instability (TI) of the periodic states in 1D and 2D settings, respectively. In the case of the defocusing nonlinearity, the 1D MI breaks the periodic states into an array of spatiotemporal crescents. In the case of self-focusing, the 1D MI, initiated by small random perturbations, leads to establishment of a chaotic state, with the amplitude statistics featuring a long-tail probability distribution, that represents the presence of dissipative rogue waves. On the other hand, spatially periodic perturbations initiate formation of breather chains, which periodically disappear and reappear, resembling the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou recurrence. In the 2D regime, the TI results in the formation of an array of 2D lumps. For a given SPP strength, the exact solutions for the periodic structures are stable if the loss constant exceeds a critical value. The findings reported here provide a contribution to nonequilibrium physics in general and may find direct applications in laser physics.</description>

      <title>Observation of generic U(m) non-Abelian holonomy in photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Abelian geometric phases form the foundation of fault-tolerant holonomic quantum computation. An "all-geometric" approach leveraging these phases enables robust unitary operations in condensed matter systems. Photonics, with rich degrees of freedom, offer a highly promising platform for non-Abelian holonomy. Yet, achieving universal unitary transformations in photonic holonomy remain elusive. Intrinsic positive real couplings in dissipationless photonic waveguides restrict holonomy to special orthogonal matrices, falling short of universal quantum gates or arbitrary linear operations. Here, we introduce artificial gauge fields (AGFs) to enable complex-valued couplings, expanding photonic holonomy to the full unitary group. We realize generic U(2) transformations and synthesize higher dimensional U(m) operations (up to U(4)) in integrated photonics. Our results open doors toward the transformative "all-geometric-phase" approach in photonic computing in both classical and quantum realms.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Control of High Harmonic Generation in Mixed Argon-Helium Gaseous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High harmonic generation (HHG) in gaseous media provides a robust method for producing coherent extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) radiation and attosecond pulses. However, the spectral and temporal properties of these pulses -- such as bandwidth and chirp -- are fundamentally limited by the underlying generation mechanisms. Typically, tailoring the EUV emission involves modifying the properties of the intense infrared femtosecond driving pulse, and/or the macroscopic laser-matter configuration. Here, we focus on controlling the HHG process through the gas specie, introducing mixed-gas targets as a practical approach to enhance control over the EUV harmonic radiation. Through advanced simulations assisted by artificial intelligence that take into account both the quantum microscopic and macroscopic aspects of HHG, we demonstrate how mixtures of argon and helium modulate the emitted EUV harmonics. A simple model reveals that these modulations arise from coherent interference between harmonics emitted by different species at the single-atom level, and that they can be tuned by adjusting the macroscopic relative concentrations. Furthermore, by spatially separating the gas species into two distinct jets in a symmetric configuration, we gain additional control over the whole harmonic bandwidth. This strategy provides a realistic and versatile pathway to tailor EUV light and attosecond sources via HHG, while also enabling the identification of species-specific contributions to the process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a conventional lens sharpness of the image is always limited by the wavelength of light. An unconventional alternative to a lens, a slab of negative refractive index material, has the power to focus all Fourier components of a 2D image, even those that do not propagate in a radiative manner. Such super lenses can be realised in the microwave band with current technology and a version operating at the frequency of visible light, but at short distances of a few nanometres, can be realised in the form of a thin slab of silver as our simulations show.</description>

      <title>Black hole optical analogue: photon sphere microlasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bell-like ringdown of the gravitational field in the last stage of the merging of massive black holes is now routinely detected on earth by the last generation of gravitational wave detectors. Its spectrum is interpreted as a sum of damped sinusoidal vibrations of the spacetime in the vicinity of the black hole. These so-called quasinormal modes are currently the subject of extensive studies, yet, their true nature remains elusive. Here, we emulate, in the laboratory, genuine four-dimension black hole metrics by two-dimensional optical curved surfaces that preserve the features of lightlike geodesics. %We establish the analogy with gravitational waves radiated by relaxing black holes, and We analytically compute the optical quasinormal modes and show that they are confined around the photon sphere, the unstable region around a black hole where spacetime curvature traps light in circular orbits. By 3D-printing non-Euclidean dye-doped microcavities, we demonstrate lasing at the photon sphere with a mode profile that closely matches the analytical prediction. These results paves the way for observing astrophysical phenomena in tabletop setups and is likely to inspire innovative designs in photonics.</description>

      <title>Role of plasma waves in rescattering processes in intense laser fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rescattering of the photoelectron at its parent ion underlie a number of phenomena in intense laser field interaction with matter, such as high harmonic generation, attosecond pulse production, non-sequential double ionization, and others. These processes are unavoidably accompanied by the medium photoionization. The interaction of the laser pulse with the photoionization-induced plasma excites wakefield waves, which are self-consistently coupled plasma density and Langmuir waves. We study theoretically the effect of the electric field of the plasma wave on the rescattering processes. We show that this field can compensate for the magnetic drift of the rescattering electron, which otherwise dramatically suppresses the rescattering efficiency in intense low-frequency laser fields. Moreover, the presence of the plasma wave field leads to new lines in the spectrum emitted due to the XUV free-induction decay (XFID). Observation of these lines can allow, in particular, the detection of forbidden transition frequencies, thus providing new perspectives for XFID spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>LOMS.cz: A computational platform for high-throughput Classical and Combinatorial Judd-Ofelt analysis and rare-earth spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present LOMS.cz (Luminescence, Optical and Magneto-optical Software), an open-source computational platform that addresses the long-standing challenge of standardizing Judd-Ofelt (JO) calculations in rare-earth spectroscopy. Despite JO theory's six-decade history as the fundamental framework for understanding $4f\leftrightarrow4f$ transitions, the field lacks standardized computational methodologies for precise and reproducible parameter determination. LOMS integrates three key innovations: (1) automated computation of JO parameters, transition probabilities, branching ratios, and theoretical radiative lifetimes, (2) a dynamically expanding database of experimentally validated parameters enabling direct comparison between computed and empirical results, and (3) a novel Combinatorial JO (C-JO) analysis algorithm that systematically identifies optimal absorption band combinations to ensure reliable parameter extraction. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate how this computational framework enables rapid screening of spectroscopic parameters, allowing researchers to predict optical properties with enhanced reliability. By combining automated analysis with experimental validation through its integrated database, LOMS.cz establishes a standardized platform for accelerating the discovery and optimization of rare-earth-based photonic and optoelectronic materials.</description>

      <title>TeO2-BaO-Bi2O3 tellurite optical glasses II. -- Linear and non-linear optical and magneto-optical properties</title>

Abstract: The present study investigates the linear and non-linear optical and magneto-optical properties of TeO$_2$-BaO-Bi$_2$O$_3$ (TeBaBi) glasses prepared by the conventional melt-quenching technique at 900 {\deg}C. Prepared glass composition ranges across the whole glass-forming-ability (GFA) region focusing on mutual substitution trends of constituent oxides, where TeO$_2$: 55-85 mol.%, BaO: 10-35 mol.%, Bi$_2$O$_3$: 5-15 mol.%. Studied glasses exhibit high values of linear ($n_{632} \approx$ 1.922-2.084) and non-linear refractive index ($n_2\approx$1.63-3.45$\times10^{-11}$ esu), Verdet constant ($V_{632} \approx$ 26.7-45.3 radT$^{-1}$m$^{-1}$) and optical band gap energy ($E_g \approx$ 3.1-3.6 eV). The introduction of TeO$_2$ and Bi$_2$O$_3$ results in increase of both linear/non-linear refractive index and Verdet constant, with a more pronounced influence of Bi$_2$O$_3$. Measured spectral dispersion of refractive index and Verdet constant were used for estimation of magneto-optic anomaly parameter ($\gamma \approx$ 0.71-0.92), which may be used for theoretical modelling of magneto-optic response in diamagnetic TeBaBi glasses. Additionally, the properties of the prepared TeBaBi glasses were directly compared to those of the TeO$_2$-ZnO-BaO glass system, which was prepared and characterized under similar experimental conditions. The compositional dependence of the refractive index in both glass systems was described using multilinear regression analysis, demonstrating high correlation and uniformity of estimation across the entire GFA region. This makes them highly promising for precise dispersion engineering and construction of optical devices operating from visible to mid-infrared spectral region.</description>

      <title>Fiber transmission of cluster states via multi-level time-bin encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next generation of telecommunication networks will rely on the transmission of complex quantum states to enable secure and transformative information processing, utilizing entanglement and superposition. Cluster states - multipartite entangled states that retain entanglement under local measurements - are a vital resource for quantum networking applications such as blind photonic quantum computing, quantum state teleportation and all-photonic quantum repeaters. However, the transmission of cluster states over optical fiber has remained elusive with previous approaches. Here, we demonstrate the first transmission of a four-qubit cluster state over 25 km of single-mode fiber by using a two-photon multi-level time-bin encoding. We directly generate the state by exploiting coherent control of a parametric generation process, rendering a resource-intensive controlled-phase gate obsolete. To enable efficient and reconfigurable projective measurements on the multi-level time-bin encoded state, we introduce chirped-pulse modulation and implement the first time-bin beam splitter, allowing us to certify genuine multipartite entanglement and to demonstrate one-way computing operations. Our approach enables the transmission of complex quantum states over long-distance fibers, permitting the implementation of multipartite protocols and laying the foundation for large-scale quantum resource networks.</description>

      <title>Measuring spatial coherence of quantum and classical light with an ultrastable monolithic interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a monolithic interferometer for spatial coherence measurements of both classical and quantum light sources. The design combines parametric down-conversion with a thermal source, using two identical calcite crystals to control beam alignment via birefringence. The monolithic structure ensures inherent stability. Spatial coherence is measured through temporal interferograms and spectral analysis, with both methods showing close agreement with theoretical predictions. The system is robust and performs reliably for both quantum and classical light. Its design enables automated, rapid coherence measurements across different source types.</description>

      <title>On-chip photon entanglement-assisted topology loading and transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological protection offers a robust solution to the challenges of noise and loss in physical systems. By integrating topological physics into optics, loading and encoding quantum states into topological invariants can provide resilience to information systems in the face of environmental disruptions. Here, we demonstrate on-chip loading and entanglement-assisted transfer of photon topology, where the topological structure is coherently encoded in a single-photon spin-textured quantum state, which can be transferred, through entanglement distribution, into a non-local quantum-correlated topology shared between two entangled photons. Throughout the transfer process, the topology remains protected against substantial background noise as well as isotropic and anisotropic disturbances, while quantum correlations persist. Our framework for loading and transferring topology is compatible with quantum teleportation when ancillary photons are introduced, thereby promising the development of distributed quantum systems with inherently secure and protected information channels. This approach serves as a step toward building robust quantum interconnects and advancing distributed quantum information technology mediated by topology.</description>

      <title>Scalability of On-chip Diffractive Optical Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18493v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This short report focuses on the scalability challenges of the on-chip diffractive optical neural networks. It addresses an emerging gap in the literature, specifically around the limitations and challenges of scaling optical neural networks on a chip. A thorough investigation of diffractive optical neural networks provides evidence that such networks are not capable of performing complex tasks and exhibit significant performance degradation as the number of classification categories increases. Despite optimizations, these networks classify only 3-4 classes, suggesting fundamental limitations in their computational scale. The inherent scalability challenges in these systems are underscored by the fact that the design parameters, such as the number of diffractive layers, the number of neurons per layer, and the inter-layer distances, cannot substantially change the performance. Therefore, the on-chip diffraction-based approach provides a limited number of controllable degrees of freedom compared to electronic neural networks, restricting the complexity of functions an on-chip diffractive neural network can learn.</description>

      <title>Hybrid integrated ultra-low linewidth coil stabilized isolator-free widely tunable external cavity laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precision applications including quantum computing and sensing, mmWave/RF generation, and metrology, demand widely tunable, ultra-low phase noise lasers. Today, these experiments employ table-scale systems with bulk-optics and isolators to achieve requisite noise, stability, and tunability. Photonic integration will enable scalable, reliable and portable solutions. Here we report a hybrid-integrated external cavity widely tunable laser stabilized to a 10-meter-long integrated coil-resonator, achieving record-low 3 - 7 Hz fundamental linewidth across a 60 nm tuning range and 27 - 60 Hz integral linewidth with 1.8E-13 Allan deviation at 6.4 ms across 40 nm, delivering orders of magnitude frequency noise and integral linewidth reduction over state of the art. Stabilization is achieved without an optical isolator, leveraging resilience to optical feedback of 30 dB beyond that of commercial DFB lasers. The laser and reference cavity are fabricated in the same Si3N4 CMOS-compatible process, unlocking a path towards fully integrated visible to ShortWave-IR frequency stabilized lasers.</description>

Abstract: Thermal emission is naturally spatially incoherent and lacks directionality. Here, we demonstrate that by precisely controlling the spatial temperature distribution within a solid, directional thermal emission can be achieved across a broad spectral range. These anisothermal sources open new avenues for manipulating radiative heat flux at the microscale and hold promise for applications in thermal management and energy conversion, enabling more efficient and targeted thermal control.</description>

      <title>Space-time duality in polariton dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spatial and temporal dynamics of wave propagation are intertwined. A common manifestation of this duality emerges in the spatial and temporal decay of waves as they propagate through a lossy medium. A complete description of the non-Hermitian wave dynamics in such a lossy system, capturing temporal and spatial decays, necessitates the use of complex-valued frequency and/or wavenumber Eigen-values. Here, we demonstrate that the propagation of polaritons - hybrid light-matter quasiparticles - can be broadly controlled in space and time by temporally shaping their photonic excitation. Using time-domain terahertz near-field nanoscopy, we study plasmon polaritons in bilayer graphene at sub-picosecond time scales. Suppressed spatial decay of polaritons is implemented by temporally engineering the excitation waveform. Polaritonic space-time metrology data agree with our dynamic model. Through the experimental realization and visualization of polaritonic space-time duality, we uncover the effects of the spatio-temporal engineering of wave dynamics; these are applicable to acoustic, photonic, plasmonic, and electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Transmission eigenvalue distribution in disordered media from radiant field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a field-theoretic framework, called radiant field theory, to calculate the distribution of transmission eigenvalues for coherent wave propagation in disordered media. At its core is a self-consistent transport equation for a $2\times 2$ matrix radiance, reminiscent of the radiative transfer equation but capable of capturing coherent interference effects. This framework goes beyond the limitations of the Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar theory by accounting for both quasiballistic and diffusive regimes. It also handles open geometries inaccessible to standard wave-equation solvers such as infinite slabs. Analytical and numerical solutions are provided for these geometries, highlighting in particular the impact of the waveguide shape and the grazing modes on the transmission eigenvalue distribution in the quasiballistic regime. By removing the macroscopic assumptions of random matrix models, this microscopic theory enables the calculation of transmission statistics in regimes previously out of reach. It also provides a foundation for exploring more complex observables and physical effects relevant to wavefront shaping in realistic disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Radiant Field Theory: A Transport Approach to Shaped Wave Transmission through Disordered Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a field-theoretic framework to characterize the distribution of transmission eigenvalues for coherent wave propagation through disordered media. The central outcome is a transport equation for a matrix-valued radiance, analogous to the classical radiative transport equation but capable of capturing coherent effects encoded in the transmission matrix. Unlike the Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar (DMPK) theory, our approach does not rely on the isotropy hypothesis, which presumes uniform angular scattering by material slices. As a result, it remains valid beyond the diffusive regime, accurately describing the transmission eigenvalue distribution in the quasiballistic regime as well. Moreover, the framework is more versatile than the DMPK theory, enabling straightforward incorporation of experimental realities such as absorption and incomplete channel control. These factors are frequently encountered in wave experiments on complex media but have lacked an ab initio theoretical treatment until now. We validate our predictions through numerical simulations based on the microscopic wave equation, confirming the accuracy and broad applicability of the theory.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Coherence Peak in Near-Field Radiative Heat Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enhancement and peaks in near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) typically arise due to surface phonon-polaritons, plasmon-polaritons, and electromagnetic (EM) modes in structured materials. However, the role of material quantum coherence in enhancing near-field radiative heat transfer remains unexplored. Here, we unravel that NFRHT in superconductor-ferromagnetic systems displays a unique peak at the superconducting phase transition that originates from the quantum coherence of Bogoliubov quasiparticles in superconductors. Our theory takes into account evanescent EM radiation emanating from fluctuating currents related to Cooper pairs and Bogoliubov quasiparticles in stark contrast to the current-current correlations induced by free electrons in conventional materials. Our proposed NFRHT configuration exploits ferromagnetic resonance at frequencies deep inside the superconducting band gap to isolate this superconducting coherence peak. Furthermore, we reveal that Cooper pairs and Bogoliubov quasiparticles have opposite effects on near-field thermal radiation and isolate their effects on many-body radiative heat transfer near superconductors. Our proposed phenomenon can have applications for developing thermal isolators and heat sinks in superconducting circuits.</description>
