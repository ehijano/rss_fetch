      <title>A dynamical measure of algorithmically infused visibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on the nature of visibility in societies where the behaviours of humans and algorithms influence each other - termed algorithmically infused societies. We propose a quantitative measure of visibility, with implications and applications to an array of disciplines including communication studies, political science, marketing, technology design, and social media analytics. The measure captures the basic characteristics of the visibility of a given topic, in algorithm/AI-mediated communication/social media settings. Topics, when trending, are ranked against each other, and the proposed measure combines the following two attributes of a topic: (i) the amount of time a topic spends at different ranks, and (ii) the different ranks the topic attains. The proposed measure incorporates a tunable parameter, termed the discrimination level, whose value determines the relative weights of the two attributes that contribute to visibility. Analysis of a large-scale, real-time dataset of trending topics, from one of the largest social media platforms, demonstrates that the proposed measure can explain a large share of the variability of the accumulated views of a topic.</description>

      <title>Who Sets the Agenda on Social Media? Ideology and Polarization in Online Debates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abundance of information on social media has reshaped public discussions, shifting attention to the mechanisms that drive online discourse. This study analyzes large-scale Twitter (now X) data from three global debates -- Climate Change, COVID-19, and the Russo-Ukrainian War -- to investigate the structural dynamics of engagement. Our findings reveal that discussions are not primarily shaped by specific categories of actors, such as media or activists, but by shared ideological alignment. Users consistently form polarized communities, where their ideological stance in one debate predicts their positions in others. This polarization transcends individual topics, reflecting a broader pattern of ideological divides. Furthermore, the influence of individual actors within these communities appears secondary to the reinforcing effects of selective exposure and shared narratives. Overall, our results underscore that ideological alignment, rather than actor prominence, plays a central role in structuring online discourse and shaping the spread of information in polarized environments.</description>

      <title>Clustering-induced localization of quantum walks on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum walks on networks are a paradigmatic model in quantum information theory. Quantum-walk algorithms have been developed for various applications, including spatial-search problems, element-distinctness problems, and node centrality analysis. Unlike their classical counterparts, the evolution of quantum walks is unitary, so they do not converge to a stationary distribution. However, it is important for many applications to understand the long-time behavior of quantum walks and the impact of network structure on their evolution. In the present paper, we study the localization of quantum walks on networks. We demonstrate how localization emerges in highly clustered networks that we construct by recursively attaching triangles, and we derive an analytical expression for the long-time inverse participation ratio that depends on products of eigenvectors of the quantum-walk Hamiltonian. Building on the insights from this example, we then show that localization also occurs in Kleinberg navigable small-world networks and Holme--Kim power-law cluster networks. Our results illustrate that local clustering, which is a key structural feature of networks, can induce localization of quantum walks.</description>

      <title>Socio-Emotional Response Generation: A Human Evaluation Protocol for LLM-Based Conversational Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational systems are now capable of producing impressive and generally relevant responses. However, we have no visibility nor control of the socio-emotional strategies behind state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), which poses a problem in terms of their transparency and thus their trustworthiness for critical applications. Another issue is that current automated metrics are not able to properly evaluate the quality of generated responses beyond the dataset's ground truth. In this paper, we propose a neural architecture that includes an intermediate step in planning socio-emotional strategies before response generation. We compare the performance of open-source baseline LLMs to the outputs of these same models augmented with our planning module. We also contrast the outputs obtained from automated metrics and evaluation results provided by human annotators. We describe a novel evaluation protocol that includes a coarse-grained consistency evaluation, as well as a finer-grained annotation of the responses on various social and emotional criteria. Our study shows that predicting a sequence of expected strategy labels and using this sequence to generate a response yields better results than a direct end-to-end generation scheme. It also highlights the divergences and the limits of current evaluation metrics for generated content. The code for the annotation platform and the annotated data are made publicly available for the evaluation of future models.</description>

      <title>'Debunk-It-Yourself': Health Professionals' Strategies for Responding to Misinformation on TikTok</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Misinformation is "sticky" in nature, requiring a considerable effort to undo its influence. One such effort is debunking or exposing the falsity of information. As an abundance of misinformation is on social media, platforms do bear some debunking responsibility in order to preserve their trustworthiness as information providers. A subject of interpretation, platforms poorly meet this responsibility and allow dangerous health misinformation to influence many of their users. This open route to harm did not sit well with health professional users, who recently decided to take the debunking into their own hands. To study this individual debunking effort - which we call 'Debunk-It-Yourself (DIY)' - we conducted an exploratory survey n=14 health professionals who wage a misinformation counter-influence campaign through videos on TikTok. We focused on two topics, nutrition and mental health, which are the ones most often subjected to misinformation on the platform. Our thematic analysis reveals that the counterinfluence follows a common process of initiation, selection, creation, and "stitching" or duetting a debunking video with a misinformation video. The 'Debunk-It-Yourself' effort was underpinned by three unique aspects: (i) it targets trending misinformation claims perceived to be of direct harm to people's health; (ii) it offers a symmetric response to the misinformation; and (iii) it is strictly based on scientific evidence and claimed clinical experience. Contrasting the 'Debunk-It-Yourself' effort with the one TikTok and other platforms (reluctantly) put in moderation, we offer recommendations for a structured response against the misinformation's influence by the users themselves.</description>

      <title>Feature-Based Network Construction: From Sampling to What-if Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks are characterized by structural features, such as degree distribution, triangular closures, and assortativity. This paper addresses the problem of reconstructing instances of continuously (and non-negatively) weighted networks from given feature values. We introduce the gradient-based Feature-Based Network Construction (FBNC) framework. FBNC allows for sampling networks that satisfy prespecified features exactly (hard constraint sampling). Initializing the FBNC gradient descent with a random graph, FBNC can be used as an alternative to exponential random graphs in sampling graphs conditional on given feature values. We establish an implicit regularization approach to the original feature-fitting loss minimization problem so that FBNC achieves a parsimonious change in the underlying graph, where the term "implicit" stems from using appropriate norms in the very construction of the FBNC gradient descent. In constructing the implicit regularization, we distinguish between the case where weights of a link can be chosen from a bounded range, and, the more demanding case, where the weight matrix of the graph constitutes a Markov chain. We show that FBNC expands to "what-if analysis" of networks, that is, for a given initial network and a set of features satisfied by this network, FBNC finds the network closest to the initial network with some of the feature values adjusted or new features added. Numerical experiments in social network management and financial network regulation demonstrate the value of FBNC for graph (re)construction and what-if analysis.</description>

      <title>Dirac-Equation Signal Processing: Physics Boosts Topological Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological signals are variables or features associated with both nodes and edges of a network. Recently, in the context of Topological Machine Learning, great attention has been devoted to signal processing of such topological signals. Most of the previous topological signal processing algorithms treat node and edge signals separately and work under the hypothesis that the true signal is smooth and/or well approximated by a harmonic eigenvector of the Hodge-Laplacian, which may be violated in practice. Here we propose Dirac-equation signal processing, a framework for efficiently reconstructing true signals on nodes and edges, also if they are not smooth or harmonic, by processing them jointly. The proposed physics-inspired algorithm is based on the spectral properties of the topological Dirac operator. It leverages the mathematical structure of the topological Dirac equation to boost the performance of the signal processing algorithm. We discuss how the relativistic dispersion relation obeyed by the topological Dirac equation can be used to assess the quality of the signal reconstruction. Finally, we demonstrate the improved performance of the algorithm with respect to previous algorithms. Specifically, we show that Dirac-equation signal processing can also be used efficiently if the true signal is a non-trivial linear combination of more than one eigenstate of the Dirac equation, as it generally occurs for real signals.</description>

      <title>Citation Sentiment Reflects Multiscale Sociocultural Norms</title>

Abstract: Modern science is formally structured around scholarly publication, where scientific knowledge is canonized through citation. Precisely how citations are given and accrued can provide information about the value of discovery, the history of scientific ideas, the structure of fields, and the space or scope of inquiry. Yet parsing this information has been challenging because citations are not simply present or absent; rather, they differ in purpose, function, and sentiment. In this paper, we investigate how critical and favorable sentiments are distributed across citations, and demonstrate that citation sentiment tracks sociocultural norms across scales of collaboration, discipline, and country. At the smallest scale of individuals, we find that researchers cite scholars they have collaborated with more favorably (and less critically) than scholars they have not collaborated with. Outside collaborative relationships, higher h-index scholars cite lower h-index scholars more critically. At the mesoscale of disciplines, we find that wetlab disciplines tend to be less critical than drylab disciplines, and disciplines that engage in more synthesis through publishing more review articles tend to be less critical. At the largest scale of countries, we find that greater individualism (and lesser acceptance of the unequal distribution of power) is associated with more critical sentiment. Collectively, our results demonstrate how sociocultural factors can explain variations in sentiment in scientific communication. As such, our study contributes to a broader understanding of how human factors influence the practice of science, and underscores the importance of considering the larger sociocultural contexts in which science progresses.</description>

      <title>SimMLP: Training MLPs on Graphs without Supervision</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in various graph learning tasks, yet their reliance on neighborhood aggregation during inference poses challenges for deployment in latency-sensitive applications, such as real-time financial fraud detection. To address this limitation, recent studies have proposed distilling knowledge from teacher GNNs into student Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) trained on node content, aiming to accelerate inference. However, these approaches often inadequately explore structural information when inferring unseen nodes. To this end, we introduce SimMLP, a Self-supervised framework for learning MLPs on graphs, designed to fully integrate rich structural information into MLPs. Notably, SimMLP is the first MLP-learning method that can achieve equivalence to GNNs in the optimal case. The key idea is to employ self-supervised learning to align the representations encoded by graph context-aware GNNs and neighborhood dependency-free MLPs, thereby fully integrating the structural information into MLPs. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, demonstrating the equivalence between SimMLP and GNNs based on mutual information and inductive bias, highlighting SimMLP's advanced structural learning capabilities. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments on 20 benchmark datasets, covering node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, to showcase SimMLP's superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in scenarios involving unseen nodes (e.g., inductive and cold-start node classification) where structural insights are crucial. Our codes are available at: https://github.com/Zehong-Wang/SimMLP.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Loop and Clique Coarsening Algorithm for Graph Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11869v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have made remarkable achievements in graph-level tasks. However, most existing works regard graph structures as a form of guidance or bias for enhancing node representations, which focuses on node-central perspectives and lacks explicit representations of edges and structures. One natural question arises as to whether we can leverage a hypernode to represent some structures. Through experimental analysis, we explore the feasibility of this assumption. Based on our findings, we propose an efficient Loop and Clique Coarsening algorithm with linear complexity for Graph Classification (LCC4GC) on GT architecture. Specifically, we build three unique views, original, coarsening, and conversion, to learn a thorough structural representation. We compress loops and cliques via hierarchical heuristic graph coarsening and restrict them with well-designed constraints, which builds the coarsening view to learn high-level interactions between structures. We also introduce line graphs for edge embeddings and switch to edge-central perspective to alleviate the impact of coarsening reduction. Experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the improvements of LCC4GC over 31 baselines from various architectures.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the interplay between egocentric preference and urban structure in shaping human mobility has profound implications for improving epidemic intervention, social equity, and urban resilience. However, numerous existing studies either solely identify the egocentric preferences -- the anchoring effects from home -- or the impact of hierarchical urban structures. Here, we propose a network-based approach to present human mobility in both spatial and topological aspects within the urban system, using cell phone trajectory data from millions of users across three countries. By segmenting mobility trajectories into modules and examining their overlap with urban scales, we have observed the inflation law that the geospatial extent of these modules increases sub-linearly with their distance from home. Moreover, the egocentric preference for higher urban levels leads to this increase. This universal finding indicates that home-based preferences distort the hierarchical scales of human mobility in the urban environment, regardless of demographics or geography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order graph neural networks (HOGNNs) and the related architectures from Topological Deep Learning are an important class of GNN models that harness polyadic relations between vertices beyond plain edges. They have been used to eliminate issues such as over-smoothing or over-squashing, to significantly enhance the accuracy of GNN predictions, to improve the expressiveness of GNN architectures, and for numerous other goals. A plethora of HOGNN models have been introduced, and they come with diverse neural architectures, and even with different notions of what the "higher-order" means. This richness makes it very challenging to appropriately analyze and compare HOGNN models, and to decide in what scenario to use specific ones. To alleviate this, we first design an in-depth taxonomy and a blueprint for HOGNNs. This facilitates designing models that maximize performance. Then, we use our taxonomy to analyze and compare the available HOGNN models. The outcomes of our analysis are synthesized in a set of insights that help to select the most beneficial GNN model in a given scenario, and a comprehensive list of challenges and opportunities for further research into more powerful HOGNNs.</description>

      <title>GRAND : Graph Reconstruction from potential partial Adjacency and Neighborhood Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cryptographic approaches, such as secure multiparty computation, can be used to compute in a secure manner the function of a distributed graph without centralizing the data of each participant. However, the output of the protocol itself can leak sensitive information about the structure of the original graph. In particular, in this work we propose an approach by which an adversary observing the result of a private protocol for the computation of the number of common neighbors between all pairs of vertices, can reconstruct the adjacency matrix of the graph. In fact, this can only be done up to co-squareness, a notion we introduce, as two different graphs can have the same matrix of common neighbors. We consider two models of adversary, one who observes the common neighbors matrix only, and a knowledgeable one, that has a partial knowledge of the original graph. Our results demonstrate that secure multiparty protocols are not enough for privacy protection, especially in the context of highly structured data such as graphs. The reconstruction that we propose is interesting in itself from the point of view of graph theory.</description>
