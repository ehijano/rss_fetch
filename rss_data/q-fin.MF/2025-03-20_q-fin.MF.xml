      <title>Modelling High-Frequency Data with Bivariate Hawkes Processes: Power-Law vs. Exponential Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the application of Hawkes processes to model high-frequency data in the context of limit order books. Two distinct Hawkes-based models are proposed and analyzed: one utilizing exponential kernels and the other employing power-law kernels. These models are implemented within a bivariate framework. The performance of each model is evaluated using high-frequency trading data, with a focus on their ability to reproduce key statistical properties of limit order books. Through a comprehensive comparison, we identify the strengths and limitations of each kernel type, providing insights into their suitability for modeling high-frequency financial data. Simulations are conducted to validate the models, and the results are interpreted. Based on these insights, a trading strategy is formulated.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Volatility Model with Sticky Drawdown and Drawup Processes: A Deep Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new financial model, the stochastic volatility model with sticky drawdown and drawup processes (SVSDU model), which enables us to capture the features of winning and losing streaks that are common across financial markets but can not be captured simultaneously by the existing financial models. Moreover, the SVSDU model retains the advantages of the stochastic volatility models. Since there are not closed-form option pricing formulas under the SVSDU model and the existing simulation methods for the sticky diffusion processes are really time-consuming, we develop a deep neural network to solve the corresponding high-dimensional parametric partial differential equation (PDE), where the solution to the PDE is the pricing function of a European option according to the Feynman-Kac Theorem, and validate the accuracy and efficiency of our deep learning approach. We also propose a novel calibration framework for our model, and demonstrate the calibration performances of our models on both simulated data and historical data. The calibration results on SPX option data show that the SVSDU model is a good representation of the asset value dynamic, and both winning and losing streaks are accounted for in option values. Our model opens new horizons for modeling and predicting the dynamics of asset prices in financial markets.</description>

      <title>The fundamental representation of pricing adjustments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article consolidates and extends past work on derivative pricing adjustments, including XVA, by providing an encapsulating representation of the adjustment between any two derivative pricing functions, within an Ito SDE/parabolic PDE framework. We give examples of this representation encapsulating others from the past 20 years, ranging from a well known option pricing adjustment introduced by Gatheral, to the collection of semi-replication XVA originating from Burgard &amp; Kjaer. To highlight extensions, we discuss certain meta-adjustments beyond XVA, designed to help signal and mitigate XVA model risk.</description>

      <title>Model-independent upper bounds for the prices of Bermudan options with convex payoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose $\mu$ and $\nu$ are probability measures on $\mathbb R$ satisfying $\mu \leq_{cx} \nu$. Let $a$ and $b$ be convex functions on $\mathbb R$ with $a \geq b \geq 0$. We are interested in finding \[ \sup_{\mathcal M} \sup_{\tau} \mathbb{E}^{\mathcal M} \left[ a(X) I_{ \{ \tau = 1 \} } + b(Y) I_{ \{ \tau = 2 \} } \right] \] where the first supremum is taken over consistent models $\mathcal M$ (i.e., filtered probability spaces $(\Omega, \mathcal F, \mathbb F, \mathbb P)$) such that $Z=(z,Z_1,Z_2)=(\int_{\mathbb R} x \mu(dx) = \int_{\mathbb R} y \nu(dy), X, Y)$ is a $(\mathbb F,\mathbb P)$ martingale, where $X$ has law $\mu$ and $Y$ has law $\nu$ under $\mathbb P$) and $\tau$ in the second supremum is a $(\mathbb F,\mathbb P)$-stopping time taking values in $\{1,2\}$.
  Our contributions are first to characterise and simplify the dual problem, and second to completely solve the problem in the symmetric case under the dispersion assumption. A key finding is that the canonical set-up in which the filtration is that generated by $Z$ is not rich enough to define an optimal model and additional randomisation is required. This holds even though the marginal laws $\mu$ and $\nu$ are atom-free.
  The problem has an interpretation of finding the robust, or model-free, no-arbitrage bound on the price of a Bermudan option with two possible exercise dates, given the prices of co-maturing European options.</description>
