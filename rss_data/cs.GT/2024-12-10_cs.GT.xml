      <title>Promoting Cooperation in the Public Goods Game using Artificial Intelligent Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tragedy of the commons illustrates a fundamental social dilemma where individual rational actions lead to collectively undesired outcomes, threatening the sustainability of shared resources. Strategies to escape this dilemma, however, are in short supply. In this study, we explore how artificial intelligence (AI) agents can be leveraged to enhance cooperation in public goods games, moving beyond traditional regulatory approaches to using AI as facilitators of cooperation. We investigate three scenarios: (1) Mandatory Cooperation Policy for AI Agents, where AI agents are institutionally mandated always to cooperate; (2) Player-Controlled Agent Cooperation Policy, where players evolve control over AI agents' likelihood to cooperate; and (3) Agents Mimic Players, where AI agents copy the behavior of players. Using a computational evolutionary model with a population of agents playing public goods games, we find that only when AI agents mimic player behavior does the critical synergy threshold for cooperation decrease, effectively resolving the dilemma. This suggests that we can leverage AI to promote collective well-being in societal dilemmas by designing AI agents to mimic human players.</description>

      <title>A Game-Theoretic Framework for Privacy-Aware Client Sampling in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to design a Privacy-aware Client Sampling framework in Federated learning, named FedPCS, to tackle the heterogeneous client sampling issues and improve model performance. First, we obtain a pioneering upper bound for the accuracy loss of the FL model with privacy-aware client sampling probabilities. Based on this, we model the interactions between the central server and participating clients as a two-stage Stackelberg game. In Stage I, the central server designs the optimal time-dependent reward for cost minimization by considering the trade-off between the accuracy loss of the FL model and the rewards allocated. In Stage II, each client determines the correction factor that dynamically adjusts its privacy budget based on the reward allocated to maximize its utility. To surmount the obstacle of approximating other clients' private information, we introduce the mean-field estimator to estimate the average privacy budget. We analytically demonstrate the existence and convergence of the fixed point for the mean-field estimator and derive the Stackelberg Nash Equilibrium to obtain the optimal strategy profile. By rigorously theoretical convergence analysis, we guarantee the robustness of FedPCS. Moreover, considering the conventional sampling strategy in privacy-preserving FL, we prove that the random sampling approach's PoA can be arbitrarily large. To remedy such efficiency loss, we show that the proposed privacy-aware client sampling strategy successfully reduces PoA, which is upper bounded by a reachable constant. To address the challenge of varying privacy requirements throughout different training phases in FL, we extend our model and analysis and derive the adaptive optimal sampling ratio for the central server. Experimental results on different datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedPCS compared with the existing SOTA FL strategies under IID and Non-IID datasets.</description>

      <title>Charting the Shapes of Stories with Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stories are records of our experiences and their analysis reveals insights into the nature of being human. Successful analyses are often interdisciplinary, leveraging mathematical tools to extract structure from stories and insights from structure. Historically, these tools have been restricted to one dimensional charts and dynamic social networks; however, modern AI offers the possibility of identifying more fully the plot structure, character incentives, and, importantly, counterfactual plot lines that the story could have taken but did not take. In this work, we use AI to model the structure of stories as game-theoretic objects, amenable to quantitative analysis. This allows us to not only interrogate each character's decision making, but also possibly peer into the original author's conception of the characters' world. We demonstrate our proposed technique on Shakespeare's famous Romeo and Juliet. We conclude with a discussion of how our analysis could be replicated in broader contexts, including real-life scenarios.</description>

      <title>Blotto on the Ballot: A Ballot Stuffing Blotto Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the following Colonel Blotto game between parties $P_1$ and $P_A.$ $P_1$ deploys a non negative number of troops across $J$ battlefields, while $P_A$ chooses $K,$ $K &lt; J,$ battlefields to remove all of $P_1$'s troops from the chosen battlefields. $P_1$ has the objective of maximizing the number of surviving troops while $P_A$ wants to minimize it. Drawing an analogy with ballot stuffing by a party contesting an election and the countermeasures by the Election Commission to negate that, we call this the Ballot Stuffing Game. For this zero-sum resource allocation game, we obtain the set of Nash equilibria as a solution to a convex combinatorial optimization problem. We analyze this optimization problem and obtain insights into the several non trivial features of the equilibrium behavior. These features in turn allows to describe the structure of the solutions and efficient algorithms to obtain then. The model is described as ballot stuffing game in a plebiscite but has applications in security and auditing games. The results are extended to a parliamentary election model. Numerical examples illustrate applications of the game.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Tullock Contests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the algorithmic complexity of computing the pure Nash Equilibrium (PNE) in Tullock contests. A key aspect of this analysis lies in the elasticity parameter $r_i$, which dictates whether a contestant $i$'s cost function is convex, concave, or neither. Our primary contribution is the identification of how the domains of $r_i$ govern the computational complexity of solving Tullock contests. Specifically, we establish the following results:
  - Efficient Algorithms for $r_i \notin (1,2]$: When no contestant's elasticity parameter $r_i$ lies within the interval $(1,2]$, we show that an efficient algorithm can be designed to compute the pure Nash Equilibrium.
  - Hardness Results for $r_i \in (1,2]$: When many $r_i$ values fall within the interval $(1,2]$, we prove that determining the existence of a pure Nash Equilibrium cannot be achieved in polynomial time, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH).
  - Approximation Algorithms for $r_i \in (1,2]$: In cases where many $r_i$ values fall within the interval $(1,2]$, we propose a Fully Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (FPTAS) to compute an $\epsilon$-approximate PNE, provided an exact PNE exists.
  All our algorithms are implemented efficiently to handle large-scale instances. Computational experiments validate their effectiveness, even under challenging scenarios with complex elasticity distributions.</description>

      <title>EFX Allocations on Some Multi-graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of EFX allocations is one of the most significant open questions in fair division. Recent work by Christodolou, Fiat, Koutsoupias, and Sgouritsa ("Fair allocation in graphs", EC 2023) establishes the existence of EFX allocations for graphical valuations, when agents are vertices in a graph, items are edges, and each item has zero value for all agents other than those at its end-points. Thus in this setting, each good has non-zero value for at most two agents, and there is at most one good valued by any pair of agents. This marks one of the few cases when an exact and complete EFX allocation is known to exist for arbitrary agents.
  In this work, we extend these results to multi-graphs, when each pair of vertices can have more than one edge between them. The existence of EFX allocations in multi-graphs is a natural open question given their existence in simple graphs. We show that EFX allocations exist, and can be computed in polynomial time, for agents with cancellable valuations in the following cases: (i) bipartite multi-graphs, (ii) multi-trees with monotone valuations, and (iii) multi-graphs with girth $(2t-1)$, where $t$ is the chromatic number of the multi-graph. The existence in multi-cycles follows from (i) and (iii).</description>

      <title>Collaborative and parametric insurance on the Ethereum blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a blockchain-based insurance scheme that integrates parametric and collaborative elements. A pool of investors, referred to as surplus providers, locks funds in a smart contract, enabling blockchain users to underwrite parametric insurance contracts. These contracts automatically trigger compensation when predefined conditions are met. The collaborative aspect is embodied in the generation of tokens, which are distributed to both surplus providers and policyholders. These tokens represent each participant's share of the surplus and grant voting rights for management decisions. The smart contract is developed in Solidity, a high-level programming language for the Ethereum blockchain, and deployed on the Sepolia testnet, with data processing and analysis conducted using Python. In addition, open-source code is provided and main research challenges are identified, so that further research can be carried out to overcome limitations of this first proof of concept.</description>

      <title>Undergraduate Course Allocation through Competitive Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prevailing methods of course allocation at undergraduate institutions involve reserving seats to give priority to designated groups of students. We introduce a competitive equilibrium-based mechanism that assigns course seats using student preferences and course priorities. This mechanism satisfies approximate notions of stability, efficiency, envy-freeness, and strategy-proofness. We evaluate its performance relative to a mechanism widely used in practice using preferences estimated from university data. Our empirical findings demonstrate an improvement in student satisfaction and allocation fairness. The number of students who envy another student of weakly lower priority declines by 8 percent, or roughly 500 students.</description>

      <title>The emergence of chaos in population game dynamics induced by comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise description of population game dynamics introduced by revision protocols - an economic model describing the agent's propensity to switch to a better-performing strategy - is of importance in economics and social sciences in general. In this setting innovation or imitation of others is the force which drives the evolution of the economic system. As the continuous-time game dynamics is relatively well understood, the same cannot be said about revision driven dynamics in the discrete time. We investigate the behavior of agents in a $2\times 2$ anti-coordination game with symmetric random matching and a unique mixed Nash equilibrium. In continuous time the Nash equilibrium is attracting and induces a global evolutionary stable state. We show that in the discrete time one can construct (either innovative or imitative) revision protocol and choose a level of the time step, under which the game dynamics is Li-Yorke chaotic, inducing complex and unpredictable behavior of the system, precluding stable predictions of equilibrium. Moreover, we reveal that this unpredictability is encoded into any imitative revision protocol. Furthermore, we show that for any such game there exists a perturbed pairwise proportional imitation protocol introducing chaotic behavior of the agents for sufficiently large time step.</description>

      <title>A Cardinality-Constrained Approach to Combinatorial Bilevel Congestion Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial bilevel congestion pricing (CBCP), a variant of the discrete network design problem, seeks to minimize the total travel time experienced by all travelers in a road network, by strategically selecting toll locations and determining the corresponding charges. Conventional wisdom suggests that these problems are intractable since they have to be formulated and solved with a significant number of integer variables. Here, we devise a scalable local algorithm for the CBCP problem that guarantees convergence to a Kuhn-Tucker-Karush point. Our approach is novel in that it eliminates the use of integer variables altogether, instead introducing a cardinality constraint that limits the number of toll locations to a user-specified upper bound. The resulting bilevel program with the cardinality constraint is then transformed into a block-separable, single-level optimization problem that can be solved efficiently after penalization and decomposition. We are able to apply the algorithm to solve, in about 20 minutes, a CBCP instance with up to 3,000 links, of which hundreds can be tolled. To the best of our knowledge, no existing algorithm can solve CBCP problems at such a scale while providing any assurance of convergence.</description>

      <title>Reasoning about Strategic Abilities in Stochastic Multi-agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning about strategic abilities is key to AI systems comprising multiple agents, which provide a unified framework for formalizing various problems in game theory, social choice theory, etc. In this work, we propose a probabilistic extension of the alternating-time $\mu$-calculus (AMC), named PAMC, for reasoning about the strategic abilities of agents in stochastic multi-agent systems. We show that PAMC subsumes two existing logics AMC and P$\mu$TL (a probabilistic extension of the modal $\mu$-calculus), but is incomparable with the probabilistic alternating-time temporal logic (PATL). We study the problems of model checking and satisfiability checking for PAMC. We first give a model checking algorithm by leveraging algorithms for solving normal-form games and AMC model checking. We establish that the model checking problem of PAMC remains in UP$\cap$co-UP, the same complexity class as the model checking problem for AMC and P$\mu$TL. We also provide a new reduction from the satisfiability problem of PAMC to solving parity games, by which we obtain an EXPTIME decision procedure, as well as the small model property which allows us to construct a model for each satisfiable PAMC formula. Satisfiability in PAMC has the same complexity as in the modal $\mu$-calculus, unlike PCTL and PATL whose satisfiability checking problems remain open. We have implemented both the model checking and satisfiability checking algorithms as open-source tools. Experimental results are reported, showcasing the practical applications and effectiveness of our approaches.</description>

      <title>Implications of Distance over Redistricting Maps: Central and Outlier Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.00872v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In representative democracy, a redistricting map is chosen to partition an electorate into districts which each elects a representative. A valid redistricting map must satisfy a collection of constraints such as being compact, contiguous, and of almost-equal population. However, these constraints are loose enough to enable an enormous ensemble of valid redistricting maps. This enables a partisan legislature to gerrymander by choosing a map which unfairly favors it. In this paper, we introduce an interpretable and tractable distance measure over redistricting maps which does not use election results and study its implications over the ensemble of redistricting maps. Specifically, we define a central map which may be considered "most typical" and give a rigorous justification for it by showing that it mirrors the Kemeny ranking in a scenario where we have a committee voting over a collection of redistricting maps to be drawn. We include running time and sample complexity analysis for our algorithms, including some negative results which hold using any algorithm. We further study outlier detection based on this distance measure and show that our framework can detect some gerrymandered maps. More precisely, we show some maps that are widely considered to be gerrymandered that lie very far away from our central maps in comparison to a large ensemble of valid redistricting maps. Since our distance measure does not rely on election results, this gives a significant advantage in gerrymandering detection which is lacking in all previous methods.</description>

      <title>Online Contention Resolution Schemes for Network Revenue Management and Combinatorial Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Network Revenue Management (NRM) problem, products composed of up to L resources are sold to stochastically arriving customers. We take a randomized rounding approach to NRM, motivated by the modern tool of Online Contention Resolution Schemes (OCRS). The goal is to take a fractional solution to NRM that satisfies the resource constraints in expectation, and implement it in an online policy that satisfies the resource constraints with probability 1, while (approximately) preserving all of the sales that were prescribed by the fractional solution.
  In NRM problems, customer substitution induces a negative correlation between products being demanded, making it difficult to apply the standard definition of OCRS. We start by deriving a more powerful notion of "random-element" OCRS that achieves a guarantee of 1/(1+L) for NRM with customer substitution, matching a common benchmark in the literature. We show this benchmark is unbeatable for all integers L that are the power of a prime number. We then show how to beat this benchmark under three widely applied assumptions. Finally, we show that under several assumptions, it is possible to do better than offline CRS when L&gt;= 5.
  Our results have corresponding implications for Online Combinatorial Auctions, in which buyers bid for bundles of up to L items, and buyers being single-minded is akin to having no substitution. Our result under the assumption that products comprise one item from each of up to L groups implies that 1/(1+L) can be beaten for Prophet Inequality on the intersection of L partition matroids, a problem of interest. In sum, our paper shows how to apply OCRS to all of these problems and establishes a surprising separation in the achievable guarantees when substitution is involved, under general resource constraints parametrized by L.</description>

      <title>Honor Among Bandits: No-Regret Learning for Online Fair Division</title>

Abstract: We consider the problem of online fair division of indivisible goods to players when there are a finite number of types of goods and player values are drawn from distributions with unknown means. Our goal is to maximize social welfare subject to allocating the goods fairly in expectation. When a player's value for an item is unknown at the time of allocation, we show that this problem reduces to a variant of (stochastic) multi-armed bandits, where there exists an arm for each player's value for each type of good. At each time step, we choose a distribution over arms which determines how the next item is allocated. We consider two sets of fairness constraints for this problem: envy-freeness in expectation and proportionality in expectation. Our main result is the design of an explore-then-commit algorithm that achieves $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ regret while maintaining either fairness constraint. This result relies on unique properties fundamental to fair-division constraints that allow faster rates of learning, despite the restricted action space. We also prove a lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}(T^{2/3})$ regret for our setting, showing that our results are tight.</description>

      <title>Almost Envy-free Allocation of Indivisible Goods: A Tale of Two Valuations</title>

Abstract: The existence of $\textsf{EFX}$ allocations stands as one of the main challenges in discrete fair division.In this paper, we present symmetrical results on the existence of $\textsf{EFX}$ and its approximate variations for two distinct valuations: restricted additive valuations and $(p,q)$-bounded valuations introduced by Christodoulou \etal \cite{christodoulou2023fair}. In a $(p,q)$-bounded instance, each good has relevance for at most $p$ agents, and any pair of agents shares at most $q$ common relevant goods.
  We show that instances with $(\infty,1)$-bounded valuations admit $\textsf{EF2X}$ allocations and $\textsf{EFX}$ allocations with at most $\lfloor {n}/{2} \rfloor - 1$ discarded goods, mirroring results for the restricted additive setting \cite{akrami2022ef2x}. We also present ${({\sqrt{2}}/{2})\textsf{-EFX}}$ algorithms for both restricted additive and $(\infty,1)$-bounded subadditive settings. The symmetry of these results suggests these valuations share symmetric structures. Building on this, we propose an $\textsf{EFX}$ allocation for restricted additive valuations when $p=2$ and $q=\infty$.
  To achieve these results, we further develop the rank concept introduced by Farhadi \etal \cite{farhadi2021almost} and introduce several new concepts such as virtual value, rankpath, and root, which advance the overall understanding of $\textsf{EFX}$ allocations. In addition, we suggest an updating rule based on the virtual values which we believe will lead to broader and more generalized results on $\textsf{EFX}$.</description>

      <title>Responding to Promises: No-regret learning against followers with memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a repeated Stackelberg game setup where the leader faces a sequence of followers of unknown types and must learn what commitments to make. While previous works have considered followers that best respond to the commitment announced by the leader in every round, we relax this setup in two ways. Motivated by natural scenarios where the leader's reputation factors into how the followers choose their response, we consider followers with memory. Specifically, we model followers that base their response on not just the leader's current commitment but on an aggregate of their past commitments. In developing learning strategies that the leader can employ against such followers, we make the second relaxation and assume boundedly rational followers. In particular, we focus on followers employing quantal responses. Interestingly, we observe that the smoothness property offered by the quantal response (QR) model helps in addressing the challenge posed by learning against followers with memory. Utilizing techniques from online learning, we develop algorithms that guarantee $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret for quantal responding memory-less followers and $O(\sqrt{BT})$ regret for followers with bounded memory of length $B$ with both scaling polynomially in game parameters.</description>

      <title>The Partially Observable Off-Switch Game</title>

Abstract: A wide variety of goals could cause an AI to disable its off switch because "you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead" (Russell 2019). Prior theoretical work on this shutdown problem assumes that humans know everything that AIs do. In practice, however, humans have only limited information. Moreover, in many of the settings where the shutdown problem is most concerning, AIs might have vast amounts of private information. To capture these differences in knowledge, we introduce the Partially Observable Off-Switch Game (PO-OSG), a game-theoretic model of the shutdown problem with asymmetric information. Unlike when the human has full observability, we find that in optimal play, even AI agents assisting perfectly rational humans sometimes avoid shutdown. As expected, increasing the amount of communication or information available always increases (or leaves unchanged) the agents' expected common payoff. But counterintuitively, introducing bounded communication can make the AI defer to the human less in optimal play even though communication mitigates information asymmetry. In particular, communication sometimes enables new optimal behavior requiring strategic AI deference to achieve outcomes that were previously inaccessible. Thus, designing safe artificial agents in the presence of asymmetric information requires careful consideration of the tradeoffs between maximizing payoffs (potentially myopically) and maintaining AIs' incentives to defer to humans.</description>

      <title>FairSort: Learning to Fair Rank for Personalized Recommendations in Two-Sided Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional recommendation systems focus on maximizing user satisfaction by suggesting their favourite items. This user-centric approach may lead to unfair exposure distribution among the providers. On the contrary, a provider-centric design might become unfair to the users. Therefore, this paper proposes a re-ranking model FairSort to find a trade-off solution among user-side fairness, provider-side fairness, and personalized recommendations utility. Previous works habitually treat this issue as a knapsack problem, incorporating both-side fairness as constraints.
  In this paper, we adopt a novel perspective, treating each recommendation list as a runway rather than a knapsack. In this perspective, each item on the runway gains a velocity and runs within a specific time, achieving re-ranking for both-side fairness. Meanwhile, we ensure the Minimum Utility Guarantee for personalized recommendations by designing a Binary Search approach. This can provide more reliable recommendations compared to the conventional greedy strategy based on the knapsack problem. We further broaden the applicability of FairSort, designing two versions for online and offline recommendation scenarios. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on real-world datasets indicate that FairSort can ensure more reliable personalized recommendations while considering fairness for both the provider and user.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Core Stability Relaxations in Hedonic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study relationships between different relaxed notions of core stability in hedonic games, which are a class of coalition formation games. Our unified approach applies to a newly introduced family of hedonic games, called $\alpha$-hedonic games, which contains previously studied variants such as fractional and additively separable hedonic games. In particular, we derive an upper bound on the maximum factor with which a blocking coalition of a certain size can improve upon an outcome in which no deviating coalition of size at most $q$ exists. Counterintuitively, we show that larger blocking coalitions might sometimes have lower improvement factors. We discuss the tightness conditions of our bound, as well as its implications on the price of anarchy of core relaxations. Our general result has direct implications for several well-studied classes of hedonic games, allowing us to prove two open conjectures by Fanelli et al. (2021) for fractional hedonic games.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Fusion Balancing Through Game-Theoretic Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal learning can complete the picture of information extraction by uncovering key dependencies between data sources. However, current systems fail to fully leverage multiple modalities for optimal performance. This has been attributed to modality competition, where modalities strive for training resources, leaving some underoptimized. We show that current balancing methods struggle to train multimodal models that surpass even simple baselines, such as ensembles. This raises the question: how can we ensure that all modalities in multimodal training are sufficiently trained, and that learning from new modalities consistently improves performance? This paper proposes the Multimodal Competition Regularizer (MCR), a new loss component inspired by mutual information (MI) decomposition designed to prevent the adverse effects of competition in multimodal training. Our key contributions are: 1) Introducing game-theoretic principles in multimodal learning, where each modality acts as a player competing to maximize its influence on the final outcome, enabling automatic balancing of the MI terms. 2) Refining lower and upper bounds for each MI term to enhance the extraction of task-relevant unique and shared information across modalities. 3) Suggesting latent space permutations for conditional MI estimation, significantly improving computational efficiency. MCR outperforms all previously suggested training strategies and is the first to consistently improve multimodal learning beyond the ensemble baseline, clearly demonstrating that combining modalities leads to significant performance gains on both synthetic and large real-world datasets.</description>
