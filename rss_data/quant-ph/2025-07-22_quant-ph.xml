      <title>Bipartite quantum states admitting a causal explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The statistics of local measurements of joint quantum systems can sometimes be used to distinguish the temporal order in which they were measured. We first prove that every bipartite separable density matrix is temporally compatible with direct causal influence for arbitrary finite-dimensional quantum systems and measurements of a tomographically-complete class of observables, which includes all Pauli observables in the case of multi-qubit systems. Equivalently, if a bipartite density matrix is not temporally compatible with direct causal influence, then it must be entangled. We also provide an operational meaning for the temporal evolution consistent with such correlations in terms of a generalized dephasing channel and a pretty good measurement. The two temporal evolutions turn out to not be Petz recovery maps of each other, but are Bayesian inverses of each other. Finally, we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary bipartite quantum state to be temporally compatible, thereby providing a temporal analogue of the positive partial transpose criterion valid for quantum systems of any dimension.</description>

      <title>Polar Codes for Erasure and Unital Classical-Quantum Markovian Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider classical-quantum (cq-)channels with memory, and establish that Ar{\i}kan-constructed polar codes achieve the classical capacity for two key noise models, namely for (i) qubit erasures and (ii) unital qubit noise with channel state information at the receiver. The memory in the channel is assumed to be governed by a discrete-time, countable-state, aperiodic, irreducible, and positive recurrent Markov process. We establish this result by leveraging existing classical polar coding guarantees established for finite-state, aperiodic, and irreducible Markov processes [FAIM], alongside the recent finding that no entanglement is required to achieve the capacity of Markovian unital and erasure quantum channels when transmitting classical information. More broadly, our work illustrates that for cq-channels with memory, where an optimal coding strategy is essentially classical, polar codes can be shown to approach the capacity.</description>

      <title>Quantum $1/f^\eta$ Noise Induced Relaxation in the Spin-Boson Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the spin-boson model of open quantum systems to the regime of quantum $1/f^\eta$ noise characterized by negative exponents of its spectral distribution. Using the numerically exact time-evolving matrix product operator, we find the dynamic regime diagram, including pseudocoherent dynamics controlled by quantum $1/f^\eta$ noise. We determine the dephasing rate and find for it an empirical formula valid at zero temperature. The bath reorganization energy depends on the infrared bath cutoff frequency, revealing an increased sensitivity of the dephasing on the measurement time of an experiment. \ep{Our results apply to a qubit as an elementary building block of a quantum computer and pave the way towards a quantum treatment of low-frequency noise in more complex architectures.</description>

      <title>Affine Equivalence in the Clifford Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove a collection of results on the structure of permutations in the Clifford Hierarchy. First, we leverage results from the cryptography literature on affine equivalence classes of 4-bit permutations which we use to find all 4-qubit permutations in the Clifford Hierarchy. We then use the classification of 4-qubit permutations and previous results on the structure of diagonal gates in the Clifford Hierarchy to prove that all 4-qubit gates in the third level of the Clifford Hierarchy are semi-Clifford. Finally, we introduce the formalism of cycle structures to permutations in the Clifford Hierarchy and prove a general structure theorem about them. We also classify many small cycle structures up to affine equivalence. Interestingly, this classification is independent of the number of qubits.</description>

      <title>Quasi-degenerate resonant eigenstate doublets of two quantum emitters in a closed waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics of systems of quantum emitters is significantly influenced by the relation between their spatial separation and the wavelength of the emitted photons. If the distance that separates a pair of emitters meets specific resonance conditions, the photons produced from decay may destructively interfere. In an infinite-wavelength setting, this effect gives rise to bound states in the continuum, where a photon remains confined in between the emitter. In the case of a finite-length waveguide with two periodic boundary conditions, the relevant distances become two, leading to states in which a photon is confined in either the shorter or the longer path that connects the emitters. If the ratio of the shorter and the longer path is a rational number, these two kinds of resonant states are allowed to co-exist in the same Hamiltonian. In this paper, we investigate the existence of quasi-degenerate resonant doublets of a pair of identical emitters coupled to a linear waveguide mode. The states that form the doublet are searched among the ones in which a single excitation tends to remain bound to the emitters. We investigate the spectrum in a finite range around degeneracy points to check whether the doublet remains well separated from the closest eigenvalues in the spectrum. The identification of quasi-degenerate doublets opens the possibility to manipulate the emitters-waveguide system as an effectively two-level system in specific energy ranges, providing an innovative tool for quantum technology tasks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Internet in a Nutshell -- Advancing Quantum Communication with Ion Traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Internet in a Nutshell (QI-Nutshell) connects the fields of quantum communication and quantum computing by emulating quantum communication protocols on currently available ion-trap quantum computers. We demonstrate emulations of QKD protocols where the individual steps are mapped to physical operations within our hardware platform. This allows us to not only practically execute established protocols such as BB84 or BBM92, but also include cloning attacks by an eavesdropping party, noise sources and side-channel attacks that are generally hard to include in theoretical QKD security proofs. We deliberately inject noise and investigate its effect on quantum communication protocols. We employ numerical simulations in order to study the incorporation of small quantum error correction (QEC) codes into QKD protocols. We find that these codes can help to suppress the noise level and to monitor the noise profile of the channel. This may enable the communicating parties to detect suspicious deviations from expected noise characteristics as a result of potential eavesdropping. This suggests that QEC may serve as a means of privacy authentication for quantum communication without altering the transmitted quantum information.</description>

      <title>An Effective Reflection Mode Measurement for Hanger-Coupled Microwave Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting microwave resonators are used to study two-level system (TLS) loss in superconducting quantum devices. Fano asymmetry, characterized by a nonzero asymmetry angle $\phi$ in the diameter correction method (DCM), results from the coupling schemes used to measure these devices, including the commonly used hanger method. $\phi$ is an additional fitting parameter which contains no physically interesting information and can obscure device parameters of interest. The tee-junction symmetry nominally present in these resonator devices provides an avenue for the elimination of Fano asymmetry using calibrated measurement. We show that the eigenvalue associated with the common mode excitation of the resonator is an effective reflection mode (ERM) which has no Fano asymmetry. Our analysis reveals the cause of Fano asymmetry as interference between common and differential modes. Practically, we obtain the ERM from a linear combination of calibrated reflection and transmission measurements. We utilize a 3D aluminum cavity to experimentally demonstrate the validity and flexibility of this model. To extend the usefulness of this symmetry analysis, we apply perturbation theory to recover the ERM in a multiplexed coplanar waveguide resonator device and experimentally demonstrate quantitative agreement in the extracted $Q_i^{-1}$ between hanger mode and ERM measurements. We observe a five-fold reduction in uncertainty from the ERM compared to the standard hanger mode at the lowest measured power, -160 dBm delivered to the device. This method could facilitate an increase in throughput of low-power superconducting resonator measurements by up to a factor of 25, as well as allow the extraction of critical parameters from otherwise unfittable device data.</description>

      <title>Multipartite entanglement from ditstrings for 1+1D systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that multipartite entanglement can be used as an efficient way of identifying the critical points of 1+1D systems. We demonstrate this with the quantum Ising model, lattice $\lambda \phi^4$ approximated with qutrits, and arrays of Rydberg atoms. To do so we make use of multipartite compositions of entanglement quantities for different parts combined to form the strong subadditivity, weak monotonicity, and a convex combination of these with conformal properties. These quantities display some remarkable properties. We will demonstrate how the entanglement of individual parts together displays behavior at phase boundaries, but the combination of these in the aforementioned quantities sharpens and localizes this behavior to the boundaries even better. We will show that we can extend a scheme for approximating the entanglement with the mutual information, and that this acts as a lower bound which will also follow the changes in the entanglement for the above quantities, despite the additional contributions of different signs. This mutual information approximation to the identifying quantities can have its lower probabilities removed in a process we call filtering, and despite the combination of terms will respond well to the filtering and offer improvements to the lower bound.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity, quasi-deterministic entanglement generation using phase-matched spectral islands in a zero-added-loss multiplexing architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While photonic entanglement generation and distribution are well developed, their demonstrated rates are far below what is needed for a quantum internet. The present paper proposes and analyzes a scheme for spectral multiplexing that provides entanglement-distribution rates well in excess of the state of the art. It builds on the idea presented by Chen~\emph{et al}.~[Phys. Rev. Appl. {\bf 19}, 054209 (2023)], who proposed zero-added-loss multiplexing (ZALM) as a means for high-fidelity, quasi-deterministic entanglement generation. Unfortunately, Chen \emph{et al}.'s ZALM requires a large number (800) of spectral channels to achieve its claimed high-fidelity, quasi-deterministic, high-rate entanglement generation. Our modified version of ZALM affords major performance improvements over the original. It draws on Morrison~\emph{et al}.~[APL Photon. {\bf 7}, 066102 (2022)], who domain engineered a $\chi^{(2)}$ crystal to realize a biphoton wave function with 8 discrete and spectrally-factorable frequency bins. Our ZALM SPDCs each have a modest number ($N_I\ll$ 800) of these phase-matched spectral islands each generating two-mode squeezed-vacuum states, permitting our analysis, unlike Chen~\emph{et al.}'s, to account for multipairs of all orders, losses in the partial BSM, and propagation losses en route to the receivers. A major innovation in our proposal is to employ both same-island heralding and cross-island heralding, which allows the entanglement-delivery rate to scale as $N_I^2$ rather than $N_I$ in the weak squeezing regime required for the reception of photon pairs with a high Bell-state fidelity under realistic losses. This heralding scheme uses an order of magnitude fewer spectral channels, which may enable near-term implementations of satellite-to-ground or fiber-optic based ZALM architectures.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Optimization Based on Dynamic Grouping and ZX-Calculus for Reducing 2-Qubit Gate Count</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, two-qubit gates in quantum circuits are more susceptible to noise than single-qubit gates. Therefore, reducing the number of two-qubit gates is crucial for improving circuit efficiency and reliability. As quantum circuits scale up, the optimization search space becomes increasingly complex, leading to challenges such as low efficiency and suboptimal solutions. To address these issues, this paper proposes a quantum circuit optimization approach based on dynamic grouping and ZX-calculus. First, a random strategy-based dynamic grouping method partitions the circuit into multiple subcircuits. Second, a ZX-calculus guided k-step lookahead search performs equivalent subcircuit filtering to minimize two-qubit gate counts. Third, a delay-aware placement method optimizes the recombined circuit to reduce the overall gate count. Finally, simulated annealing iteratively updates the grouping strategy to achieve an optimized two-qubit gate count. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in reducing two-qubit gates. Compared to the original circuits, the approach achieves an average reduction of 18% in two-qubit gates. It outperforms classical methods with up to 25% reduction, especially on gf circuits, and shows a 4% average improvement over heuristic ZX-calculus-based methods, validating its efficiency.</description>

      <title>Mitigating state transition errors during readout with a synchronized flux pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State transitions during qubit measurements are extremely detrimental to quantum tasks that rely on repeated measurements, such as quantum error correction. These state transitions can occur when excessive measurement power leads to qubit excitations outside its computational space. Alternatively, the qubit state can decay rapidly when the measurement protocol inadvertently couples the qubit to lossy modes such as two-level systems (TLSs). We experimentally verify the impact of these TLSs in qubit readout by measuring the transition errors at different qubit flux bias. Because such state transitions during measurements are often localized in frequency space, we demonstrate the ability to avoid them during a fluxonium readout by exploiting the qubit's flux-tunability. By synchronizing the flux bias with the readout photon dynamics, we obtain an optimal readout fidelity of 99 % (98.4 %) in 1 us (0.5 us) integration time. Our work advances the understanding of state transitions in superconducting circuit measurements and demonstrates the potential of fluxonium qubits to achieve fast high-fidelity readout.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Preparation Based on LimTDD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state preparation is a fundamental task in quantum computing and quantum information processing. With the rapid advancement of quantum technologies, efficient quantum state preparation has become increasingly important. This paper proposes a novel approach for quantum state preparation based on the Local Invertible Map Tensor Decision Diagram (LimTDD). LimTDD combines the advantages of tensor networks and decision diagrams, enabling efficient representation and manipulation of quantum states. Compared with the state-of-the-art quantum state preparation method, LimTDD demonstrates substantial improvements in efficiency when dealing with complex quantum states, while also reducing the complexity of quantum circuits. Examples indicate that, in the best-case scenario, our method can achieve exponential efficiency gains over existing methods. This study not only highlights the potential of LimTDD in quantum state preparation but also provides a robust theoretical and practical foundation for the future development of quantum computing technologies.</description>

      <title>Spectator Leakage Elimination in CZ Gates via Tunable Coupler Interference on a Superconducting Quantum Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectator-induced leakage poses a fundamental challenge to scalable quantum computing, particularly as frequency collisions become unavoidable in multi-qubit processors. We introduce a leakage mitigation strategy based on dynamically reshaping the system Hamiltonian. Our technique utilizes a tunable coupler to enforce a block-diagonal structure on the effective Hamiltonian governing near-resonant spectator interactions, confining the gate dynamics to a two-dimensional invariant subspace and thus preventing leakage by construction. On a multi-qubit superconducting processor, we experimentally demonstrate that this dynamic control scheme suppresses leakage rates to the order of $10^{-4}$ across a wide near-resonant detuning range. The method also scales effectively with the number of spectators. With three simultaneous spectators, the total leakage remains below the threshold relevant for surface code error correction. This approach eases the tension between dense frequency packing and high-fidelity gate operation, establishing dynamic Hamiltonian engineering as an essential tool for advancing fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sensing Enhancement through a Nuclear Spin Register in Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensing has seen rapid progress from laboratory research to real-world applications. Solid-state spin systems, particularly nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, are attractive for their ability to operate at room temperature with high sensitivity. However, electron spin coherence due to noise from the surrounding spin bath and this environment effect limits the sensitivity of NV centers. Thus, a critical task in NV center-based quantum sensing is sensitivity enhancement through coherence protection. Nuclear spin assisted protocols have demonstrated greater enhancement of electron spin coherence due to the naturally occurring electron and nuclear spin pair. The longer nuclear coherence times allow for long-lived memory bit for quantum information protocols. This review discusses the physics of NV centers, the mechanisms and variations of nuclear spin-assisted protocols, and their applications in nuclear spin spectroscopy, atomic imaging, and magnetic sensing. Challenges in sensitivity enhancement, commercialization prospects, and future research directions are also explored.</description>

Abstract: Studies of subradiance in a chain N two-level atoms in the single excitation regime focused mainly on the complex spectrum of the effective Hamiltonian, identifying subradiant eigenvalues. This can be achieved by finding the eigenvalues $N$ of the Hamiltonian or by evaluating the expectation value of the Hamiltonian on a generalized Dicke state, depending on a continuous variable k. This has the advantage that the sum above N can be calculated exactly, such that N becomes a simple parameter of the system and no more the size of the Hilbert space. However, the question remains how subradiance emerges from atoms initially excited or driven by a laser. Here we study the dynamics of the system, solving the coupled-dipole equations for N atoms and evaluating the probability to be in a generalized Dicke state at a given time. Once the subradiant regions has been identified, it is simple to see if subradiance is being generated. We discuss different initial excitation conditions that lead to subradiance and the case of atoms excited by switching on and off a weak laser. This may be relevant for future experiments aimed at detecting subradiance in ordered systems.</description>

Abstract: The Wigner's Friend thought experiment stands as one of the most intellectually provocative and challenging conceptual puzzles in quantum mechanics. It compels us to confront profound questions concerning the fundamental nature of reality, the very act of observation, and the possible role that consciousness might play within the quantum measurement process. This article gives a general presentation, beginning with Eugene Wigner's seminal proposal of the original thought experiment. In this paper, we explore its initial implications, which shook the foundations of classical physics, and then progress to an examination of the recent theoretical advancements and the ingenious extended versions of the experiment. The recent versions seem to imply that it is no more possible to consider events as absolute.</description>

      <title>Scalable modular architecture for universal quantum computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal quantum computing requires the ability to perform every unitary operation, i.e., evolution operator controllability. In view of developing resource-efficient quantum processing units (QPUs), it is important to determine how many local controls and qubit-qubit couplings are required for controllability. Unfortunately, assessing the controllability of large qubit arrays is a difficult task, due to the exponential scaling of Hilbert space dimension. Here we show that it is sufficient to connect two qubit arrays that are evolution operator controllable by a single entangling two-qubit gate in order to obtain a composite qubit array that is evolution operator controllable. Our proof provides a template to build up modular QPUs from smaller building blocks with reduced numbers of local controls and couplings. We illustrate the approach with two examples, consisting of 10, respectively 127 qubits, inspired by IBM quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Improving the Rate-Loss Scaling in Polarization Entanglement Distribution using Single-Click Entanglement Swapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization entanglement is widely used in optical quantum information processing due to its compatibility with standard optical components. On the other hand, it is known that polarization entanglement is susceptible to the loss, more precisely, its transmission rate in a lossy channel is limited by the scaling of O({\eta}), where {\eta} is a transmittance of the channel. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that this rate-loss scaling limit can be overcome by a relatively simple protocol. This is possible by integrating the idea of the polarizaion-photon-number hybrid entanglement and the single-click entanglement swapping. We demonstrate square root improvement of the rate-loss scaling from the conventional approaches and achieve the fidelity of 0.843 for the distributed polarization entangled photon pairs. This improvement in the rate-loss scaling is equivalent to that achieved by 1-hop quantum repeater node. Our result paves a way to build a near-future quantum network and its applications.</description>

      <title>Time Entangled Quantum Blockchain with Phase Encoding for Classical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With rapid advancements in quantum computing, it is widely believed that there will be quantum hardware capable of compromising classical cryptography and hence, the internet and the current information security infrastructure in the coming decade. This is mainly due to the operational realizations of quantum algorithms such as Grover and Shor, to which the current classical encryption protocols are vulnerable. Blockchains, i.e., blockchain data structures and their data, rely heavily on classical cryptography. One approach to secure blockchain is to attempt to achieve information theoretical security by defining blockchain on quantum technologies. There have been two conceptualizations of blockchains on quantum registers: the time-entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state blockchain and the quantum hypergraph blockchain. On our part, an attempt is made to conceptualize a new quantum blockchain combining features of both these schemes to achieve the absolute security of the time-temporal GHZ blockchain and the scalability and efficiency of the quantum hypergraph blockchain in the proposed quantum blockchain protocol.</description>

      <title>Wigner quasi-probability distribution for symmetric multi-quDit systems and their generalized heat kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a symmetric $N$-quDit system described by a density matrix $\rho$, we construct a one-parameter $s$ family $\mathcal{F}^{(s)}_\rho$ of quasi-probability distributions through generalized Fano multipole operators and Stratonovich-Weyl kernels. The corresponding phase space is the complex projective ${C}P^{D-1}=U(D)/U(D-1)\times U(1)$, related to fully symmetric irreducible representations of the unitary group $U(D)$. For the particular cases $D=2$ (qubits) and $D=3$ (qutrits), we analyze the phase-space structure of Schr\"odinger $U(D)$-spin cat (parity adapted coherent) states and we provide plots of the corresponding Wigner $\mathcal{F}^{(0)}_\rho$ function. We examine the connection between non-classical behavior and the negativity of the Wigner function. We also compute the generalized heat kernel relating two quasi-probability distributions $\mathcal{F}^{(s)}_\rho$ and $\mathcal{F}^{(s')}_\rho$, with $t=(s'-s)/2$ playing the role of ``time'', together with their twisted Moyal product in terms of a trikernel. In the thermodynamic limit $N\to\infty$, we recover the usual Gaussian smoothing for $s'&gt;s$. A diagramatic interpretation of the phase-space construction in terms of Young tableaux is also provided.</description>

      <title>Multi-state imaginarity and coherence in qubit systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, the characterization of quantum resources has focused on individual quantum states. Recent literature, however, has increasingly explored the characterization of resources in multi-states (ordered collections of states indexed by a varying parameter). In this work, we provide a unitary-invariant framework to pinpoint imaginarity and coherence in sets of qubit states: we prove that Bloch vectors must be coplanar to be imaginarity-free and colinear to be incoherent, yielding exact rank-based tests of coherence and imaginarity, and closed-form bounds for existing robustness quantifiers, all based on two-state overlaps only. We also show that the set of imaginarity-free multi-states is not convex, and that third-order invariants completely characterize multi-state imaginarity of single-qubits but not of higher-dimensional systems. As our main technical result, we show that every Bargmann invariant of single-qubit states is determined (up to conjugation) by two-state overlaps. Beyond qubits, we give purity and system-agnostic coherence witnesses from equality constraints on higher-order invariants and connect our results to practical protocols: characterization of partial distinguishability, spin-chirality detection, and subchannel discrimination.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous determination of multiple low-energy eigenstates of many-body systems on a superconducting quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The determination of the ground and low-lying excited states is critical in many studies of quantum chemistry and condensed-matter physics. Recent theoretical work proposes a variational quantum eigensolver using ancillary qubits to generate entanglement in the variational circuits, which avoids complex ansatz circuits and successive measurements in the previous algorithms. In this work, we employ the ancilla-entangled variational quantum eigensolver to simultaneously compute multiple low-lying eigenenergies and eigenstates of the H2 molecule and three- and five-spin transverse field Ising models (TFIMs) on a superconducting quantum processor. We obtain the potential energy curves of H2 and show an indication of antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase transition in the TFIMs from the average absolute magnetization. Our experiments demonstrate that the algorithm is capable of simultaneously determining multiple eigenenergies and eigenstates of many-body systems with high efficiency and accuracy and with less computational resources.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing of Lanthandie binding tags with relaxometer of NV center in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lanthanide binding tags (LBTs) stand out as a prominent group of fluorescent probes that are extensively utilized in biological detection. However, research on LBTs has predominantly emphasized their fluorescence properties, which frequently compromised by background fluorescence noise. Investigating magnetic properties could optimize detection methodologies that offer enhanced sensitivity and specificity. In this study, we measured the response of a relaxometer based on ensemble nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to various amounts of LBTs with gadolinium ions, determining the detection limit of LBTs to be 25 fmol. We then proposed and demonstrated a detection scheme employing the NV relaxometer to detect specific binding between LBTs and target. Specifically, we assessed the relaxometer's response to various concentrations of the interaction between the modified LBTs and Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-COVID-2 spike protein, with the detection threshold reaching ~1 pmol. Our research provides a potential application platform for biomarker detection under picomole concentration by using NV centers to detect the magnetism of LBTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) play a vital role in non-Hermitian (NH) systems, driving unique dynamical phenomena and promising innovative applications. However, the NH dynamics at EPs remains obscure due to the incomplete biorthogonal eigenspaces of defective NH Hamiltonians and thus is often avoided. In this Letter, we systematically establish pseudo-completeness relations at EPs by employing all available generalized eigenstates, where both single and multiple arbitrary-order EPs embracing degenerate scenarios are addressed, to unveil EP dynamics. We reveal that depending on EP order and initial conditions, the EP dynamics is characterized by a \emph{polynomial growth over time} of EP eigenstates or their superposition, which will dominate long-term evolution despite real spectra protected by pseudo-Hermiticity (PH), or can also become unitary. We further introduce two PH-compliant NH models to demonstrate these EP dynamics and explore their applications. This work completes the dynamical investigation of NH physics, offers valuable insights into nonunitary EP evolution, and further lays the groundwork for engineering NH devices and exploiting other EP-related technologies.</description>

      <title>Granovskii-Zhedanov Scar of XYZ Spin-chain: Modern Algebraic Perspectives and Realization in Higher Dimensional Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a work by Granovskii and Zhedanov, a surprising scar state exhibiting zero entanglement and long periodicity was discovered in the XYZ spin chains; remarkably, nearly three decades before the concept of many-body scars became a subject of active research. In this study, we uncover the origin of the Granovskii-Zhedanov (GZ) scar within the framework of the modern understanding of quantum many-body scars. We demonstrate that the scar subspace can be effectively described using the standard spectrum-generating algebra (SGA) framework and through a group-theoretical formulation of the Hamiltonian. This description, however, is applicable only in the XXZ limit, where a quasi-$U(1)$ symmetry exists within the scar subspace. In contrast, the absence of such quasi-$U(1)$ symmetry for the GZ scar subspace restricts the applicability of these standard formulations. We propose two alternative techniques: approximated SGA and generalized SGA, which construct and describe the scar subspace in the XYZ case. Using these approaches, we can characterize the scar subspaces. We further explore the possibility of constructing lattice-independent GZ scars in higher-dimensional uniform spin-exchange systems with centrosymmetry, using graphical rules developed for GZ scar construction. Our results indicate that lattice-independent GZ scars cannot be supported on uniform lattices with odd coordination numbers or plaquettes with an odd number of edges, while uniform lattices featuring even coordination numbers and even-edged plaquettes can host such lattice-independent scars in specific scenarios. Remarkably, if certain bonds retain the full $SU(2)$ symmetry of the spin-exchange interaction, thereby breaking the spatial uniformity of the lattice, lattice-independent GZ scars can still emerge in systems with odd coordination numbers or plaquettes with an odd number of edges.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Organic Light-Emitting Diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are central to modern display technologies and are promising candidates for low-cost energy-efficient lighting. Their performance is determined by numerous, intricate fabrication parameters, but not least by the number of emissive molecules N, which provide sites for electron-hole recombination and photon generation in the diode host matrix. Counterintuitively, larger concentrations of emitters do not always lead to brighter or more efficient OLEDs due to concentration quenching of luminescence meaning that rates of radiative electron-hole recombination can become severely reduced, negatively impacting charge-to-photon conversion efficiency. In this work we trigger steady-state superradiant light emission from a series of Fabry-P\'erot microcavity OLEDs by scaling the operating voltage of each device with emitter concentration. We demonstrate a collective enhancement in the luminance of a microcavity OLED that scales super-extensively when compared to no-cavity controls fabricated in the same run. Triggering quantum correlations between emitters via the confined cavity field allows devices with fewer emitters to match or even exceed the brightness of control OLEDs even when driven by lower voltages. Moreover, our devices show significant narrowing of their emission spectra, offering purer colours at low applied voltages. Leveraging collective effects in microcavity OLEDs provides a new approach to enable brighter, more efficient devices paving the way for next-generation displays and lighting that do not compromise performance for operational efficiency or device lifetime.</description>

      <title>The Way from Rota to Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper traces an intellectual journey or \textit{Way} (in the sense of a Tao) that starts with some unfinished work of Gian-Carlo Rota on making a logic of equivalence relations or partitions. Rota understood the category-theoretic duality between subsets and partitions which implied there should be a logic of partitions dual to the usual Boolean logic of subsets.And just as probability starts quantitatively with the size of a subset, so he saw that information should start with some notion of size of a partition. After developing the logic of partitions and its quantitative version as logical entropy, it became clear that there is a fundamental duality, fully developed only in category theory, that runs through the exact sciences. Classical physics lies on the subset side and quantum physics on the partition side of the duality. The rest of the paper develops the treatment of quantum mechanics seen through the lens of partitions as the logic of definiteness and indefiniteness. The lattices of partitions allows the treatment of quantum phenomena in highly simplified but essential terms. Since Feynman saw the``only mystery'' of quantum mechanics in the two-slit experiment, this new approach is developed to show how to resolve that mystery. Finally, quantum statistics is treated using Rota-style enumerative combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Polarisation and Temperature Dependence of Er$^{3+}$:CaWO$_4$ -- Towards a Solid-State Rare-Earth Ion-Doped Quantum Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the endeavour of developing quantum memories, Er$^{3+}$:CaWO$_4$ has emerged as a promising rare-earth ion-doped (REID) crystal platform due to its long optical coherence times and compatibility with the 1550 nm telecommunications band. This work investigates the effects of polarisation and temperature on the absorption strength, central wavelength, and linewidth of the $Z_1\to Y_1$ and $Z_1\to Y_2$ optical transitions, with light incident along the crystal $a$ and $c$ axes. It is found that the $Z_1\to Y_1$ transition at 1532.6 nm with the incident laser along the $c$-axis at cryogenic temperatures ($\sim$3 K) is particularly favourable. The transition exhibits a stable central wavelength, narrower linewidth, polarisation independence, larger absorption cross-section, and lies within the C-band -- attributes that make it highly suitable for quantum memory applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Historically, a $\sqrt{N}log^{1/2}(N)$ distance barrier for quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with $N$ qubits persisted for nearly two decades, until the recent discovery of the fibre-bundle code. An open question is whether such a distance barrier can be broken while preserving the ability to perform transversal non-Clifford gates. In this direction, another long-standing distance barrier of $N^{1/3}$ for LDPC stabilizer codes -- present since the discovery of the 3D color code -- was only recently overcome by a construction achieving an $\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ distance (arXiv:2501.19375). The present work further breaks the $\sqrt{N}$ distance barrier by taking a homological product of three good qLDPC codes, combined with the Freedman-Hastings code-to-manifold mapping and the triple cup product to implement transversal CCZ gates. The resulting code achieves an $\Omega(N^{2/3})$ distance (a linear $X$-distance of $\Theta(N)$) and a dimension of $\Theta(N^{2/3})$, which enables fault-tolerant preparation of $\Theta(N^{1/3})$ independent logical CCZ magic states in a single shot, without distillation (`magic state fountain'). This new quantum code also inspires the discovery of a family of exotic $3q$-dimensional manifolds $\mathcal{M}$, which exhibit both a power-law $\mathbb{Z}_2$-($q$, $2q$)-systolic freedom and $\Theta(vol(\mathcal{M}))$ triple intersection points of $2q$-dimensional submanifolds.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing for Machine Learning: Applications in Feature Selection, Instance Selection, and Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the applications of quantum annealing (QA) and classical simulated annealing (SA) to a suite of combinatorial optimization problems in machine learning, namely feature selection, instance selection, and clustering. We formulate each task as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem and implement both quantum and classical solvers to compare their effectiveness. For feature selection, we propose several QUBO configurations that balance feature importance and redundancy, showing that quantum annealing (QA) produces solutions that are computationally more efficient. In instance selection, we propose a few novel heuristics for instance-level importance measures that extend existing methods. For clustering, we embed a classical-to-quantum pipeline, using classical clustering followed by QUBO-based medoid refinement, and demonstrate consistent improvements in cluster compactness and retrieval metrics. Our results suggest that QA can be a competitive and efficient tool for discrete machine learning optimization, even within the constraints of current quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Grover's algorithm is an approximation of imaginary-time evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reveal the power of Grover's algorithm from thermodynamic and geometric perspectives by showing that it is a product formula approximation of imaginary-time evolution (ITE), a Riemannian gradient flow on the special unitary group. This viewpoint uncovers three key insights. First, we show that the ITE dynamics trace the shortest path between the initial and the solution states in complex projective space. Second, we prove that the geodesic length of ITE determines the query complexity of Grover's algorithm. This complexity notably aligns with the known optimal scaling for unstructured search. Lastly, utilizing the geodesic structure of ITE, we construct a quantum signal processing formulation for ITE without post-selection, and derive a new set of angles for the fixed-point search. These results collectively establish a deeper understanding of Grover's algorithm and suggest a potential role for thermodynamics and geometry in quantum algorithm design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In statistics and causal modeling it is common for a selection process to induce correlations in a subset of an uncorrelated ensemble. We propose that EPR and Bell correlations are selection artefacts of this kind. The selection process is preparation of the initial state of the relevant experiments. Choice of initial state amounts to preselection of a subensemble of a larger, uncorrelated, virtual ensemble of possble histories. Because it is preselection rather than postselection, the resulting correlations support the intuitive counterfactuals of the EPR argument and Bell nonlocality. In this respect, and in its temporal orientation, the case differs from familiar forms of selection bias. Given the ubiquity of quantum entanglement, the result may thus be of independent interest to students of causal modeling. The paper concludes with a discussion of its novel implications in that field.</description>

      <title>Ground and excited-state energies with analytic errors and short time evolution on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately solving the Schr\"odinger equation remains a central challenge in computational physics, chemistry, and materials science. Here, we propose an alternative eigenvalue problem based on a system's autocorrelation function, avoiding direct reference to a wave function. In particular, we develop a rigorous approximation framework that enables precise frequency estimation from a finite number of signal samples. Our analysis builds on new results involving prolate spheroidal wave functions and yields error bounds that reveal a sharp accuracy transition governed by the observation time and spectral density of the signal. These results are very general and thus carry far. As one important example application we consider the quantum computation for molecular systems. By combining our spectral method with a quantum subroutine for signal generation, we define quantum prolate diagonalization (QPD) - a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm. QPD simultaneously estimates ground and excited state energies within chemical accuracy at the Heisenberg limit. An analysis of different input states demonstrates the robustness of the method, showing that high precision can be retained even under imperfect state preparation.</description>

      <title>Planted Solutions in Quantum Chemistry: Generating Non-Trivial Hamiltonians with Known Ground States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating large, non-trivial quantum chemistry test problems with known ground-state solutions remains a core challenge for benchmarking electronic structure methods. Inspired by planted-solution techniques from combinatorial optimization, we introduce four classes of Hamiltonians with embedded, retrievable ground states. These Hamiltonians mimic realistic electronic structure problems, support adjustable complexity, and are derived from reference systems. Crucially, their ground-state energies can be computed exactly, provided the construction parameters are known. To obscure this structure and control perceived complexity, we introduce techniques such as killer operators, balance operators, and random orbital rotations. We showcase this framework using examples based on homogeneous catalysts of industrial relevance and validate tunable difficulty through density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) convergence behavior. Beyond enabling scalable, ground-truth benchmark generation, our approach offers a controlled setting to explore the limitations of electronic structure methods and investigate how Hamiltonian structure influences ground state solution difficulty.</description>

      <title>Global-scale quantum networking using hybrid-channel quantum repeaters with relays based on a chain of balloons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global-scale entanglement distribution has been a formidable challenge due to the unavoidable losses in communication channels. Here, we propose a novel backbone channel for quantum network based on balloon-based aerial relays. We demonstrate for the first time that the atmospheric disturbances in balloon-based channels can be almost eliminated through optimizing beam waist positions and employing a series of adaptive optics systems, which boosts the channel efficiency to -21 dB over a 10,000 km distance, outperforming satellite-based relays by 12 dB with same device parameters. We then propose a global-scale quantum networking scheme based on hybrid-channel quantum repeaters that combine ground-based quantum repeaters and balloon-based aerial relays. Servers are interconnected globally via a chain of balloons, while clients link to local servers through fiber connections, facilitating rapid client switching and network scalability. Our simulations, employing state-of-the-art Eu$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ quantum memories and mature entanglement sources based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion, demonstrate an entanglement distribution rate in the sub-Hertz range between clients separated by 10,000 km. This approach offers a practical path toward global quantum networking in the near future.</description>

      <title>1H Polarization above 60% at room temperature by triplet dynamic nuclear polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 1H polarization of 61% was achieved by Dynamic Nuclear Polarization using photoexcited triplet electrons (Triplet-DNP) at room temperature and in 0.64 T. We introduced dibenz[a, h]anthracene as a new host molecule of the polarizing agent, pentacene-d14. Its rigid structure provides a long spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) of more than 2 hours at room temperature. The single crystal of dibenz[a, h]anthracene doped with 0.05 mol% pentacene-d14 was grown by the Bridgman method, and cut into a small piece of ~1 mg for Triplet-DNP experiment. The 1H polarization buildup and relaxation measurements indicated that paramagnetic relaxation became the major source of the relaxation than spin-lattice relaxation. Finally, two promising applications of room-temperature hyperpolarization, i .e. nuclear ordering and radiation-tolerant polarized target, are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time crystals are classified into discrete time crystals and continuous time crystals based on whether they spontaneously break time-translation symmetry. Continuous-time crystals do not require external driving. By introducing AdS/CFT duality to time crystals, we derive their thermodynamic limit and find that in strongly correlated many-body systems such as a 3D optical lattice, cooperative many-body tunneling enables time crystals to oscillate spontaneously. In strongly correlated quantum systems driven by many-body cooperative tunneling, we discover a universal scaling law governing the time-crystalline phase transition at a critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Resource-Efficient Cross-Platform Verification with Modular Superconducting Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale quantum computers are expected to benefit from modular architectures. Validating the capabilities of modular devices requires benchmarking strategies that assess performance within and between modules. In this work, we evaluate cross-platform verification protocols, which are critical for quantifying how accurately different modules prepare the same quantum state -- a key requirement for modular scalability and system-wide consistency. We demonstrate these algorithms using a six-qubit flip-chip superconducting quantum device consisting of two three-qubit modules on a single carrier chip, with connectivity for intra- and inter-module entanglement. We examine how the resource requirements of protocols relying solely on classical communication between modules scale exponentially with qubit number, and demonstrate that introducing an inter-module two-qubit gate enables sub-exponential scaling in cross-platform verification. This approach reduces the number of repetitions required by a factor of four for three-qubit states, with greater reductions projected for larger and higher-fidelity devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensor network metrology with bright solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider multiparameter quantum metrology problem with bright soliton networks in the presence of weak losses. We introduce General Heisenberg Limit (GHL) $\sigma_{\boldsymbol{\chi}}=1/N^k$ that characterizes fundamental limitations for unknown parameter measurement and estimation accuracy $\sigma_{\boldsymbol{\chi}}$ within linear ($k=1$) and nonlinear ($k=3$) quantum metrology approaches to solitons. We examine multipartite $N00N$ states specially prepared for the improvement of multiparameter estimation protocols. As a particular example of producing such states, we propose the three-mode soliton Josephson junction (TMSJJ) system as a three mode extension for the soliton Josephson junction (SJJ) bosonic model, which we previously proposed. The energy spectrum of the TMSJJ exhibits sharp phase transition peculiarities for the TMSJJ ground state. The transition occurs from a Gaussian-like (coherent) state to the superposition of entangled Fock states, which rapidly approach the three-mode $N00N$ state. We show that in the presence of weak losses, the TMSJJ enables saturate scaling relevant to the optimal state limit close to the GHL. Our findings open new prospects for quantum network sensorics with atomtronic circuits.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a unified framework for dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in non-Hermitian systems that encompasses both biorthogonal and self-norm non-biorthogonal formulations for pure and mixed states. Our framework provides explicit expressions for the Loschmidt amplitude, Loschmidt echo, and rate function, revealing a universal geometric signature of DQPTs: orthogonality of two related vectors in two-dimensional real space. Strikingly, we demonstrate that non-biorthogonal quenches from non-Hermitian to Hermitian Hamiltonians under chiral symmetry exhibit emergent topological characteristics, unveiling the intrinsic topological nature of DQPTs beyond conventional Hermitian regimes. This work establishes fundamental geometric and topological principles governing quantum criticality in open systems, with implications for quantum sensing and many-body physics in dissipative environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Trotter approximation for a pair of orbital angular momentum operators, $L_x$ and $L_y$. In particular, we investigate the scaling behavior of the state-dependent Trotter error. We show that for states in the domains of the orbital angular momentum operators the Trotter error scales as $n^{-1}$, where $n$ is the time discretization. Instead, the convergence rate can be arbitrarily slow for states that do not belong to the domains of all three angular momentum operators simultaneously.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its variants underpin modern machine learning by enabling efficient optimization of large-scale models. However, their local search nature limits exploration in complex landscapes. In this paper, we introduce Stochastic Quantum Hamiltonian Descent (SQHD), a quantum optimization algorithm that integrates the computational efficiency of stochastic gradient methods with the global exploration power of quantum dynamics. We propose a Lindbladian dynamics as the quantum analogue of continuous-time SGD. We further propose a discrete-time gate-based algorithm that approximates these dynamics while avoiding direct Lindbladian simulation, enabling practical implementation on near-term quantum devices. We rigorously prove the convergence of SQHD for convex and smooth objectives. Numerical experiments demonstrate that SQHD also exhibits advantages in non-convex optimization. All these results highlight its potential for quantum-enhanced machine learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the physical process of stimulated emission as a model for state-dependent quantum copying. We explore how a quantum state, for instance, a photon polarization, can be cloned through light-matter interactions when the ancillary system, such as an excited atom, effectively encodes prior information about the quantum state. This process, while resembling quantum cloning, adheres to the no-cloning theorem due to its state-dependent and non-universal nature. We clarify the distinction between universal cloning and conditional copying, and demonstrate that stimulated emission offers a concrete physical realization of state-dependent quantum copying.</description>

      <title>Realistic vulnerabilities of decoy-state quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze realistic vulnerabilities of decoy-state quantum key distribution (QKD) arising from the combination of laser damage attack (LDA) and unambiguous state discrimination (USD). While decoy-state QKD is designed to protect against photon-number-splitting and beam-splitting attacks by accurately estimating the single-photon fraction, it relies on stable attenuation to prepare pulses with fixed mean-photon numbers. An eavesdropper (Eve) can exploit LDA to irreversibly alter the optical components on Alice's side, effectively increasing the mean-photon numbers beyond the decoy-state security regime. We show that once the alteration exceeds a critical threshold - on the order of 10--20 dB - Eve can implement an efficient USD-based intercept-resend strategy using current off-the-shelf technology, thus obtaining the entire secret key. Numerical simulations confirm that for sufficiently elevated mean-photon numbers, Eve's conclusive measurement outcomes skew the decoy-state statistics, yet remain undetected by standard security checks. We further demonstrate how a modified USD setup employing an additional beam splitter can reduce the required threshold, facilitating Eve's attack. Our findings emphasize the need for robust safeguards against high-power laser damage in QKD systems, including careful hardware selection, rigorous testing under high-power illumination, and real-time monitoring to ensure the integrity of the decoy-state protocol.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Preservation and Clauser-Horne Nonlocality in Electromagnetically Induced Transparency Quantum Memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum memories are indispensable for quantum repeater networks, deterministic generation of single- or multi-photon states, and linear optical quantum computing. Although experiments have demonstrated that electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) quantum memories can store entangled photons, a definitive theoretical framework verifying the preservation of entanglement and nonlocality has not been rigorously established. Here, we develop a comprehensive model by integrating the dark-state polariton framework with reduced-density-operator theory to derive the retrieved density operator under realistic ground-state decoherence conditions. Our analysis reveals that decoherence inevitably causes probe photon loss, converting a Bell state into a mixed state. Crucially, we predict a critical storage efficiency threshold of 89.7%. Only when this threshold is exceeded does the retrieved probe photon state violate the Clauser-Horne inequality, thereby preserving nonlocality; below this point, nonlocal correlations vanish. Moreover, our theory shows that multiple spatially separated EIT memories can cooperatively store and retrieve N-qubit entangled states encoded in photon number, path, and polarization with near-unity fidelity in the ideal limit. This work bridges a long-standing theoretical gap and lays a solid foundation for the application of quantum memories in scalable quantum networks and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermometry with non-Gaussian states: From non-equilibrium speed to equilibrium precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study temperature estimation using quantum probes, including single-mode initial states and two-mode states generated via stimulated parametric down-conversion in a nonlinear crystal at finite temperature. We explore both transient and equilibrium regimes and compare the performance of Gaussian and non-Gaussian probe states for temperature estimation. In the non-equilibrium regime, we show that single-mode non-Gaussian probe states - such as Fock, odd cat, and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states - can significantly enhance the speed of estimation, particularly at short interaction times. In the two-mode setting, entangled states such as the two-mode squeezed vacuum, NOON state, and entangled cat state can enable access to temperature information at much earlier times. In the equilibrium regime, we analyze temperature estimation using two-mode squeezed thermal states, which outperform single-mode strategies. We evaluate practical measurements and find that both energy and population difference observables yield optimal precision, while quadrature-based measurements are suboptimal. The precision gain arises from squeezing, which suppresses fluctuations in the population difference.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and Liouville Space Formulation of Decoherence-Free Subsystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a generic and systematic decoherence-free scheme to encode quantum information into an open quantum system based focusing on symmetry. Under a given symmetry, the Liouville space is decomposed into invariant subspaces characterized by a tensor-product structure. A decoherence-free subsystem is then identified as a factor of the tensor product. Unlike decoherence-free subspaces, which typically require strong symmetries, decoherence-free systems are permitted under less restrictive weak symmetries. Specifically, we primarily concern the permutation symmetry in conjunction with the unitary symmetry and utilize the Schur-Weyl duality, which facilitates numerous efficient and systematic calculations based on the well-established group representation theory. Employing the isomorphism between the Liouville space and the fictitious Hilbert space, we construct a super-Schur basis, which block-diagonalizes the super-operators that describe the noisy quantum channels, both in the Kraus representation and in terms of the quantum master equation. Each block reveals the tensor-product structure and facilitates the identification of physically relevant decoherence-free subsystems under the specified weak symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement is a special technique that allows to evade quantum back-action. In this paper, we propose a new QND measurement scheme of the optical field quadratures based on the non-degenerate optical parametric amplifier. We show that for a proper set of parameters, this scheme can realize a new type of QND measurement, where the quadrature of interest is amplified but still does not subject to any back action.</description>

      <title>Matrix inversion polynomials for the quantum singular value transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum matrix inversion with the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) requires a polynomial approximation to $1/x$. Several methods from the literature construct polynomials that achieve the known degree complexity $\mathcal{O}(\kappa\log(\kappa/\varepsilon))$ with condition number $\kappa$ and uniform error $\varepsilon$. However, the \emph{optimal} polynomial with lowest degree for fixed error $\varepsilon$ can only be approximated numerically with the resource-intensive Remez method, leading to impractical preprocessing runtimes. Here, we derive an analytic shortcut to the optimal polynomial. Comparisons with other polynomials from the literature, based on Taylor expansion, Chebyshev iteration, and convex optimization, confirm that our result is optimal. Furthermore, for large $\kappa\log(\kappa/\varepsilon)$, our polynomial has the smallest maximum value on $[-1,1]$ of all approaches considered, leading to reduced circuit depth due to the normalization condition of QSVT. With the Python code provided, this paper will also be useful for practitioners in the field.</description>

      <title>A One-sided Witness for the Quantumness of Gravitational Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information concepts and quantum technologies have opened the prospect to probe quantum gravity in table-top experiments. Many proposals rely on witnessing entanglement generation as a means to probe whether gravity is a quantum channel. Here we formulate a different and conclusive indirect test of the quantum nature of the gravitational interaction. Our witness is based on the concept of verifiable quantum memory in the dynamics of a quantum system. This allows us to assess the quantumness of an interaction between two systems by local measurements on one subsystem only. Our approach enables the first one-sided verification of the quantum nature of gravity, and provides a quantum signature of the interaction that is not fully covered by existing proposals. Our results open novel ways to witnessing the quantum nature of gravity in table-top experiments and clarify how {decisive tests can be designed even with measurements on only the probe system</description>

      <title>Unconventional photon blockade in a hybrid optomechanical system with an embedded spin-triplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The research article studies the unconventional photon blockade effect in a hybrid optomechanical system with an embedded spin-triplet state. The interaction between the optomechanical system and the spin state generates new transition paths for the destructive quantum interference of the two-photon excitation state. By analytically solving the Schrodinger equation and numerically simulating the master equation, it can be found that the modulated mechanical dissipation is essential for achieving the strong photon blockade in our system. Unlike the conventional cavity optomechanical system, the second-order correlation function g(2)(0) =0 can be obtained with the weak single-photon optomechanical coupling. By adjusting the system parameters, the strong photon blockade and the single-photon resonance can coincide, which indicates the hybrid system has the potential to be a high-quality and efficient single-photon source. Finally, the influence of the thermal noise on photon blockade is investigated. The results show that the second-order correlation function is more robust for the weaker phonon-spin coupling.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Investigation of the New Quantum-Control-Assisted Reverse uncertainty relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a new interesting concept of reverse uncertainty relation is introduced. Different from the normal uncertainty relation, the reverse one indicates that one cannot only prepare quantum states with joint small uncertainty, but also with joint great uncertainty for incompatible observables. We in this work construct a new quantum-control-assisted reverse uncertainty relation and investigate the corresponding dynamic evolution in the Heisenberg model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The obtained relation indicates that the reverse uncertainty can be broken with help of the quantum control system. The dynamic investigation reveals that there exists an interesting single-value relationship between new uncertainty relation and the mixedness of the system, indicating that the tightness and upper bound of the uncertainty relation can be written as functional form of the mixedness. By comparing the existing research in [Physica Scripta 2023, 98(6), 065113], we show that the single-value relationship with the mixedness is the common nature of both the normal uncertainty relations and the reverse uncertainty relation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum Discord in V-shaped Plasmonic Waveguides by Quantum Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of a symmetric quantum feedback control on the quantum discord of the X state in V-shaped plasmonic waveguides. Under this feedback, the quantum discord of the Werner state is enhanced from 0 to 0.38. This value even continues to rise after reducing the decay rate of the atoms. Furthermore, we get the operational mechanism of feedback control through the evolution of the matrix elements. It confines the initial 4 * 4 matrix into a 3 * 3 subspace. As a result, the weights of each ground state in the quantum state change, which suppresses the degradation of Bell state. Lastly, we propose a direction for suggesting an improved feedback Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Caustics in a Near-Resonant Quantum Kicked Rotor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of the quantum kicked rotor in the near-resonant regime and observe a particular recurring cusp caustic of the wave functions' accumulation. We then derive the path integral expression of the quantum evolution and analytically determine the conditions for the caustic formation and recurring period. A scaling power law with Arnold index of $1/4$ relating to the wave amplitude enhancement depending on the kicking strength as well as the resonant detuning parameter, has been derived and verified. We also discuss classical-quantum correspondence of the caustics and find that chaos can disrupt the phase matching leading to the destruction of the caustic structure. Finally, possible experimental observations and some implications of these findings are discussed.</description>

      <title>On Strong Converse Bounds for the Private and Quantum Capacities of Anti-degradable Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a strong converse bound for the private classical capacity of anti-degradable quantum channels. Specifically, we prove that this capacity is zero whenever the error $\epsilon &gt; 0$ and privacy parameter $\delta &gt; 0$ satisfy the inequality $\delta (1-\epsilon^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}+\epsilon (1-\delta^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;1$. This result strengthens previous understandings by sharply defining the boundary beyond which reliable and private communication is impossible. Furthermore, we present a ``pretty simple'' proof of the ``pretty strong'' converse for the quantum capacity of anti-degradable channels, valid for any error $\epsilon &lt; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. Our approach offers clarity and technical simplicity, shedding new light on the fundamental limits of quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Generation of Cluster States via Time-Delayed Feedback in Matrix Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cluster states, as highly entangled multi-qubit states, are widely used as essential resources for quantum communication and quantum computing. However, due to the diverse requirements of applications for cluster states with specific entanglement structures, a universal generation protocol is still lacking. Here we develop a matrix representation according to the characteristics of time-delayed feedback (TDF) and propose a protocol for generating arbitrary cluster states with multiple TDFs. The matrix representation also allows us to optimize the generation process to reduce TDF usage, thus improving efficiency. In particular, we demonstrate a tree-cluster-state generation process that requires only one TDF. Moreover, accounting for the critical loss mechanisms and imperfections in our protocol, we discuss the additional losses caused by multiple TDFs and evaluate the fidelity of the resulting cluster states.</description>

      <title>Symplectic coherence: a measure of position-momentum correlations in quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interdependence of position and momentum, as highlighted by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, is a cornerstone of quantum physics. Yet, position-momentum correlations have received little systematic attention. Motivated by recent developments in bosonic quantum physics that underscore their relevance in quantum thermodynamics, metrology, and computing, we establish a general framework to study and quantify position-momentum correlations in quantum states. We introduce symplectic coherence, a faithful and easily computable measure defined as the Frobenius norm of the block of the covariance matrix encoding position-momentum correlations, and demonstrate that symplectic coherence is monotone under relevant operations and robust under small perturbations. Furthermore, using a recent mapping by Barthe et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 070604) which relates the covariance matrix of a bosonic state to the density matrix of a finite-dimensional system, we show that position-momentum correlations correspond to beyond-classical correlations in a virtual finite-dimensional quantum state, with symplectic coherence mapping naturally to geometric quantum discord. Taking energy constraints into account, we determine the maximal position-momentum correlations achievable at fixed energy, revealing structural insights about the corresponding optimal states. Finally, we illustrate the operational relevance of symplectic coherence through several examples in quantum information tasks and quantum thermodynamics. In the process, we establish new technical results on matrix norms and quantum covariance matrices, and demonstrate the conceptual significance of viewing covariance matrices as density matrices of virtual quantum states.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Quantum Search via Recursive Oracle Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel deterministic quantum search algorithm that provides a practical alternative to conventional probabilistic search approaches. Our scheme eliminates the inherent uncertainty of quantum search without relying on arbitrary phase rotations, a key limitation of other deterministic methods. The algorithm achieves certainty by recursively expanding the base oracle so that it marks all states prefixed by the same two bits as the target, encompassing exactly one-quarter of the search space. This enables a step-by-step reduction of the superposition until the target state can be measured with certainty. The algorithm achieves deterministic success with a query complexity of $O(N^{\log_2(3)/2}) \approx O(N^{0.7925})$, falling between Grover's $O(\sqrt{N})$ scaling and the classical $O(N)$. Our approach relies exclusively on two-qubit nearest-neighbour diffusion operators, avoiding global diffusion entirely. We show that, despite the increased query complexity, this design reduces the total number of two-qubit gates required for diffusion by more than an order of magnitude for search spaces up to at least 18 qubits, with even greater advantages on hardware with limited qubit connectivity. The scheme's inherent determinism, reliance on simple nearest-neighbour, low-depth operations, and scalable recursive structure make it well-suited for hardware implementation. Additionally, we show that the algorithm naturally supports partial database search, enabling deterministic identification of selected target bits without requiring a full search, further broadening its applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling quantum computers remains a substantial scientific and technological challenge. Leveraging the full range of intrinsic degrees of freedom in quantum systems offers a promising route towards enhanced algorithmic performance and hardware efficiency. We experimentally study the use of $^{137}$Ba$^+$ ions for quantum information processing, achieving high-fidelity state preparation and readout of up to 25 internal levels, thus forming a 25-dimensional qudit. By probing superpositions of up to 24 states, we investigate how errors scale with qudit dimension $d$ and identify the primary error sources affecting quantum coherence. Additionally, we demonstrate high-dimensional qudit operations by implementing a 3-qubit Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm and a 4-qubit Toffoli gate with a single ion. Our findings suggest that quantum computing architectures based on large-dimensional qudits hold significant promise.</description>

      <title>Mpemba effect in self-contained quantum refrigerators: accelerated cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the qubit-qutrit model of self-contained quantum refrigerator and observe the quantum Mpemba effect in its cooling. In this system, the qutrit acts as the refrigerator while the qubit is to be cooled. The entire system is coupled to three bosonic heat baths, due to which the dynamics of the system is governed by a Gorini-Kossakoswski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation. We investigate the Liouvillian that generates the dynamics of the system and find that it has a block diagonal form. The dynamics of each element of the system's density matrix can be determined by solving the dynamical equation of the corresponding block that contains it. We find that the steady state belongs to the block containing only the diagonal elements in the energy basis. We numerically solve for the steady state and investigate the steady-state cooling over a significant region of the parameter space. Moreover, we demonstrate the quantum Mpemba effect in the refrigerator: a Mpemba state obtained by applying a unitary on the equilibrium state of the system reaches the steady state faster than the equilibrium state, despite the Mpemba state being initially farther away from the steady state. The Mpemba state thus leads to an acceleration in cooling of the cold qubit. We also find that both local and global unitaries on the qubit-qutrit system can generate the Mpemba state. Finally, we study the effect of the qubit-qutrit couplings and the system-bath couplings on the Mpemba effect.</description>

      <title>Quantum computational sensing using quantum signal processing, quantum neural networks, and Hamiltonian engineering</title>

Abstract: Combining quantum sensing with quantum computing can lead to quantum computational sensors that are able to more efficiently extract task-specific information from physical signals than is possible otherwise. Early examples of quantum computational sensing (QCS) have largely focused on protocols where only a single sensing operation appears before measurement -- with an exception being the recent application of Grover's algorithm to signal detection. In this paper we present, in theory and numerical simulations, the application of two quantum algorithms -- quantum signal processing and quantum neural networks -- to various binary and multiclass machine-learning classification tasks in sensing. Here sensing operations are interleaved with computing operations, giving rise to nonlinear functions of the sensed signals. We have evaluated tasks based on static and time-varying signals, including spatiotemporal signals. Our approach to optimizing the circuit parameters in a QCS protocol takes into account quantum sampling noise and allows us to engineer protocols that can yield accurate results with as few as just a single measurement shot. In all cases, we have been able to show a regime of operation where a quantum computational sensor can achieve higher accuracy than a conventional quantum sensor, with a simulated accuracy advantage of $&gt;$20 percentage points for some tasks. We also present protocols for performing nonlinear tasks using Hamiltonian-engineered bosonic systems and quantum signal processing with hybrid qubit-bosonic systems. Overall, we have shown that substantial quantum computational-sensing advantages can be obtained even if the quantum system is small, including few-qubit systems, systems comprising a single qubit and a single bosonic mode, and even just a single qubit alone -- raising the prospects for experimental proof-of-principle and practical realizations.</description>

      <title>Causal Fermion Systems: An Introduction to Fundamental Structures, Methods and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06450v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This textbook introduces the basic concepts of the theory of causal fermion systems, a recent approach to the description of fundamental physics. The theory yields quantum mechanics, general relativity and quantum field theory as limiting cases and is therefore a candidate for a unified physical theory. From the mathematical perspective, causal fermion systems provide a general framework for describing and analyzing non-smooth geometries and "quantum geometries." The dynamics is described by a novel variational principle, the causal action principle.
  The book includes a detailed summary of the mathematical and physical preliminaries. It explains the physical concepts behind the causal fermion system approach from the basics. Moreover, all the mathematical objects and structures are introduced step by step. The mathematical methods used for the analysis of causal fermion systems and the causal action principle are introduced in depth. Many examples and applications are worked out.
  The textbook is addressed to master and graduate students in mathematics or physics. Furthermore, it serves as a reference work for researchers working in the field.</description>

      <title>The Order of Physical Law</title>

Abstract: First-order legal relations specify the duties of legal actors. For instance, the duty not to trespass derives from a first-order law. Second-order legal relations generally concern the intentional, volitional acts of legal actors exercising legal powers to change first-order laws or legal relations. For example, a landowner may exercise a second-order power to change another legal actor's duty not to trespass into a legal permission to enter the landowner's property. This article adapts the notion of legal order to propose a theory of first- and higher-order physical laws, contending that current physical theories implicitly (and wrongly) assume that essentially all physical processes can be modeled using first-order laws. Incorporating second- and higher-order structures from legal models into physical theories provides a novel approach for framing problems in physics, such as the process of quantum measurement. Specifically, quantum measurement is better explained as a fundamentally second-order physical process that alters the underlying first-order physical "microlaws" governing the evolution of the quantum system.</description>

      <title>A quantum algorithm for the n-gluon MHV scattering amplitude</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum algorithm for computing the n-gluon maximally helicity violating (MHV) tree-level scattering amplitude. We revisit a newly proposed method for unitarisation of non-unitary operations and present how this implementation can be used to create quantum gates responsible for the color and kinematic factors of the gluon scattering amplitude. As a proof-of-concept, we detail the full conceptual algorithm that yields the squared amplitude and implement the corresponding building blocks on simulated noiseless quantum circuits for n = 4 to analyze its performance. The algorithm is found to perform well with parameter optimizations, suggesting it to be a good candidate for implementing on quantum computers also for higher multiplicities.</description>

      <title>The Sound of an Orbit: A Quantum Spectrum at the ISCO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum signature of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), a region of profound importance in black hole astrophysics. By modeling an atom as an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a massless scalar field in the Boulware vacuum, we calculate the excitation rate for a detector following a circular geodesic at the ISCO of a Schwarzschild black hole. In stark contrast to the continuous thermal spectra associated with static or infalling observers, our analysis reveals a unique, non-thermal excitation spectrum characterized by a discrete "frequency comb" of sharp, resonant peaks. We show that the locations of these peaks are determined by the orbital frequency at the ISCO, while their intensity increases dramatically as the orbit approaches this final stability boundary. This distinct spectral signature offers a novel theoretical probe of the quantum vacuum in a strong-field gravitational regime and provides a clear distinction between the quantum phenomena experienced by observers on different trajectories. Our findings have potential implications for interpreting the emission spectra from accretion disks and open new avenues for exploring the connection between quantum mechanics and gravity.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Safe Identity Verification using Relativistic Zero-Knowledge Proof Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identity verification is the process of confirming an individual's claimed identity, which is essential in sectors like finance, healthcare, and online services to ensure security and prevent fraud. However, current password/PIN-based identity solutions are susceptible to phishing or skimming attacks, where malicious intermediaries attempt to steal credentials using fake identification portals. Alikhani et al. [Nature, 2021] began exploring identity verification through graph coloring-based relativistic zero-knowledge proofs (RZKPs), a key cryptographic primitive that enables a prover to demonstrate knowledge of secret credentials to a verifier without disclosing any information about the secret. Our work advances this field and addresses unresolved issues: From an engineering perspective, we relax further the relativistic constraints from 60m to 30m, and significantly enhance the stability and scalability of the experimental demonstration of the 2-prover graph coloring-based RZKP protocol for near-term use cases. At the same time, for long-term security against entangled malicious provers, we propose a modified protocol with comparable computation and communication costs, we establish an upper bound on the soundness parameter for this modified protocol. On the other hand, we extend the two-prover, two-verifier setup to a three-prover configuration, demonstrating the security of such relativistic protocols against entangled malicious provers.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Accelerated Large-scale Topology Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method that efficiently solves TO problems and provides a practical pathway to leverage quantum computing to exploit potential quantum advantages. This work targets on large-scale, multi-material TO challenges for three-dimensional (3D) continuum structures, beyond what have been addressed in prior studies. Central to this new method is the modified Dantzig-Wolfe (MDW) decomposition, which effectively mitigates the escalating computational cost associated with using classical Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solvers to solve the master problems involved in TO, by decomposing the MILP into local and global sub-problems. Evaluated on 3D bridge designs, our classical implementation achieves comparable solution quality to state-of-the-art TO methods while reducing computation time by orders of magnitude. It also maintains low runtimes even in extreme cases where classical MILP solvers fail to converge, such as designs involving over 50 million variables. The computationally intensive local sub-problems, which are essentially Binary Integer Programming (BIP) problems, can potentially be accelerated by quantum computing via their equivalent Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations. Enabled by the MDW decomposition, the resulting QUBO formulation requires only sparse qubit connectivity and incurs a QUBO construction cost that scales linearly with problem size, potentially accelerating BIP sub-problem solutions by an additional order of magnitude. All observed and estimated speedups become increasingly significant with larger problem sizes and when moving from single-material to multi-material designs. This suggests that this new method, along with quantum computing, will play an increasingly valuable role in addressing the scale and complexity of real-world TO applications.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Anderson localization in higher-dimensional nonreciprocal lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocity breaks the symmetry between forward and backward propagation, giving rise to a range of peculiar wave phenomena. In this work, we investigate Anderson localization in higher-dimensional nonreciprocal lattices. Focusing on the two-dimensional Hatano-Nelson model, we uncover anisotropic hybrid modes (HMs) that exhibit skin localization along one direction and Anderson localization along the other. We determine the Anderson transition along different directions via the transfer matrix approach and finite-size scaling of Lyapunov exponents. This allows us to map out mobility edges that separate HMs from normal skin modes and Anderson localized modes (ALMs), revealing an ALM-HM-ALM reentrant transition. Our analysis extends to arbitrary dimensions, and we demonstrate the existence of skin-Anderson transitions on the infinite-dimensional nonreciprocal Bethe lattice using the forward-scattering approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of quantized vortices is a unifying feature of quantum mechanical systems, making it a premier means for fundamental and comparative studies of different quantum fluids. Being excited states of motion, vortices are normally unstable towards relaxation into lower energy states. However, here we exploit the driven-dissipative nature of polaritonic fluids of light to create stationary, multiply charged vortices. We measure the spectrum of collective excitations and observe negative energy modes at the core and positive energy modes at large radii. Their coexistence at the same frequency normally causes the dynamical instability, but here intrinsic losses stabilize the system, allowing for phase pinning by the pump on macroscopic scales. We observe common features of quantized vortices in quantum fluids and other rotating geometries like astrophysical compact objects, opening the way to the study of universal amplification phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Passwords that are long and human-generated pose a challenge for both classical and quantum attacks due to their irregular structure and large search space. In this work, we present an enhanced classical-quantum hybrid attack tailored to this scenario. We build rainbow tables using dictionary-based password generation with transformation rules to better model real user behavior. These tables are then organized into buckets, enabling faster lookup and reduced space complexity. To perform quantum search within each bucket, we use a distributed exact variant of Grover's algorithm, which offers lower circuit depth and deterministic success. As a result, the overall quantum circuit is shallower and more robust against noise, particularly from depolarizing channels commonly found in near-term quantum devices. Through this work, Overall, we propose a hybrid framework that combines structured rainbow tables with efficient quantum search to enhance password recovery.</description>

      <title>Reconciling Translational Invariance and Hierarchy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks are not only numerical tools for describing ground states of quantum many-body systems, but also conceptual aids for understanding their entanglement structures. The proper way to understand tensor networks themselves is through explicit examples of solvable ground states that they describe exactly. In fact, this has historically been how tensor networks for gapped ground states, such as the matrix product state (MPS) and the projected entangled paired state, emerged as an elegant analytical framework from numerical techniques like the density matrix renormalization group. However, for gapless ground states, generically described by the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), a corresponding exactly solvable model has so far been missing. This is because the hierarchical structure of MERA intrinsically breaks the translational invariance. We identify a condition for MERA to be compatible with translational invariance by examining equivalent networks of rank-3 tensors. The condition is satisfied by the previously constructed hierarchical tensor network for the Motzkin and Fredkin chains, which can be considered a non-unitary generalization to the MERA. The hierarchical TN description is complemented by a translationally invariant MPS alternative, which is used to derive the power-law decay of the correlation function and critical exponents.</description>

Abstract: We solve the nuclear two-body and three-body bound states via quantum simulations of pionless effective field theory on a lattice in position space. While the employed lattice remains small, the usage of local Hamiltonians including two- and three-body forces ensures that the number of Pauli terms scales linearly with increasing numbers of lattice sites. We use an adaptive ansatz grown from unitary coupled cluster theory to parametrize the ground states of the deuteron and $^3$He, compute their corresponding energies, and analyze the scaling of the required computational resources.</description>

      <title>Spiral renormalization group flow and universal entanglement spectrum of the non-Hermitian 5-state Potts model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum $5$-state Potts model is known to possess a perturbative description using complex conformal field theory (CCFT), the analytic continuation of ``theory space" to a complex plane. To study the corresponding complex fixed point on the lattice, the model must be deformed by an additional non-Hermitian term due to its complex coefficient $\lambda$. Although the variational principle breaks down in this case, we demonstrate that tensor network algorithms are still capable of simulating these non-Hermitian theories. We access system sizes up to $L = 28$, which enable the observation of the theoretically predicted spiral flow of the running couplings. Moreover, we reconstruct the full boundary CCFT spectrum through the entanglement Hamiltonian encoded in the ground state. Our work demonstrates how tensor networks are the correct approach to capturing the approximate conformal invariance of weakly first-order phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-induced Hall-like lateral forces in a chiral-gain environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we demonstrate that vacuum fluctuations can induce lateral forces on a small particle positioned near a translation-invariant uniform non-Hermitian substrate with chiral gain. This type of non-Hermitian response can be engineered by biasing a low-symmetry conductor with a static electric field and is rooted in the quantum geometry of the material through the Berry curvature dipole. The chiral-gain material acts as an active medium for a particular circular polarisation handedness, while serving as a passive, dissipative medium for the other polarisation handedness. Owing to the nonreciprocity and gain characteristics, momentum is continuously exchanged in a preferred direction parallel to the surface between the test particle and the surrounding electromagnetic field, giving rise to lateral forces. Interestingly, the force can be viewed as a fluctuation-induced drag linked to the nonlinear Hall current. Indeed, although the gain is driven by an electric current, the resulting force acts perpendicular to the bias -- unlike conventional current-drag effects. This effect stems from the skewed propagation characteristics of surface modes and gain-momentum locking. Our theory reveals a Hall-like asymmetry in the field correlations and establishes a novel link between quantum geometry and fluctuation-induced phenomena, offering new possibilities for nanoscale control via tailored electromagnetic environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) have emerged as a critical backbone for supporting the low-altitude economy, particularly with the densification of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and high-altitude platforms (HAPs). To meet growing data demands, some LAWN deployments incorporate free-space optical (FSO) links, which offer exceptional bandwidth and beam directivity. However, without strong security measures in place, both conventional radio frequency channels and FSO beams remain vulnerable to interception and spoofing and FSO in particular can suffer from turbulence, misalignment, and weather-related attenuation. To address these challenges in the quantum era, a quantum-secure architecture called Quantum Skyshield is proposed to enable reliable communication between the base transceiver station (BTS) and LAWN. The proposed design integrates BB84 quantum key distribution (QKD) with post-quantum authentication mechanisms. Simulation results confirm the reliable generation of a 128-bit symmetric key when the quantum bit error rate (QBER) remains below the threshold of 11%. Authentication is enforced using Lamport one-time signatures and hash-based message authentication codes (HMAC) to ensure message integrity. A Grover-inspired threat detection mechanism identifies anomalies with up to 89% probability in a single iteration, enabling real-time trust evaluation. Lastly, future research challenges have also been identified and discussed to guide further development in this area.</description>

      <title>Interference and short-range correlation in fermionic Hubbard gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interference patterns of ultracold atoms, observed after ballistic expansion from optical lattices, encode essential information about strongly correlated lattice systems, including phase coherence and non-local correlations. While the interference of lattice bosons has been extensively investigated, quantitative studies of the lattice fermion interference remain challenging. Here, we report the observation and quantitative characterization of interference patterns in low-temperature, homogeneous fermionic Hubbard gases. We develop a novel method to extract first-order correlations from interference patterns, which directly reflect the short-range phase coherence of lattice fermions. Mapping the nearest-neighbor correlations as a function of lattice filling and interaction strength, we observe a crossover from a metal to a Mott insulator. Moreover, at half filling, the measured correlations agree well with quantum Monte Carlo calculations and remain finite in the regime of strong repulsion, revealing virtual tunneling processes driven by quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Old Rules in a New Game: Mapping Uncertainty Quantification to Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the key obstacles in traditional deep learning is the reduction in model transparency caused by increasingly intricate model functions, which can lead to problems such as overfitting and excessive confidence in predictions. With the advent of quantum machine learning offering possible advances in computational power and latent space complexity, we notice the same opaque behavior. Despite significant research in classical contexts, there has been little advancement in addressing the black-box nature of quantum machine learning. Consequently, we approach this gap by building upon existing work in classical uncertainty quantification and initial explorations in quantum Bayesian modeling to theoretically develop and empirically evaluate techniques to map classical uncertainty quantification methods to the quantum machine learning domain. Our findings emphasize the necessity of leveraging classical insights into uncertainty quantification to include uncertainty awareness in the process of designing new quantum machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Potential barriers are nearly-ideal quantum thermoelectrics at finite power output</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics defines the ideal quantum thermoelectric, with maximum possible efficiency at finite power output. However, such an ideal thermoelectric is challenging to implement experimentally. Instead, here we consider two types of thermoelectrics regularly implemented in experiments: (i) finite-height potential barriers or quantum point contacts, and (ii) double-barrier structures or single-level quantum dots. We model them with Landauer scattering theory as (i) step transmissions and (ii) Lorentzian transmissions. We optimize their thermodynamic efficiency for any given power output, when they are used as thermoelectric heat-engines or refrigerators. The Lorentzian's efficiency is excellent at vanishing power, but we find that it is poor at the finite powers of practical interest. In contrast, the step transmission is remarkably close to ideal efficiency (typically within 15%) at all power outputs. The step transmission is also close to ideal in the presence of phonons and other heat-leaks, for which the Lorentzian performs very poorly. Thus, a simple nanoscale thermoelectric - made with a potential barrier or quantum point contact - is almost as efficient as an ideal thermoelectric.</description>

Abstract: We consider quantum mechanics in spacetime with time anisotropy. Such Lifshitz quantum mechanics is characterized by a kinetic term with fractional derivatives. We show that, contrary to popular belief, local conservation of probability is respected when the probability current is properly identified. As an application we consider a Josephson Junction with an anisotropic insulating layer. We show that anisotropy affects the tunneling rate and can greatly enhance the working of Josephson Junction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heusler alloys were discovered in 1903, and materials with half-metallic characteristics have drawn more attention from researchers since the advances in semiconductor industry. Heusler alloys have found application as spin-filters, tunnel junctions or giant magnetoresistance (GMR) devices in technological applications. In this work, the electronic structures, phonon dispersion, thermal properties, and electrical conductivities of PdMnSn and six novel alloys (AuCrSn, AuMnGe, Au2MnSn, Cu2NiGe, Pd2NiGe and Pt2CoSn) along with their magnetic moments are studied using ab initio calculations to understand the roots of half-metallicity in these alloys of Heusler family. From the phonon dispersion, the thermodynamic stability of the alloys in their respective phases is assessed. Phonon modes were also used to further understand the electrical transport in the crystals of these seven alloys. This study evaluates the relationship between materials' electrical conductivity and minority-spin bandgap in the band structure, and it provides suggestions for selecting constituent elements when designing new half-metallic Heusler alloys of C1b and L21 structures.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of jump-diffusion stochastic differential equations by hysteresis switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the stabilization of both classical and quantum systems modeled by jump-diffusion stochastic differential equations using a novel hysteresis switching strategy. Unlike traditional methods that depend on global Lyapunov functions or require each subsystem to stabilize the target state individually, our approach employs local Lyapunov-like conditions and state-dependent switching to achieve global asymptotic or exponential stability with finitely many switches almost surely. We rigorously establish the well-posedness of the resulting switched systems and derive sufficient conditions for stability. The framework is further extended to quantum feedback control systems governed by stochastic master equations with both diffusive and jump dynamics. Notably, our method relaxes restrictive invariance assumptions often necessary in prior work, enhancing practical applicability in experimental quantum settings. Additionally, the proposed strategy offers promising avenues for robust control under model uncertainties and perturbations, paving the way for future developments in both classical and quantum control.</description>

      <title>Observation of Self-Bound Droplets of Ultracold Dipolar Molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultracold gases of dipolar molecules have long been envisioned as a platform for the realization of novel quantum phases. Recent advances in collisional shielding, protecting molecules from inelastic losses, have enabled the creation of degenerate Fermi gases and, more recently, Bose-Einstein condensation of dipolar molecules. However, the observation of quantum phases in ultracold molecular gases that are driven by dipole-dipole interactions has so far remained elusive. In this work, we report the formation of self-bound droplets and droplet arrays in an ultracold gas of strongly dipolar sodium-cesium molecules. Starting from a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), microwave dressing fields are used to induce dipole-dipole interactions with controllable strength and anisotropy. By varying the speed at which interactions are induced, covering a dynamic range of four orders of magnitude, we prepare droplets under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions, observing a transition from robust one-dimensional (1D) arrays to fluctuating two-dimensional (2D) structures. The droplets exhibit densities up to 100 times higher than the initial BEC, reaching the strongly interacting regime, and suggesting the possibility of a quantum-liquid or crystalline state. This work establishes ultracold molecules as a system for the exploration of strongly dipolar quantum matter and opens the door to the realization of self-organized crystal phases and dipolar spin liquids in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Markov Gaps and Entanglement Wedge Multiway Cuts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Markov gap, defined as the difference between reflected entropy and mutual information, serves as a diagnostic for quantum recoverability and multipartite entanglement. In holographic settings, it admits a geometric interpretation as the deviation between entanglement wedge cross-sections and RT surfaces. Motivated by this holographic perspective, we propose a generalization of the Markov gap to multipartite systems by using a reflected multi-entropy. The resulting Multipartite Markov gap can capture geometric obstructions to bulk reconstruction. We investigate the properties of this quantity from both information-theoretic and holographic viewpoints, and examine its potential operational significance through candidate recovery maps. We further introduce the genuine reflected multi-entropy, which is designed to vanish for states containing only lower-partite entanglement. Together, these quantities offer complementary probes of recoverability and multipartite structure in holographic quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of Hybrid Optimization Method for Quantum Annealing Machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To enhance the performance of quantum annealing machines, several methods have been proposed to reduce the number of spins by fixing spin values through preprocessing. We proposed a hybrid optimization method that combines a simulated annealing (SA)-based non-quantum-type Ising machine with a quantum annealing machine. However, its applicability remains unclear. Therefore, we evaluated the performance of the hybrid method on large-size Ising models and analyzed its characteristics. The results indicate that the hybrid method improves upon solutions obtained by the preprocessing SA, even if the Ising models cannot be embedded in the quantum annealing machine. We analyzed the method from three perspectives: preprocessing, spin-fixed sub-Ising model generation method, and the accuracy of the quantum annealing machine. From the viewpoint of the minimum energy gap, we found that solving the sub-Ising model with a quantum annealing machine results in a higher solution accuracy than solving the original Ising model. Additionally, we demonstrated that the number of fixed spins and the accuracy of the quantum annealing machine affect the dependency of the solution accuracy on the sub-Ising model size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin shuttling offers a promising approach for developing scalable silicon-based quantum processors by addressing the connectivity limitations of quantum dots (QDs). In this work, we demonstrate high-fidelity bucket-brigade (BB) spin shuttling in a silicon MOS device, utilizing Pauli Spin Blockade (PSB) readout. We achieve an average shuttling fidelity of \SI{99.8}{\percent}. The residual shuttling error is highly sensitive to the ratio between interdot tunnel coupling and Zeeman splitting, with tuning of these parameters enabling up to a twenty-fold variation in error rate. An appropriate four-level Hamiltonian model supports our findings. These results provide valuable insights for optimizing high-performance spin shuttling systems in future quantum architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent control of ultrafast quantum phenomena benefits from the pulse-shaping capabilities allowing to modulate the envelope and instantaneous phase of optical fields on femtosecond time scales. While such control is available for optical fields, an analogy of a pulse shaper for freely propagating electrons is lacking. In this study, we theoretically demonstrate a method that enables near arbitrary light-based shaping of electron wave packets in the time domain. The method is based on the quantum phase modulation of electron waves by coherent light with time-dependent frequency leading to generation of spectrally separated electron energy side bands with shaped time-energy profiles and envelopes. Our results show that few femtosecond time durations can be achieved without additional spectral broadening of the electron wave packet, allowing one to reach the combination of high time, spatial, and spectral resolutions in ultrafast imaging and diffraction experiments with pulsed electron beams.</description>

      <title>A Robust COTS Objective for Diffraction-Limited, High-NA, Long Front Working Distance Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a robust objective lens optimized for applications requiring both high numerical aperture (NA) and long front working distance imaging comprised of all commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) singlet lenses. Unlike traditional designs that require separate collimation and refocusing stages, our approach directly converges imaged light to the back focal plane using a single lens group. Our configuration corrects spherical aberrations and efficiently collects light to achieve diffraction-limited performance across a wide range of wavelengths while simplifying alignment and assembly. Using this approach, we design and construct an example objective lens that features a long front working distance of 61 mm and a clipped NA of 0.30 (limited by an aperture in our experimental setup). We experimentally verify that it achieves monochromatic diffraction-limited resolution at wavelengths from 375 nm to 866 nm without requiring replacement of the lenses or changing the inter-lens spacings, and its performance remains robust across a 46 mm range variation in total length (by adjusting mainly the back working distances). Additionally, we develop a quantitative method to measure the field of view (FOV) using an experimentally-calibrated pinhole target. Under 397 nm illumination (i.e. from $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion fluorescence), the objective achieves a resolution of 0.87 $\mu$m with a 540 $\mu$m FOV. This robust, all-COTS, and versatile design is well-suited for a broad range of experiments, supporting high-precision measurements and exploring quantum phenomena.</description>

Abstract: A hallmark of the computational campaign in nuclear and particle physics is the lattice-gauge-theory program. It continues to enable theoretical predictions for a range of phenomena in nature from the underlying Standard Model. The emergence of a new computational paradigm based on quantum computing, therefore, can introduce further advances in this program. In particular, it is believed that quantum computing will make possible first-principles studies of matter at extreme densities, and in and out of equilibrium, hence improving our theoretical description of early universe, astrophysical environments, and high-energy particle collisions. Developing and advancing a quantum-computing based lattice-gauge-theory program, therefore, is a vibrant and fast-moving area of research in theoretical nuclear and particle physics.
  These lecture notes introduce the topic of quantum computing lattice gauge theories in a pedagogical manner, with an emphasis on theoretical and algorithmic aspects of the program, and on the most common approaches and practices, to keep the presentation focused and useful. Hamiltonian formulation of lattice gauge theories is introduced within the Kogut-Susskind framework, the notion of Hilbert space and physical states is discussed, and some elementary numerical methods for performing Hamiltonian simulations are discussed. Quantum-simulation preliminaries and digital quantum-computing basics are presented, which set the stage for concrete examples of gauge-theory quantum-circuit design and resource analysis. A step-by-step analysis is provided for a simpler Abelian gauge theory, and an overview of our current understanding of the quantum-computing cost of quantum chromodynamics is presented in the end. Examples and exercises augment the material, and reinforce the concepts and methods introduced throughout.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.02820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss efficient methods to optimize the metrological performance over local Hamiltonians in a bipartite quantum system. For a given quantum state, our methods find the best local Hamiltonian for which the state outperforms separable states the most from the point of view of quantum metrology. We show that this problem can be reduced to maximize the quantum Fisher information over a certain set of Hamiltonians. We present the quantum Fisher information in a bilinear form and maximize it by an iterative see-saw (ISS) method, in which each step is based on semidefinite programming. We also solve the problem with the method of moments that works very well for smaller systems. We consider a number of other problems in quantum information theory that can be solved in a similar manner. For instance, we determine the bound entangled quantum states that maximally violate the Computable Cross Norm-Realignment (CCNR) criterion. Our approach is one of the efficient methods that can be applied for an optimization of the unitary dynamics in quantum metrology, the other methods being, for example, machine learning, variational quantum circuits, or neural networks. The advantage of our method is the fast and robust convergence due to the simple mathematical structure of the approach.</description>

Abstract: Generating large multiphoton entangled states is of main interest due to enabling universal photonic quantum computing and all-optical quantum repeater nodes. These applications exploit measurement-based quantum computation using cluster states. Remarkably, it was shown that photonic cluster states of arbitrary size can be generated by using feasible heralded linear optics fusion gates that act on heralded three-photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states as the initial resource state. Thus, the capability of generating heralded GHZ states is of great importance for scaling up photonic quantum computing. Here, we experimentally demonstrate this required building block by reporting a polarisation-encoded heralded GHZ state of three photons, for which we build a high-rate six-photon source ($547{\pm}2$ Hz) from a solid-state quantum emitter and a stable polarisation-based interferometer. The detection of three ancillary photons heralds the generation of three-photon GHZ states among the remaining particles with fidelities up to $\mathcal{F}=0.7278{\pm}0.0106$. Our results initiate a path for scalable entangling operations using heralded linear-optics implementations.</description>

      <title>Robust Error Accumulation Suppression for Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16884v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a \textit{robust error accumulation suppression} (\textbf{REAS}) technique to manage errors in quantum computers. Our method reduces the accumulation of errors in any quantum circuit composed of single- or two-qubit gates expressed as $e^{-i \sigma\theta }$ for Pauli operators $\sigma$ and $\theta \in [0,\pi)$, which forms a universal gate set. For coherent errors -- which include gate overrotation and crosstalk -- we demonstrate a reduction of the error scaling in an $L$-depth circuit from $O(L)$ to $O(\sqrt{L})$. This asymptotic error suppression behavior can be proven in a regime where all gates -- including those constituting the error-suppressing protocol itself -- are noisy. Going beyond coherent errors, we derive the general form of decoherence noise that can be suppressed by REAS. Lastly, we experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach regarding realistic errors using 100-qubit circuits with up to 64 two-qubit gate layers on IBM Quantum processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14931v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum states of a spin $\tfrac{1}{2}$ (a qubit) are parametrized by the space ${\mathbf {CP}}^1 \sim S^2$, the Bloch sphere. A spin $j$ for a generic $j$ (a $2j+1$-state system) is represented instead by a point of a larger space, ${\mathbf {CP}}^{2j}$. Here we study the state of a single angular momentum/spin in the limit, $j \to \infty$. The special class of states $ | j, {\mathbf n}\rangle \in {\mathbf {CP}}^{2j} $, with spin oriented towards definite spatial directions ${\mathbf n} \in S^2$, i.e., $({\mathbf J}\cdot {\mathbf n} ) \, | j, {\mathbf n}\rangle = j\, |j, {\mathbf n}\rangle $, are found to behave as classical angular momenta, $j \, {\mathbf n}$, in this limit. Vice versa, general spin states in ${\mathbf {CP}}^{2j}$ do not become classical, even at large $j$. We discuss these questions, by analysing the Stern-Gerlach processes, the angular-momentum composition rule, and the rotation matrix. Our observations help to clarify better how classical mechanics emerges from quantum mechanics in this context (e.g., with unique trajectories for a particle carrying a large spin), and to make the widespread idea that large spins somehow become classical, more precise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain the complexity geometry associated with the Hamiltonian of a quantum mechanical system, specifically in cases where the Hamiltonian is explicitly time-dependent. Using Nielsen's geometric formulation of circuit complexity, we calculate the bi-invariant cost associated with these time-dependent Hamiltonians by suitably regularising their norms and obtain analytical expressions of the costs for several well-known time-dependent quantum mechanical systems. Specifically, we show that an equivalence exists between the total costs of obtaining an operator through time evolution generated by a unit mass harmonic oscillator whose frequency depends on time, and a harmonic oscillator whose both mass and frequency are functions of time. These results are illustrated with several examples, including a specific smooth quench protocol where the comparison of time variation of the cost with other information theoretic quantities, such as the Shannon entropy, is discussed.</description>

Abstract: A topological quantum number, the Witten index, characterizes supersymmetric models by probing for zero energy modes and the possibility of supersymmetry breaking. We propose an averaging method to infer the Witten index in quantum analog simulators. Motivated by recent work on Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays, we consider a related supersymmetric XXZ spin model. We show how to infer the Witten index from open system averaging and numerically demonstrate its topological robustness in this model. Our Letter defines a route for quantum analog simulators to directly identify many-body topological physics.</description>

Abstract: We derive a class of cellular automata for the Schr\"odinger Hamiltonian, including scalar and vector potentials. It is based on a multi-split of the Hamiltonian, resulting in a multi-step unitary evolution operator in discrete time and space. Experiments with one-dimensional automata offer quantitative insight in phase and group velocities, energy levels, related approximation errors, and the evolution of a time-dependent harmonic oscilator. The apparent effects of spatial waveform aliasing are intriguing. Interference experiments with two-dimensional automata include refraction, Davisson-Germer, Mach-Zehnder, single &amp; double slit, and Aharonov-Bohm.</description>

      <title>Mixing of counterpropagating signals in a traveling-wave Josephson device</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light waves do not interact in vacuum, but may mix through various parametric processes when traveling in a nonlinear medium. In particular, a high-amplitude wave can be leveraged to frequency convert a low-amplitude signal, as long as the overall energy and momentum of interacting photons are conserved. These conditions are typically met when all waves propagate in the medium with comparable phase velocity along a particular axis. In this work, we investigate an alternative scheme by which an input microwave signal propagating along a 1-dimensional Josephson metamaterial is converted to an output wave propagating in the opposite direction. The interaction is mediated by a pump wave propagating at low phase velocity. In this regime, the input signal is exponentially attenuated as it travels down the device. We exploit this process to implement a robust on-chip microwave isolator that can be reconfigured into a reciprocal and tunable coupler. The device mode of operation is selected in situ, along with its working frequency over a wide microwave range. We measure an isolation over 5 dB in the 5-8.5 GHz range and over 10 dB in the 7-8.5 GHz range on a typical bandwidth of 200 MHz. Substantial margin for improvement exists through design optimization and by reducing fabrication disorder, opening new avenues for microwave routing and processing in superconducting circuits.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we introduce the concept of Classicality and derive Wigner inequalities that depend on two instants, with a potential extension to three instants. We explore the experimental feasibility of testing the violations of these inequalities in both pure and mixed flavor states of $K^0$-, $D^0$-, and $B_s$- meson pairs. Using the Werner noise model, we demonstrate that violations of time-dependent Wigner inequalities can be detected even when background processes constitute up to 50% of the system.</description>

Abstract: Non-commutative polynomial optimization (NPO) problems seek to minimize the state average of a polynomial of some operator variables, subject to polynomial constraints, over all states and operators, as well as the Hilbert spaces where those might be defined. Many of these problems are known to admit a complete hierarchy of semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations. In this work, we consider a variant of NPO problems where a subset of the operator variables satisfies a system of ordinary differential equations. We find that, under mild conditions of operator boundedness, for every such problem one can construct a standard NPO problem with the same solution. This allows us to define a complete hierarchy of SDPs to tackle the original differential problem. We apply this method to bound averages of local observables in quantum spin systems subject to a Hamiltonian evolution (i.e., a quench). We find that, even in the thermodynamic limit of infinitely many sites, low levels of the hierarchy provide very good approximations for reasonably long evolution times.</description>

      <title>A New Framework for Quantum Phases in Open Systems: Steady State of Imaginary-Time Lindbladian Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study delves into the concept of quantum phases in open quantum systems, examining the shortcomings of existing approaches that focus on steady states of Lindbladians and highlighting their limitations in capturing key phase transitions. In contrast to these methods, we introduce the concept of imaginary-time Lindbladian evolution as an alternative framework. This new approach defines gapped quantum phases in open systems through the spectrum properties of the imaginary-Liouville superoperator. We find that, in addition to all pure gapped ground states, the Gibbs state of a stabilizer Hamiltonian at any finite temperature can also be characterized by our scheme, demonstrated through explicit construction. Moreover, the closing of the imaginary Liouville gap is associated with the divergence of the Markov length, which has recently been proposed as an indicator of phase transitions in open quantum systems. To illustrate the effectiveness of this framework, we apply it to investigate the phase diagram for open systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\sigma}\times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\tau}$ symmetry, including cases with nontrivial average symmetry protected topological order or spontaneous symmetry breaking order. Our findings demonstrate universal properties at quantum criticality, such as nonanalytic behaviors of steady-state observables, divergence of correlation lengths, and closing of the imaginary-Liouville gap. These results advance our understanding of quantum phase transitions in open quantum systems. In contrast, we find that the steady states of real-time Lindbladians do not provide an effective framework for characterizing phase transitions in open systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the performance of a quantum battery in terms of energy storage and energy extraction, assisted by nonlinearities in a Dicke quantum battery utilizing an open-system approach. In particular, we consider two types of nonlinearities in the system, viz. nonlinearity in the coupling between battery and the cavity, and the cavity itself comprising an anharmonic oscillator. In both these scenarios, the cavity is connected to an environment, and is driven by an external laser source. We derive the Markovian master equation for the dynamics of the combined cavity-battery system in presence of the environment. When the cavity is non-linearly coupled to a battery, we find an enhancement in the steady state ergotropy over the linearly-coupled case. We further see that the times at which steady state ergotopy is attained get decreased in the presence of nonlinear coupling. We additionally find a complementarity between the nonlinear interaction strength and the coherent-drive strength in the steady-state ergotropy values, i.e. the same ergotropy as that obtained using weak nonlinearity and strong coherent drive can be obtained utilizing an opposite order of their values. We also identify the nonlinear interaction where the cavity can be considered as a ``charger" and show an advantage of using the nonlinear coupling over linear ones. In case when the cavity is modeled as a multi-level transmon with an inherent anharmonicity, we find an advantage in maximum ergotropy values over the harmonic instance. Unlike the non-linearly coupled batteries, the ones mediated by an anharmonic cavity prove to be useful in the transient regime. We also determine values of the coherent drive for which the anharmonic battery is beneficial over the harmonic one at all timescales. Further, we observe a distinct region of the anharmonic strength and coherent drive where ergotropy values reach their maxima.</description>

      <title>Optimal convergence rates in trace distance and relative entropy for the quantum central limit theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum analogue of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), first introduced by Cushen and Hudson (1971), states that the $n$-fold convolution $\rho^{\boxplus n}$ of an $m$-mode quantum state $\rho$, with zero first moments and finite second moments, converges weakly, as $n$ increases, to a Gaussian state $\rho_G$ with the same first and second moments. Recently, this result has been extended with estimates of the convergence rate in various distance measures. In this paper, we establish optimal rates of convergence in both the trace distance and quantum relative entropy. Specifically, we show that for a centered $m$-mode quantum state with finite third-order moments, the trace distance between $\rho^{\boxplus n}$ and $\rho_G$ decays at the optimal rate of $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})$. Furthermore, for states with finite fourth-order moments (order $4+\delta$ for an arbitrary small $\delta&gt;0$ if $m&gt;1$), we prove that the relative entropy between $\rho^{\boxplus n}$ and $\rho_G$ decays at the optimal rate of $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1})$. Both of these rates are proven to be optimal, even when assuming the finiteness of all moments of $\rho$. These results relax previous assumptions on higher-order moments, yielding convergence rates that match the best known results in the classical setting. By giving explicit examples we also show that our moment assumptions are essentially minimal. We show that for any $\theta&gt;0$, there exists a quantum state $\rho$ with finite moments of order less than $3-\theta$, such that the convergence rate of $\rho^{\boxplus n}$ to $\rho_G$ in trace distance is not $\mathcal O(n^{-1/2})$. Similarly, we show that for any $\theta&gt;0$, there exists a quantum state $\rho$ with finite moments of order less than $4-\theta$, such that the relative entropy between $\rho^{\boxplus n}$ to $\rho_G$ does not decay at the rate $\mathcal O(n^{-1})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of testing and learning from data in the presence of resource constraints, such as limited memory or weak data access, which place limitations on the efficiency and feasibility of testing or learning. In particular, we ask the following question: Could a resource-constrained learner/tester use interaction with a resource-unconstrained but untrusted party to solve a learning or testing problem more efficiently than they could without such an interaction? In this work, we answer this question both abstractly and for concrete problems, in two complementary ways: For a wide variety of scenarios, we prove that a resource-constrained learner cannot gain any advantage through classical interaction with an untrusted prover. As a special case, we show that for the vast majority of testing and learning problems in which quantum memory is a meaningful resource, a memory-constrained quantum algorithm cannot overcome its limitations via classical communication with a memory-unconstrained quantum prover. In contrast, when quantum communication is allowed, we construct a variety of interactive proof protocols, for specific learning and testing problems, which allow memory-constrained quantum verifiers to gain significant advantages through delegation to untrusted provers. These results highlight both the limitations and potential of delegating learning and testing problems to resource-rich but untrusted third parties.</description>

      <title>Fast entangling gates for Rydberg atoms via resonant dipole-dipole interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of digital neutral-atom quantum computers relies on the development of fast and robust protocols for high-fidelity quantum operations. In this work, we introduce a novel scheme for entangling gates using four atomic levels per atom: a ground-state qubit and two Rydberg states. A laser field couples the qubit to one of the two Rydberg states, while a microwave field drives transitions between the two Rydberg states, enabling a resonant dipole-dipole interaction between different atoms. We show that controlled-Z gates can be realized in this scheme without requiring optical phase modulation and relying solely on a microwave field with time-dependent phase and amplitude. We demonstrate that such gates are faster and less sensitive to Rydberg decay than state-of-the-art Rydberg gates based on van der Waals interactions. Moreover, we systematically stabilize our protocol against interatomic distance fluctuations and analyze its performance in realistic setups with rubidium or cesium atoms. Our results open up new avenues to the use of microwave-driven dipolar interactions for quantum computation with neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>Unwanted couplings can induce amplification in quantum memories despite negligible apparent noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical quantum memory design often involves selectively focusing on certain energy levels to mimic an ideal $\Lambda$-configuration, a common approach that may unintentionally overlook the impact of neighboring levels or undesired couplings. While this simplification may be justified in certain protocols or platforms, it can significantly distort the achievable memory performance. Through numerical semi-classical analysis, we show that the presence of unwanted energy levels and undesired couplings in an NV-center-based absorptive memory can significantly amplify the signal, resulting in memory efficiencies exceeding unity, a clear indication of unwanted noise at the quantum level. Strikingly, this effect occurs even when the apparent noise i.e., output in the absence of an input field, is negligible. We then generalize our results using semi-analytical estimations to analyze this amplification, and propose a strategy to reduce its effect. Our findings extend to memory platforms beyond NV centers; as an example, we also analyze a cavity-based rubidium memory that experiences the same issue.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic construction of SSA-compatible extreme rays of the subadditivity cone and the ${\sf N}=6$ solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15364v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the set of all extreme rays of the 6-party subadditivity cone that are compatible with strong subadditivity. In total, we identify 208 new (genuine 6-party) orbits, 52 of which violate at least one known holographic entropy inequality. For the remaining 156 orbits, which do not violate any such inequalities, we construct holographic graph models for 150 of them. For the final 6 orbits, it remains an open question whether they are holographic. Consistent with the strong form of the conjecture in arXiv:2204.00075, 148 of these graph models are trees. However, 2 of the graphs contain a "bulk cycle", leaving open the question of whether equivalent models with tree topology exist, or if these extreme rays are counterexamples to the conjecture. The paper includes a detailed description of the algorithm used for the computation, which is presented in a general framework and can be applied to any situation involving a polyhedral cone defined by a set of linear inequalities and a partial order among them to find extreme rays corresponding to down-sets in this poset.</description>

      <title>Superactivation and Incompressibility of Genuine Multipartite Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum correlations in the form of entanglement, quantum steering or Bell nonlocality are resources for various information-processing tasks, but their detailed quantification and characterization remain complicated. One counter-intuitive effect is the phenomenon of superactivation, meaning that two copies of a quantum state may exhibit forms of correlations which are absent on the single-copy level. We develop a systematic approach towards a full understanding of this phenomenon using the paradigm of genuine multipartite entanglement. We introduce systematic methods for studying superactivation of entanglement based on symmetries and generalized notions of multipartite distillability. With this, we present novel criteria for superactivation as well as a quantitative theory of it. Finally, we prove the existence of incompressible entanglement, meaning that there are quantum states for which superactivated multipartite entanglement cannot be reduced to the single-copy level.</description>

      <title>GHZ-W Genuinely Entangled Subspace Verification with Adaptive Local Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Genuinely entangled subspaces (GESs) are valuable resources in quantum information science. Among these, the three-qubit GHZ-W GES, spanned by the three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and W states, is a universal and crucial entangled subspace resource for three-qubit systems. In this work, we develop two adaptive verification strategies, the XZ strategy and the rotation strategy, for the three-qubit GHZ-W GES using local measurements and one-way classical communication. These strategies are experimentally feasible, efficient and possess a concise analytical expression for the sample complexity of the rotation strategy, which scales approximately as $2.248\epsilon^{-1}\ln\delta^{-1}$, where $\epsilon$ is the infidelity and $1-\delta$ is the confidence level. Furthermore, we comprehensively analyze the two-dimensional two-qubit subspaces and classify them into three distinct types, which include unverifiable entangled subspaces, revealing intrinsic limitations in local verification of entangled subspaces.</description>

      <title>Violation of the Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation in Quantum Collisional Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) is a fundamental principle in non-equilibrium thermodynamics that relates entropy production to fluctuations in a system, establishing a trade-off between the precision of an observable and the thermodynamic cost. Investigating TUR violations challenges classical thermodynamic limits, offering the potential for improved precision-entropy trade-offs, which is crucial for enhancing performance and optimization in quantum technologies. In this work, we investigate the thermodynamic uncertainty relation within a quantum collisional model, which offers the advantage of discretizing interactions into successive collisions with auxiliaries, allowing for precise tracking of dynamics and the incorporation of memory effects and non-Markovian behavior. We consider three types of dynamics in the collisional model: one is Markovian evolution, achieved by taking the continuous time limit and imposing the stability condition, while the other two are non-Markovian dynamics-one arising from increasing the collision time between the system and the auxiliaries, and the other from incorporating interactions between the auxiliaries. For the Markovian dynamics, we examine the classical and quantum TUR bounds in the non-equilibrium steady-state regime, and also the finite-time TUR bound. We identify two distinct regimes of classical TUR violation: in some cases, the maximum violation occurs in the steady state, while in others, it is necessarily transient-appearing only at early times and vanishing with further evolution. For the two non-Markovian approaches, we find that both the degree and type of non-Markovianity crucially affect TUR violations. The second approach shows more pronounced violations during transient times, while the first approach has much stronger violations in the steady-state regime for a certain parameter window.</description>

      <title>Exact steady state of perturbed open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06134v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general non-perturbative method to determine the exact steady state of open quantum systems under perturbation. The method works for systems with a unique steady state and the perturbation may be time-independent or periodic, and of arbitrarily large amplitude. Using the Drazin inverse and a single diagonalization, we construct an operator that generates the entire dependence of the steady state on the perturbation parameter. The approach also enables exact analytic operations-such as differentiation, integration, and ensemble averaging-with respect to the parameter, even when the steady state is computed numerically. We apply the method to three non-trivial open quantum systems, showing that it achieves exact results, with a computational speedup of one to several orders of magnitude for calculations requiring large sampling, compared to previous approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptation to climate change requires robust climate projections, yet the uncertainty in these projections performed by ensembles of Earth system models (ESMs) remains large. This is mainly due to uncertainties in the representation of subgrid-scale processes such as turbulence or convection that are partly alleviated at higher resolution. New developments in machine learning-based hybrid ESMs demonstrate great potential for systematically reduced errors compared to traditional ESMs. Building on the work of hybrid (physics + AI) ESMs, we here discuss the additional potential of further improving and accelerating climate models with quantum computing. We discuss how quantum computers could accelerate climate models by solving the underlying differential equations faster, how quantum machine learning could better represent subgrid-scale phenomena in ESMs even with currently available noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, how quantum algorithms aimed at solving optimization problems could assist in tuning the many parameters in ESMs, a currently time-consuming and challenging process, and how quantum computers could aid in the analysis of climate models. We also discuss hurdles and obstacles facing current quantum computing paradigms. Strong interdisciplinary collaboration between climate scientists and quantum computing experts could help overcome these hurdles and harness the potential of quantum computing for this urgent topic.</description>

      <title>Roadmap to fault tolerant quantum computation using topological qubit arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12252v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a concrete device roadmap towards a fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture based on noise-resilient, topologically protected Majorana-based qubits. Our roadmap encompasses four generations of devices: a single-qubit device that enables a measurement-based qubit benchmarking protocol; a two-qubit device that uses measurement-based braiding to perform single-qubit Clifford operations; an eight-qubit device that can be used to show an improvement of a two-qubit operation when performed on logical qubits rather than directly on physical qubits; and a topological qubit array supporting lattice surgery demonstrations on two logical qubits. Devices that enable this path require a superconductor-semiconductor heterostructure that supports a topological phase, quantum dots and coupling between those quantum dots that can create the appropriate loops for interferometric measurements, and a microwave readout system that can perform fast, low-error single-shot measurements. We describe the key design components of these qubit devices, along with the associated protocols for demonstrations of single-qubit benchmarking, Clifford gate execution, quantum error detection, and quantum error correction, which differ greatly from those in more conventional qubits. Finally, we comment on implications and advantages of this architecture for utility-scale quantum computation.</description>

      <title>iPEPS failure to represent corner-dependent entanglement in conformal systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor networks, particularly the infinite projected entangled pair state (iPEPS) ansatz, have been shown to represent a vast range of quantum states. While entanglement constraints limit the representation of critical states in one-dimensional iPEPS (commonly referred to as infinite matrix product states (iMPS)), it was previously unclear whether similar limitations exist for two-dimensional iPEPS-represented states. In this work, we investigate a subleading entanglement contribution stemming from a sharp corner in the bipartition and analyze its manifestation in iPEPS. For gapped systems, the corner-dependent term is predicted by the continuum theory to have a particular opening-angle dependence and not to scale with the system size. This is shown to emerge from the iPEPS structure upon averaging over the corner's orientation with respect to the iPEPS lattice orientation. However, for conformal (critical) systems, the predicted corner term scales logarithmically with the system size. This behavior is shown to be impossible in iPEPS, again by arguments relying on the iPEPS structure. We also verify numerically their validity for a particular critical system, the Rokhsar-Kivelson state. We discuss two possible interpretations: First, iPEPS may inherently fail to capture this subleading entanglement feature, potentially indicating additional limitations in their ability to represent other properties of critical systems. Alternatively, the corner-dependent term might vanish for lattice systems, arising only in continuous conformal systems. We discuss the possible implications of this result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building more powerful quantum computers requires manufacturing processes with tight tolerances. To improve the tolerances on Josephson junctions, techniques to fine tune their properties after fabrication have been developed. Understanding how tuning techniques may physically modify the tunnel barrier of a Josephson junction is important and will enable these techniques to be optimised. We develop a model of junction tuning based on depinning theory to interpret a phase diagram of tuning rate. We extract the dependence on temperature, time-varying voltages and oscillation frequency. Using depinning theory we are able to show both why time-varying annealing potentials result in controlled junction tuning and how such protocols can be optimised. We examine how tuning changes the electrical breakdown of barriers and discrepancies between modeled and measured higher energy levels of transmon qubits.</description>

Abstract: Quantifying the entanglement and coherence of quantum systems is a topic of significant theoretical and practical interest. In this paper, we propose a method to evaluate lower bounds for several widely used coherence measures and genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) measures. Our approach, which is resource-efficient and computationally feasible, provides bounds of coherence and GME measures with the help of witnesses by the F-norm. Finally, we present a practical framework for estimating these quantum resources in various physical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Scalability Challenges in Variational Quantum Optimization under Stochastic Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With rapid advances in quantum hardware, a central question is whether quantum devices with or without full error correction can outperform classical computers on practically relevant problems. Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have gained significant attention as promising candidates in this pursuit, particularly for combinatorial optimization problems. While reports of their challenges and limitations continue to accumulate, many studies remain optimistic based on small-scale, idealized testing setups, leaving doubt about the scalability of VQAs for large-scale problems. We systematically investigate this scaling behavior by analyzing how classical optimizers minimize variational quantum loss functions for random QUBO instances in the presence of uncertainty, modeled as effective Gaussian noise. We find that the critical noise threshold for successful optimization decreases rapidly as system size grows. This decline exceeds what can be explained solely by shrinking loss variance, confirming deeper, fundamental limitations in the loss landscapes of VQAs beyond barren plateaus. Translating these thresholds into required measurement shots reveals that achieving sufficient precision in the evaluated loss values quickly becomes impractical, even for moderately-sized problems. Our findings demonstrate serious scalability challenges for VQAs in optimization stemming from mere uncertainty, indicating potential barriers to achieving practical quantum advantage with current hybrid approaches.</description>

      <title>Maxwell's Demon Is Foiled by the Entropy Cost of Measurement, Not Erasure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I dispute the conventional claim that the second law of thermodynamics is saved from a "Maxwell's Demon" by the entropy cost of information erasure, and show that instead it is measurement that incurs the entropy cost. Thus Brillouin, who identified measurement as savior of the second law, was essentially correct, and putative refutations of his view, such as Bennett's claim to measure without entropy cost, are seen to fail when the applicable physics is taken into account. I argue that the tradition of attributing the defeat of Maxwell's Demon to erasure rather than to measurement arose from unphysical classical idealizations that do not hold for real gas molecules, as well as a physically ungrounded recasting of physical thermodynamical processes into computational and information-theoretic conceptualizations. I argue that the fundamental principle that saves the second law is the quantum uncertainty principle applying to the need to localize physical states to precise values of observables in order to effect the desired disequilibria aimed at violating the second law. I obtain the specific entropy cost for localizing a molecule in the Szilard engine and show that it coincides with the quantity attributed to Landauer's principle. I also note that an experiment characterized as upholding an entropy cost of erasure in a "quantum Maxwell's Demon" actually demonstrates an entropy cost of measurement.</description>

      <title>Almost device-independent calibration beyond Born's rule: Bell tests for cross-talk detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum information, device-independent protocols offer a new approach to information processing tasks, making minimal assumptions about the devices used. Typically, since these protocols draw conclusions directly from the data collected in a meaningful Bell test, the no-signaling conditions, and often even Born's rule for local measurements, are taken as premises of the protocol. Here, we demonstrate how to test such premises in an (almost) device-independent setting, i.e., directly from the raw data and with minimal assumptions. In particular, for IBM's quantum computing cloud services, we implement the prediction-based ratio protocol to characterize how well the qubits can be accessed locally and independently. More precisely, by performing a variety of Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt-type experiments on these systems and carrying out rigorous hypothesis tests on the collected data, we provide compelling evidence showing that some of these qubits suffer from cross-talks, i.e., their measurement statistics are affected by the choice of measurement bases on another qubit. Unlike standard randomized benchmarking, our approach does not rely on assumptions such as gate-independent Markovian noise. Moreover, despite the relatively small number of experimental trials, the direction of "signaling" may also be identified in some cases. Our approach thus serves as a complementary tool for benchmarking the local addressability of quantum computing devices.</description>

      <title>Dispersive regime of multiphoton qubit-oscillator interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dispersive regime of $n$-photon qubit-oscillator interactions is analyzed using Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory. Effective Hamiltonians are derived up to the second order in the perturbation parameters. These effective descriptions reveal higher-order qubit-oscillator cross-Kerr and oscillator self-Kerr terms. The cross-Kerr term combines a qubit Pauli operator with an $n$-degree polynomial in the oscillator photon number operator, while the self-Kerr term is an $(n-1)$-degree polynomial in the oscillator photon number operator. In addition to the higher-order Kerr terms, a qubit-conditional $2n$-photon squeezing term appears in the effective non-rotating-wave-approximation Hamiltonian. Furthermore, perturbation theory is applied to the case of multiple qubits coupled to a shared oscillator. A photon-number-dependent qubit-qubit interaction emerges in this case, which can be leveraged to tune the effective multiqubit system parameters using the oscillator state. Results for the converse setup of multiple oscillators and a single qubit are also derived. In this case, a qubit-conditional oscillator-oscillator nonlinear interaction is found. The spectral instabilities plaguing multiphoton qubit-oscillator models are carefully treated by introducing stabilizing higher-order terms in the Hamiltonian. The stabilizing terms preserve low-photon subspaces, avoid negative infinite energies and facilitate reliable numerical calculations used to validate analytical predictions. The effective descriptions developed here offer a simple and intuitive physical picture of dispersive multiphoton qubit-oscillator interactions that can aid in the design of implementations harnessing their desired nonlinear effects.</description>

      <title>Structured search algorithm: A quantum leap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03426v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a structured quantum search algorithm that leverages entanglement maps and a fixed-point method to minimize oracle query complexity in unsorted datasets. By partitioning qubits into rows based on their entanglement order, the algorithm enables parallel subspace searches, achieving solution identification with at most two oracle calls per row. Experimental results on IBM Kyiv hardware demonstrate successful searches in datasets with up to 5 TB of unsorted data. Our findings indicate that with optimal encoding, the quantum search complexity becomes $\mathcal{O}(1)$, that is, independent of the dataset size $N$, surpassing both classical $\mathcal{O}(N)$ and Grover's $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ scaling. Furthermore, the letter hypothesizes a scalable simulation of the said algorithm using classical means.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field orientation dependence of continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance with nitrogen-vacancy ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (CW-ODMR) measurements with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) spins in diamond are used for sensing DC magnetic fields from nearby magnetic targets. However, this technique suffers from ambiguities in the extraction of the magnetic field components when resonances due to different NV orientation classes overlap with each other. Here, we perform detailed experimental and theoretical studies of such effects on NV ensembles experiencing low bias magnetic fields. In particular, through symmetry considerations, we systematically examine the ODMR response of different NV orientation classes as a function of the orientation of the magnetic field vector. Our studies are of importance for performing a careful and detailed analysis of the ODMR spectra in order to infer the vector magnetic field information. Our results find application in the studies of magnetic samples that require a low applied bias field and also can be potentially adapted to defect spins in other solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a 3D Integrated Superconducting Quantum Chip Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a combined analytical and simulation-based study of a 3D-integrated quantum chip architecture. We model a flip-chip-inspired structure by stacking two superconducting qubits fabricated on separate high-resistivity silicon substrates through a dielectric interlayer. Utilizing \emph{rigorous} Ansys High-Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) simulations and analytical models from microwave engineering and quantum theory, we evaluate key quantum metrics such as eigenfrequencies, Q-factors, decoherence times, anharmonicity, cross-Kerr, participation ratios, and qubit coupling energy to describe the performance of the quantum device as a function of integration parameters. The integration parameters include the thickness and the quality of the dielectric interlayer. For detuned qubits, these metrics remain mostly invariant with respect to the substrate separation. However, introducing dielectric interlayer loss decreases the qubit quality factor, which consequentially degrades the relaxation time of the qubit. It is found that for the structure studied in this work, the stacked chip distance can be as small as $0.5 \text{mm}$. These findings support the viability of 3D quantum integration as a scalable alternative to planar architectures, while identifying key limitations in qubit coherence preservation due to lossy interlayer materials.</description>

      <title>Quasiprobabilistic imaginary-time evolution on quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imaginary-time evolution plays an important role in algorithms for computing ground-state and thermal equilibrium properties of quantum systems, but can be challenging to simulate on classical computers. Many quantum algorithms for imaginary-time evolution have resource requirements that are prohibitive for current quantum devices and face performance issues due to noise. Here, we propose a new algorithm for computing imaginary-time evolved expectation values on quantum computers, inspired by probabilistic error cancellation, an error-mitigation technique. Our algorithm works by decomposing a Trotterization of imaginary-time evolution into a probabilistic linear combination of operations, each of which is then implemented on a quantum computer. The measurement data is then classically post-processed to obtain the expectation value of the imaginary-time evolved state. Our algorithm requires no ancillary qubits and can be made noise-resilient without additional error mitigation. It is well-suited for estimating thermal expectation values by making use of the notion of a thermal pure quantum state. We demonstrate our algorithm by performing numerical simulations of thermal pure quantum state preparation for the 1D Heisenberg Hamiltonian on 8 qubits, and by using an IBM quantum computer to estimate the energy of the same Hamiltonian on 2 qubits. We observe promising results compared to the exact values, illustrating the potential of our algorithm for probing the physics of quantum many-body systems on current hardware.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of robust entanglement generation in engineered XX spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a numerical investigation comparing two entanglement generation protocols in finite XX spin chains with varying spin magnitudes ($s = 1/2, 1, 3/2 $). Protocol 1 (P1) relies on staggered couplings to steer correlations toward the ends of the chain. At the same time, Protocol 2 (P2) adopts a dual-port architecture that uses optimized boundary fields to mediate virtual excitations between terminal spins. Our results show that P2 consistently outperforms P1 in all spin values, generating higher-fidelity entanglement in shorter timescales when evaluated under the same system parameters. Furthermore, P2 exhibits superior robustness under realistic imperfections, including diagonal and off-diagonal disorder, as well as dephasing noise. These advantages stem from its ability to suppress the bulk population and minimize susceptibility to decoherence. Together, the scalability, efficiency, and noise resilience of the dual-port approach position it as a promising framework for entanglement distribution in solid-state quantum information platforms.</description>

      <title>Dissipative quantum North-East-Center model: steady-state phase diagram, universality and nonergodic dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study the dissipative quantum North-East-Center (NEC) model: a two-dimensional spin-1/2 lattice subject to chiral, kinetically constrained dissipation and coherent quantum interactions. This model combines kinetic constraints and chirality at the dissipative level, implementing local incoherent spin flips conditioned by an asymmetric majority-vote rule. Through a cluster mean-field approach, we determine the steady-state phase diagram of the NEC model under different Hamiltonians, consistently revealing the emergence of two distinct phases, bistable and normal, across all cases considered. We further investigate the stability of the steady-state with respect to inhomogeneous fluctuations in both phases, showing the emergence of instabilities at finite wavevectors in the proximity of the phase transition. Next, we study the nonergodicity of the model in the bistable phase. We characterize the dynamics of minority islands of spins surrounded by a large background of spins pointing in the opposite direction. We show that in the bistable phase, the minority islands are always reabsorbed by the surrounding at a constant velocity, irrespectively of their size. Finally, we propose and numerically benchmark an equation of motion for the reabsorption velocity of the islands where thermal and quantum fluctuations act independently at linear order.</description>

      <title>Practical continuous-variable quantum key distribution with squeezed light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) has gathered significant interest for its potential to achieve high secret key rates and seamless integration with existing optical communication infrastructure. State-of-the-art CV-QKD systems primarily use coherent states for simplicity. However, squeezed states of light have been theoretically shown to offer significant advantages, including higher secret key rates, greater resilience to excess noise, and reduced requirements on information reconciliation efficiency. In this work, we experimentally verify these theoretical predictions and propose and demonstrate a practical squeezed-state CV-QKD system based on modern local-local oscillator and digital-signal-processing techniques. Operating over fibre channels and considering finite-size security against collective attacks we show the advantages of our system over its coherent state counterpart. Our work paves the way for squeezed states to become practical resources for quantum key distribution and other quantum information protocols.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Inner Product Estimation with Low-Depth Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed inner product estimation (DIPE) is a fundamental task in quantum information, aiming to estimate the inner product between two unknown quantum states prepared on distributed quantum platforms. Existing rigorous sample complexity analyses are limited to unitary $4$-designs, which present practical challenges for near-term quantum devices. This work addresses this challenge by exploring DIPE with low-depth quantum circuits. We first establish that DIPE with an arbitrary unitary $2$-design ensemble achieves an average sample complexity of $\Theta(\sqrt{2^n})$, where $n$ is the number of qubits. We then analyze ensembles below unitary $2$-designs -- specifically, the brickwork and local unitary $2$-design ensembles -- showing average sample complexities of $O(\sqrt{2.18^n})$ and $O(\sqrt{2.5^n})$, respectively. Furthermore, we analyze the state-dependent variance for the brickwork and Clifford ensembles. Remarkably, we find that DIPE with the global Clifford ensemble requires $\Theta(\sqrt{2^n})$ copies for arbitrary state pairs, with its efficiency further enhanced by the nonstabilizerness of the state pairs. Numerical simulations with GHZ states and Haar random states up to $26$ qubits show that low-depth circuit ensembles can match the performance of unitary $4$-designs in practice. Our findings offer theoretically guaranteed methods for implementing DIPE with experimentally feasible unitary ensembles.</description>

      <title>Making Non-Markovian master equations accessible with approximate environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of open quantum systems remains a significant challenge, particularly for Non-Markovian dynamics. We demonstrate the profound utility of expressing the environmental correlation function as a sum of damped sinusoidals within master equations. While not strictly required, this decomposition offers substantial benefits, crucially reducing the cost of Lamb-shift and decay rates calculations without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, this approach enables straightforward calculation of Lamb-shift corrections, bypassing the need for complex principal value integration. We show that these Lamb-shift effects are demonstrably non-negligible in heat transport scenarios, and are needed for an accurate description. Unlike in the Gorini-Kossakowski-Lindblad-Sudarshan(GKLS) master equation, the non-commuting nature of the Lamb-shift with the Hamiltonian in non-Markovian descriptions, coupled with GKLS's inaccuracies at early times, brings the necessity of Non-Markovian descriptions for finite-time thermodynamics. In the weak coupling regime, our Master Equation formulations with exponential decomposition achieve accuracy comparable to numerically exact methods. This methodology significantly simplifies and accelerates the simulation of non-Markovian dynamics in open quantum systems, offering a more reliable and computationally tractable alternative akin to a Global Master Equation.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Open Quantum Dynamics with Time-Dependent Variational Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a method to simulate open quantum many-body dynamics by combining time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) with quantum trajectory techniques. Our approach unravels the Lindblad master equation into an ensemble of stochastic Schr\"{o}dinger equations for a variational ansatz, avoiding the exponential cost of density matrix evolution. The method is compatible with generic ans\"{a}tze, including expressive neural-network wavefunctions. We derive the nonlinear stochastic equations of motion for the variational parameters and employ suitable Stratonovich numerical solvers. To validate our approach, we simulate quenches in the locally dissipative long-range Ising model in a transverse field, accurately capturing non-equilibrium magnetization and spin squeezing dynamics relevant to trapped-ion and Rydberg atom experiments. The framework is computationally efficient, scalable on high-performance computing platforms, and can be readily integrated into existing tVMC implementations. This work enables large-scale simulations of complex, dissipative quantum systems in higher dimensions, with broad implications for quantum technology and fundamental science.</description>

      <title>Scaling Quantum Algorithms via Dissipation: Avoiding Barren Plateaus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have enabled a wide range of applications on near-term quantum devices. However, their scalability is fundamentally limited by barren plateaus, where the probability of encountering large gradients vanishes exponentially with system size. In addition, noise induces barren plateaus, deterministically flattening the cost landscape. Dissipative quantum algorithms that leverage nonunitary dynamics to prepare quantum states via engineered cooling offer a complementary framework with remarkable robustness to noise. We demonstrate that dissipative quantum algorithms based on non-unital channels can avoid both unitary and noise-induced barren plateaus. Periodically resetting ancillary qubits actively extracts entropy from the system, maintaining gradient magnitudes and enabling scalable optimization. We provide analytic conditions ensuring they remain trainable even in the presence of noise. Numerical simulations confirm our predictions and illustrate scenarios where unitary algorithms fail but dissipative algorithms succeed. Our framework positions dissipative quantum algorithms as a scalable, noise-resilient alternative to traditional VQAs.</description>

      <title>Estimating Quantum Execution Requirements for Feature Selection in Recommender Systems Using Extreme Value Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computing have significantly accelerated research into quantum-assisted information retrieval and recommender systems, particularly in solving feature selection problems by formulating them as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems executable on quantum hardware. However, while existing work primarily focuses on effectiveness and efficiency, it often overlooks the probabilistic and noisy nature of real-world quantum hardware. In this paper, we propose a solution based on Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to quantitatively assess the usability of quantum solutions. Specifically, given a fixed problem size, the proposed method estimates the number of executions (shots) required on a quantum computer to reliably obtain a high-quality solution, which is comparable to or better than that of classical baselines on conventional computers. Experiments conducted across multiple quantum platforms (including two simulators and two physical quantum processors) demonstrate that our method effectively estimates the number of required runs to obtain satisfactory solutions on two widely used benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Additivity of quantum relative entropies as a single-copy criterion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fundamental goal of information theory is to characterize complex operational tasks using efficiently computable information quantities, Shannon's capacity formula being the prime example of this. However, many tasks in quantum information can only be characterized by regularized entropic measures that are often not known to be computable and for which efficient approximations are scarce. It is thus of fundamental importance to understand when regularization is not needed, opening the door to an efficiently computable characterization based on additive quantities. Here, we demonstrate that for a large class of problems, the question of whether regularization is needed or not can be determined at the single-copy level. Specifically, we demonstrate that regularization of the Umegaki relative entropy, along with related quantities such as the Petz and sandwiched relative entropies, is not needed if and only if a single-copy optimizer satisfies a certain property. These problems include hypothesis testing with arbitrarily varying hypotheses as well as quantum resource theories used to derive fundamental bounds for entanglement and magic state distillation. We derive the Stein, Chernoff, and Hoeffding exponents for these problems and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for their additivity, while also presenting partial results for the strong converse exponent.</description>

      <title>Unitary designs in nearly optimal depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct $\varepsilon$-approximate unitary $k$-designs on $n$ qubits in circuit depth $O(\log k \log \log n k / \varepsilon)$. The depth is exponentially improved over all known results in all three parameters $n$, $k$, $\varepsilon$. We further show that each dependence is optimal up to exponentially smaller factors. Our construction uses $\tilde{{O}}(nk)$ ancilla qubits and ${O}(nk)$ bits of randomness, which are also optimal up to $\log(n k)$ factors. An alternative construction achieves a smaller ancilla count $\tilde{{O}}(n)$ with circuit depth ${O}(k \log \log nk/\varepsilon)$. To achieve these efficient unitary designs, we introduce a highly-structured random unitary ensemble that leverages long-range two-qubit gates and low-depth implementations of random classical hash functions. We also develop a new analytical framework for bounding errors in quantum experiments involving many queries to random unitaries. As an illustration of this framework's versatility, we provide a succinct alternative proof of the existence of pseudorandom unitaries.</description>

      <title>Relativistic electrodynamics with a universal length scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the analogues of the Dirac and Pauli equations from a spatially fourth-order Klein--Gordon equation with a universal length scale. Starting from a singularly perturbed variant of Maxwell's equations, we deduce a 32-dimensional variant of the Dirac equation for spin-$1/2$ particles through an algebraic factorization procedure. We illustrate an experimental test of the theory from the split lines of the electron beam in a Stern--Gerlach experiment. This hyperfine splitting leads to four distinct eigenvalues of the spin operator, which can be grouped into two pairs centered around the classic values of $\pm\hbar/2$. The modified electrodynamic framework features particle-antiparticle asymmetry and an oriented, micropolar spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show, in the framework of a space-time resolved relativistic quantum field theory approach to tunneling, that microcausality precludes superluminal tunneling dynamics. More specifically in this work dealing with Dirac and Klein-Gordon fields, we first prove that microcausality holds for such fields in the presence of a background potential. We then use this result to show that an intervention performed on a localized region of an initial wave packet subsequently scattering on a potential barrier does not result in any effect outside the light cone emanating from that region. We illustrate these results with numerical computations for Dirac fermions and Klein-Gordon bosons.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of quantum Fisher and Wigner-Yanase skew information following a noisy quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the influence of noise on the dynamics of a transverse field Ising model when quenched across a quantum critical point. To quantify two-spin correlations properties, we employ the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and Wigner-Yanase skew information (WYSI) as measures of quantum coherence. In the absence of noise, despite the entanglement, both QFI and WYSI increase monotonically with the ramp quench time, approaching their adiabatic limits without exhibiting any Kibble-Zurek type scaling with quench duration. When noise is added to the quench protocol, the coherence dynamics change dramatically: QFI and WYSI both decay exponentially with time scale of a ramp quench, with the exponent depending on the noise intensity. Furthermore, the maximum ramp time, at which either of these measures reach their maximum, scales linearly with the noise variance, featuring the same exponent that determines the optimal annealing time for minimizing defect production in noisy quantum annealing.</description>

      <title>The Ontic Necessity of the Quantum Wavefunction: Why Epistemic Views Struggle with the Uncertainty Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ontological status of the quantum wavefunction remains one of the most debated questions in quantum theory. While epistemic interpretations regard the wavefunction as a reflection of our knowledge or beliefs, ontic interpretations treat it as a real physical object. In this paper, we argue that epistemic approaches struggle to explain the universality and precision of the uncertainty principle, a core feature of quantum mechanics. By contrast, treating the wave-function as ontic allows a consistent and natural derivation of quantum uncertainty from the mathematical structure of Hilbert space. We examine key interpretations on both sides and highlight why the epistemic view falls short in addressing constraints that appear to be intrinsic to nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method to sympathetically cool polar molecules with Rydberg atoms without destroying the quantum information encoded in the polar molecules. While the interactions between the two are usually state-dependent, we show how to engineer state-insensitive interactions between the hot molecules and the cold atoms with a suitable choice of internal states and the application of external fields. The resulting interactions, which may be van der Waals or dipolar, induce a phonon swap interaction between the two species, thereby coherently cooling the polar molecules without affecting the internal state, a process which can be repeated if the atoms are cooled again or new cold atoms are brought in. Our cooling schemes open the possibility of extending quantum computation and simulation times in emerging hybrid tweezer arrays of polar molecules and neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>Manarat: A Scalable QICK-Based Control System for Superconducting Quantum Processors Supporting Synchronized Control of 10 Flux-Tunable Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A scalable control architecture for superconducting quantum processors is essential as the number of qubits increases and coherent multi-qubit operations span beyond the capacity of a single control module. The Quantum Instrumentation Control Kit (QICK), built on AMD RFSoC platforms, offers a flexible open-source framework for pulse-level qubit control but lacks native support for multi-board synchronization, limiting its applicability to mid- and large-scale quantum devices. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Manarat, a scalable multi-board control platform based on QICK that incorporates hardware, firmware, and software enhancements to enable sub-100 ps timing alignment across multiple AMD ZCU216 RFSoC boards. Our system integrates a low-jitter clock distribution network, modifications to the tProcessor, and a synchronization scheme to ensure deterministic alignment of program execution across boards. It also includes a custom analog front-end for flux control that combines high-speed RF signals with software-programmable DC biasing voltages generated by a low-noise, high-precision DAC. These capabilities are complemented by a software stack capable of orchestrating synchronized multi-board experiments and fully integrated with the open-source Qibo framework for quantum device calibration and algorithm execution. We validate Manarat on a 10-qubit superconducting processor controlled by two RFSoC boards, demonstrating reliable execution of synchronized control sequences for cross-board CZ gate calibration. These results confirm that sub-nanosecond synchronization and coherent control is achievable across multiple RFSoC boards, enabling scalable operation of superconducting quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Clique Local Decoder to Correct Length-2 Space Errors in the Surface Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing demand for fault-tolerant quantum computing drives the need for efficient, scalable Quantum Error Correction (QEC) strategies. Conventional decoders designed for worst-case error scenarios incur significant overhead, prompting the development of local decoders, that leverage the sparse and often trivial nature of many quantum errors, to support the conventional decoders. The previously proposed Clique decoder addresses this by handling isolated, length-1 space and time errors within the cryogenic environment with minimal hardware costs, thereby mitigating I/O bandwidth constraints between cryogenic quantum systems and room-temperature processors. Building on this foundation, we propose Clique_L2 that extends the Clique-based approach by relaxing some original constraints and incorporating additional low-cost logic to also correct length-2 error chains in space, which become non-trivial occurrences at higher physical error rates and code distances. This enhanced capability not only further reduces out-of-the-fridge data transmission but also adapts more effectively to clustered errors observed under a variety of noise models. Specifically, under data-qubit-only errors and uniformly random noise, Clique_L2 achieves up to 8.95x decoding bandwidth reduction over the original Clique (or Clique_L1) decoder, especially beneficial at higher code distances. When clustered errors and longer error chains are more likely to occur, Clique_L2 achieves up to 18.3x decoding bandwidth reduction over Clique_L1, achieving substantial benefits across a wide range of physical qubit error rates.</description>

      <title>Broadband and long-duration optical memory in Yb:YSO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical quantum memories are essential components for realizing the full potential of quantum networks. Among these, rare-earth-doped crystal memories stand out due to their large multimode storage capabilities. To maximize the multimode capacity in the time domain, it is key to simultaneously achieve large memory bandwidth and long optical storage time. Here, we demonstrate an atomic frequency comb optical memory in Yb:YSO, with a memory bandwidth of 250 MHz and a storage time of up to 125 $\mu$s. The efficiency reaches 20 % at short storage times, and 5 % at 125 $\mu$s. These results were enabled by an optimized optical pumping scheme, guided by numerical modelling. Our approach is specifically designed for future spin-wave storage experiments, with the theoretical bandwidth limit set at 288 MHz by the hyperfine structure of Yb:YSO. Additionally, we introduce an efficient method for synthesizing the optical pumping waveforms required for generating combs with tens of thousands of teeth, as well as a simple yet frequency-agile laser setup for optical pumping across a 10 GHz bandwidth.</description>

Abstract: Arunachalam and de Wolf (2018) showed that the sample complexity of quantum batch learning of boolean functions, in the realizable and agnostic settings, has the same form and order as the corresponding classical sample complexities. In this paper, we extend this, ostensibly surprising, message to batch multiclass learning, online boolean learning, and online multiclass learning. For our online learning results, we first consider an adaptive adversary variant of the classical model of Dawid and Tewari (2022). Then, we introduce the first (to the best of our knowledge) model of online learning with quantum examples.</description>

      <title>New Partial Trace Inequalities and Distillability of Werner States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05726v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the oldest problems in quantum information theory is to study if there exists a state with negative partial transpose which is undistillable. This problem has been open for almost 30 years, and still no one has been able to give a complete answer to it. This work presents a new strategy to try to solve this problem by translating the distillability condition on the family of Werner states into a problem of partial trace inequalities, this is the aim of our first main result. As a consequence we obtain a new bound for the $2$-distillability of Werner states, which does not depend on the dimension of the system. On the other hand, our second main result provides new partial trace inequalities for bipartite systems, connecting some of them also with the separability of Werner states. Throughout this work we also present numerous partial trace inequalities, which are valid for many families of matrices.</description>

      <title>Rigorous lower bound on dynamical exponents in gapless frustration-free systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work rigorously establishes a universal lower bound $z\ge2$ for the dynamical exponent in frustration-free quantum many-body systems whose ground states exhibit power-law decaying correlations. The derivation relies on the Gosset-Huang inequality, providing a unified framework applicable across various lattice structures and spatial dimensions, independent of specific boundary conditions. Remarkably, our result can be applied to prove new bounds for dynamics of classical stochastic processes. Specifically, we utilize a well-established mapping from the time evolution of local Markov processes with detailed balance to that of frustration-free quantum Hamiltonians, known as Rokhsar-Kivelson Hamiltonians. This proves $z \ge 2$ for such Markov processes, which is an improvement over existing bounds. Beyond these applications, the quantum analysis of the $z\ge2$ bound is further broadened to include systems exhibiting hidden correlations, which may not be evident from purely local operators.</description>

      <title>Quantum determinism and completeness restored by indistinguishability and long-time particle detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that measurement data in quantum physics can be rigorously interpreted only as a result of a statistical, macroscopic process, taking into account the indistinguishable character of identical particles. Quantum determinism is in principle possible on the condition that a fully-fledged quantum-field-theoretic model is used to describe the measurement device in interaction with the studied object as one system. In contrast, any approach that relies on Born's rule discriminates the dynamics of a quantum system from that of the detector with which it interacts during measurement. In this work, we critically analyze the validity of this measurement postulate applied to single-event signals. In fact, the concept of ``individual'' particle becomes inadequate once both indistinguishability and a scattering approach allowing an unlimited interaction time for an effective detection, are considered as they should be, hence preventing the separability of two successive measurement events. In this context, measurement data should therefore be understood only as a result of statistics over many events. Accounting for the intrinsic noise of the sources and the detectors, we also show with the illustrative cases of the Schr\"odinger cat and the Bell experiment that once the Born rule is abandoned on the level of a single particle, realism, locality and causality are restored. We conclude that indiscernibility and long-time detection process make quantum physics not fundamentally probabilistic.</description>

Abstract: In the past couple of decades, there have been significant advances in measuring quantum properties of light, such as quadratures of squeezed light and single-photon counting. Here, we explore whether such tools can be leveraged to probe electronic correlations in the many-body quantum regime. Specifically, we show that it is possible to probe certain spin, charge, and topological orders in an electronic system by measuring the correlation functions of scattered photons. We construct a mapping from the correlators of the scattered photons to those of a correlated insulator, particularly for Mott insulators described by a single-band Fermi-Hubbard model at half-filling. We show that frequency filtering before photodetection plays a crucial role in determining this mapping. We find that if the ground state of the insulator is a gapped spin liquid, a photon-pair correlation function, i.e., $G^{(2)}$, can detect the presence of anyonic excitations with fractional mutual statistics. Moreover, we show that correlations between electromagnetic quadratures can be used to detect expectation values of static spin chirality operators on both the kagome and triangular lattices, thus being useful in detecting chiral spin liquids. More generally, we show that a series of hitherto unmeasured spin-spin and spin-charge correlation functions of the material can be extracted from photonic correlations. This work opens up access to probe correlated materials, beyond the linear response paradigm, by detecting quantum properties of scattered light.</description>

      <title>Rotation quenches in trapped bosonic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ground state properties of strongly rotating bosons confined in an asymmetric anharmonic potential exhibit a split density distribution. However, the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of this split structure remain largely unexplored. Given that rotation is responsible for the breakup of the bosonic cloud, we investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics by abruptly changing the rotation frequency. Our study offers insights into the dynamics of trapped Bose-Einstein condensates in both symmetric and asymmetric anharmonic potentials under different rotation quench scenarios. In the rotationally symmetric trap, angular momentum is a good quantum number. This makes it challenging to exchange angular momentum within the system; hence, a rotation quench does practically not impact the density distribution. In contrast, the absence of angular momentum conservation in asymmetric traps results in more complex dynamics. This allows rotation quenches to either inject into or extract angular momentum from the system. We observe and analyze these intricate dynamics both for the mean-field condensed and the many-body fragmented systems. The dynamical evolution of the condensed system and the fragmented system exhibits similarities in several observables during small rotation quenches. However, these similarities diverge notably for larger quenches. Additionally, we investigate the formation and the impact of the vortices on the angular momentum dynamics of the evolving split density. All in all, our findings offer valuable insights into the dynamics of trapped interacting bosons under different rotation quenches.</description>

      <title>Two-photon coupling via Josephson element I: Breaking the symmetry with magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05016v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a coupling element based on a symmetric superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) and show that it mediates a two-photon interaction. This and other inductive interactions due to the SQUID can be switched off in situ. We derive the system Hamiltonian for coupled resonator and rf SQUID. The rf SQUID dwells in the vicinity of its metastable well holding a number of energy states and acts as an artificial atom. We discuss how the Josephson symmetry breaks owing to magnetic fields in the superconducting loops. We assess that the two-photon coupling strength reaches 18 MHz which can exceed the single-photon capacitive interaction in the coupler.</description>

      <title>Continuous and Reversible Electrical Tuning of Fluorescent Decay Rate via Fano Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the decay rates of a fluorescent molecule can be controlled by electrically shifting a transparency introduced by a Fano resonance. An auxiliary quantum object (QO), located at the hotspot of a plasmonic nanoparticle, suppresses plasmonic excitation at its level spacing {\omega}_QO. As a result, the local density of states (LDOS) associated with the plasmonic spectrum is also suppressed at {\omega}={\omega}_QO. By shifting {\omega}_QO via an applied voltage, we continuously tune the radiative and nonradiative decay rates of the fluorescent molecule by up to two orders of magnitude. This mechanism offers a valuable tool for integrated quantum technologies, enabling on-demand entanglement and single-photon sources, voltage-controlled quantum gate operations, and electrical control of superradiant-like phase transitions. The approach also holds promise for applications in super-resolution microscopy and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).</description>

      <title>Semi-group influence matrices for non-equilibrium quantum impurity models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for describing the real-time dynamics of quantum impurity models out of equilibrium which is based on the influence matrix approach. By replacing the dynamical map of a large fermionic quantum environment with an effective semi-group influence matrix (SGIM) which acts on a reduced auxiliary space, we overcome the limitations of previous proposals, achieving high accuracy at long evolution times. This SGIM corresponds to a uniform matrix-product state representation of the influence matrix and can be obtained by an efficient algorithm presented in this paper. We benchmark this approach by computing the spectral function of the single impurity Anderson model with high resolution. Further, the spectrum of the effective dynamical map allows us to obtain relaxation rates of the impurity towards equilibrium following a quantum quench. Finally, for a quantum impurity model with on-site two-fermion loss, we compute the spectral function and confirm the emergence of Kondo physics at large loss rates.</description>

      <title>Impact of Fixing Spins in a Quantum Annealer with Energy Rescaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01008v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum annealing is a promising algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. However, various hardware restrictions significantly impede its efficient performance. Size-reduction methods provide an effective approach for addressing large-scale problems but often introduce additional challenges. A notable hardware restriction is the limited number of decision variables quantum annealing can handle compared to the size of the problem. Moreover, when employing size-reduction methods, the interactions and local magnetic fields in the Ising model--used to represent the combinatorial optimization problem--can become excessively large, making them difficult to implement on hardware. Although prior studies suggest that energy rescaling impacts the performance of quantum annealing, its interplay with size-reduction methods remains unexplored. This study examines the relationship between fixing spins, a promising size-reduction method, and the effects of energy rescaling. Numerical simulations and experiments conducted on a quantum annealer demonstrate that the fixing spins method enhances quantum annealing performance while preserving the spin-chain embedding for a homogeneous, fully connected ferromagnetic Ising model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a spinor traveling along a helical path develops a spin-orbit coupling because of the curvature of the path. We then estimate the magnitude of this effective geometric spin-orbit interaction for structures that showcase chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). We find that this chirality-induced spin-orbit coupling ($\chi$-SOC), in conjunction with broken time-reversal symmetry, may be an important ingredient for the microscopic underpinning of the CISS phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the frequency-resolved density response of a photon Bose-Einstein condensate coupled to a bath of dye molecules by time-periodic driving. By monitoring the photon number dynamics for different drive frequencies, we obtain the spectral response of the condensate in a phase-sensitive way. We find that as the photon number increases, the response of the coupled condensate-bath system transitions from overdamped to resonant behavior, indicating a transition from closed to open system dynamics. Our spectroscopy method paves the way for studies of collective excitations in complex driven-dissipative systems.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Framework for the Prediction of Intersystem Crossing Rates in Spin Defects: The Role of Electron Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optically active spin defects in solids are promising platforms for quantum technologies. Here, we present a first-principles framework to investigate intersystem crossing processes, which represent crucial steps in the optical spin-polarization cycle used to address spin defects. Considering the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond as a case study, we demonstrate that our framework effectively captures electron correlation effects in the calculation of many-body electronic states and their spin-orbit coupling and electron-phonon interactions, while systematically addressing finite-size effects. We validate our predictions by carrying out measurements of fluorescence lifetimes, finding excellent agreement between theory and experiments. The framework presented here provides a versatile and robust tool for exploring the optical cycle of varied spin defects entirely from first principles.</description>

      <title>Gauging non-invertible symmetries on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a general prescription for gauging finite non-invertible symmetries in 1+1d lattice Hamiltonian systems. Our primary example is the Rep(D$_8$) fusion category generated by the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation, which is the simplest anomaly-free non-invertible symmetry on a spin chain of qubits. We explicitly compute its lattice F-symbols and illustrate our prescription for a particular (non-maximal) gauging of this symmetry. In our gauging procedure, we introduce two qubits around each link, playing the role of "gauge fields" for the non-invertible symmetry, and impose novel Gauss's laws. Similar to the Kramers-Wannier transformation for gauging an ordinary $\mathbb{Z}_2$, our gauging can be summarized by a gauging map, which is part of a larger, continuous non-invertible cosine symmetry.</description>

      <title>Tensor-network study of the roughening transition in a (2 + 1)D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the confined phase of (2+1)D lattice gauge theories a roughening transition arises between a weakly confined regime with floppy string excitations and a strongly confined regime with stiff string excitations. In this work, we use an infinite Density Matrix Renormalization Group (iDMRG) algorithm to quantitatively characterize the properties of confined strings. To this end, we stabilize the state with a string excitation by 't Hooft loop operators. While for zero gauge-matter coupling we can use bare 't Hooft loop operators to do so, for finite gauge-matter coupling we have to transform them to emergent ones, which we achieve with an adiabatic protocol. By analyzing the scaling of both a novel order parameter and the entanglement entropy, our approach allows us to accurately determine the roughening transition, even at finite gauge-matter coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute various averages over bulk geometries of quantum states prepared by the Chern-Simons path integral, for any level $k$ and compact simple gauge group $G$. We do so by carefully summing over all topologically distinct bulk geometries which have $n$ disjoint boundary tori and a decomposition into space$\times$time of fixed spatial topology. We find that to leading order in the complexity of the state, the typical state contains many types of multiparty entanglement, proving a conjecture of Balasubramanian et al. Additionally, we compute an averaged wave function which captures the leading order statistics of boundary observables in the $n$ torus Chern-Simons Hilbert space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the integrability and non-integrability of isotropic spin chains with nearest-neighbor interaction with general spin $S$ in terms of the presence or absence of local conserved quantities. We prove a dichotomy theorem that whether a single quantity is zero or not sharply separates two scenarios: (i) this system has $k$-local conserved quantities for all $k$ (completely integrable), or (ii) this system has no nontrivial local conserved quantity (non-integrable). This result excludes the possibility of an intermediate system with some but not all local conserved quantities, which solves in the affirmative the Grabowski-Mathieu conjecture. This theorem also serves as a complete classification of integrability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation.grability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Pekeris coordinates provide a permutationally invariant set of coordinates for H$_3^+$. They are defined as linear combinations of the three internuclear distances that automatically fulfil the triangle inequality for all non-negative coordinate values. In this work, we test three discrete variable representations (DVR) for tightly converging the rovibrational energies up to and beyond the barrier to linearity using the Pekeris coordinates. The best performing representation is a cot-DVR-type approach adapted to the Pekeris problem. The two- and three-proton near coalescence region, which is also part of the direct product Pekeris grid but dynamically not relevant, is avoided by coordinate mapping and regulator functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ideal spatial demultiplexing (SPADE) is proven to be a quantum-optimal tool for exoplanet detection, i.e., asymmetric source discrimination. However, recent investigations into the related problems of separation estimation and symmetric source discrimination showed its efficiency to be limited in the presence of noise. In this work, we use analytical tools to scrutinize the practical applicability of SPADE and derive the associated optimal decision strategy for exoplanet detection in the presence of experimental imperfections. On the one hand, we find that the probability of detection of noisy SPADE has the same scaling with planet-star separation and relative brightness as conventional techniques, such as direct imaging and coronagraphs. On the other hand, we prove that, due to a superior scaling coefficient under realistic noise conditions, SPADE remains the most efficient method for practical exoplanet detection in the sub-Rayleigh regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that under general resonance the classical piecewise linear Fermi-Ulam accelerator behaves substantially different from its quantization in the sense that the classical accelerator exhibits typical recurrence and non-escaping while the quantum version enjoys quadratic energy growth in general. We also describe a procedure to locate the escaping orbits, though exceptionally rare in the infinite-volume phase space, for the classical accelerators, which in particular include Ulam's very original proposal and the linearly escaping orbits therein in the existing literature, and hence provide a complete (modulo a null set) answer to Ulam's original question. For the quantum accelerators, we reveal under resonance the direct and explicit connection between the energy growth and the shape of the quasi-energy spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a quantum-logic spectroscopy (QLS) protocol to control the quantum state of a CaH+ ion in a cryogenic environment, in which reduced thermal radiation extends rotational state lifetimes by an order of magnitude over those at room temperature. By repeatedly and adaptively probing the molecule, detecting the outcome of each probe via an atomic ion, and using a Bayesian update scheme to quantify confidence in the molecular state, we demonstrate state preparation and measurement (SPAM) in a single quantum state with infidelity less than 6x10^-3 and measure Rabi flopping between two states with greater than 99% contrast. The protocol does not require any molecule-specific lasers and the detection scheme is non-destructive.</description>

Abstract: The emergence of the arrow of time in quantum many-body systems stems from the inherent tendency of Hamiltonian evolution to scramble quantum information and increase entanglement. While, in principle, one might counteract this temporal directionality by engineering a perfectly inverted Hamiltonian to reverse entanglement growth, such a scenario is fundamentally unstable because even minor imperfections in the backward evolution can be exponentially amplified, a hallmark of quantum many-body chaos. Therefore, successfully reversing quantum many-body dynamics demands a deep understanding of the underlying structure of quantum information scrambling and chaotic dynamics. Here, by using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance on a macroscopic ensemble of randomly interacting spins, we measure the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) and validate key predictions of scramblon theory, a universal theoretical framework for information scrambling. Crucially, this theory enables us to isolate and mitigate errors in the OTOC caused by imperfections in the backward evolution. As a result, this protocol uncovers the anticipated exponential behavior of quantum many-body chaos and extracts the quantum Lyapunov exponent in a many-body experimental system for the first time. Our results push the fundamental limits of dynamical reversibility of complex quantum systems, with implications for quantum simulation and metrology.</description>

      <title>Anyon-trions in atomically thin semiconductor heterostructures</title>

Abstract: The study of anyons in topologically ordered quantum systems has mainly relied on edge-state interferometry. However, realizing controlled braiding of anyons necessitates the ability to detect and manipulate individual anyons within the bulk. Here, we propose and theoretically investigate a first step toward this goal by demonstrating that a long-lived, optically generated interlayer exciton can bind to a quasihole in a fractional quantum Hall state, forming a composite excitation we term an anyon-trion. Using exact diagonalization, we show that mobile anyon-trions possess a binding energy of approximately 0.5 meV, whereas static anyon-trions exhibit a binding energy of about 0.9 meV, that is linearly proportional to the quasiholes fractional charge. An experimental realization based on photoluminescence from localized interlayer excitons in a quantum twisting microscope setup should allow for a direct optical observation of anyon-trions.</description>
