      <title>Demographic synchrony increases the vulnerability of human societies to collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Why do human populations remain vulnerable to collapse, even when they are large? Classical demographic theory predicts that volatility in growth should decline rapidly with size due to the averaging effects of the law of large numbers. As such, while small-scale societies may be demographically fragile, large-scale societies should be much more stable. Using a large census dataset of 228 indigenous societies from Brazil, we show that this prediction does not hold. Instead of volatility declining as the square root of population size, it falls much more slowly. This means that individuals within communities do not behave as independent demographic units as their lives are correlated through cooperation, shared subsistence practices, overlapping land use, and exposure to common shocks such as disease outbreaks or failed harvests. These correlations build demographic synchrony, drastically reducing the effective demographic degrees of freedom in a population, keeping volatility higher than expected at all scales. As a result, large-scale populations fluctuate as if they were much smaller, increasing their vulnerability to collapse. This helps explain why human societies of all sizes seem vulnerable to collapse, and why the archaeological and historical record is filled with examples of large, complex societies collapsing despite their size. We suggest demographic synchrony provides a general mechanism for understanding why human populations remain vulnerable across all scales: Scale still stabilizes synchronous populations via density increases, but synchrony ensures that stability grows only slowly with size, leaving large populations more volatile, and more vulnerable, than classical demographic theory predicts.</description>

      <title>Gradual assembly of metabolism at a phosphorylating hydrothermal vent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of microbial cells required the emergence of metabolism, an autocatalytic network of roughly 400 enzymatically catalyzed chemical reactions that synthesize the building blocks of life: amino acids, nucleotides and cofactors. Proposals for metabolic origin are theoretical in nature [1-9], empirical studies addressing the origin and early evolution of the 400-reaction chemical network itself are lacking. Here we identify intermediate states in the primordial assembly of metabolism from its inorganic origins, using structure-refined clusters for metabolic enzymes of prokaryotic genomes. We show that metabolism in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) was enzymatically incomplete, undergoing final assembly independently in the lineages leading to bacteria and archaea, with metal catalysts that predated both enzymes and cofactors providing essential functions. Over half of modern core metabolism corresponds to laboratory reactions catalyzed by native transition metals--Fe(0), Co(0), Ni(0) and their alloys--under conditions of serpentinizing hydrothermal vents. As the hitherto elusive source of primordial aqueous phosphorylation, we show that phosphite, a constituent of serpentinizing systems [10], phosphorylates AMP [11] to ADP using native metals in water. Seventeen cofactors that transfer electrons, nitrogen, and carbon units to substrates in modern metabolism [12] can be functionally replaced by environmental transition metals [13-19]. The data reveal that cofactors are synthesized late in enzymatic metabolism and are required in reactions preceding their synthesis, specifying the existence at origins of simpler precursors, which we identify here as native metals. Cofactors liberated metabolism from a requirement for solid state catalysis at a phosphorylating hydrothermal vent, engendering its autocatalytic state.</description>

      <title>Weak Form Learning for Mean-Field Partial Differential Equations: an Application to Insect Movement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Insect species subject to infection, predation, and anisotropic environmental conditions may exhibit preferential movement patterns. Given the innate stochasticity of exogenous factors driving these patterns over short timescales, individual insect trajectories typically obey overdamped stochastic dynamics. In practice, data-driven modeling approaches designed to learn the underlying Fokker-Planck equations from observed insect distributions serve as ideal tools for understanding and predicting such behavior. Understanding dispersal dynamics of crop and silvicultural pests can lead to a better forecasting of outbreak intensity and location, which can result in better pest management. In this work, we extend weak-form equation learning techniques, coupled with kernel density estimation, to learn effective models for lepidopteran larval population movement from highly sparse experimental data. Galerkin methods such as the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (WSINDy) algorithm have recently proven useful for learning governing equations in several scientific contexts. We demonstrate the utility of the method on a sparse dataset of position measurements of fall armyworms (Spodoptera frugiperda) obtained in simulated agricultural conditions with varied plant resources and infection status.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous branching trees with symmetric and asymmetric offspring and their genealogies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define symmetric and asymmetric branching trees, a class of processes particularly suited for modeling genealogies of inhomogeneous populations where individuals may reproduce throughout life. In this framework, a broad class of Crump-Mode-Jagers processes can be constructed as (a)symmetric Sevast'yanov processes, which count the branches of the tree. Analogous definitions yield reduced (a)symmetric Sevast'yanov processes, which restrict attention to branches that lead to extant progeny. We characterize their laws through generating functions. The genealogy obtained by pruning away branches without extant progeny at a fixed time is shown to satisfy a branching property, which provides distributional characterizations of the genealogy.</description>

      <title>Three-state coevolutionary game dynamics with environmental feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Environmental feedback mechanisms are ubiquitous in real-world complex systems. In this study, we incorporate a homogeneous environment into the evolutionary dynamics of a three-state system comprising cooperators, defectors, and empty nodes. Both coherence resonance and equilibrium states, resulting from the tightly clustering of cooperator agglomerates, enhance population survival and environmental quality. The resonance phenomenon arises at the transition between cooperative and defective payoff parameters in the prisoner's dilemma game.</description>

      <title>Evaluating multi-season occupancy models with autocorrelation fitted to heterogeneous datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting species distributions using occupancy models accounting for imperfect detection is now commonplace in ecology. Recently, modelling spatial and temporal autocorrelation was proposed to alleviate the lack of replication in occupancy data, which often prevents model identifiability. However, how such models perform in highly heterogeneous datasets where missing or single-visit data dominates remains an open question. Motivated by an heterogeneous fine-scale butterfly occupancy dataset, we evaluate the performance of a multi-season occupancy model with spatial and temporal random effects to a skewed (Poisson) distribution of the number of surveys per site, overlap of covariates between occupancy and detection submodels, and spatiotemporal clustering of observations. Results showed that the model is robust to heterogeneous data and covariate overlap. However, when spatiotemporal gaps were added, site occupancy was biased towards the average occupancy, itself overestimated. Random effects did not correct the influence of gaps, due to identifiability issues of variance and autocorrelation parameters. Occupancy analysis of two butterfly species further confirmed these results. Overall, multi-season occupancy models with autocorrelation are robust to heterogeneous data and covariate overlap, but still present identifiability issues and are challenged by severe data gaps, which compromise predictions even in data-rich areas.</description>

      <title>GTP before ATP: The energy currency at the origin of genes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Life is an exergonic chemical reaction. Many individual reactions in metabolism entail slightly endergonic steps that are coupled to free energy release, typically as ATP hydrolysis, in order to go forward. ATP is almost always supplied by the rotor-stator ATP synthase, which harnesses chemiosmotic ion gradients. Because the ATP synthase is a protein, it arose after the ribosome did. What was the energy currency of metabolism before the origin of the ATP synthase and how (and why) did ATP come to be the universal energy currency? About 27% of a cell's energy budget is consumed as GTP during translation. The universality of GTP-dependence in ribosome function indicates that GTP was the ancestral energy currency of protein synthesis. The use of GTP in translation and ATP in small molecule synthesis are conserved across all lineages, representing energetic compartments that arose in the last universal common ancestor, LUCA. And what came before GTP? Recent findings indicate that the energy supporting the origin of LUCA's metabolism stemmed from H2-dependent CO2 reduction along routes that strongly resemble the reactions and transition metal catalysts of the acetyl-CoA pathway.</description>

      <title>Measures of net effects in signed social and ecological networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With improvements in data resolution and quality, researchers can now represent complex systems as signed, weighted, and directed networks. In this article, we introduce a framework for measuring net and indirect effects without simplifying these information-rich networks. It captures both direct and indirect interactions, the effect of the whole network on a node, and conversely, the effect of a node on the entire network, while accommodating the complexity of signed, weighted, and directed links. Our taxonomy unifies and extends existing approaches and measures from network science, computational social science, and ecological networks. We demonstrate its value in ecological systems, where net and indirect effects are critical yet difficult to quantify. Using generalized Lotka-Volterra dynamics, we find a strong correlation between negative net effects and species extinction. We further apply the framework to a real-world social network, where it identifies informative rankings that illuminate influence propagation and power dynamics.</description>
