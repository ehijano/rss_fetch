      <title>How Not to Measure a False QCD Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluctuations of conserved charges are a golden channel for measuring a QCD critical point in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. These fluctuations are quantified by measuring high-order cumulants of baryon-number distributions at a given centrality. Using simulated proton-number cumulants as an example, we discuss how the correlation between particle identification and centrality measurements can distort particle-number distributions. These distortions can easily create large fluctuations in high-order cumulants that might be mistaken for a critical-point signature. We show that certain measurement choices can make the analysis more or less vulnerable to these false signals. We motivate this by considering how the two-dimensional probability space of proton-number versus multiplicity is shaped by analysis choices. We then demonstrate this vulnerability with simulated Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3.9$ GeV in UrQMD, and two toy models of detector responses to certain classes of events. We explain how an analyzer might observe a false critical signature, and how to avoid doing so, even in a challenging experimental environment.</description>

      <title>Testable leptogenesis and $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in extended seesaw model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of observable neutrinoless double beta decay $( 0 \nu \beta\beta)$ and viable leptogenesis within a low-scale extended inverse seesaw mechanism with additional sterile neutrinos. General effective field theory (EFT) considerations suggest that if there are experimentally observable signatures in $0 \nu \beta \beta$-decay and a lepton asymmetry generated by heavy right-handed neutrino decays, thermal leptogenesis is likely to be unviable. However, in this work, we show that in the context of low-scale leptogenesis, one can obtain the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe and observable signatures of $0 \nu \beta \beta$ decay in the presence of additional sterile neutrinos. In this framework, the light neutrino masses are suppressed by the extended seesaw parameter, $\mu$, thereby allowing for $\mathcal{O}(10\, \mathrm{TeV})$ right-handed (RH) neutrinos, while avoiding small Yukawa couplings as in other neutrino mass models and near degeneracies in the RH neutrino spectrum as required by the low-scale leptogenesis paradigm. Contributions to the $0 \nu \beta \beta$-decay rate from additional sterile neutrinos can be appreciable, while the corresponding contributions to the early universe lepton asymmetry washout rate are suppressed by other parameters not entering the $0 \nu \beta \beta$-decay amplitudes. We show that for keV-MeV scale, sterile neutrinos future ton-scale $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay experiments offer potential signals while maintaining viable leptogenesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instability of the charged pion vacuum resulting in the pion condensation is studied within the $\lambda|\phi|^4$ model at the rapid rotation of the system in presence of external fields. Case of the static external scalar and electric square potential wells and the uniform magnetic field is studied in detail. The Meissner and Aharonov-Bohm effects and the London moment are taken into account. Analogies and differences with the behavior of metallic superconductors under the action of the rotation and the external magnetic field are analysed.</description>

      <title>Approach to meson-baryon femtoscopy using effective field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate several femtoscopy correlation functions in the strangeness sectors $S=0$ and $S=-2$ for meson-baryon interactions. We combine the amplitudes of chiral perturbation theory at leading order with the TROY (T-matrix-based Routine for HadrOn femtoscopY) framework. We consider the correlation function for the $\pi^+$p and $\pi^-$p channels, which are currently under analysis by the ALICE collaboration at the LHC. Furthermore, we will show that analogous interactions can be used to reproduce the results for $K_S \Lambda$ correlation functions obtained by ALICE collaboration in PbPb collisions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the proton-antiproton scattering using a constituent-quark-model based coupled-channels calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the last experimental and theoretical advances in the analysis of possible baryonium resonances, the $X(1835)$ and their partners, we perform a constituent-quark-model based coupled-channels calculation of the proton-antiproton scattering in order to analyze the possible existence of bound states or near-threshold structures. The used $N\overline N$ potential is derived from a $G$-parity transformation of the quark-model-based $NN$ interaction which has described well deuteron properties, $NN$ phase shifts, and even hadron-hadron phenomenology. The additional $N\overline N$ annihilation is taken into account by a complex phenomenological potential whose real part is generated by one-pion and one-gluon exchange annihilation potentials and its imaginary part is an energy-independent potential of Gaussian form. Then, all the parameters of the interaction are constrained by the $NN$ sector except those determining the imaginary part of the annihilation potential. Our study concludes that the nucleon-antinucleon dynamics is complex and rich in scattering singularities near the proton-antiproton and neutron-antineutron thresholds.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Fifth Force Using the Earth as a Spin and Mass Source from the Chinese Space Station</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential of conducting an experiment on the Chinese Space Station (CSS) to constrain beyond-the-standard-model (BSM) long-range spin- and velocity-dependent interactions, which are mediated by the exchange of an ultralight $\left(m_{z^{\prime}}&lt;10^{-10}\text{eV}\right)$ or massless intermediate vector boson. We demonstrate that the proposed experiment on the CSS offers several advantages compared to ground-based experiments. The high speed can enhance the sensitivity to velocity-dependent interactions. The periodicity allows efficient extraction of signals from background noises, thereby strengthening the experiment's accuracy. Combining these advantages, one can improve the existing bounds on such interactions by up to five orders of magnitude. With advancements in sensor technology, we anticipate a further enhancement of four orders of magnitude, resulting in a total potential improvement of up to nine orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Polarization options in inclusive DIS off tensor polarized deuteron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the near future, the Jefferson Lab $b_1$ experiment will provide the second measurement of tensor polarized asymmetries in inclusive DIS on the deuteron. In this asymmetry, 4 independent tensor polarized structure functions contribute. This necessitates systematic approximations in the extraction of the leading twist structure function $b_1$ from a single tensor asymmetry measurement. Contamination from higher twist structure functions and kinematic effects is discussed here. Using a deuteron convolution model, we quantify the systematic errors from these approximations for two different choices for the target polarization direction (momentum transfer, electron beam direction). For Jefferson Lab 12 GeV kinematics, the systematic error turns out to be comparable between the two polarization options, while at higher $Q^2$ values the momentum transfer direction is preferred.</description>

      <title>Shear Viscosity of Asymptotically Hot and Dense QCD Matter: AMY Formalism vs. A Modified Relaxation Time Approximation in 0-flavor SU(3) Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16856v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The AMY formalism is widely used to describe the transport coefficients of asymptotically hot and dense QCD matter, such as shear viscosity $\eta$. In literature prior to AMY, the viscosity of an asymptotically hot QCD plasma was expressed by a $q^2$ momentum transfer-weighted relaxation time approximation. Recent studies that compared numerical transport calculations and analytical expressions for $\eta$ demonstrated that asymptotically high temperatures and densities induce anisotropic scatterings, which are exhibited in the quark-gluon plasma produced by relativistic heavy ion collisions. In these studies, the QGP was treated as a Maxwell-Boltzmann-distributed gluon gas with added (anti-)quark degrees of freedom. One such method used in the comparison was the "modified" $q^2$ transport-weighted RTA. In this study, a comparison between the AMY formalism (both numerical calculations and next-leading-log expression) and the modified RTA expression for $\eta$ is made in 0-flavor SU(3) theory. The comparison between numerical AMY calculations and the modified RTA method shows perfect agreement under the temperatures associated with collider-produced QGP. Additionally, AMY is compared with the Chapman-Enskog method, which is well understood to better describe anisotropic collider-produced QGP.</description>

      <title>Imaging the initial condition of heavy-ion collisions and nuclear structure across the nuclide chart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy nuclear collisions encompass three key stages: the structure of the colliding nuclei informed by low-energy nuclear physics, the initial condition (IC) leading to the formation of quark-gluon plasma (QGP), and the hydrodynamic expansion and hadronization of the QGP leading to final-state hadrons observed experimentally. Recent advances in experimental and theoretical methods have ushered in a precision era, enabling an increasingly accurate understanding of these stages. However, most approaches involve simultaneously determining both QGP properties and initial conditions from a single collision system, creating complexity due to the coupled contributions of various stages to the final-state observables.
  To avoid this, we propose leveraging known knowledge of low-energy nuclear structure and hydrodynamic observables to constrain the IC independently. By conducting comparative studies of collisions involving isobar-like nuclei - species with similar mass numbers but different structures - we disentangle the initial condition's impacts from the QGP properties. This approach not only refines our understanding of the IC but also turns high-energy experiments into a precision tool for imaging nuclear structures, offering insights that complement traditional low-energy approaches.
  Opportunities for carrying out such comparative experiments at the LHC and other facilities could significantly advance both high-energy and low-energy nuclear physics. Additionally, this approach has implications for the future EIC. While the possibilities are extensive, we focus on selected proposals that could benefit both the high-energy and low-energy nuclear physics communities. Originally prepared as input for the long-range plan of U.S. nuclear physics, this white paper reflects the status as of September 2022, with a brief update on developments since then.</description>

      <title>Optimization and Stabilization of Functional Renormalization Group Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit optimization of functional renormalization group flows by analyzing regularized loop integrals. This leads us to a principle, the Principle of Strongest Singularity, and a corresponding order relation which allows to order existing regularization schemes with respect to the stability of renormalization group flows. Moreover, the order relation can be used to construct new regulators in a systematic fashion. For studies of critical behavior, which require to follow renormalization group flows down to the deep infrared regime, such new regulators may turn out to be particularly useful. The general application of this principle is demonstrated with the aid of a scalar field theory which is solved over a wide range of scales with novel methods borrowed from numerical fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Estimates of Lee-Yang zeros and critical point for finite isospin densities in (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD using unbiased exponential resummation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimated using the unbiased exponential resummation formalism on (2+1)-flavor QCD with physical quark masses on $\Nt=8$ lattice, we present the first calculations of Lee-Yang zeros of QCD partition function in complex isospin chemical potential $\muI$ plane. From these zeros, we obtain the resummed estimate of radius of convergence, which we compare with the corresponding ratio and Mercer-Roberts estimates of the subsequent Taylor series expansions of the first three cumulants. We also illustrate a comparative study between the resummed and the Taylor series results of different partition function cumulants for real and imaginary values of $\muI$, discussing the behaviour of different expansion orders within and beyond the so-obtained resummed estimate of radius of convergence. We show that the reweighting factor and phasefactor begin to attain zero from this resummed estimate of radius of convergence. In this paper, we crosscheck this resummation methodology in baryochemical potential $\muB$ and affirm its validity in finite statistics limit. We also briefly compare this method with Taylor and \pade resummation results in $\muB$. We also re-establish this resummed radius of convergence can capture the onset of overlap problem for finite real $\muI$ simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a factorization theorem was proposed for partonic flavor evolution as defined by the net flavor of the Winner-Take-All axis of a jet. We validate the factorization theorem through explicit calculation at two-loop order, and in the process extract all anomalous dimensions and renormalization factors for any ultraviolet-to-infrared flavor transition at this order. These results can then be used to extract the renormalized hard function for flavored jet production at next-to-next-to-leading order for any process of interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transverse momentum spectra and their multiplicity dependence serve as key tools for extracting parameters to be compared with theoretical models. Over the past decade, the scientific community has extensively studied the possibility of a system analogous to quark-gluon plasma, predicted in heavy nuclei collisions, also existing in collisions involving light nuclei and protons. We have reanalysed the data published by the ALICE Collaboration at the LHC. We present the dependence of the mean transverse momenta obtained in the soft and soft+hard (mixed) parts. Finally, we also discuss possible refinements of the analyses concerning the use of statistical parameters of higher order, aimed at a more detailed way of comparing the models with data.</description>

      <title>Upper Limit of Sound Speed in Nuclear Matter: A Harmonious Interplay of Transport Calculation and Perturbative Quantum Chromodynamic Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09563v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Very recently, it has been shown that there is an upper bound on the squared sound speed of nuclear matter from the transport, which reads $c_{\rm s}^2 \leq 0.781$. In this work, we demonstrate that this upper bound is corroborated by the reconstructed equation of state (EOS; modeled with a nonparametric method) for ultradense matter. The reconstruction integrates multimessenger observation for neutron stars, in particular, the latest radius measurements for PSR J0437-4715 ($11.36^{+0.95}_{-0.63}$ km), PSR J0030+0451 ($11.71^{+0.88}_{-0.83}$ km, in the ST+PDT model), and PSR J0740+6620 ($12.49^{+1.28}_{-0.88}$ km) by NICER have been adopted. The result shows in all cases, the $c_{\rm s}^2 \leq 0.781$ upper limit for EOS will naturally yield the properties of matter near the center of the massive neutron star consistent with the causality-driven constraint from pQCD, where, in practice, the density in implementing the pQCD likelihood ($n_{\rm L}$) is applied at $10n_s$ (where $n_s$ is the nuclear saturation density). We also note that there is a strong correlation for the maximum $c_s^2$ with $n_{\rm L}$, and $c_{\rm s}^2 \leq 0.781$ is somehow violated when $n_{\rm L} = n_{\rm c,TOV}$. The result indicates that a higher $n_{\rm L}$, even considering the uncertainties from statistics, is more natural. Moreover, the remarkable agreement between the outcomes derived from these two distinct and independent constraints (i.e., the transport calculation and pQCD boundary) lends strong support to their validity. In addition, the latest joint constraint for $R_{1.4}$, $R_{2.0}$, $R_{1.4}-R_{2.0}$, and $M_{\rm TOV}$ are $11.94_{-0.68}^{+0.77}$ km, $11.99_{-0.67}^{+0.88}$ km, $-0.1_{-0.27}^{+0.42}$ km, and $2.24_{-0.10}^{+0.13}M_\odot$ (at $90\%$ credible level), respectively.</description>

      <title>Unraveling alignment pattern in high-energy particles via transverse momentum disbalance analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hypothesis of the relation between the strong azimuthal correlations, known as the alignment, in the families of hadrons and photons observed in cosmic ray experiments and the selection procedure of the highest-energy particles together with the transverse momentum conservation are tested in the framework of the HYDJET++ model. Results show that the high degree of alignment can appear in nucleus-nucleus interactions at the reasonable values of transverse momentum disbalance of most energetic detected particles.</description>

      <title>Charge radii of $^{11-16}$C, $^{13-17}$N and $^{15-18}$O determined from their charge-changing cross-sections and the mirror-difference charge radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10199v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charge-changing cross-sections of $^{11-16}$C, $^{13-17}$N and $^{15-18}$O on a carbon target have been determined at energies around 300 MeV/nucleon. A nucleon separation energy-dependent correction factor has been introduced to the Glauber model calculation for extracting the nuclear charge radii from the experimental CCCSs. The charge radii of $^{11}$C, $^{13,16}$N and $^{15}$O thus were determined for the first time. With the new radii, we studied the experimental mirror-difference charge radii ($\Delta R_{\text {ch}}^{\text {mirror}}$) of $^{11}$B-$^{11}$C, $^{13}$C-$^{13}$N, $^{15}$N-$^{15}$O, $^{17}$N-$^{17}$Ne pairs for the first time. We find that the $\Delta R_{\text {ch}}^{\text {mirror}}$ values of $^{13}$C-$^{13}$N and $^{15}$N-$^{15}$O pairs follow well the empirical relation to the isospin asymmetry predicted by the $ab$ $initio$ calculations, while $\Delta R_{\text {ch}}^{\text {mirror}}$ of $^{11}$B-$^{11}$C and $^{17}$N-$^{17}$Ne pairs deviate from such relation by more than two standard deviations.</description>

      <title>Systematic input scheme of many-boson Hamiltonians with applications to the two-dimensional $\phi ^4$ theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel, systematic input scheme for many-boson Hamiltonians in order to solve field theory problems within the light-front Hamiltonian formalism via quantum computing. We present our discussion of this input scheme based on the light-front Hamiltonian of the two-dimensional $\phi ^4$ theory. In our input scheme, we employ a set of quantum registers, where each register encodes the occupation of a distinct boson mode as binaries. We squeeze the boson operators of each mode and present the Hamiltonian in terms of unique combinations of the squeezed boson operators. We design the circuit modules for these unique combinations. Based on these circuit modules, we block encode the many-boson Hamiltonian utilizing the idea of quantum walk. For demonstration purposes, we present the spectral calculations of the Hamiltonian utilizing the hybrid quantum-classical symmetry-adapted quantum Krylov subspace diagonalization algorithm based on our input scheme, where the quantum computations are performed with the IBM Qiskit quantum simulator. The results of the hybrid calculations agree with exact results.</description>

      <title>Charged pions asymmetry from the decay of light neutral axial mesons due to interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective three meson couplings, based in flavor U(3) quark-antiquark interactions, are considered to describe two light neutral axial meson Strong decays, $A \sim f_1(1285)$ and $f_{1S} (1420)$, and the charged rho meson decay in the following channels: $A \to \rho^\mp (770)+ \pi^\pm$, $A\to a_0^\mp (980) +\pi^\pm$ and $\rho^\pm \to \pi^\pm \pi^0$. By considering neutral meson mixings, such as $f_1(1285) - a_1^0(1260)$, $f_{1S}(1420) - a_1^0(1260)$ and $\eta-\pi^0$ for the channels investigated, the leading three-meson interactions may lead to decay amplitudes that undergo interference and a resulting ratio of decay rate into charged pions, $\Gamma_{\pi^+}/\Gamma_{\pi^-}$, slightly smaller than one. For that it will be assumed that the produced charged vector mesons or charged scalar mesons undergo absorption, decay into channels without charged pions, or any other inelastic process that may suppress their decays into charged pions.</description>

      <title>Relativistic diffusion model for hadron production in p-Pb collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate charged-hadron production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions of asymmetric systems within a nonequilibrium-statistical framework. Calculated centrality-dependent pseudorapidity distributions for p-Pb collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=5.02 and 8.16 TeV are compared with data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Our approach combines a relativistic diffusion model with formulations based on quantum chromodynamics while utilizing numerical solutions of a Fokker-Planck equation to account for the shift and broadening of the fragmentation sources for particle-production with respect to the stopping (net-baryon) rapidity distributions. To represent the centrality dependence of charged-hadron production in asymmetric systems over a broad region of pseudorapidities, the consideration and precise modelling of the fragmentation sources - along with the central gluon-gluon source - is found to be essential. Specifically, this results in an inversion of the particle-production amplitude from backward- to forward-dominance when transitioning from central to peripheral collisions, in agreement with recent ATLAS and ALICE p-Pb data at sqrt(s_NN)=5.02 TeV.</description>

      <title>Baryon and Meson Excited States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The masses of eight baryon sets and nine meson sets of three or more equal-quantum excited states are fitted by a simple two-parameter logarithm function, M(n) = a Ln(n) + b, where $n$ is the order of excitation. The conjecture is made that accurately measured masses of all equal-quantum baryon and meson excited states would be related by the logarithm function used here; at least for the mass range of currently known excited states.</description>

      <title>Hadron-quark hybrid model, modular transformation and Roberge-Weiss transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the framework of modular transformations, we reformulate the recently proposed hadron-quark hybrid model when the imaginary baryonic chemical potential is introduced. As a result, we can consider the torus, which is characterized by the complex number densities of baryons (antibaryons) and quarks (antiquarks). We apply this model to analyze the Roberge-Weiss transition. It is shown that the torus vanishes at the baryonic chemical potential where the Roberge-Weiss transition appears because the number density of baryons (antibaryons) is not linearly independent of the number density of quarks (antiquarks). When the temperature T is lower than the Roberge-Weiss transition temperature TRW, the torus shrinks smoothly to the one-dimensional object at the Roberge-Weiss transition point, but the discontinuity does not appear. On the other hand, the discontinuity of the geometrical object appears when T&gt;TRW. We also calculate the modulus of the torus and transform it into the fundamental region. The transformed moduli are symmetric below TRW, but the symmetry is broken above TRW.</description>
