      <title>Thermostatistical Evaluation of Economic Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of Bogot'{a}'s sports sector through thermostatistical models applied to economic systems. The study investigates the cross-price elasticity of income ($\lambda$) to determine whether sports services in Bogot'{a} are normal or inferior goods. Analyzing data from the Sports Satellite Account of Bogot'{a} (CSDB) from 2018 to 2022, we find that demand for sports services is highly elastic, particularly during economic upturns, indicating they are seen as normal or luxury goods. We also calculate the partition function, entropy, and heat capacity, showing consistency with the Boltzmann Principle, which indicates a strong correlation between microstates and the macroeconomic state, supporting the statistical thermodynamic framework. Furthermore, the study employs geometrothermodynamics to assess system stability using Kretschmann and Ricci scalars to identify economic singularities, especially during the pandemic, highlighting its disruptive impact. This approach provides a nuanced understanding of system stability and the effects of external shocks like COVID-19 on the economic structure. Our analysis demonstrates that Bogot'{a}'s sports sector responds elastically to GDP changes, with stability influenced by various macroeconomic factors. However, a decline in heat capacity as economic temperature rises suggests potential growth limitations, necessitating further research to fully grasp the sector's long-term outlook.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the Mix of World Energy Needs by mid-21st Century</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The logistic function is used to forecast energy consumed worldwide. The logistic substitution model is used to describe the energy mix since 1965 presenting a picture significantly different from the one covering the previous 100 years. In the new picture the share of heavy pollutants, i.e. coal plus oil, keeps declining systematically in favor of natural gas and renewables (wind, geothermal, solar, biomass, and waste), the share of which grows rapidly. The shares of these three energy sources (coal plus oil, natural gas, and renewables) are poised to reach around 30 percent each by the mid-21st century. Nuclear and hydroelectric energy, both with rather stable shares, are responsible for the remaining 10 percent, which goes mostly to hydroelectric.
  Zooming into the composition of renewables we find that today's dominant wind power is about to begin losing share to solar energy, which will overtake wind after 2024 and account for more than 90 percent of all renewables by mid-21st century, by which time geothermal, biomass, and other renewable energy sources will have dropped to insignificant levels.
  Forecasts in exajouls are given for all energy sources up to 2050.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of strategic voting: pathways to consensus and gridlock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The outcomes of democratic elections rest on individuals' decision-making that is driven by their varying preferences and beliefs. Individuals may prefer consensus to gridlock, or gridlock to consensus, and information may be fractured via echo-chambers. To understand the role of these factors in whether or not elections reach consensus, we develop and explore a computational model in which voters have varying party affiliations, preferences, beliefs, and voting strategies. Voters may change their voting strategies either by imitating others or reconsidering their strategy individually. Preferences are orderings of the following election outcomes: a voter's party winning a super-majority, the opposing party winning such a majority, and gridlock. Voters beliefs and decisions are shaped by their social networks, and thus are heterogeneous in the population. We observe a "tipping point" phenomenon wherein the voters' initial strategies and randomness impact whether the minority party voters vote to create gridlock or consensus. A positive feedback loop secures such voters into one behaviour or the other. Consensus is reached by the minority party evolving to prefer consensus, which in turn drives the majority to also prefer consensus due to the influence of social learning. Further, consensus is promoted by an uneven distribution of party affiliation, and undermined when it is even. We also find that a moderate prevalence or strength of echo-chambers can boost consensus, since they can quell voters' desires for gridlock.</description>

      <title>Massive Retail Location Choice as a Human Flow-Covering Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we reframe the classic problem of massive location choice for retail chains, introducing an alternative approach. Traditional methodologies of massive location choice models encounter limitations rooted in assumptions such as power-law distance decay and oversimplified travel patterns. In response, we present a spatial operations research model aimed at maximizing customer coverage, using massive individual trajectories as a "sampling" of human flows, and thus the model is robust. Formulating the retail location selection problem as a set-covering problem, we propose a greedy solution. Through a case study in Shenzhen utilizing real-world individual trajectory data, our approach demonstrates substantial improvements over prevailing location choices.</description>

      <title>Nanopore DNA Sequencing Technology: A Sociological Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanopore sequencing, a next-generation sequencing technology, holds the potential to revolutionize multiple facets of life sciences, forensics, and healthcare. While previous research has focused on its technical intricacies and biomedical applications, this paper offers a unique perspective by scrutinizing the societal dimensions (ethical, legal, and social implications) of nanopore sequencing. Employing the lenses of Diffusion and Action Network Theory, we examine the dissemination of nanopore sequencing in society as a potential consumer product, contributing to the field of the sociology of technology. We investigate the possibility of interactions between human and nonhuman actors in developing nanopore technology to analyse how various stakeholders, such as companies, regulators, and researchers, shape the trajectory of the growth of nanopore sequencing. This work offers insights into the social construction of nanopore sequencing, shedding light on the actors, power dynamics, and socio-technical networks that shape its adoption and societal impact. Understanding the sociological dimensions of this transformative technology is vital for responsible development, equitable distribution, and inclusive integration into diverse societal contexts.</description>

      <title>Revealing the core-periphery structure of cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of urban services reveals critical patterns of human activity and accessibility. Proximity to amenities like restaurants, banks, and hospitals can reduce access barriers, but these services are often unevenly distributed, exacerbating spatial inequalities and socioeconomic disparities. In this study, we present a novel accessibility measure based on the spatial distribution of Points of Interest (POIs) within cities. Using the radial distribution function from statistical physics, we analyze the dispersion of services across different urban zones, combining local and remote access to services. This approach allows us to identify a city's central core, intermediate areas or secondary cores, and its periphery. Comparing the areas that we find with the resident population distribution highlights clusters of urban services and helps uncover disparities in access to opportunities.</description>

      <title>A cross-platform analysis of polarization and echo chambers in climate change discussions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21187v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the intensification of climate change discussion, social media has become prominent in disseminating reliable and unreliable content. In this study, we present a cross-platform analysis on Youtube and Twitter, and examine the polarization and echo chambers in social media discussions in four datasets related to climate change: COP27, IPCC, Climate Refugees, and Do\~{n}ana. We have identified communities of users spreading misinformation on Twitter, although they remain relatively isolated from the rest of the network. The analysis by interaction type reveals that climate change sceptics use mentions to draw the attention of other communities. The YouTube posts referenced on Twitter reveal a strong correlation in the community organisation of social media, suggesting a platform alignment. Moreover, we report the presence of echo chambers in YouTube post-sharing related to mainstream and sceptical content.</description>

      <title>Intersectional inequalities in social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social networks are shaped by complex, intersecting identities that drive our connection preferences. These preferences weave networks where certain groups hold privileged positions, while others become marginalized. While previous research has examined the impact of single-dimensional identities on inequalities of social capital, social disparities accumulate nonlinearly, further harming individuals at the intersection of multiple disadvantaged groups. However, how multidimensional connection preferences affect network dynamics and in what forms they amplify or attenuate inequalities remains unclear. In this work, we systematically analyze the impact of multidimensionality on social capital inequalities through the lens of intersectionality. To this end, we operationalize several notions of intersectional inequality in networks. Using a network model, we reveal how attribute correlation (or consolidation) combined with biased multidimensional preferences lead to the emergence of counterintuitive patterns of inequality that are unobservable in one-dimensional systems. We calibrate the model with real-world high school friendship data and derive analytical closed-form expressions for the predicted inequalities, finding that the model's predictions match the observed data with remarkable accuracy. These findings hold significant implications for addressing social disparities and inform strategies for creating more equitable networks.</description>

      <title>Evolving interdisciplinary contributions to global societal challenges: A 50-year overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Addressing global societal challenges necessitates insights and expertise that transcend the boundaries of individual disciplines. In recent decades, interdisciplinary collaboration has been recognised as a vital driver of innovation and effective problem-solving, with the potential to profoundly influence policy and practice worldwide. However, quantitative evidence remains limited regarding how cross-disciplinary efforts contribute to societal challenges, as well as the evolving roles and relevance of specific disciplines in addressing these issues. To fill this gap, this study examines the long-term evolution of interdisciplinary contributions to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), drawing on extensive bibliometric data from OpenAlex. By analysing publication and citation trends across 19 research fields from 1970 to 2022, we reveal how the relative presence of different disciplines in addressing particular SDGs has shifted over time. Our results also provide unique evidence of the increasing interconnection between fields since the 2000s, coinciding with the United Nations' initiative to tackle global societal challenges through interdisciplinary efforts. These insights will benefit policymakers and practitioners as they reflect on past progress and plan for future action, particularly with the SDG target deadline approaching in the next five years.</description>

      <title>Economic Integration of Africa in the 21st Century: Complex Network and Panel Regression Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global and regional integration has grown significantly in recent decades, boosting intra-African trade and positively impacting national economies through trade diversification and sustainable development. However, existing measures of economic integration often fail to capture the complex interactions among trading partners. This study addresses this gap by using complex network analysis and dynamic panel regression techniques to identify factors driving economic integration in Africa, based on data from 2002 to 2019. The results show that economic development, institutional quality, regional trade agreements, human capital, FDI, and infrastructure positively influence a country's position in the African trade network. Conversely, trade costs, the global financial crisis, and regional overlapping memberships negatively affect network based integration. Our findings suggest that enhancing a country's connectivity in the African trade network involves identifying key economic and institutional factors of trade partners and strategically focusing on continent-wide agreements rather than just regional ones to boost economic growth.</description>

      <title>Universal Statistics of Competition in Democratic Elections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elections for public offices in democratic nations are large-scale examples of collective decision-making. As a complex system with a multitude of interactions among agents, we can anticipate that universal macroscopic patterns could emerge independent of microscopic details. Despite the availability of empirical election data, such universality, valid at all scales, countries, and elections, has not yet been observed. In this work, we propose a parameter-free voting model and analytically show that the distribution of the victory margin is driven by that of the voter turnout, and a scaled measure depending on margin and turnout leads to a robust universality. This is demonstrated using empirical election data from $34$ countries, spanning multiple decades and electoral scales. The deviations from the model predictions and universality indicate possible electoral malpractices. We argue that this universality is a stylized fact indicating the competitive nature of electoral outcomes.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Analysis of Wealth Index Predictions in Africa between three Multi-Source Inference Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01631v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Poverty map inference has become a critical focus of research, utilizing both traditional and modern techniques, ranging from regression models to convolutional neural networks applied to tabular data, satellite imagery, and networks. While much attention has been given to validating models during the training phase, the final predictions have received less scrutiny. In this study, we analyze the International Wealth Index (IWI) predicted by Lee and Braithwaite (2022) and Esp\'in-Noboa et al. (2023), alongside the Relative Wealth Index (RWI) inferred by Chi et al. (2022), across six Sub-Saharan African countries. Our analysis reveals trends and discrepancies in wealth predictions between these models. In particular, significant and unexpected discrepancies between the predictions of Lee and Braithwaite and Esp\'in-Noboa et al., even after accounting for differences in training data. In contrast, the shape of the wealth distributions predicted by Esp\'in-Noboa et al. and Chi et al. are more closely aligned, suggesting similar levels of skewness. These findings raise concerns about the validity of certain models and emphasize the importance of rigorous audits for wealth prediction algorithms used in policy-making. Continuous validation and refinement are essential to ensure the reliability of these models, particularly when they inform poverty alleviation strategies.</description>

      <title>Liberal-Conservative Hierarchies of Intercoder Reliability Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While numerous indices of inter-coder reliability exist, Krippendorff's {\alpha} and Cohen's \{kappa} have long dominated in communication studies and other fields, respectively. The near consensus, however, may be near the end. Recent theoretical and mathematical analyses reveal that these indices assume intentional and maximal random coding, leading to paradoxes and inaccuracies. A controlled experiment with one-way golden standard and Monte Carlo simulations supports these findings, showing that \{kappa} and {\alpha} are poor predictors and approximators of true intercoder reliability. As consensus on a perfect index remains elusive, more authors recommend selecting the best available index for specific situations (BAFS). To make informed choices, researchers, reviewers, and educators need to understand the liberal-conservative hierarchy of indices, i.e., which indices produce higher or lower scores. This study extends previous efforts by expanding the math-based hierarchies to include 23 indices and constructing six additional hierarchies using Monte Carlo simulations. These simulations account for factors like the number of categories and distribution skew. The resulting eight hierarchies display a consistent pattern and reveal a previously undetected paradox in the Ir index.</description>

      <title>Modeling urbanization dynamics by labor force migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Individual participants in human society collectively exhibit aggregation behavior. In this study, we present a simple microscopic model of labor force migration based on the active Brownian particles framework. In particular, agent-based simulations show that the model produces clusters of agents from a random initial distribution. Furthermore, two empirical regularities called Zipf's and Okun's laws were observed. To reveal the mechanism underlying the reproduced aggregation phenomena, we use our microscopic model to derive an extended Keller--Segel system, which is a classic model describing the aggregation behavior of biological organisms called taxis. The obtained macroscopic system indicates that the concentration of the workforce in the real world can be explained through a new type of taxis central to human behavior, highlighting the relevance of urbanization to blow-up phenomena in the derived PDE system. We then characterize the transition between the aggregation and diffusion regimes both analytically and computationally. The predicted long-term dynamics of urbanization -- originating in the asymmetric natures of employed and unemployed agents -- are compared with global empirical data, particularly in the realms of labor statistics and urban indicators.</description>

Abstract: Biodiversity loss driven by agricultural intensification is a pressing global issue, with significant implications for ecosystem stability and human well-being. We design an integrated bio-economic agent-based model, informed by historical data from the French agricultural sector, to project future biodiversity trends and evaluate policy interventions. Our model predicts further biodiversity decline under a business-as-usual scenario, primarily due to intensified land consolidation. We evaluate two policy options: reducing pesticide use and subsidizing small farmers. While pesticide reduction rapidly benefits biodiversity in the beginning, it eventually leads to increased land consolidation and further biodiversity loss. In contrast, subsidizing small farmers by reallocating a small fraction of existing subsidies, stabilizes farm sizes and enhances biodiversity in the long run. The most effective strategy results from combining both policies, leveraging pesticide reduction alongside targeted subsidies to balance economic pressures and consistently improve biodiversity.</description>
