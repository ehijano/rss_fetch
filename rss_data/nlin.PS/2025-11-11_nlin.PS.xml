      <title>Stability theory of flat band solitons in nonlinear wave systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a sharp criterion for the stability of a class of compactly supported, homogeneous density``minimal compact solitons'' or MCS states, of the time-dependent discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on a multi-lattice, $\mathbb L$ ($\mathbb L$-DNLS). MCS states arise for multi-lattices where a nearest neighbor Laplace-type operator on $\mathbb L$ has a flat band. Our stability criterion is in terms of the explicit form of the nonlinearity and the projection of distinguished vectors onto the flat band eigenspace. We apply our general results to MCS states of DNLS for the diamond, Kagom{\'e} and checkerboard lattices. In lattices where MCS states are unstable, we demonstrate how to engineer the nonlinearity to stabilize small amplitude MCS states. Finally, via systematic numerical computations, we put our analytical results in the context of global bifurcation diagrams.</description>

      <title>Pattern formation in ring condensates subjected to bichromatic driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical formation of nonlinear patterns in one-dimensional ring condensates under bichromatic periodic modulation of the interaction strength. The stability phase diagram of the condensate's homogeneous density state is analytically derived through a suitable biharmonic variant of the Mathieu equation and computing the associated Floquet spectrum. It reveals the complex interplay between the driving parameters, i.e., amplitude, frequencies, and the so-called frequencies' mixing angle, which dictate the instability onset and the selective enhancement of higher-order resonance tongues, thus offering precise control over the excited modes. These results are in agreement with time-dependent mean-field simulations evidencing the emergence of density wave modulations of specific momenta, while enabling a deeper understanding of the nonlinear stage of the relevant instability. Further insights on the ensuing unstable nonlinear dynamics are provided through a reduced {five-mode} model which captures the instability onset, the oscillatory behavior of the mode populations and the phase-space dynamics, in agreement with the mean-field predictions. Our study highlights the versatility of bichromatic driving to generate and control complex nonlinear patterns that are within reach in present day ultracold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Optically-Induced Faraday-Goldstone Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Faraday waves, typically observed in driven fluids, result from the confluence of nonlinearity and parametric amplification. Here we show that optical pulses can generate analogous phenomena that persist much longer than the pump time-scales in ordered quantum solids. We present a theory of ultrafast light-matter interactions within a symmetry-broken state; dynamical nonlinear coupling between the Higgs (amplitude) and the Goldstone (phase) modes drives an emergent phason texture that oscillates in space and in time: Faraday-Goldstone waves. Calculated signatures of this spatiotemporal order compare well with measurements on K$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$; Higgs-Goldstone beating, associated with coherent energy exchange between these two modes, is also predicted. We show this light-generated crystalline state is robust to thermal noise, even when the original Goldstone mode is not. Our results offer a new pathway for the design of periodic structures in quantum materials with ultrafast light pulses.</description>

      <title>Some of the many uses of scalar fields: kinks, lumps, and geometric constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This perspective deals with real scalar fields in two-dimensional spacetime. We focus on models described by one and two real scalar fields, paying closer attention to kinks and lumps, which are localized structures of current interest in high energy physics and in other areas of nonlinear science. We briefly review some of the main results presented in the literature and then focus on some new issues concerning the compact and long-range behavior of solutions and the presence of geometric constraints, suggesting how they can be used in applications in other areas of nonlinear science.</description>
