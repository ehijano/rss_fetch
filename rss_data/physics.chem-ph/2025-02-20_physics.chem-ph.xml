      <title>Imaging the Photochemistry of Cyclobutanone using Ultrafast Electron Diffraction: Experimental Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the ultrafast structural dynamics of cyclobutanone following photoexcitation at $\lambda=200$ nm using gas-phase megaelectronvolt ultrafast electron diffraction. Our investigation complements the simulation studies of the same process within this special issue. It provides information about both electronic state population and structural dynamics through well-separable inelastic and elastic electron scattering signatures. We observe the depopulation of the photoexcited S$_2$ state of cyclobutanone with n3s Rydberg character through its inelastic electron scattering signature with a time constant of $(0.29 \pm 0.2)$ ps towards the S$_1$ state. The S$_1$ state population undergoes ring-opening via a Norrish Type-I reaction, likely while passing through a conical intersection with S$_0$. The corresponding structural changes can be tracked by elastic electron scattering signatures. These changes appear with a delay of $(0.14 \pm 0.05)$ ps with respect the initial photoexcitation, which is less than the S$_2$ depopulation time constant. This behavior provides evidence for the ballistic nature of the ring-opening once the S$_1$ state is reached. The resulting biradical species react further within $(1.2 \pm 0.2)$ ps via two rival fragmentation channels yielding ketene and ethylene, or propene and carbon monoxide. Our study showcases both the value of gas-phase ultrafast diffraction studies as an experimental benchmark for nonadiabatic dynamics simulation methods and the limits in the interpretation of such experimental data without comparison to such simulations.</description>

      <title>The impact of conformer quality on learned representations of molecular conformer ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training machine learning models to predict properties of molecular conformer ensembles is an increasingly popular strategy to accelerate the conformational analysis of drug-like small molecules, reactive organic substrates, and homogeneous catalysts. For high-throughput analyses especially, trained surrogate models can help circumvent traditional approaches to conformational analysis that rely on expensive conformer searches and geometry optimizations. Here, we question how the performance of surrogate models for predicting 3D conformer-dependent properties (of a single, active conformer) is affected by the quality of the 3D conformers used as their input. How well do lower-quality conformers inform the prediction of properties of higher-quality conformers? Does the fidelity of geometry optimization matter when encoding random conformers? For models that encode sets of conformers, how does the presence of the active conformer that induces the target property affect model accuracy? How do predictions from a surrogate model compare to estimating the properties from cheap ensembles themselves? We explore these questions in the context of predicting Sterimol parameters of conformer ensembles optimized with density functional theory. Although answers will be case-specific, our analyses provide a valuable perspective on 3D representation learning models and raise practical considerations regarding when conformer quality matters.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Water Contamination on the Aging of a Dual-Carbon Lithium-Ion Capacitor Employing LiFSI-Based Electrolyte</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fabricating electrochemical energy storage devices demands significant energy for drying cell components to ensure optimal performance. The development of new, water-tolerant materials would represent a tremendous advance in cost savings and sustainability. Although it is generally established that water deteriorates cell performance, there are few systematic studies on the maximum amount of tolerable water contamination, and most of the studies employed the electrolyte salt $\mathrm{LiPF_6}$, which inevitably decomposes upon exposure to humidity. In this work, the potential of using the non-hydrolyzing salt LiFSI is explored with respect to its performance in Li-ion capacitor cells based on activated carbon (AC) and pre-lithiated graphite (Gr). Water is deliberately added in various amounts (950, 2300, and 6000 ppm), and its effect on the electrochemical performance and aging of AC and Gr electrodes is systematically studied. While the addition of 950 ppm water has no evident impact on capacity retention (96% after 2000 cycles), the addition of 2300 ppm water or 6000 ppm water shows a distinct capacity fade, attributed to a significant loss of lithium inventory and increased resistivity due to irreversible reactions of the water with lithiated Gr. Post-mortem analysis reveals that water promotes the oxidative and reductive decomposition of LiFSI on AC and lithiated Gr, respectively. A significant thickening of the SEI on Gr is observed as the water concentration is increased.</description>

      <title>$\mathtt{GeLLM^3O}$: Generalizing Large Language Models for Multi-property Molecule Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements, most computational methods for molecule optimization are constrained to single- or double-property optimization tasks and suffer from poor scalability and generalizability to novel optimization tasks. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable out-of-domain generalizability to novel tasks. To demonstrate LLMs' potential for molecule optimization, we introduce $\mathtt{MoMUInstruct}$, the first high-quality instruction-tuning dataset specifically focused on complex multi-property molecule optimization tasks. Leveraging $\mathtt{MoMUInstruct}$, we develop $\mathtt{GeLLM^3O}$s, a series of instruction-tuned LLMs for molecule optimization. Extensive evaluations across 5 in-domain and 5 out-of-domain tasks demonstrate that $\mathtt{GeLLM^3O}$s consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines. $\mathtt{GeLLM^3O}$s also exhibit outstanding zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, significantly outperforming powerful closed-source LLMs. Such strong generalizability demonstrates the tremendous potential of $\mathtt{GeLLM^3O}$s as foundational models for molecule optimization, thereby tackling novel optimization tasks without resource-intensive retraining. $\mathtt{MoMUInstruct}$, models, and code are accessible through https://github.com/ninglab/GeLLMO.</description>

      <title>Mol-LLaMA: Towards General Understanding of Molecules in Large Molecular Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding molecules is key to understanding organisms and driving advances in drug discovery, requiring interdisciplinary knowledge across chemistry and biology. Although large molecular language models have achieved notable success in interpreting molecular structures, their instruction datasets are limited to the specific knowledge from task-oriented datasets and do not fully cover the fundamental characteristics of molecules, hindering their abilities as general-purpose molecular assistants. To address this issue, we propose Mol-LLaMA, a large molecular language model that grasps the general knowledge centered on molecules via multi-modal instruction tuning. To this end, we design key data types that encompass the fundamental features of molecules, incorporating essential knowledge from molecular structures. In addition, to improve understanding of molecular features, we introduce a module that integrates complementary information from different molecular encoders, leveraging the distinct advantages of different molecular representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that Mol-LLaMA is capable of comprehending the general features of molecules and generating relevant responses to users' queries with detailed explanations, implying its potential as a general-purpose assistant for molecular analysis.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Transients in Motility-Induced Phase Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate normal diffusion in a two-dimensional athermal suspension of active particles undergoing motility-induced phase separation. The particles are modeled as achiral Janus disks with fixed self-propulsion speed and weakly fluctuating orientation. When plotted versus the overall suspension packing fraction, the relevant diffusion constant traces a hysteresis loop with sharp jumps in correspondence with the binodal and spinodal of the gaseous phase. No hysteresis loop is observed between the spinodal and binodal of the dense phase, as they appear to overlap. Moreover, even under steady-state phase separation, the particle displacement distributions exhibit non-Gaussian normal diffusion with transient fat (thin) tails in the presence (absence) of phase separation.</description>

      <title>NEAR: A Training-Free Pre-Estimator of Machine Learning Model Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks have been shown to be state-of-the-art machine learning models in a wide variety of applications, including natural language processing and image recognition. However, building a performant neural network is a laborious task and requires substantial computing power. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) addresses this issue by an automatic selection of the optimal network from a set of potential candidates. While many NAS methods still require training of (some) neural networks, zero-cost proxies promise to identify the optimal network without training. In this work, we propose the zero-cost proxy \textit{Network Expressivity by Activation Rank} (NEAR). It is based on the effective rank of the pre- and post-activation matrix, i.e., the values of a neural network layer before and after applying its activation function. We demonstrate the cutting-edge correlation between this network score and the model accuracy on NAS-Bench-101 and NATS-Bench-SSS/TSS. In addition, we present a simple approach to estimate the optimal layer sizes in multi-layer perceptrons. Furthermore, we show that this score can be utilized to select hyperparameters such as the activation function and the neural network weight initialization scheme.</description>
