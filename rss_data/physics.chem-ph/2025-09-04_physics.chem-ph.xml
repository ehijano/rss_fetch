      <title>A perturbative triples correction to relativistic Quadratic Unitary Coupled Cluster Method: Theory, Implementation and Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a perturbative triples correction to the relativistic quadratic unitary coupled cluster singles and doubles (qUCCSD) method, denoted as qUCCSD[T]. The method builds upon the Hermitian structure of the unitary ansatz and employs a many-body perturbation theory framework to consistently include the effects of triple excitations without the need for computationally intensive iterative procedures. Relativistic effects are incorporated using the exact two-component atomic mean-field (X2CAMF) Hamiltonian, and the computational cost is further reduced through the frozen natural spinor (FNS) and Cholesky decomposition (CD) approximations. Benchmark results demonstrate that qUCCSD[T] outperforms previously proposed triples corrections to the unitary coupled cluster method in the clasical computing regime and yields excellent agreement with experimental data and Full CI benchmarks. Specifically, the method shows high accuracy in computing bond dissociation enthalpies, molecular geometries, vibrational frequencies, ionization potentials, and electron affinities of heavy-element-containing systems.</description>

      <title>Exploiting correlations in multi-coincidence Coulomb explosion patterns for differentiating molecular structures using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coulomb explosion imaging (CEI) is a powerful technique for capturing the real-time motion of individual atoms during ultrafast photochemical reactions. CEI generates high-dimensional data with naturally embedded correlations that allow mapping the coordinated motion of nuclei in molecules. This enables reliable separation of competing reaction pathways and makes this approach uniquely suited for characterizing weak reaction channels. However, rich information contained in experimental CEI patterns remains largely underexploited due to challenges in visualizing correlations between multiple observables in multi-dimensional parameter space. Here we present a new approach to CEI of intermediate-sized polyatomic molecules, detecting up to eight ionic fragments in coincidence and leveraging machine-learning-based analysis to identify patterns and correlations in the resulting high-dimensional momentum-space data, enabling robust molecular structure identification and differentiation. Our approach provides high-dimensional background-free data encoding exceptionally rich structural information and establishes an automated, scalable framework for extracting insightful information from the data. As a demonstration, we apply this method to image and distinguish dichloroethylene isomers, showcasing its potential for broader applications in molecular imaging. Our results pave the way for channel-specific analysis of ultrafast structural dynamics in chemically relevant systems, particularly for disentangling mixed reaction pathways and detecting contributions from weak channels and minority species.</description>

      <title>Excitonic description of singlet fission beyond dimer model : a matrix product state approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The importance of singlet fission as a fundamental process with a variety of implications in energy harvesting cannot be overstated. The challenge is in characterizing the energy states of these large singlet fission molecular aggregates that participate in the process. Large dimensionality and essential multi-configuration nature of the electronic states of interest combine to make accurate ab initio calculations prohibitively difficult. We present a spin-resolved tight-binding excitonic model for singlet fission that can be parameterized based on ab initio calculations on monomers and dimers of molecules, and is highly suitable for the study of aggregates using tensor network methods such as the density matrix renormalization group. This tensor network coarse-grained model is demonstrated specifically on the pentacene crystal, where we evaluate the spectra and density of states. We show the natural emergence of bands of states in some cases, and characterize them. Through an analysis of entanglement entropy of the eigenstates, we gain crucial insight into the extent of their multireference character. This method is useful in understanding not just the structure of these extended aggregates, but also being the cornerstone for incorporation of vibronic features and simulation of the singlet fission dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dynamical simulation of chiral induced spin-polarization and magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite generally lacking ferromagnetic properties or strong spin-orbit coupling, electrons in chiral molecules exhibit unique spin-dependent transport behavior, known as chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS). This phenomenon implies a profound connection between chirality and spin, and draws attention to the link between chirality and magnetism. Experiments in recent years have shown that chirality can induce spin-polarizations and magnetizations, providing fresh insights into interpreting chirality-related biochemical processes and designing nano-magnetic devices. In this paper, we present a dynamical theoretical model aimed at elucidating how charge-polarization combined with the CISS leads to spin-polarization and magnetization. Our theoretical model successfully explains the spin-polarization and magnetization observed in three types of experiments, where the charge-polarization is induced in the chiral molecules by the dispersion interaction, gate voltage, and molecular adsorption. The model simulates a clear time evolution process and provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for this field.</description>

      <title>Dynamical theory of chiral-induced spin selectivity in electron donor-chiral molecule-acceptor systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, a phenomenon where the chirality of molecules imparts significant spin selectivity to electron transfer processes, has garnered increasing interest among the chemistry, biology, and physics communities. Although this effect was discovered more than a decade ago, the dynamical process of how electron spin polarization is caused by chiral molecules is still unclear. Here, we propose a dynamical theory of electron transfer in donor-chiral molecule bridge-acceptor systems without electrodes or substrates based on the Lindblad-type master equation. We demonstrate that the molecular spin-orbit coupling generates unequal spin velocities and achieves steady spin polarization with the help of dephasing. Our work elucidates the dynamical process of CISS and may promote the applications of chiral-based spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Spin-to-charge conversion modulated by chiral molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular chirality and electron spin are intricately intertwined via the fascinating phenomenon of chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS), which has garnered considerable attention due to its extensive potential applications. A recent experiment has revealed that chiral molecules self-assembled on the gold surface can modulate the inverse spin Hall effect, providing an alternative platform for studying the interplay between chirality and spin transport. Our study uncovers that this modulation stems from the CISS effect, which enhances spin currents of one spin orientation while suppressing those of the opposite spin orientation. We provide numerical results that are highly consistent with the experimental phenomena and further investigate the influence of various factors on this modulation. This work offers a theoretical explanation of previously unexplained experimental findings, and the underlying physical mechanism broadens current perspectives on understanding and applying CISS.</description>

      <title>Spin-to-charge conversion driven by inverse chiral-induced spin selectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral molecules have attracted significant multidisciplinary interest and extensive research owing to their remarkable ability to achieve charge-to-spin conversion, known as the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS). A recent experiment has revealed that chiral molecules also exhibit an unexpected capability for spin-to-charge conversion, referred to as the inverse CISS (ICISS), opening unprecedented avenues for the study and application of chiral molecules. Here, we propose a specific theoretical explanation, suggesting that ICISS arises from the spin-dependent deflection of electrons caused by the interaction between the spin and chiral structure. Our numerical results are in excellent agreement with experimental observations, demonstrating that ICISS persists under strong disorder. Our model also reproduces the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) in this experiment. Comparative analysis reveals that ICISS employs an unconventional spin-to-charge conversion mechanism distinct from conventional ISHE approaches. We provide a comprehensive explanation of ICISS, elucidate experimental phenomena, and pave the way for organic-based spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular visualization software has long supported research and education in chemical and structural sciences, but consumer devices constrained to 2D inputs and outputs pose two major challenges: they poorly convey 3D nature, and 3D manipulation is very difficult. eXtended Reality (XR, including AR and VR) offers new ways to see and interact with molecules in three dimensions. This chapter presents the "MolecularWeb" ecosystem (https://molecularweb.org), a set of web-based tools for immersive visualization, modeling, and simulations, already widely used in education and science communication and now expanding toward research applications. We cover moleculARweb, which provides AR educational activities via phones, tablets, and computers; MolecularWebXR, a multiuser WebXR platform accessible from both headsets and simpler devices, supporting immersive education, outreach, and scientific discussion; and PDB2AR, which enables users to generate custom content for MolecularWebXR and standalone AR/VR. Finally, we introduce a prototype and an upcoming version of HandMol, our latest WebXR software which allows concurrent multiuser immersive visualization and modeling of molecules with bare hands supported by real-time molecular mechanics, natural language input via a language model, and access through both high-end headsets or consumer devices like smartphones and laptops. Together, these tools demonstrate the present and near-future of accessible, interactive molecular science on the web.</description>

      <title>Multi-Spectroscopic Method to Quantify Rapid Decomposition of an Organophosphate Simulant Using Reactive Materials as a Function of Metal Powder Chemistry and Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of advanced diagnostic systems to measure and optimize emerging energetic material performance is critical for the defeat of Chemical Warfare Agents (CWA). This study presents an integrated multi-spectroscopic approach to monitor the interaction between a CWA simulant, Diisopropyl Methyl Phosphonate (DIMP), and combusting composite metal particles. A custom benchtop Polygonal Rotating Mirror Infrared Spectrometer (PRiMIRS), equipped with a customizable experimental chamber, is employed to observe DIMP decomposition. Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS) is used to measure path-averaged gas temperature profiles during combustion. In the experiment, the chamber is preheated to evaporate liquid DIMP. Various composite metal powders (Al-8Mg):3Zr, (Al-8Mg):Zr, 2(Al-8Mg):Zr, and 4(Al-8Mg):Zr are placed on a stainless steel mount and ignited using 3Al-2Ni sputter-deposited nanolayered foils. The combusting metal particles mix with the DIMP vapor, initiating chemical and thermal interactions. PRiMIRS captures DIMP spectral evolution, while TDLAS simultaneously monitors gas temperature. A spectral defeat parameter was developed to enable quantitative real-time assessment of the DIMP destruction. It uses infrared light absorption by both from DIMP and its immediate decomposition products Isopropyl Methyl Phosphonate (IMP) and Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA). Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) serves as a secondary verification tool quantifying the decomposition products over extended timeframes, and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) confirms the expected metal oxide dispersion within the reaction space. This study reports variability in DIMP defeat as a function of metal powder stoichiometry, metal powder loading, and path-averaged gas temperature profiles, offering critical insights into optimizing reactive materials for effective CWA neutralization.</description>

      <title>Toward an affordable density-based measure for the quality of a coupled cluster calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose two new diagnostics for the degree to which static correlation impacts the quality of a coupled cluster calculation. The first is the change in the Matito static correlation diagnostic $\overline{I_{ND}}$ between CCSD and CCSD(T), $\Delta I_{ND}[\textrm{(T)}]=\overline{I_{ND}}[\textrm{CCSD(T)}]-\overline{I_{ND}}[\textrm{CCSD}]$. The second is the ratio of the same and of the corresponding change in the total correlation diagnostic $\overline{I_{T}}=\overline{I_{ND}}+\overline{I_{D}}$, i.e., $r_I[(T)]=\Delta I_{ND}[\textrm{(T)}]/\Delta I_{T}[\textrm{(T)}]$. The first diagnostic can be extended to higher-order improvements in the wave function, e.g., $\Delta I_{ND}[\textrm{(Q)}]=\overline{I_{ND}}[\textrm{CCSDT(Q)}]-\overline{I_{ND}}[\textrm{CCSDT}]$. In general, a small $\Delta I_{ND}$[\textrm{level$_1$}] value indicates that at this level$_1$ of theory, the density is converged and any further changes to the energy come from dynamical correlation, while larger $\Delta I_{ND}$[\textrm{level$_2$}] indicates that the density is still not converged at level$_2$ and some static correlation remains. $r_I[(T)]$ is found to be a moderately good predictor for the importance of post-CCSD(T) correlation effects.</description>

      <title>Low-rank matrix and tensor approximations: advancing efficiency of machine-learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become a mainstay in computationally-guided materials science, surpassing traditional force fields due to their flexible functional form and superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties of materials. This flexibility is achieved through mathematically-rigorous basis sets that describe interatomic interactions within a local atomic environment. The number of parameters in these basis sets influences both the size of the training dataset required and the computational speed of the MLIP. Consequently, compressing MLIPs by reducing the number of parameters is a promising route to more efficient simulations. In this work, we use low-rank matrix and tensor factorizations under fixed-rank constraints to achieve this compression. In addition, we demonstrate that an algorithm with automatic rank augmentation helps to find a deeper local minimum of the fitted potential. The methodology is verified using the Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) model and benchmarked on multi-component systems: a Mo-Nb-Ta-W medium-entropy alloy, molten LiF-NaF-KF, and a glycine molecular crystal. The proposed approach achieves up to 50% compression without any loss of MTP accuracy and can be applied to compress other MLIPs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing non-Hermitian Floquet theory, the strong-field process of high harmonic (HH) generation by a classical continuous-wave field irradiating ground-state atom is discovered to be controllable by placing the irradiated atom inside a single-mode quantum cavity initiated even with a single photon. Judicious cavity coupling of cavity-free photo-induced atomic Floquet states forms polaritonic Floquet states that generate side harmonics around the (standard no-cavity) odd harmonics. The different possible cavity-controlled HH spectra, including also the ones resulting from several cavities in a row, enable attosecond-pulse sequences different from the one produced without a cavity. Moreover, the present study sets the framework and opens the way for further cavity control over the HH generation process as well as over other strong-field processes</description>

      <title>Alchemical diastereomers from antisymmetric alchemical perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16409v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The energy difference between two iso-electronic systems can be accurately approximated by the alchemical first order Hellmann-Feynmann derivative for the averaged Hamiltonian. This approximation is exact up to third order because even-order contributions cancel out. This finding holds for any iso-electronic compound pair (dubbed `alchemical diastereomers'), regardless of differences in configuration, composition, or energy, and consequently, relative energy estimates for all possible iso-electronic alchemical diastereomer pairs, require only O(1) self-consistent field cycles for any given averaging reference Hamiltonian. We discuss the relation to the Verlet algorithm, alchemical harmonic approximation (AHA) [J. Chem. Phys. 162, 044101 (2025)], relative properties such as forces, ionization potential or electron affinities, and Levy's formula for relative energies among iso-electronic systems that uses the averaged electron density of the two systems [J. Chem. Phys. 70, 1573 (1979)]. Numerical estimates accurately reflect trends in the charge-neutral iso-electronic diatomic molecule series with 14 protons (N$_2$, CO, BF, BeNe, LiNa, HeMg, HAl), with systematically increasing errors. Using alchemical Hellmann-Feynman derivatives for toluene, we demonstrate the concept's broader applicability by estimating relative energies for all 36 possible alchemical diastereomer pairs from vertical iso-electronic charge-neutral antisymmetric BN doping of toluene's aromatic ring, with mean absolute errors of a few milli-Hartrees.</description>

      <title>Incorporation of Internal Coordinates Interpolation into the Freezing String Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an improved method for determining guess structures for transition state searches by incorporating internal coordinates interpolation into the freezing string method (FSM). We test our method on over 40 reactions across 3 benchmark datasets covering a diverse set of chemical reactions. Our results show that incorporation of internal coordinates interpolation improves the reliability of the FSM, enabling larger interpolation step sizes and fewer optimization steps per cycle, which together yield nearly a 50\% reduction in computational cost while maintaining a 100\% success rate on benchmark chemical reaction test cases, including systems where previous attempts based on linear synchronous transit interpolation have failed. We provide an open-source Python implementation of the FSM, in addition to the reactant, product, and transition state structures of all reactions studied.</description>

      <title>Cavity Born-Oppenheimer Coupled Cluster Theory: Towards Electron Correlation in the Vibrational Strong Light-Matter Coupling Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed derivation and discussion of cavity Born-Oppenheimer coupled cluster (CBO-CC) theory and address cavity-modified electron correlation in the vibrational strong coupling regime. Methodologically, we combine the recently proposed cavity reaction potential (CRP) approach with the Lagrangian formulation of CC theory and derive a self-consistent CRP-CC method at the singles and doubles excitations level (CRP-CCSD). The CRP-CC approach is formally similar to implicit solvation CC models and provides access to the CBO-CC electronic ground state energy minimized in cavity coordinate space on a CC level of theory. A hierarchy of linearisation schemes (lCRP-CCSD) similar to canonical CC theory systematically lifts the self-consistent nature of the CRP-CCSD approach and mitigates numerical cost by approximating electron correlation effects in energy minimization. We provide a thorough comparison of CRP-CCSD, lCRP-CCSD and CRP-Hartee-Fock methods for a cavity-modified Menshutkin reaction, pyridine$+$CH$_3$Br, and cavity-induced collective electronic effects in microsolvation energies of selected methanol-water clusters. We find lCRP-CCSD methods to provide excellent results compared to the self-consistent CRP-CCSD approach in the few-molecule limit. We furthermore observe significant differences between mean-field and correlated results in both reactive and collective scenarios. Our work emphasizes the non-trivial character of electron correlation under vibrational strong coupling and provides a starting point for further developments in ab initio vibro-polaritonic chemistry beyond the mean-field approximation.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Aqueous Medium on Nucleobase Shape Resonances: Insights from Microsolvation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied the effect of microhydration on the shape resonances of uracil nucleobase. The resonance parameters were determined using the resonance via Pad\'e approach along with the efficient wave function-based EA-EOM-DLPNO-CCSD method. Our results showed that the uracil resonances become stabilized with an increase in the extent of microsolvation. The energy of the resonances decreased, and the lifetime increased as the number of water molecules surrounding uracil was increased. It showed that ten water molecules are sufficient to make the lowest shape resonance of uracil a bound radical anionic state. Our results also indicate that the lowest energy resonance state may become a bound state under bulk solvation.</description>
