      <title>Discrete Action, Graph Evolution, and the Hierarchy of Symmetries: A Rigorous Construction of Temporal Layers $C1 \to C2 \to C3 \to C4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Postulating a minimal discrete quantum of action $S=\hbar$ and a simple rule for the growth of an oriented graph, we construct a strict hierarchy of temporal layers $C N$ with discrete periods $\tau_N=N\hbar/E$. Each layer is specified by its configuration space, symplectic structure, update rule, and emergent symmetry. At $C1$ the state is represented by a single oriented edge with $U(1)$ phase $e^{i E t/\hbar}$. The transition $C1 \to C2$ splits the edge into two independent flows, which yields canonical pairs $(x_a,p_a)$, local $U(1)$ invariance, and an effective $(2{+}1)$ metric with signature $(+--)$. The closure $C2 \to C3$ produces $SU(3)$ connections and an Einstein-Yang-Mills type action. We show that these structures follow from discrete-action principles, and that stochastic graph growth naturally provides mechanisms for decoherence and spontaneous symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Local Quantum Mechanical Prediction of the Singlet State Using Geometric Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We deduce the quantum mechanical prediction of $-{\bf a}\cdot{\bf b}$ for the singlet spin state employing local measurement functions following Bell's approach. This result represents the quantum mechanical expectation value for the joint measurement of spin projections in the singlet state. And is equal to the negative cosine of the angle between vectors {\bf a} and {\bf b}. Our derivation is corroborated through a computational simulation conducted in the Mathematica programming environment using geometric algebra.</description>

      <title>Stationary multiple euclidon solutions to the vacuum Einstein equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-linear superposition of the stationary euclidon solution with an arbitrary axially symmetric stationary gravitational field on the basis of the method of variation of parameters was constructed. Stationary soliton solution of the Einstein equations was generalized to the case of a stationary seed metric. The formulae obtained have a simple and compact form, permitting an effective non-linear "addition" of the solutions. These euclidon solutions serve as building block of the theory, which allows for the construction of almost all known solutions to the vacuum static axially-symmetric Einstein equations, including such important ones as the Kerr-NUT solution. The stationary euclidon solution has a clear physical interpretation as a relativistic accelerated non-inertial reference frame, which provides a different perspective on the physical interpretation of well-known solutions, such as the Kerr solution.</description>

      <title>Exponentially accelerated mirrors as a physical realization of the kappa plane-wave vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The kappa plane-wave vacuum is a family of kinematically defined quantum states whose thermal properties are well understood, but whose physical origin has remained obscure. In this paper we provide a concrete dynamical realization of this vacuum, showing that it is physically and operationally equivalent to the quantum state produced on future null infinity by a mirror following the Carlitz-Willey (CW) trajectory. The equivalence is established through a three-pronged analysis: we demonstrate that the two constructions share identical Bogoliubov squeeze parameters, identical nonlocal thermal kernels in their Wightman functions, and identical Planckian responses of an Unruh-DeWitt detector. This result anchors an abstract kinematic construction in a well-understood dynamical model, identifying the parameter $\kappa$ with the physical scale that governs the Carlitz-Willey trajectory. In the final part of the paper we characterize, within the moving-mirror framework, the complete class of mirror trajectories that reproduce the same asymptotic thermal kernel on $\mathscr I^+_R$, and show that only the purely exponential CW trajectory generates a constant, stationary flux.</description>

      <title>Antisymmetric SU(2) adjoint generator as the universal origin of geometric phases in quantum two-level systems and classical polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish that the antisymmetric part of the adjoint SU(2) generator serves as the universal algebraic origin of geometric phases across classical polarization optics and quantum two-level systems. For classical ideal retarders, we demonstrate that the antisymmetric block of the Mueller matrix exclusively determines the geometric phase, encoding the angular-velocity pseudovector governing Stokes-vector evolution on the Poincar\'e sphere. Remarkably, the symmetric component is geometrically neutral. Quantum mechanically, the identical antisymmetric generator emerges in the adjoint SU(2) action on the Bloch sphere and fully governs the geometric phase of pure qubit states, independent of adiabaticity or cyclicity. This unified framework provides direct operational access to geometric phases via measured Mueller matrices or quantum process tomography, enabling precise control and diagnosis of geometric effects in both classical and quantum domains.</description>
