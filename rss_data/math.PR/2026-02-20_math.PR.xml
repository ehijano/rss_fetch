      <title>Ray-Knight theorems for the local times of rebirthed Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove generalizations of the first and second Ray-Knight theorems, for a large class of non-symmetric strong Markov processes. These results link the local times of the Markov process with the squares of associated Gaussian processes. This connection allows us to establish results about the exact modulus of continuity (in the spatial variable) of the local times. Our approach is different from earlier treatments which were based on associated permanental processes rather than Gaussian processes.
  The type of process with which we work can be described as follows. Start with a symmetric Markov process with finite lifetime; upon its death resurrect it at a place in the state space chosen at random, independent of the past. Continue in this way, resurrecting at each death, to obtain a recurrent process. The rebirthing procedure destroys the symmetry of the original process, leading to a large class of non-symmetric processes.
  The main results are illustrated by many examples.</description>

      <title>Overdamped limits for Langevin dynamics with position-dependent coefficients via $L^2$-hypocoercivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note provides a simple derivation of the overdamped approximation for kinetic (or underdamped) equilibrium Langevin dynamics, in cases where certain coefficients depend on the position variable. The equivalent small-mass limit of these dynamics, known as the Kramers--Smoluchowski approximation, in the case of a state-dependent friction coefficient, has been previously studied by a variety of approaches. Our new approach uses hypocoercivity estimates, which may be of interest in their own right, and lead to a very direct derivation, providing in particular a clear explanation of the ``noise-induced drift'' term in the overdamped equation in the case of a state-dependent friction term. Using the same approach, we also treat several effective kinetic dynamical models derived from a coarse-graining approximation of a high-dimensional system, as well as a class of kinetic dynamics with position-dependent mass matrices. All of these models are relevant to applications in computational chemistry. We finally identify a mistake in a related work and suggest a solution.</description>

      <title>Once-excited random walks on general trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study once-excited random walks on general trees, modeled by placing a single "cookie" at each vertex. Each cookie acts as a metaphorical reward that is consumed upon the first visit to the vertex where the cookie is placed. On that initial visit, the walk is in an excited state and behaves like a biased random walk. Once the cookie is consumed, the process reverts to a symmetric random walk on all subsequent visits. We consider a random environment in which the bias parameters are independent random variables. We prove that the process exhibits a sharp phase transition between transience and recurrence on general trees with polynomial growth, where the critical threshold is determined by the branching-ruin number of the tree.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorem for linear eigenvalue statistics of random geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random spatial networks-that is, graphs whose connectivity is governed by geometric proximity-have emerged as fundamental models for systems constrained by an underlying spatial structure. A prototypical example is the random geometric graph, obtained by placing vertices according to a Poisson point process and connecting two vertices whenever their Euclidean distance is less than a certain threshold. Despite their broad applicability, the spectral properties of such spatial models remain far less understood than those of classical random graph models, such as Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs and Wigner matrices. The main obstacle is the presence of spatial constraints, which induce highly nontrivial dependencies among edges, placing these models outside the scope of techniques developed for purely combinatorial random graphs.
  In this paper, we provide the first rigorous analysis of Gaussian fluctuations for linear eigenvalue statistics of random geometric graphs. Specifically, we establish central limit theorems for $\text{Tr}[\phi(A)]$, where $A$ is the adjacency matrix and $\phi$ ranges over a broad class of suitable (possibly non-polynomial) test functions. In the polynomial setting, we moreover obtain a quantitative central limit theorem, including an explicit convergence rate to the limiting Gaussian law. We further obtain polynomial-test-function CLTs for other canonical random spatial networks, including $k$-nearest neighbor graphs and relative neighborhood graphs. Our results open new avenues for the study of spectral fluctuations in spatially embedded random structures and underscore the delicate interplay between geometry, local dependence, and spectral behavior.</description>

      <title>Diffusive Scaling Limits of Forward Event-Chain Monte Carlo: Provably Efficient Exploration with Partial Refreshment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piecewise deterministic Markov process samplers are attractive alternatives to Metropolis--Hastings algorithms. A central design question is how to incorporate partial velocity refreshment to ensure ergodicity without injecting excessive noise. Forward Event-Chain Monte Carlo (FECMC) is a generalization of the Bouncy Particle Sampler (BPS) that addresses this issue through a stochastic reflection mechanism, thereby reducing reliance on global refreshment moves. Despite promising empirical performance, its theoretical efficiency remains largely unexplored.
  We develop a high-dimensional scaling analysis for standard Gaussian targets and prove that the negative log-density (or potential) process of FECMC converges to an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck diffusion, under the same scaling as BPS. We derive closed-form expressions for the limiting diffusion coefficients of both methods by analyzing their associated radial momentum processes and solving the corresponding Poisson equations. These expressions yield a sharp efficiency comparison: the diffusion coefficient of FECMC is strictly larger than that of optimally tuned BPS, and the optimum for FECMC is attained at zero global refreshment. Specifically, they imply an approximately eightfold increase in effective sample size per event over optimal BPS. Numerical experiments confirm the predicted diffusion coefficients and show that the resulting efficiency gains remain substantial for a range of non-Gaussian targets. Finally, as an application of these results, we propose an asymptotic variance estimator for Piecewise deterministic Markov processes that becomes increasingly efficient in high dimensions by extracting information from the velocity variable.</description>

Abstract: One standard way to prove existence for deterministic, highly nonlinear PDEs is to use the Schauder-Tychonoff fixed-point theorem. In what follows, we introduce and verify a stochastic variant of the Schauder-Tychonoff theorem.

      <title>Limiting Behavior of Degree-Degree Metrics under Local Convergence in Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the limiting behaviour of degree-degree correlation metrics for sequences of random graphs under a general assumption of local convergence in probability. We establish convergence results for Pearson's correlation coefficient r, Spearman's rho, Kendall's tau, average nearest neighbour degree (ANND), and average nearest neighbour rank (ANNR). Our results explicitly show how the limits of these degree-degree correlation metrics depend on the local structure of the graph. We then apply our general results to study degree-degree correlations in rank-1 inhomogeneous random graphs and random geometric graphs, deriving explicit expressions for ANND in both models and for Pearson's correlation coefficient in the latter one.

      <title>Hyper-contractivity and entropy decay in discrete time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a measure-preserving transition kernel $T$ on an arbitrary probability space $(\mathbb X,\mathcal cA,\pi)$. In this level of generality, we prove that a one-step hyper-contractivity estimate of the form $\|T\|_{p\to q}\le 1$ with $p&lt; q$ implies a one-step entropy contraction estimate of the form ${\mathrm H}(\mu T\,|\,\pi)\le \theta\, {\mathrm H}(\mu\,|\,\pi)$, with $\theta=p/q$. Neither reversibility, nor any sort of regularity is required. This static implication is simultaneously simpler and stronger than the celebrated dynamic relation between exponential hyper-contractivity and exponential entropy decay along continuous-time Markov semi-groups.</description>

      <title>Quenched large deviations for randomly weighted geodesic random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider weighted geodesic random walks in a complete Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$. We show that for almost all sequences of weights (with respect to a suitable measure), these weighted geodesic random walks satisfy, when suitably scaled, a large deviation principle with a universal rate function. This extends the results from [3], where this was shown for the real-valued case. It turns out the argument is also valid for general vector spaces. This allows us to use the methodology of [9], in which large deviations for geodesic random walks are obtained from large deviation estimates for associated random walks in tangent spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stochastic homogenization of a class of turbulent diffusions generated by non-local symmetric L\'evy operators with divergence-free drift fields in ergodic random environments, where neither the drift fields nor their associated stream functions are assumed to be bounded. A pivotal step in our proof is the establishment of $W_{loc}^{1,q}$ estimates with $q\in (1,2)$ for the corresponding correctors, under mild prior regularity conditions imposed on the L\'evy measure and the stream function.</description>

      <title>Variance renormalisation in regularity structures -- the case of $2d$ gPAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the variance renormalisation of a singular SPDE for which a Da Prato-Debussche trick is not applicable. The example taken is the $2$-dimensional generalised parabolic Anderson model (gPAM), driven by a much rougher than white noise, necessitating both a multiplicative and an additive renormalisation. To handle the discrepancy between the regularity structures of the approximate and the limiting equations, we consider models that lift $0$ noises to nontrivial models, in analogy with ``pure area'' from rough paths. The convergence to such a model is shown for the BPHZ model over the vanishing noise via graphical computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the main algebraic assumption required to perform a fixed point argument for rough differential equations implies the algebraic assumption for the Bailleul flow approach. This assumption requires that the rough path associated with the equation is given by a Hopf algebra whose coproduct admits a cocycle and has a tree-like basis. We show that the Hopf algebra of multi-indices does not satisfy the cocycle condition. This is a rigorous result on the impossibility, observed in practice, of performing a fixed point argument for multi-indices rough paths and multi-indices in Regularity Structures.</description>

      <title>An Allen-Cahn equation with jump-diffusion noise for biological damage and repair processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a stochastic Allen--Cahn equation for the dynamics of biomolecular damage and repair. The system is driven by two distinct noise processes: a multiplicative cylindrical Wiener process, modeling continuous background stochastic fluctuations, and a jump-type noise, modeling the abrupt, localized damage induced by external shocks. The drift of the equation is singular and covers the typical logarithmic Flory-Huggins potential required in phase-separation dynamics. We prove well-posedness of the model in a strong probabilistic sense, and analyze its long-time behavior in terms of existence and uniqueness of invariant measures, ergodicity, and mixing properties. Eventually, we present an Euler--Maruyama scheme to simulate the model and illustrate how it captures fundamental biological phenomena, such as damage clustering, stress-induced topology perturbations, and damage dynamics.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium functional inequalities for finite Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional inequalities such as the Poincar\'e and log-Sobolev inequalities quantify convergence to equilibrium in continuous-time Markov chains by linking generator properties to variance and entropy decay. However, many applications, including multiscale and non-reversible dynamics, require analysing probability measures that are not at equilibrium, where the classical theory tied to steady states no longer applies. We introduce generalised versions of these inequalities for arbitrary positive measures on a finite state space, retaining key structural properties of their classical counterparts. In particular, we prove continuity of the associated constants with respect to the reference measure and establish explicit positive lower bounds. As an application, we derive quantitative coarse-graining error estimates for non-reversible Markov chains, both with and without explicit scale separation, and propose a quantitative criterion for assessing the quality of coarse-graining maps.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the point process of the eigenvalues of real or complex non-Hermitian matrices $X$ with independent, identically distributed entries is hyperuniform: the variance of the number of eigenvalues in a subdomain $\Omega$ of the spectrum is much smaller than the volume of $\Omega$. Our main technical novelty is a very precise computation of the covariance between the resolvents of the Hermitization of $X-z_1, X-z_2$, for two distinct complex parameters $z_1,z_2$.</description>

      <title>Spectral boundaries of deterministic matrices deformed by rotationally invariant random non-Hermitian ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the great miracles of random matrix theory is that, in the $N \to \infty$ limit, many otherwise intractable matrix problems with horrendously complicated finite-$N$ expressions admit remarkably simple and elegant asymptotic solutions. In this paper, we illustrate this phenomenon in the context of spectral boundaries (or spectral edges) for deformed random matrices. Specifically, we consider matrices of the form $\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}$, where $\mathbf{A}$ is a deterministic $N\times N$ matrix (not necessarily Hermitian) and $\mathbf{B}$ is a rotationally invariant random matrix. In the large-$N$ limit, we show that the complex eigenvalue distribution of $\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}$ satisfies remarkably simple boundary equations that depend on the $\mathcal{R}_1$ and $\mathcal{R}_2$ transforms of $\mathbf{B}$. We illustrate our results on several explicit random matrix ensembles and support them with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Aborting Schemes for Quantum Error Correction Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation. Current QEC controllers execute all scheduled syndrome (parity-bit) measurement rounds before decoding, even when early syndrome data indicates that the run will result in an error. The resulting excess measurements increase the decoder's workload and system latency. To address this, we introduce an adaptive abort module that simultaneously reduces decoder overhead and suppresses logical error rates in surface codes and color codes under an existing QEC controller. The key idea is that initial syndrome information allows the controller to terminate risky shots early before additional resources are spent. An effective scheme balances the cost of further measurement against the restart cost and thus increases decoder efficiency.
  Adaptive abort schemes dynamically adjust the number of syndrome measurement rounds per shot using real-time syndrome information. We consider three schemes: fixed-depth (FD) decoding (the standard non-adaptive approach used in current state-of-the-art QEC controllers), and two adaptive schemes, AdAbort and One-Step Lookahead (OSLA) decoding. For surface and color codes under a realistic circuit-level depolarizing noise model, AdAbort substantially outperforms both OSLA and FD, yielding higher decoder efficiency across a broad range of code distances. Numerically, as the code distance increases from 5 to 15, AdAbort yields an improvement that increases from 5% to 35% for surface codes and from 7% to 60% for color codes.
  To our knowledge, these are the first adaptive abort schemes considered for QEC. Our results highlight the potential importance of abort rules for increasing efficiency as we scale to large, resource-intensive quantum architectures.</description>

      <title>Complex Moments, Gamma and Riemann Zeta Functions unified by the Parabolic Mellin Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified integral framework based on the Fourier-Laplace transform evaluated along a vertical line in the complex plane. By identifying the moment-generating function (MGF) of a random variable with the weights of these integrals, we first establish a general expression for complex fractional moments valid for any random variable with a MGF. Applying this formula to the Gaussian distribution, we recover a global integral representation for the reciprocal Gamma function that unifies it with its reflection. We formalize the underlying operator as the Parabolic Mellin Transform, a holomorphic alternative to the classical Mellin transform that avoids strips of convergence by mapping the vertical line to a parabolic contour. This general framework leads to new meromorphic representations for the Hurwitz and Riemann zeta functions that are valid throughout the critical strip, as well as reformulations of the Riemann hypothesis and the Lindelof hypothesis.</description>

      <title>ARCANE: Scalable high-degree cubature formulae for simulating SDEs without Monte Carlo error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo sampling is the standard approach for estimating properties of solutions to stochastic differential equations (SDEs), but accurate estimates require huge sample sizes. Lyons and Victoir (2004) proposed replacing independently sampled Brownian driving paths with "cubature formulae", deterministic weighted sets of paths that match Brownian "signature moments" up to some degree $D$. They prove that cubature formulae exist for arbitrary $D$, but explicit constructions are difficult and have only reached $D=7$, too small for practical use. We present ARCANE, an algorithm that efficiently and automatically constructs cubature formulae of arbitrary degree. It reproduces the state of the art in seconds and reaches $\boldsymbol{D=19}$ within hours on modest hardware. In simulations across multiple different SDEs and error metrics, our cubature formulae robustly achieve an error orders of magnitude smaller than Monte Carlo with the same number of paths.</description>

Abstract: The paper presents a geometric duality between the spherical squared-Hellinger distance and a hyperbolic isometric invariant of the Poincare disc under the action of the general Mobius group. Motivated by the geometric connection, we propose the usage of the L2-embedded hyperbolic isometric invariant as an alternative way to quantify divergence between Gaussian measures as a contribution to information theory.</description>

      <title>Smoothing on $L^1$ for ground state transformed semigroups in non-local settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $L^1$-smoothing properties for a broad class of semigroups arising from the ground state transformation of Schr\"odinger semigroups with confining potentials associated with non-local L\'evy operators, for which (asymptotic) ultracontractivity and hypercontractivity fail. Our work is inspired by Talagrand's convolution conjecture in the discrete cube setting, as well as by subsequent developments on the classical Ornstein--Uhlenbeck semigroup. The estimates we provide exhibit a clear dependence on the potential and the L\'evy measure defining the kinetic term operator, and they yield a description of the semigroups' action on $L^1$ in terms of Orlicz spaces. Our framework is quite general, encompassing fractional and relativistic Laplacians as kinetic operators. The results are illustrated by numerous examples demonstrating that the $L^1$-regularizing effects become stronger as $t \uparrow \infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an $n$-species $t$-PushTASEP, an integrable long-range stochastic process, on a one-dimensional periodic lattice with inhomogeneities $x_1,\ldots,x_L$ and arbitrary capacity $l$ at each lattice site. The Markov matrix is identified with an alternating sum of commuting transfer matrices over all fundamental representations of $U_t(\widehat{sl}_{n+1})$. Stationary probabilities are expressed in a matrix product form involving a fusion of quantized corner transfer matrices for the strange five-vertex model introduced by Okado, Scrimshaw, and the second author. The resulting partition function, which serves as the normalization factor of the stationary probabilities, is obtained from the $l=1$ case by a finite plethystic substitution of length $l$.</description>

      <title>The optimal hypercontractive constants for $\mathbb{Z}_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We resolve a folklore problem for the optimal hypercontractive constant of the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_3$ for all $1 &lt; p &lt; q &lt; \infty$. Precisely, the optimal hypercontractive constant is given by \[ r_{p,q}(\mathbb{Z}_3) = \frac{(1 + 2x)(1 - y)}{(1 + 2y)(1 - x)}, \] where $(x,y)$ is the $\textit{unique}$ solution in the open unit square $(0,1)\times (0,1)$ to the system of equations \begin{align*} \left\{ \begin{aligned} &amp;\frac{1}{1+2x}\Big(\frac{1+2x^p}{3}\Big)^{\frac{1}{p}}=\frac{1}{1+2y}\Big(\frac{1+2y^q}{3}\Big)^{\frac{1}{q}},\\ &amp;\frac{(1-x)(1-x^{p-1})}{1+2x^p}=\frac{(1-y)(1-y^{q-1})}{1+2y^q}. \end{aligned} \right. \end{align*} One feature of our formalism is that the system simultaneously determines the optimal hypercontractive constant and a nontrivial extremizer. As a consequence of our main result, for rational $p, q\in \mathbb{Q}$, the constants $r_{p,q}(\mathbb{Z}_3)$ are algebraic numbers whose minimal polynomials are generally rather complicated, with non-solvable Galois groups and therefore no explicit radical expressions.</description>

Abstract: We present and study an explicit exponential integrator for parabolic SPDEs in any dimension driven by a Gaussian noise which is white in time and with spatial correlation given by a Riesz kernel. Under assumptions on the coefficients of the SPDE, we prove strong error bounds and exhibit how the rate of convergence depends on the exponent in the Riesz kernel. Finally, numerical experiments in spatial dimensions $1$ and $2$ are provided in order to confirm our convergence results.</description>

Abstract: We prove that whenever $d=d(n)\to\infty$ and $n-d\to\infty$ as $n\to\infty$, then with high probability for any non-trivial initial colouring, the colour refinement algorithm distinguishes all vertices of the random regular graph $\mathcal{G}_{n,d}$. This, in particular, implies that with high probability $\mathcal{G}_{n,d}$ admits a canonical labelling computable in time $O(\min\{n^{\omega},nd^2+nd\log n\})$, where $\omega&lt;2.372$ is the matrix multiplication exponent.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of stochastic Volterra integral equations with completely monotone kernels and stochastic differential equations on Hilbert spaces with unbounded control and diffusion operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamic programming approach is one of the most powerful ones in optimal control. However, when dealing with optimal control problems of stochastic Volterra integral equations (SVIEs) with completely monotone kernels, deep mathematical difficulties arise and it is still not understood. These very classical problems have applications in most fields and have now become even more popular due to their applications in mathematical finance under rough volatility. In this article, we consider a class of optimal control problems of SVIEs with completely monotone kernels. Via a recent Markovian lift \cite{FGW2024}, the problem can be reformulated as an optimal control problem of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) on suitable Hilbert spaces, which due to the roughness of the kernel, presents a generator of an analytic semigroup and unbounded control and diffusion operators.
  This analysis leads us to study a general class of optimal control problems of abstract SDEs on Hilbert spaces with unbounded control and diffusion operators. This class includes optimal control problems of SVIEs with completely monotone kernels, but it is also motivated by other models. We analyze the regularity of the associated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck transition semigroup. We prove that the semigroup exhibits a new smoothing property in control directions through a general observation operator $\Gamma$, which we call $\Gamma$-smoothing. This allows us to establish existence and uniqueness of mild solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, establish a verification theorem, and construct optimal feedback controls. We apply these results to optimal control problems of SVIEs with completely monotone kernels. To the best of our knowledge these are the first results of this kind for this abstract class of infinite dimensional problems and for the optimal control of SVIEs with completely monotone kernels.</description>

      <title>On the Limit of the Tridiagonal Model for $\beta$-Dyson Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01633v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous work, a description of the result of applying the Householder tridiagonalization algorithm to a G$\beta$E random matrix is provided by Edelman and Dumitriu. The resulting tridiagonal ensemble makes sense for all $\beta&gt;0$, and has spectrum given by the $\beta$-ensemble for all $\beta&gt;0$. Moreover, the tridiagonal model has useful stochastic operator limits which was introduced and analyzed in subsequent studies.
  In this work, we analogously study the result of applying the Householder tridiagonalization algorithm to a G$\beta$E process which has eigenvalues governed by $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motion. We propose an explicit limit of the upper left $k \times k$ minor of the $n \times n$ tridiagonal process as $n \to \infty$ and $k$ remains fixed. We prove the result for $\beta=1$, and also provide numerical evidence for $\beta=1,2,4$. This leads us to conjecture the form of a dynamical $\beta$-stochastic Airy operator with smallest $k$ eigenvalues evolving according to the $n \to \infty$ limit of the largest, centered and re-scaled, $k$ eigenvalues of $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motion.</description>

Abstract: We study the derivative-free global optimization algorithm Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO), establishing uniform-in-time propagation of chaos as well as an almost uniform-in-time stability result for the microscopic particle system. Moreover, we prove almost sure exponential convergence of the microscopic CBO system around a point close to the global minimizer. The proof of these results is based on a novel stability estimate for the weighted mean and on a quantitative concentration inequality for the microscopic particle system around the empirical mean. Our propagation of chaos result recovers the classical Monte Carlo rate, with a prefactor that depends explicitly on the parameters of the problem. Notably, in the case of CBO with anisotropic noise, this prefactor is independent of the problem dimension.</description>

      <title>A central limit theorem for a generalization of the Ewens measure to random tuples of commuting permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a central limit theorem (CLT) for the number of joint orbits of random tuples of commuting permutations. In the uniform sampling case this generalizes the classic CLT of Goncharov for the number of cycles of a single random permutation. We also consider the case where tuples are weighted by a factor other than one, per joint orbit. We view this as an analogue of the Ewens measure, for tuples of commuting permutations, where our CLT generalizes the CLT by Hansen. Our proof uses saddle point analysis, in a context related to the Hardy-Ramanujan asymptotics and the theorem of Meinardus, but concerns a multiple pole situation. The proof is written in a self-contained manner, and hopefully in a manner accessible to a wider audience. We also indicate several open directions of further study related to probability, combinatorics, number theory, an elusive theory of random commuting matrices, and perhaps also geometric group theory.</description>

      <title>Contact process with viral load</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04768v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we present two novel variants of the contact process. In the first variant individuals carry a viral load. An individual with viral load zero is classified as healthy and otherwise infected. If an individual becomes infected it begins with a viral load of one, which then evolves according to a Birth-Death process. In this model, viral load indicates severity of the infection such that individuals with a higher load can be more infectious. Moreover, the recovery times of individual is not necessarily exponentially distributed and can even be chosen to follow a power-law distribution. In the second variant individuals are permanently infected albeit in two states: actively infected or dormant. The dynamics of these individual states are again governed by a Birth-Death process. Dormant infections do not interact with neighbouring individuals but may reactivate spontaneously. Active infections reactivate dormant neighbours at a constant rate and may become dormant themselves.
  We present for both variants a Poisson construction. For the first model, we study the phase transition of survival and discuss existence of a non-trivial upper invariant law. Additionally, we derive a duality relationship between the two variant, which we use to uncover a phase transition regarding invariant distributions in the second variant.</description>

      <title>Invertibility for non-Hermitian and symmetric random band matrices with sublinear bandwidth and discrete entries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A well-known result in random matrix theory, proven by Kahn, Koml\'os and Szemer\'edi in 1995, states that a square random matrix with i.i.d. uniform $\{\pm 1\}$ entries is invertible with probability $1-\exp(-\Omega(n))$. As a natural generalization of the model, we consider the invertibility of a class of random band matrices with independent entries where the bandwidth $d_n$ scales like $n^\alpha$, for some $\alpha\in(0,1)$. The band matrix model we consider is sufficiently general and covers existing models such as the block band matrix and periodic band matrix, allowing great flexibility in the variance profile. As the bandwidth is sublinear in the dimension, estimating the invertibility and least singular values of these matrices is a well-known open problem. We make progress towards the invertibility problem by showing that, when $\alpha&gt;\frac{2}{3}$ and when the random variables are i.i.d. uniformly distributed on $\{\pm 1+c\}$ for any fixed integer $c$, then the band matrix is invertible with probability $1-\exp(-\Omega(n^{\alpha/2}))$. Previously, even invertibility with probability $1-o(1)$ was not known for these band matrix models except in the very special case of block band matrices.
  We then extend the invertibility result to symmetric random band matrices with integer entries, and prove the same non-singularity probability estimate whenever $\alpha&gt;\frac{2}{3}$.</description>

      <title>On a Roll Again: Analysis of a Dice Removal Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose we have $n$ dice, each with $s$ faces (assume $s\geq n$). On the first turn, roll all of them, and remove from play those that rolled an $n$. Roll all of the remaining dice. In general, if at a certain turn you are left with $k$ dice, roll all of them and remove from play those that rolled a $k$. The game ends when you are left with no dice to roll. For $n,s \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$ such that $s \geq n$, let $Y_n^s$ be the random variable for the number of turns to finish the game rolling $n$ dice with $s$ faces. We find recursive and non-recursive solutions for $\mathbb{E}(Y_n^{s})$ and $\mathrm{Var}(Y_n^{s})$, and bounds for both values. Moreover, we show that $Y_n^{s}$ can also be modeled as the maximum of a sequence of i.i.d. geometrically distributed random variables. Although, as far as we know, this game hasn't been studied before, similar problems have.</description>

      <title>A probabilistic journey through the Newton-Girard identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a pedagogical probabilistic exploration of the Newton-Girard identities. We show that the coefficients in these classical relations between power sums and elementary symmetric polynomials can be interpreted as the stable limits of integrals over the unit cube, and as ratios of moments of simple probability distributions. Several classes of integrals are studied, including trigonometric and multiplicative forms. In addition, we discuss the spectral implications via the Le Verrier-Souriau-Faddeev algorithm and Random Matrix Theory, providing a unified framework for the asymptotic algebraic behavior of these identities. While the identities are classical, the probabilistic interpretation of the limits of their normalized forms is the specific focus of the present work.</description>

      <title>How fast does the range of simple random walk grow?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a discrete-time simple random walk $(X_t)_{t\ge 0}$ on an infinite, connected, locally finite graph $G$. Let $R_t := |\{X_0,\dots,X_t\}|$ denote its range at time $t$, and $T_n:=\inf\{t\ge 0: R_t= n\}$ the $n-$th discovery time. We establish a general estimate on $\mathbb E[T_n]$ in terms of two coarse geometric parameters of $G$, and deduce the universal bounds $\mathbb E[T_n]\le 4n^3\log n$ and $\mathbb E[R_t]\gtrsim (t/\log t)^{1/3}$. Moreover, we show that this is essentially sharp by constructing a multi-scale version of Feige's Lollipop graph satisfying $\mathbb E[T_n]\gtrsim n^{3}$ for all dyadic integers $n$. In light of this example, we ask whether the existence of \emph{trapping phases} where the range grows sub-diffusively necessarily implies the existence of \emph{expanding phases} where it grows super-diffusively. Finally, we provide a simple \emph{uniform transience} condition under which the expected range grows linearly, and conjecture that all vertex-nonamenable graphs exhibit linear range.</description>

      <title>Martin Boundary and the Nonlinear Multiplicative Stochastic Heat Equation in Weak Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear multiplicative stochastic heat equation on Dirichlet spaces with white in time noise under weak disorder. We show that positive invariant random fields with uniformly bounded second moments are in one-to-one correspondence with bounded positive harmonic functions. The proof combines a remote past pullback construction with a uniqueness argument that applies a contraction inspired by chaos expansion. As a consequence, the space of invariant measures inherits geometric structure from the Martin Boundary. We further establish a small-noise Gaussian fluctuation result within each harmonic sector and show that the long-time behavior of solutions is completely determined by the Martin boundary data of the initial condition. These results reveal a direct connection between stochastic PDE dynamics and boundary theory in potential analysis.</description>

      <title>M\"obius inversion and the iterated bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating nonlinear functionals of probability distributions from samples is a fundamental statistical problem. The "plug-in" estimator obtained by applying the target functional to the empirical distribution of samples is biased. Resampling methods such as the bootstrap derive artificial datasets from the original one by resampling. Comparing the outcome of the plug-in estimator in the original and resampled datasets allows estimating and thus correcting the bias. In the asymptotic setting, iterations of this procedure attain an arbitrarily high order of bias correction, but finite sample results are scarce. This work develops a new theoretical understanding of bootstrap bias correction by viewing it as an iterative linear solver for the combinatorial operation of M\"obius inversion. It sharply characterizes the regime of linear convergence of the bootstrap bias reduction for moment polynomials. It uses these results to show its superalgebraic convergence rate for band-limited functionals. Finally, it derives a modified bootstrap iteration enabling the unbiased estimation of unknown order-$m$ moment polynomials in $m$ bootstrap iterations.</description>

      <title>Optimal quantum (tensor product) expanders from unitary designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate how quantum expanders (i.e. quantum channels with few Kraus operators but a large spectral gap) can be constructed from unitary designs. Concretely, we prove that a random quantum channel whose Kraus operators are independent unitaries sampled from a $2$-design measure is with high probability an optimal expander (in the sense that its spectral gap is as large as possible). More generally, we show that, if these Kraus operators are independent unitaries of the form $U^{\otimes k}$, with $U$ sampled from a $2k$-design measure, then the corresponding random quantum channel is typically an optimal $k$-copy tensor product expander, a concept introduced by Harrow and Hastings (Quant. Inf. Comput. 2009).</description>

      <title>Harmonic functions on Tutte's embeddings and linearized Monge-Amp\`ere equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove convergence of solutions of Dirichlet problems and Green's functions on Tutte's harmonic embeddings to those of the linearized Monge-Amp\`ere equation $\mathcal{L}_\varphi h=0$. The potential $\varphi$ appears as the limit of piecewise linear potentials associated with the embeddings and the only assumption that we use is the uniform convexity of $\varphi$. Even if $\varphi$ is quadratic, this setup significantly generalizes known results for discrete harmonic functions on orthodiagonal tilings. Motivated by potential applications to the analysis of 2d lattice models on irregular graphs, we also study the situation in which the limits are harmonic in a different complex structure.</description>
