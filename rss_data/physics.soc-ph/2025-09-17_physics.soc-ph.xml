      <title>A Second Order Model of Capacity Drop at Expressway Lane-Drop Bottlenecks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a second-order model of capacity drop at expressway lane-drop bottlenecks. The model is an extension of Jin's model (Jin, 2017). This model captures not only the stationary state associated with the capacity drop but also the transitional dynamics leading from the onset of congestion to that state. The characteristics of the proposed model are examined theoretically and umerically. The results show that the capacity drop stationary state is stable and is reached immediately once congestion occurs. Furthermore, we validate the model using empirical data. The results suggest that the model has the potential to provide new insights into congestion phenomena at expressway lane-drop bottlenecks.</description>

      <title>Dual Reinforcement Learning Synergy in Resource Allocation: Emergence of Self-Organized Momentum Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In natural ecosystems and human societies, self-organized resource allocation and policy synergy are ubiquitous and significant. This work focuses on the synergy between Dual Reinforcement Learning Policies in the Minority Game (DRLP-MG) to optimize resource allocation. Our study examines a mixed-structured population with two sub-populations: a Q-subpopulation using Q-learning policy and a C-subpopulation adopting the classical policy. We first identify a synergy effect between these subpopulations. A first-order phase transition occurs as the mixing ratio of the subpopulations changes. Further analysis reveals that the Q-subpopulation consists of two internal synergy clusters (IS-clusters) and a single external synergy cluster (ES-cluster). The former contribute to the internal synergy within the Q-subpopulation through synchronization and anti-synchronization, whereas the latter engages in the inter-subpopulation synergy. Within the ES-cluster, the classical momentum strategy in the financial market manifests and assumes a crucial role in the inter-subpopulation synergy. This particular strategy serves to prevent long-term under-utilization of resources. However, it also triggers trend reversals and leads to a decrease in rewards for those who adopt it. Our research reveals that the frozen effect, in either the C- or Q-subpopulation, is a crucial prerequisite for synergy, consistent with previous studies. We also conduct mathematical analyses on subpopulation synergy effects and the synchronization and anti-synchronization forms of IS-clusters in the Q-subpopulation. Overall, our work comprehensively explores the complex resource-allocation dynamics in DRLP-MG, uncovers multiple synergy mechanisms and their conditions, enriching the theoretical understanding of reinforcement-learning-based resource allocation and offering valuable practical insights</description>

      <title>A hidden benefit of incomplete round-robin tournaments: Encouraging offensive play</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to explore the impact of tournament design on the incentives of the contestants. We develop a simulation framework to quantify the potential gain and loss from attacking based on changes in the probability of reaching the critical ranking thresholds. The model is applied to investigate the 2024/25 UEFA Champions League reform. The novel incomplete round-robin league phase is found to create more powerful incentives for offensive play than the previous group stage, with an average increase of 119\% (58\%) regarding the first (second) prize. Our study provides the first demonstration that the tournament format itself can strongly influence team behaviour in sports.</description>

      <title>Fast Unbiased Sampling of Networks with Given Expected Degrees and Strengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13230v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The configuration model is a cornerstone of statistical assessment of network structure. While the Chung-Lu model is among the most widely used configuration models, it systematically oversamples edges between large-degree nodes, leading to inaccurate statistical conclusions. Although the maximum entropy principle offers unbiased configuration models, its high computational cost has hindered widespread adoption, making the Chung-Lu model an inaccurate yet persistently practical choice. Here, we propose fast and efficient sampling algorithms for the max-entropy-based models by adapting the Miller-Hagberg algorithm. Evaluation on 103 empirical networks demonstrates 10-1000 times speedup, making theoretically rigorous configuration models practical and contributing to a more accurate understanding of network structure.</description>

      <title>Network connectivity analysis via shortest paths</title>

Abstract: Complex systems of interacting components often can be modeled by a simple graph $\mathcal{G}$ that consists of a set of $n$ nodes and a set of $m$ edges. Such a graph can be represented by an adjacency matrix $A\in\R^{n\times n}$, whose $(ij)$th entry is one if there is an edge pointing from node $i$ to node $j$, and is zero otherwise. The matrix $A$ and its positive integer powers reveal important properties of the graph and allow the construction of the path length matrix $L$ for the graph. The $(ij)$th entry of $L$ is the length of the shortest path from node $i$ to node $j$; if there is no path between these nodes, then the value of the entry is set to $\infty$. We are interested in how well information flows via shortest paths of the graph. This can be studied with the aid of the path length matrix. The path length matrix allows the definition of several measures of communication in the network defined by the graph such as the global $K$-efficiency, which considers shortest paths that are made up of at most $K$ edges for some $K&lt;n$, as well as the number of such shortest paths. Novel notions of connectivity introduced in this paper help us understand the importance of specific edges for the flow of information through the graph. This is of interest when seeking to simplify a network by removing selected edges or trying to assess the sensitivity of the flow of information to changes due to exterior causes such as a traffic stoppage on a road network.</description>
