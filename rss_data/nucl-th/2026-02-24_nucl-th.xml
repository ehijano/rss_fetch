      <title>Two-pion exchange nucleon-nucleon potentials with Roper resonance excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent paper arXiv:2602.11815 [nucl-th], we calculate in these notes the spectral functions (i.e. imaginary parts) of the NN-potentials as they arise from $2\pi$-exchange with single and double Roper resonance excitation. In contrast to the full one-loop calculation, the spectral functions of the isoscalar and isovector central and tensor potentials can be given in simple analytical form. The pertinent momentum-space potentials $V_C(q), W_C(q), V_T(q), W_T(q)$ are obtained via subtracted dispersion relations. This representation allows also to include a regulator function, that tames high-momentum components of the chiral $2\pi$-exchange. The calculation is extended to $2\pi$-exchange with combined $\Delta(1232)$-isobar and Roper resonance excitation.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Size Independence of Hadronic Nucleus-Nucleus Cross Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent proposals to constrain the nucleon size using hadronic cross sections ($\sigma_{\rm AA}$) conflict with collective flow data. I demonstrate this dependence is an artifact of ``geometric inflation,'' where smearing point-like nucleons unintentionally dilutes the nuclear surface. By implementing a self-consistent framework that preserves the global nuclear density, I show that $\sigma_{\rm AA}$ is essentially insensitive to the nucleon width. This establishes $\sigma_{\rm AA}$ as a robust probe of the nuclear surface rather than the sub-nucleon scale. Utilizing this property, I extract a neutron skin thickness for $^{208}$Pb of $\Delta r_{\rm np} \in [0, 0.24]$~fm, providing an unconventional way to constrain the nuclear symmetry energy using high-energy hadronic observables.</description>

      <title>Constraining the nuclear symmetry energy from electric dipole polarizability and neutron skin in $^{208}\mathrm{Pb}$ within antisymmetrized molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electric dipole polarizability $\alpha_D$ and the neutron skin thickness $\Delta R_{np}$ of $^{208}\mathrm{Pb}$ are two powerful and clean probes to constrain the symmetry energy at subsaturation density. Within the framework of the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD) model, we found that the sensitive densities of $\alpha_D$ and $\Delta R_{np}$ ranges from the 0.2$\rho_0$ to 0.57$\rho_0$. To well describe the data of $\alpha_D$ and $\Delta R_{np}$, the effective interaction parameters with $S_0\sim34$ MeV and $L=66-75$ MeV are favored. The constraints of symmetry energy over the density ranging from 0.2$\rho_0$ to 0.57$\rho_0$ are obtained, and the values of symmetry energy at the starting and ending density region are $S(\rho=0.2\rho_0)=10.5\pm 0.63$ MeV and $S(\rho=0.57\rho_0)=23.1\pm 0.4$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Probing the structure of pygmy dipole resonance with its gamma decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19052v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The isospin properties and the collectivity of the pygmy dipole resonance (PDR) are long-standing open questions in nuclear structure studies. To answer these questions, the $\gamma$-decay of PDR states in $^{208}$Pb to the low-lying $2_{1}^{+}$ state is investigated using the Skyrme particle-vibration coupling (PVC) model. It is found that the $E1$ $\gamma$ decay from the PDR states to the low-lying $2_{1}^+$ state is strongly suppressed compared to that from the isovector giant dipole resonance (IVGDR), which reveals the predominantly isoscalar character of PDR. A detailed decomposition of the decay diagrams of the amplitudes of the processes contributing to the decay demonstrates the non-negligible presence of the 1 particle-1 hole configurations coupled to the $2_1^{+}$ phonon in the PDR wave function. Furthermore, we give a quantitative way to identify the components of complex-configurations in the wave function, and it is found that such component in PDR is smaller than that in IVGDR and much smaller than that in isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance (ISGQR).</description>

      <title>Charmonium suppression in fixed target proton-nucleus collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we perform a systematic investigation of cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects operative on charmonium ($J/\psi$, $\psi(2S)$) production in fixed target proton-nucleus (p+A) collisions. Influence on charmonium production cross section due to the interplay of three different plausible CNM effects namely the initial-state parton energy loss, nuclear shadowing, and final-state absorption of the resonant states, are evaluated in detail. The available data on charmonium production in fixed target p+A collision experiments from SPS, Fermilab and HERA-B are examined for this purpose. The energy dependence of the observed $J/\psi$ production patterns are utilized to anticipate level of "normal" absorption in the upcoming proton induced collisions by NA60+ experiment at CERN SPS and CBM experiment at FAIR SIS100 accelerator facilities.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Pasta and Crustal Quasi-Periodic Oscillations in Neutron Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of nuclear pasta on crustal structure and torsional oscillations using a Bayesian ensemble of unified neutron-star equations of state based on relativistic mean-field models constrained by nuclear experiments, empirical saturation properties, chiral effective field theory, and multimessenger observations. For each posterior sample, we compute the pasta sequence within a compressible liquid-drop model and quantify the onset density, thickness, and mass fraction of the pasta layers. We show that the appearance and extent of nuclear pasta are primarily controlled by the symmetry-energy slope parameter $L$. While spherical and rod-like pasta configurations are present for all equations of state, only a small fraction of the posterior supports slab, tube, or bubble geometries. The transition from spherical nuclei to rods is tightly constrained to occur at a density of $\rho_{\rm sr} = 0.0588^{+0.0045}_{-0.0065}\,\mathrm{fm^{-3}}$. We further predict that the nuclear pasta layer occupies a relative radial thickness of $\Delta R_{\rm pasta}/\Delta R_{\rm c} = 0.140^{+0.025}_{-0.036}$ and contributes a relative mass fraction of $\Delta M_{\rm pasta}/\Delta M_{\rm c} = 0.475^{+0.071}_{-0.113}$. Using the resulting crust models, we present the first quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) analysis based on a Bayesian posterior ensemble of neutron-star equations of state and systematically assess their compatibility with observed low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations. We find that the predicted QPO frequencies are strongly correlated with the curvature of the symmetry energy evaluated at sub-saturation density, $K_{\rm sym}(\rho_0/2)$, and that uncertainties in the equation of state translate into a range of angular indices $\ell$ consistent with the observed frequencies.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Optical Potential from Brueckner-Hartree-Fock Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (BHF) calculations are very successful in describing various properties of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter. Within BHF theory a microscopic optical potential (MOP) for nucleon-nucleus scattering is developed. First, we parametrize the energy and density dependence of complex optical potentials in nuclear matter based on BHF calculations and then we construct the MOP for finite nuclei with the local density approximation extended to include the finite-range effects. The density distribution and the spin-orbit contribution are calculated from the Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation with LNS5 Skyrme interaction, the latter being constrained by the BHF results. The central real and imaginary potentials turn out to be quantitatively consistent with the phenomenological global Koning-Delaroche (KD) potentials. The performance of MOP is evaluated by considering neutron/proton scattering on $^{40,48}$Ca. The elastic scattering differential cross sections, analyzing powers and total/reaction cross sections are analyzed in the energy below 200 MeV. A good agreement between the theoretical results and the measurements is achieved. Since our results are presented in the analytic forms, they can thus be used easily in the analysis of the experimental data of the nucleon scattering on exotic nuclei.</description>

      <title>A Boson exchange approach for Helium Burning Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helium burning plays a key role in the hierarchy of stellar nucleosynthesis and evolution, as the archetype of a bosonic 3-body system. Here, we examine the kinetic and nuclear aspects of the 3$\alpha$ reaction, under the auspices of the Thomas-Efimov theorem. Due to the 92.08 keV ground state of $^8$Be, multiple $\alpha$-cluster resonances appear especially at the lowest temperature (Thomas State), while with increasing temperature the system is dominated by the Hoyle/Efimov state. We extend our previous methodology for the sequential channel to describe the direct mechanism, that results in an equilateral geometry similar to the Thomas state. This is accomplished by developing a general approach to the N-body scattering, via successive particle-exchanging 2-body collisions, which eliminates long range Coulomb complications, in a similar manner to the Thomas-Efimov mechanism. We furthermore, discuss the e$^+$e$^-$ decay of the compound state with a perturbation based methodology. Due to the symmetry of the system and the resulting reaction rates, we favor the E0 decay scheme over the E2. The E0 reaction rates obey all the available astrophysical and nuclear constraints and are compared to theoretical data from the literature, whose limitations are discussed. Our extended methodology provides a physically sound description of the debated low temperature region.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the $K^{-}pp$ Bound State via the \( K^{-} + {}^{3}\mathrm{He} \) Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the four-body Alt-Grassberger-Sandhas (AGS) equations for the \( K^{-}ppn \) system, we investigate the possible formation of a \( K^{-}pp \) quasi-bound state through the low-energy \( K^{-} + {}^{3}\mathrm{He} \) reaction. The neutron missing mass spectrum in the final state was calculated for different models of the \( \bar{K}N \) interaction. The results indicate that, irrespective of the specific nature of the \( \Lambda(1405) \) structure or the details of the \( \bar{K}N \) interaction model, a signal corresponding to the \( K^{-}pp \) quasi-bound state could appear in the \( \pi \Sigma p \) mass spectrum. This supports the feasibility of observing the \( K^{-}pp \) cluster in low-energy kaon-induced reactions on helium-3.</description>

      <title>Analytic continuation of Green's functions with a neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important problem in many-body physics is to reconstruct the spectral density from the imaginary-time domain Green's function. Typically, the imaginary-time Green's function is generated by Monte Carlo methods. As the one-point fermionic kernel diverges exponentially for large frequencies, numerical noise generically causes instabilities. We use a convolutional neural network to obtain the spectral density for a given imaginary time Green's function. The network is trained by data which we generate using random Gaussians. We improve the training data set available by including collision centers for the Gaussians rather than employing uniformly distributed Gaussians. Our network is constructed in such a way that its output fulfills positive semidefiniteness. We compare the results of our network with results of the Maximum Entropy method (MaxEnt), a standard method for the same reconstruction problem for the spectral density. This comparison is performed for three different cases, namely our Gaussian based test data as well as two physical models, the 1d Hubbard model showing spin-charge separation, and the two-dimensional SSH model in the self-consistent Born approximation. We find that the network outperforms MaxEnt when presented data close to the training set. For the physical models considered, MaxEnt recognizes physical features more precisely as compared to our network prediction. While it is hard to improve MaxEnt, the quality of the network depends on the training data set which can be systematically enhanced and improved.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Nuclear Urca Process in the Ocean of Neutron-Star Superburst MAXI J1752$-$457</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that the rapid cooling of the neutron star following its X-ray superburst in MAXI J1752$-$457 over a period of 4 days, observed by two Japanese satellites, MAXI and NinjaSat, is due to enhanced neutrino emission from cycles of electron capture and $\beta^{-}$ decay involving odd-$A$ nuclei (or Urca pairs) in the ocean. Hence, this work provides the first indication of the possible existence of such a ``nuclear Urca process". The observation of MAXI J1752$-$457 implies a hot ignition layer with a maximum temperature of $\sim4~{\rm GK}$, located near the Urca shell in the ocean, such that the nuclear Urca process becomes dominant for up to $\sim2$ days after the superburst. This behavior is distinct from that of normal Type-I X-ray bursts, which are triggered by hydrogen or helium burning in much shallower layers than those of superbursts. Our findings enable probing of superburst ashes through Urca pairs via long-term monitoring of crust cooling on day-long timescales.</description>

      <title>Two nearby states in the $X(3872)$ region: Resolving the radiative-decay ratio tension with $\eta_{c2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, LHCb reported the radiative-decay ratio ${\cal R}^{\psi\gamma}\equiv {\cal B}[X(3872)\to \psi'\gamma]/{\cal B}[X(3872)\to J/\psi\gamma]=1.67\pm 0.25$ extracted from $B^+\to K^+(J/\psi\gamma, \psi'\gamma)$. This result differs markedly ($\sim4.6\sigma$) from the BESIII value obtained from $e^+e^-\to \gamma(J/\psi\gamma, \psi'\gamma)$, ${\cal R}^{\psi\gamma}=-0.04\pm 0.28$. Such a significant tension suggests that more than one state in the $X(3872)$ region contributes to the processes. We therefore propose a two-state scenario: a shallow $D^{*0}\bar{D}^0$ bound state with $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ and a $2^{-+}$ charmonium candidate, $\eta_{c2}$, slightly above the $D^{*0}\bar{D}^0$ threshold. We show that this hypothesis consistently describes these ratios along with other branching fractions and lineshapes across multiple processes. By contrast, fits without the $\eta_{c2}$ component fail to reproduce the radiative-ratio data. We also predict helicity-angle distributions that motivates the future experiments to test the two-state hypothesis and search for the so-far missing $\eta_{c2}$.</description>

      <title>Three-body molecular states composed of $D^{(*)}$ and two nucleons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the three-body systems $DNN$ and $D^{*}NN$ within a hadronic molecular framework by combining a realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction with a $D^{(*)}N$ potential constrained by heavy-quark symmetry. The three-body Schr\"odinger equation is solved with the Gaussian Expansion Method, and the analytic structure of the spectrum is investigated using the Complex Scaling Method. We find that the $DNN$ system supports a robust and compact bound state in the $I(J^{P})=\tfrac{1}{2}(1^-)$ channel over a broad range of cutoff values, even when the corresponding $DN$ subsystem is weakly bound or unbound. For $D^{*}NN$, the spin-$1$ nature of the heavy meson and the associated spin-dependent forces generate a clear spin hierarchy: deeply bound states appear in both $0^-$ and $2^-$ channels, while the $1^-$ channel exhibits a characteristic two-branch pattern with a strongly bound compact branch and a more weakly bound, spatially extended branch. The root-mean-square radii indicate pronounced spatial compression compared with the deuteron scale, highlighting the cooperative roles of realistic $NN$ correlations, the $D^{(*)}N$ interactions, and heavy-quark symmetry in forming compact heavy-flavor few-body bound states. No three-body resonances under complex scaling are found in the explored parameter space. Our results provide quantitative benchmarks for future experimental searches for such charmed-meson-nuclear bound states.</description>

      <title>2025 EIC-France Workshop: Physics Highlights and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19664v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This document presents a synthesis of the theory contributions and discussions from the 2nd EIC-France Workshop, held at IJCLab (Orsay) on 1-3 December 2025. The workshop brought together members of the French hadron-physics community to review recent theoretical developments relevant to the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) and to coordinate national efforts in preparation for its early physics program. The report first summarizes the collider's initial running conditions and luminosity performance, as outlined in the EIC Early Science Matrix. It then provides concise overviews of the theoretical presentations on inclusive, semi-inclusive, exclusive, heavy-flavor, and small-x physics.
  Based on these discussions, two measurements emerged as especially well suited for early EIC operation and strongly aligned with areas of established French expertise: inclusive diffraction and inclusive quarkonium production. These channels offer clean signatures, robust theoretical interpretability, and direct sensitivity to fundamental QCD phenomena such as gluon saturation, heavy-quark dynamics, and the small-x structure of hadrons and nuclei.
  In addition, the workshop identified longer-term physics opportunities that will benefit from the full capabilities of the EIC after its ramp-up phase. These include accessing the three-dimensional structure of the pion through the Sullivan process and a broader program of exclusive three-body final states, both of which represent high-impact avenues for exploring hadronic structure and non-perturbative QCD. Together, the elements summarized in this report provide a coherent overview of the strategic priorities and scientific ambitions shaping the French community's contribution to the EIC physics program.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically consistent treatment of repulsive corrections in HRG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reformulate the treatment of density-dependent chemical potential shifts appearing in excluded-volume implementations of the hadron resonance gas model. An auxiliary classical representation is constructed in which a common energy shift is determined by preserving the scalar number density, ensuring thermodynamic consistency. Hadron radii are parametrized through a liquid-drop inspired mass-radius relation with two parameters: the pion radius and a scaling exponent. The resulting framework reproduces lattice QCD results for lower-order conserved-charge susceptibilities at zero chemical potentials with only two adjustable parameters.</description>

      <title>Unquenched Charmonium and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The year 2024 marked the 50th anniversary of the discovery of the $J/\psi$ particle, which unveiled the charm quark and the charmonium spectrum, instigating the "November Revolution" in particle physics. This discovery catalyzed the development of quenched potential models, most notably the Cornell model, which provided a foundational quantitative description of the hadronic spectrum. However, the landscape of hadron spectroscopy has been profoundly transformed since the turn of the 21st century with the observation of numerous charmonium-like states, such as $X(3872)$, which exhibit properties starkly at odds with quenched model predictions. These discrepancies, exemplified by the "$X(3872)$ low-mass puzzle" and the "$Y$ problem" associated with vector states like $Y(4260)$, underscore the critical limitations of the quenched approximation and signal the necessity for a new theoretical paradigm. This review synthesizes recent advances in hadronic spectroscopy, arguing that the unquenched picture, which incorporates coupled-channel effects such as hadronic loops, is essential for a unified description of these new states and associated anomalies. We demonstrate how unquenched effects provide compelling solutions to long-standing puzzles in charmonium decays (e.g., the "$\rho\pi$ puzzle" and anomalous dipion transitions), predict and explain the existence of exotic charged states like $Z_c(3900)$ and $Z_b(10610)$ via mechanisms such as Initial Single Pion Emission, and offer a framework for understanding interactions between charmonia and with nucleons. Furthermore, we emphasize the universality of unquenched effects, extending their application to bottomonium and light-flavor sectors. With improving precision, we advocate systematic development of unquenched hadronic spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Nuclear cluster structure effect in $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions at the top RHIC energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09780v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the improved string-melting version of a Multi-Phase Transport model, we investigated the impact of nuclear geometry of $^{16}$O on anisotropic flows in O+O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 200$ GeV. To evaluate the influence of nuclear structure and potential alpha clustering, we implemented four candidate configurations: Woods-Saxon, tetrahedron, square, and Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory. Initial-state geometry is quantified via the eccentricity cumulant ratio $\varepsilon_{2}\{4\}/\varepsilon_{2}\{2\}$, which provides a robust and evolution-independent measure sensitive to configuration differences. The model reproduces $v_{2}(p_{\rm T})$ at low $p_{\rm T}$ and $v_{3}(p_{\rm T})$ across the full $p_{\rm T}$ range, with integrated $v_{2}\{2\}$ and $v_{3}\{2\}$ matching the STAR data, demonstrating that transport dynamics captures the essential collectivity in this intermediate-size system. These findings establish a baseline for extending nuclear-structure studies in O+O collisions to other energies and differential observables within a unified transport model framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07143v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the equations of dissipative relativistic spin hydrodynamics based on quantum kinetic theory are derived. Employing the inverse-Reynolds dominance (IReD) approach, a resummation scheme based on a power counting in Knudsen and inverse Reynolds numbers is constructed, leading to hydrodynamic equations that are accurate to second order. It is found that the spin dynamics can be characterized by eleven equations: six of them describe the evolution of the components of the spin potential, while the remaining five provide the equation of motion of a dissipative irreducible rank-two tensor. For a simple truncation, the first- and second-order transport coefficients are computed explicitly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20021v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present semi-analytical solutions for the evolution of both the temperature and chemical potentials for viscous Gubser flow with conserved charges. Such a solution can be especially useful in testing numerical codes intended to simulate relativistic fluids with large chemical potentials. The freeze-out hypersurface profiles for constant energy density are calculated, along with the corresponding normal vectors and presented as a new unit test for numerical codes. We also compare the influence of the equation of state on the semi-analytical solutions. We benchmark the newly developed Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code CCAKE that includes both shear viscosity and three conserved charges. The numerical solutions are in excellent agreement with the semi-analytical solution and also are able to accurately reproduce the hypersurface at freeze-out.</description>

      <title>A Data-Guided Coalescence Model for Light Nuclei and Hypernuclei Production in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = 3$--200 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The production of light hypernuclei in relativistic heavy-ion collisions provides a unique opportunity to probe hyperon--nucleon interactions and possible three-body forces, which are central to the resolution of the hyperon puzzle in neutron star matter. In this work, we develop a data-guided coalescence framework in which the source size is extracted from proton and deuteron yields and used, together with measured proton and $\Lambda$ spectra, to predict the production of $A=3$ nuclei $(t,{}^{3}\rm{He})$ and hypernuclei $({}^{3}_{\Lambda}\rm{H})$ in $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}=3$--200~GeV Au+Au collisions. For tritons, calculations with a Gaussian wave function reproduce experimental spectra and yield ratios across this energy range. For the hypertriton, the model predictions are highly sensitive to the assumed wave function. This sensitivity is strongest at low collision energies and in low-multiplicity environments, implying that such conditions are particularly valuable for probing hypernuclear structure.</description>

      <title>A Computational Phase Function Method for $\alpha-\alpha$ Scattering: Wavefunction Construction from Single and Two-Term Morse Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the phase function method (PFM) is employed for the first time to explicitly construct scattering wavefunctions for the $\alpha\alpha$ system using a single-term Morse potential. Unlike earlier PFM-based studies that primarily focused on reproducing scattering phase shifts, the present approach directly reconstructs radial wavefunctions for the $\ell = 0$, 2, and 4 partial waves without solving the Schr$\ddot{\text{o}}$dinger equation.
  For comparison, we adopt the interaction potential parameters reported by Sastri et al., who determined them using a two-term reference potential approach with genetic algorithm optimization to accurately reproduce the $\alpha\alpha$ scattering phase shifts. Without re-optimization, we construct the corresponding wavefunctions and find very good agreement with those obtained using our single-term Morse potential. The results also show excellent consistency with the resonating-group method calculations of Hiura \textit{et al.}.These findings demonstrate that PFM provides a numerically stable, efficient, and unified framework for scattering wavefunction construction in cluster-cluster systems.</description>

      <title>Development of an accurate formalism to predict properties of two-neutron halo nuclei: case study of $^{22}$C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When moving away from stability or in loosely-bound systems, few-body clusterized structures like two-neutron halo nuclei appear. These emerge from the interplay between the many- and few-body degrees of freedom, and/or strong coupling between bound and continuum states. This motivates the development of models that can accurately describe few-body dynamics while enforcing shell effects. This work has two goals: understanding how to accurately enforce the Pauli principle in few-body models, as well as presenting new technical developments that allow for more robust and cheaper three-body calculations. We focus on properties of the two-neutron halo 22C, but expect the conclusions to apply to other few-body systems. We use a three-body, hyperspherical harmonics formalism combined with the R-matrix method. We compare predictions for properties of 22C starting from phenomenological interactions and using two methods to remove Pauli-forbidden states, the projection and supersymmetric methods. We also present the algorithms and derivations used. Additionally, we explore model space truncations that allow for reduced computational time. We show convergence of the calculation of both bound and scattering states for $K_{max}\sim 40$. The two methods to enforce the Pauli-exclusion principle lead to different predictions of 22C properties; the projection method is more accurate. We find one efficient channel truncation that reduces the computational cost of our calculations by 20%. Our study clarifies that the projection method is more accurate than the supersymmetric one to enforce the Pauli-exclusion principle. Technical and algorithmic developments enable accurate and efficient computation of two-neutron halo properties. This development paves the way to robust uncertainty quantification in three-body predictions, and is a useful starting point to tackle more complex systems and observables.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Cooper pairing in the microscopic limit of chiral random matrix theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2004.04483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random matrix theory (RMT) provides a powerful framework for analyzing universal features of strongly coupled physical systems. In quantum chromodynamics (QCD), cold quark matter at asymptotically high density is expected to exhibit color superconductivity (CSC), the analogue of superconductivity in condensed-matter systems. Although CSC phases have been studied within RMT primarily in the macroscopic large-$N$ limit, where $N$ denotes the matrix size, it has remained unclear whether an RMT exists that realizes CSC in the microscopic large-$N$ limit. Here we answer this question in the affirmative by introducing a novel non-Hermitian chiral random matrix model. For three quark flavors, we show that the model exhibits spontaneous breaking of color $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ and flavor $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ symmetries down to the diagonal $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ subgroup, thereby reproducing color-flavor locking in dense QCD. For two flavors, we find that color $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ is spontaneously broken to $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ while the chiral symmetry $\mathrm{SU}(2)_{\mathrm{L}}\times\mathrm{SU}(2)_{\mathrm{R}}$ remains unbroken, consistent with the two-flavor color-superconducting phase.</description>

      <title>Helium as an Indicator of the Neutron-Star Merger Remnant Lifetime and its Potential for Equation of State Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The time until black hole formation in a binary neutron-star (NS) merger contains invaluable information about the nuclear equation of state (EoS) but has thus far been difficult to measure. We propose a new way to constrain the merger remnant's NS lifetime, which is based on the tendency of the NS remnant neutrino-driven winds to enrich the ejected material with helium. Based on the He I $\lambda 1083.3$ nm line, we show that the feature around 800-1200 nm in AT2017gfo at 4.4 days seems inconsistent with a helium mass fraction of $X_{\mathrm{He}} \gtrsim 0.05$ in the polar ejecta. Our recent neutrino-hydrodynamic simulations of merger remnants are only compatible with this limit if the NS remnant collapses within 20-30 ms. Such a short lifetime implies that the total binary mass of GW170817, $M_\mathrm{\rm tot}$, lay close to the threshold binary mass for direct gravitational collapse, $M_\mathrm{thres}$, for which we estimate $M_{\mathrm{thres}}\lesssim 2.93 M_\odot$. This upper bound on $M_\mathrm{thres}$ yields upper limits on the radii and maximum mass of cold, non-rotating NSs, which rule out simultaneously large values for both quantities. In combination with causality arguments, this result implies a maximum NS mass of $M_\mathrm{max}\lesssim2.3 M_\odot$. The combination of all limits constrains the radii of 1.6 M$_\odot$ NSs to about 12$\pm$1 km for $M_\mathrm{max}$ = 2.0 M$_\odot$ and 11.5$\pm$1 km for $M_\mathrm{max}$ = 2.15 M$_\odot$. This $\sim2$ km allowable range then tightens significantly for $M_\mathrm{max}$ above $\approx2.15$ M$_\odot$. This rules out a significant number of current EoS models. The short NS lifetime also implies that a black-hole torus, not a highly magnetized NS, was the central engine powering the relativistic jet of GRB170817A. Our work motivates future developments...

Abstract: We work out the spatial density distributions corresponding to the axial-vector charge density operator for spin-1/2 systems using states described by sharply localized wave packets in arbitrary Lorentz-frames. The static approximation, leading to the frequently assumed Breit-frame distributions, is also considered.

      <title>Pathfinding Quantum Simulations of Neutrinoless Double-Beta Decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present results from co-designed quantum simulations of the neutrinoless double-beta decay of a simple nucleus in 1+1D quantum chromodynamics using IonQ's Forte-generation trapped-ion quantum computers. Electrons, neutrinos, and up and down quarks are distributed across two lattice sites and mapped to 32 qubits, with an additional 4 qubits used for flag-based error mitigation. A four-fermion interaction is used to implement weak interactions, and lepton-number violation is induced by a neutrino Majorana mass. Quantum circuits that prepare the initial nucleus and time evolve with the Hamiltonian containing the strong and weak interactions are executed on IonQ Forte Enterprise. Enabled by tuned model parameters, lepton-number violation is observed in real time, providing a clear signal of neutrinoless double-beta decay. This was made possible by co-designing the simulation to maximally utilize the all-to-all connectivity and native gate-set available on IonQ's quantum computers. Quantum circuit compilation techniques and co-designed error-mitigation methods, informed from executing benchmarking circuits with up to 2,356 two-qubit gates, enabled observables to be extracted with high precision. We discuss the potential of future quantum simulations to provide yocto-second resolution of the reaction pathways in these, and other, nuclear processes.</description>

Abstract: Jet interactions with the color-deconfined QCD medium in relativistic heavy-ion collisions are conventionally assessed by measuring the modification of the distributions of jet observables with respect to their baselines in proton-proton collisions. Deep learning methods enable per-jet evaluation of these modifications, enhancing the use of jets as precision probes of the nuclear medium. In this work, we predict the jet-by-jet fractional energy loss $\chi$ for jets evolving through a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) medium using a Linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) model. To approximate realistic experimental conditions, we embed medium-modified jets in a thermal background and apply Constituent Subtraction for background removal. Two network architectures are studied: convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using jet images, and dynamic graph convolutional neural networks (DGCNNs) using particle clouds. We find that CNNs achieve accurate predictions for background-free jets but degrade in the presence of the QGP background and remain below the background-free baseline even after background subtraction. In contrast, DGCNNs applied to background-subtracted particle clouds maintain high accuracy across the entire $\chi$ range, demonstrating the advantage of point-cloud-based graph neural networks that exploit full jet structure under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Anomaly induced transport from symmetry breaking in holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the transport properties of relativistic fluids induced by quantum anomalies in presence of explicit symmetry breaking. To this end we consider a holographic Einstein-Maxwell model in 5 dimensions with pure gauge and a mixed gauge-gravitational Chern-Simons terms, coupled with a scalar field. To study the chiral vortical effects and the energy transport sector, apart from the chiral magnetic effects, we have considered the full backreaction of the gauge field on the metric. We have studied the anomalous effects by using Kubo formulae involving correlators of the charged currents and the energy current. Our findings reveal that, in the presence of explicit symmetry breaking, anomaly-induced transport phenomena can extend beyond anomalous currents and affect non-anomalous sectors as well. In particular, we find that all the conductivities display a distinct sensitivity to the mass parameter controlling the symmetry breaking, thus reflecting the interplay between anomaly coefficients and explicit symmetry breaking terms. These findings highlight the role played by pure gauge and mixed gauge-gravitational anomalies in holographic transport, and their importance for strongly coupled systems with broken symmetries.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-preserving calculation of pion light-front wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Poincar\'e-covariant Bethe-Salpeter wave functions are used to calculate light-front wave functions (LFWFs) of the pion, $\pi$, and an analogue state, $\pi_{s\bar s}$. The current masses of the degenerate valence constituents in the $\pi_{s\bar s}$ are around $25$-times larger than those of the pion's valence constituents. Both valence spin-antialigned ($\mathcal L=0$) and valence spin-aligned ($\mathcal L=1$) components are obtained and combined to produce the complete LFWF for each system. Comparing predictions delivered by two distinct Bethe-Salpeter kernels, the impact of nonperturbative dynamical effects contained in the more sophisticated (bRL) kernel are seen to be significant; and contrasts between $\pi$, $\pi_{s \bar s}$ results reveal the interplay between emergent hadron mass and mass effects owing to Higgs-boson couplings. Amongst the results, one finds that for $\pi$, $\pi_{s\bar s}$, the LFWFs can be approximated by a separable form, with that representation being pointwise reliable in the bRL cases. Moreover, the $\mathcal L=1$ component is important; so a LFWF obtained after omission of this piece is typically a poor representation of the system. These features are naturally expressed in $\pi$, $\pi_{s\bar s}$ transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs). In this connection, it is found that a Gaussian \textit{Ansatz} can only provide a rough guide to TMD pointwise behaviour: magnitude deviations between \textit{Ansatz} and prediction exceed a factor of two on $k_\perp^2 \gtrsim 0.55\,$GeV$^2$. One should therefore be cautious in interpreting conclusions drawn from phenomenological analyses based upon Gaussian \textit{Ans\"atze}.</description>

      <title>Hadron Physics Opportunities at FAIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This White Paper outlines a coordinated, decade-spanning programme of hadron and QCD studies anchored at the GSI/FAIR accelerator complex. Profiting from intense deuteron, proton and pion beams coupled with high-rate capable detectors and an international theory effort, the initiative addresses fundamental questions related to the strong interaction featuring confinement and dynamical mass generation. This includes our understanding of hadron-hadron interactions and the composition of hadrons through mapping the baryon and meson spectra, including exotic states, and quantifying hadron structure. This interdisciplinary research connects topics in the fields of nuclear, heavy-ion, and (nuclear) astro (particle) physics, linking, for example, terrestrial data to constraints on neutron star structure. A phased roadmap with SIS100 accelerator start-up and envisaged detector upgrades will yield precision cross sections, transition form factors, in-medium spectral functions, and validated theory inputs. Synergies with external programmes at international accelerator facilities worldwide are anticipated. The programme is expected to deliver decisive advances in our understanding of non-perturbative (strong) QCD and astrophysics, and high-rate detector and data-science technology.</description>

      <title>Neutrino production mechanisms in strongly magnetized quark matter: Current status and open questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the main neutrino emission mechanisms operating in dense quark matter under strong magnetic fields, with particular emphasis on conditions expected in the interiors of compact stars. We discuss the direct Urca and neutrino synchrotron processes in unpaired quark matter, incorporating the effects of Landau-level quantization. For the direct Urca process, the quantization of the electron energy spectrum plays a critical role, whereas quark quantization can often be neglected at sufficiently high baryon densities. The resulting field-dependent neutrino emissivity is anisotropic and exhibits an oscillatory behavior as a function of magnetic-field strength. We explore the implications of these effects for magnetar cooling and for possible anisotropic neutrino emission that could contribute to pulsar kicks. In addition, we review the $\nu\bar{\nu}$ synchrotron emission process, which, although subdominant, provides valuable insights into the interplay between magnetic fields and weak interactions in dense quark matter. Overall, our analysis highlights the nontrivial influence of strong magnetic fields on neutrino production in magnetized quark cores, with potential consequences for the thermal and dynamical evolution of compact stars.</description>

      <title>Scaling Properties of Two-Particle-Two-Hole Responses in Asymmetric Nuclei for Neutrino Scattering within the Relativistic Mean-Field Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a systematic analysis of the nuclear dependence of two-particle-two-hole meson-exchange current contributions to inclusive lepton-nucleus scattering within the relativistic mean-field framework. We present microscopic calculations of nuclear responses for a set of 17 nuclei, ranging from helium to uranium, using a model with different Fermi momenta for protons and neutrons. We propose a novel scaling prescription based on the two-particle phase space and key nuclear parameters. The resulting description is accurate over a wide range of nuclear targets, with typical deviations below 10\%, and allows for a separate treatment of the different emission channels. In addition, a consistent benchmark against electron-scattering data is provided. The parametrization presented provides a practical framework for extending the responses to different nuclear targets in neutrino event generators.</description>

      <title>Residue-Enhanced Pion-Rho Mixing as the Origin of Nonmonotonic Charged Pion Mass in Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify the dynamical origin of the non-monotonic magnetic field dependence of the charged pion mass observed in lattice QCD. Using a near-pole effective action derived from the SU(2) Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model, we show that the lowest Landau level charged pion mixes with the longitudinally polarized charged rho meson, which shares the same quantum numbers in a magnetic background. This mixing, generated by quark-loop polarization and a gauge-invariant tree-level operator matched to the vacuum decay $\rho^\pm\rightarrow\pi^\pm\gamma$, induces strong level repulsion. Crucially, this effect is dynamically amplified by a rapid suppression of the rho-meson wave function renormalization near the pole. As a result, the lower eigenmode exhibits a turnover as the magnetic field increases. The mechanism is analogous to singlet-triplet mixing in positronium and provides a natural explanation for the lattice results. Such effects are expected to be generic for charged mesons in magnetic fields when symmetry allowed mixing and near-pole residue suppression are present.</description>
