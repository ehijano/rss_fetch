      <title>Deepfakes in the 2025 Canadian Election: Prevalence, Partisanship, and Platform Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concerns about AI-generated political content are growing, yet there is limited empirical evidence on how deepfakes actually appear and circulate across social platforms during major events in democratic countries. In this study, we present one of the first in-depth analyses of how these realistic synthetic media shape the political landscape online, focusing specifically on the 2025 Canadian federal election. By analyzing 187,778 posts from X, Bluesky, and Reddit with a high-accuracy detection framework trained on a diverse set of modern generative models, we find that 5.86% of election-related images were deepfakes. Right-leaning accounts shared them more frequently, with 8.66% of their posted images flagged compared to 4.42% for left-leaning users, often with defamatory or conspiratorial intent. Yet, most detected deepfakes were benign or non-political, and harmful ones drew little attention, accounting for only 0.12% of all views on X. Overall, deepfakes were present in the election conversation, but their reach was modest, and realistic fabricated images, although less common, drew higher engagement, highlighting growing concerns about their potential misuse.</description>

      <title>"Talking past each other": Issue ownership and microtargeting in Swiss online political ads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Switzerland's unique system of direct democracy, characterized by frequent popular referenda, provides a critical context for studying the impact of online political advertising beyond standard electoral cycles. This paper presents a large-scale, data-driven analysis of 40k political ads published on Facebook and Instagram in Switzerland between 2021 and 2025. Despite a voting population of only 5.6 million, the ad campaigns were significant in scale, costing CHF 4.5 million and achieving 560 million impressions. This study shows that political ads are used not only for federal elections, but also to influence referenda, where greater exposure to ``pro-Yes'' advertising correlates significantly with approval outcomes. The analysis of microtargeting reveals distinct partisan strategies: centrist and right-wing parties predominantly target older men, whereas left-wing parties focus on young women. Furthermore, significant region-specific demographic variations are observed even within the same party, reflecting Switzerland's strong territorial divisions. Regarding content, a clear pattern of ``talking past each other'' is identified: in line with issue ownership theory, parties avoid direct debate on shared issues, preferring to promote exclusively owned topics. Finally, it is demonstrated that these strategies are so distinct that an ad's author can be predicted using a machine learning model trained exclusively on its audience and topic features. This study sheds light on how microtargeting and issue divergence on social platforms may fragment the public sphere and bypass traditional democratic deliberation.</description>

      <title>Topologically-Stabilized Graph Neural Networks: Empirical Robustness Across Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the standard for graph representation learning but remain vulnerable to structural perturbations. We propose a novel framework that integrates persistent homology features with stability regularization to enhance robustness. Building on the stability theorems of persistent homology \cite{cohen2007stability}, our method combines GIN architectures with multi-scale topological features extracted from persistence images, enforced by Hiraoka-Kusano-inspired stability constraints. Across six diverse datasets spanning biochemical, social, and collaboration networks , our approach demonstrates exceptional robustness to edge perturbations while maintaining competitive accuracy. Notably, we observe minimal performance degradation (0-4\% on most datasets) under perturbation, significantly outperforming baseline stability. Our work provides both a theoretically-grounded and empirically-validated approach to robust graph learning that aligns with recent advances in topological regularization</description>

      <title>Research Opportunities and Challenges of the EU's Digital Services Act</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Digital Services Act (DSA) introduced by the European Union in 2022 offers a landmark framework for platform transparency, with Article 40 enabling vetted researchers to access data from major online platforms. Yet significant legal, technical, and organizational barriers still hinder effective research on systemic online risks. This piece outlines the key challenges emerging from the Article 40 process and proposes practical measures to ensure that the DSA fulfills its transparency and accountability goals.</description>

      <title>The microscale organization of directed hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-world complex systems are characterized by non-pairwise -- higher-order -- interactions among system's units, and can be effectively modeled as hypergraphs. Directed hypergraphs distinguish between source and target sets within each hyperedge, and allow to account for the directional flow of information between nodes. Here, we provide a framework to characterize the structural organization of directed higher-order networks at their microscale. First, we extract the fingerprint of a directed hypergraph, capturing the frequency of hyperedges with a certain source and target sizes, and use this information to compute differences in higher-order connectivity patterns among real-world systems. Then, we formulate reciprocity in hypergraphs, including exact, strong, and weak definitions, to measure to which extent hyperedges are reciprocated. Finally, we extend motif analysis to identify recurring interaction patterns and extract the building blocks of directed hypergraphs. We validate our framework on empirical datasets, including Bitcoin transactions, metabolic networks, and citation data, revealing structural principles behind the organization of real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Listening Between the Lines: Decoding Podcast Narratives with Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Podcasts have become a central arena for shaping public opinion, making them a vital source for understanding contemporary discourse. Their typically unscripted, multi-themed, and conversational style offers a rich but complex form of data. To analyze how podcasts persuade and inform, we must examine their narrative structures -- specifically, the narrative frames they employ.
  The fluid and conversational nature of podcasts presents a significant challenge for automated analysis. We show that existing large language models, typically trained on more structured text such as news articles, struggle to capture the subtle cues that human listeners rely on to identify narrative frames. As a result, current approaches fall short of accurately analyzing podcast narratives at scale.
  To solve this, we develop and evaluate a fine-tuned BERT model that explicitly links narrative frames to specific entities mentioned in the conversation, effectively grounding the abstract frame in concrete details. Our approach then uses these granular frame labels and correlates them with high-level topics to reveal broader discourse trends. The primary contributions of this paper are: (i) a novel frame-labeling methodology that more closely aligns with human judgment for messy, conversational data, and (ii) a new analysis that uncovers the systematic relationship between what is being discussed (the topic) and how it is being presented (the frame), offering a more robust framework for studying influence in digital media.</description>

      <title>Supporting Migration Policies with Forecasts: Illegal Border Crossings in Europe through a Mixed Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a mixed-methodology to forecast illegal border crossings in Europe across five key migratory routes, with a one-year time horizon. The methodology integrates machine learning techniques with qualitative insights from migration experts. This approach aims at improving the predictive capacity of data-driven models through the inclusion of a human-assessed covariate, an innovation that addresses challenges posed by sudden shifts in migration patterns and limitations in traditional datasets. The proposed methodology responds directly to the forecasting needs outlined in the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum, supporting the Asylum and Migration Management Regulation (AMMR). It is designed to provide policy-relevant forecasts that inform strategic decisions, early warning systems, and solidarity mechanisms among EU Member States. By joining data-driven modeling with expert judgment, this work aligns with existing academic recommendations and introduces a novel operational tool tailored for EU migration governance. The methodology is tested and validated with known data to demonstrate its applicability and reliability in migration-related policy context.</description>
