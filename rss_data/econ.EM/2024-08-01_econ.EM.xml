      <title>Methodological Foundations of Modern Causal Inference in Social Science Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper serves as a literature review of methodology concerning the (modern) causal inference methods to address the causal estimand with observational/survey data that have been or will be used in social science research. Mainly, this paper is divided into two parts: inference from statistical estimand for the causal estimand, in which we reviewed the assumptions for causal identification and the methodological strategies addressing the problems if some of the assumptions are violated. We also discuss the asymptotical analysis concerning the measure from the observational data to the theoretical measure and replicate the deduction of the efficient/doubly robust average treatment effect estimator, which is commonly used in current social science analysis.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Synthetic Control Methods with Spillover Effects: Estimating the Economic Cost of the 2011 Sudan Split</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synthetic control method (SCM) is widely used for causal inference with panel data, particularly when there are few treated units. SCM assumes the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA), which posits that potential outcomes are unaffected by the treatment status of other units. However, interventions often impact not only treated units but also untreated units, known as spillover effects. This study introduces a novel panel data method that extends SCM to allow for spillover effects and estimate both treatment and spillover effects. This method leverages a spatial autoregressive panel data model to account for spillover effects. We also propose Bayesian inference methods using Bayesian horseshoe priors for regularization. We apply the proposed method to two empirical studies: evaluating the effect of the California tobacco tax on consumption and estimating the economic impact of the 2011 division of Sudan on GDP per capita.</description>

      <title>Identification and Estimation of Dynamic Games with Unknown Information Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.03706v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the identification and estimation of dynamic games when the underlying information structure is unknown to the researcher. To tractably characterize the set of Markov perfect equilibrium predictions while maintaining weak assumptions on players' information, we introduce \textit{Markov correlated equilibrium}, a dynamic analog of Bayes correlated equilibrium. The set of Markov correlated equilibrium predictions coincides with the set of Markov perfect equilibrium predictions that can arise when the players can observe more signals than assumed by the analyst. Using Markov correlated equilibrium as the solution concept, we propose tractable computational strategies for informationally robust estimation, inference, and counterfactual analysis that deal with the non-convexities arising in dynamic environments. We use our method to analyze the dynamic competition between Starbucks and Dunkin' in the US and the role of informational assumptions.</description>

      <title>GARHCX-NoVaS: A Model-free Approach to Incorporate Exogenous Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the forecasting ability of a recently proposed normalizing and variance-stabilizing (NoVaS) transformation with the possible inclusion of exogenous variables. From an applied point-of-view, extra knowledge such as fundamentals- and sentiments-based information could be beneficial to improve the prediction accuracy of market volatility if they are incorporated into the forecasting process. In the classical approach, these models including exogenous variables are typically termed GARCHX-type models. Being a Model-free prediction method, NoVaS has generally shown more accurate, stable and robust (to misspecifications) performance than that compared to classical GARCH-type methods. This motivates us to extend this framework to the GARCHX forecasting as well. We derive the NoVaS transformation needed to include exogenous covariates and then construct the corresponding prediction procedure. We show through extensive simulation studies that bolster our claim that the NoVaS method outperforms traditional ones, especially for long-term time aggregated predictions. We also provide an interesting data analysis to exhibit how our method could possibly shed light on the role of geopolitical risks in forecasting volatility in national stock market indices for three different countries in Europe.</description>

      <title>Testing for the Asymmetric Optimal Hedge Ratios: With an Application to Bitcoin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reducing financial risk is of paramount importance to investors, financial institutions, and corporations. Since the pioneering contribution of Johnson (1960), the optimal hedge ratio based on futures is regularly utilized. The current paper suggests an explicit and efficient method for testing the null hypothesis of a symmetric optimal hedge ratio against an asymmetric alternative one within a multivariate setting. If the null is rejected, the position dependent optimal hedge ratios can be estimated via the suggested model. This approach is expected to enhance the accuracy of the implemented hedging strategies compared to the standard methods since it accounts for the fact that the source of risk depends on whether the investor is a buyer or a seller of the risky asset. An application is provided using spot and futures prices of Bitcoin. The results strongly support the view that the optimal hedge ratio for this cryptocurrency is position dependent. The investor that is long in Bitcoin has a much higher conditional optimal hedge ratio compared to the one that is short in the asset. The difference between the two conditional optimal hedge ratios is statistically significant, which has important repercussions for implementing risk management strategies.</description>
