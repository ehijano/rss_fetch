      <title>An inverse problem for linear system of dispersive equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the inverse problem of identifying the linear velocity coefficient in a linear system governed by two Benjamin-Bona-Mahony-type equations, which model the displacement of water waves propagating along the surface of a shallow channel, incorporating effects of dispersion and topography. To solve this, we reformulate the inverse problem as a restricted minimization problem (RMP), aimed at optimizing a suitably regularized objective functional. We use numerical techniques, specifically the iterative L-BFGS-B algorithm implemented in the Dolfin-Adjoint-Python-SciPy libraries, to solve the RMP effectively. Following methodologies similar to those in Pipicano et al., we establish a local stability result for the RMP. Additionally, through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed identification method in determining the linear velocity coefficient in Boussinesq-type systems.</description>

      <title>Multiple solutions to the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a partial confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider multiple solutions to the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) with a partial confinement, which is physically relevant to dynamics of the Bose-Einstein condensate. Our study not only verifies the existence of positive ground state solutions and the nonexistence of least energy sign-changing solutions but also sheds light on the symmetry associated with these solutions. A novel finding is the existence of saddle type nodal solutions with their nodal domains intersecting at the origin. Furthermore, we have developed some innovative techniques such as the method of moving planes and the Hopf lemma for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with partial confinement.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic evolutions in solutions to the convection-diffusion equation of Burgers type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the initial value problem of the convection-diffusion equation of Burgers type is treated. In the asymptotic profile of solutions, the nonlinearity of the equation is reflected. A characteristic component derived from nonlinearity develops logarithmically over time, and the rate of decay varies depending on the spatial dimensions. The rate of this component predicted from the scale of the equation. In even dimensions, the logarithmic component decays at the expected rate, but in odd dimensions, it decays much faster than expected. These results suggest that there are differences in the symmetry of nonlinearity depending on the parity of dimensions. This interpretation is supported by comparison with similar Navier--Stokes equations. The Burgers type is applicable as an indicator for considering several bilinear problems.</description>

      <title>Quantitative periodic homogenization of parabolic equations with large drift and potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to study the rates in the context of periodic homogenization of parabolic problems with large lower order terms (both drift and potential). We demonstrate that the solution is a product of three terms: (i) a function of time, (ii) the ground-state of an exponential cell eigenvalue problem and (iii) the solution to a parabolic equation with zero effective drift. For the latter, we derive $\mathrm L^2$ rates in the homogenization limit.</description>

      <title>Initial boundary value problems for 3-d Navier-Stokes equations with hyperbolic heat conduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an initial boundary value problem for the 3-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations with hyperbolic heat conduction, where the classical Fourier law is replaced by the Cattaneo-Christov constitutive relation. We focus on spherically symmetric solutions. We establish the existence of uniform global small solutions to the resulting system. Furthermore, based on uniform a priori estimates, we rigorously justify both the relaxation limit and the vanishing viscosity limit.</description>

      <title>A two-point phase recovering from holographic data on a single plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a plane wave, a radiation solution, and the sum of these solutions (total solution) for the Helmholtz equation in an exterior region in $\mathbb{R}^d,$ $d\geq 2$. In this region, we consider a hyperplane $X$ with sufficiently large distance $s$ from the origin in ${\mathbb R}^d.$ We give two-point local formulas for approximate recovering the radiation solution restricted to the plane $X$ from the intensity of the total solution at $X$, that is, from holographic data. The recovering is given in terms of the far-field pattern of the radiation solution with a decaying error term as $s \to +\infty.$ A numerical implementation is also presented.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of a Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard System for Membrane-fluid Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an optimal control problem for a two-dimensional Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system arising in the modeling of fluid-membrane interaction. The fluid dynamics is governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, which are nonlinearly coupled with a sixth-order Cahn-Hilliard type equation representing the deformation of a flexible membrane through a phase-field variable. Building on the previously established existence and uniqueness of global strong solutions for the coupled system, we introduce an external forcing term acting on the fluid as the control variable. Then we seek to minimize a tracking-type cost functional, demonstrating the existence of an optimal control and deriving the associated first-order necessary optimality conditions. A key issue is to establish sufficient regularity for solutions of the adjoint system, which is crucial for the rigorous derivation of optimality conditions in the fluid dynamic setting.</description>

      <title>An Inverse Problem for the Prescribed Mean Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the study of inverse problems for minimal surfaces by considering the inverse source problem for the prescribed mean curvature equation \begin{equation*}
  \nabla \cdot \left[ \frac{\nabla u}{(1 + |\nabla u|^2)^{1/2}} \right] = H(x). \end{equation*} We prove that in two dimensions, the source function $H$ is uniquely determined by the associated Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. A notable feature of this problem is that although the equation is posed on an Euclidean domain, its linearization yields an anisotropic conductivity equation where the coefficient matrix corresponds to a Riemannian metric $g$ depending on the background solution. This work represents the first treatments of inverse source problems for quasilinear equations.
  The proof relies on the higher order linearization method. The main methodological contribution is the development of an approach to decouple the resulting system of nonlinear algebraic and geometric equations, which enables the complete determination of the source term from boundary measurements. The decoupling uses a Liouville type uniqueness result for conformal mappings.</description>

      <title>The moving patch model with fractional diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the following one-dimensional reaction-diffusion problem $$ u_t+(-\Delta)^s u=f(x-c t, u) \;\:\textrm{ in } \mathbb{R}\times (0,+\infty), $$ where $s&gt;\frac{1}{2}$, $c \in \mathbb{R}$ is a prescribed velocity, and $f$ is of KPP type, which describes the evolution of a population in an advective environment subjected to nonlocal diffusion. We suppose the environment is such that it is only advantageous in a bounded ``patch", outside of which the species dies at an asymptotically constant rate.
  We first derive an optimal solvability criteria for the corresponding traveling waves problem $$\Delta^s u+c u^{\prime}+f(x, u)=0 \;\:\textrm{ in } \mathbb{R},$$ through the first eigenvalue of the associated linearized elliptic operator with drift. Then we use this criteria to establish the long time behavior of the solution to the parabolic problem, for any continuous bounded nonnegative initial data, leading the species either through their extinction or survival. Moreover, assuming that for $c=0$ the population survives, we show that there exist two positive critical speeds $c^{*}$ and $c^{**}$ such that for all $|c| &lt;c^{*}$ the population persists, whereas and it perishes for $|c| &gt;c^{**}$.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the reinforcement of the spectrum of an elliptic problem with Robin boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of a differential elliptic operator on $H^1(\bar{\Omega}\cup \Sigma)$, where $\Omega$ is a smooth domain surrounded by a layer $\Sigma$. The thickness of the layer is given by $\varepsilon h$, where $h$ is a positive function defined on the boundary $\partial \Omega$ and $\varepsilon$ is the ellipticity constant of the operator in $\Sigma$. We prove that, in the limit for $\varepsilon$ going to $0$, the spectrum converges to the spectrum of a differential elliptic operator in $H^1(\Omega)$, and we investigate a first-order asymptotic development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the first eigenvalues of the polyharmonic, Lam\'e and Stokes operators with Dirichlet boundary conditions on sets of given finite measure. It is shown that a quasi-open set for which this eigenvalue is minimal is open. This removes dimensional restrictions in earlier works. We use Campanato theory, which works well in the present higher order or non-scalar setting.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of critical points of hydrophobic capillary functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22532v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the rigidity, among sets of finite perimeter, of volume-preserving critical points of the capillary energy in the half space, in the case where the prescribed interior contact angle is between $90^\circ$ and $120^\circ$. No structural or regularity assumption is required on the finite perimeter sets. Assuming that the ``tangential'' part of the capillary boundary is $\mathcal{H}^n$-null, this rigidity theorem extends to the full hydrophobic regime of interior contact angles between $90^\circ$ and $180^\circ$. Furthermore, we establish the anisotropic counterpart of this theorem under the assumption of lower density bounds.</description>

      <title>Instability of the halocline at the North Pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we address the issue of stability for the near-inertial Pollard waves, as a model for the halocline in the region of the Arctic Ocean centered around the North Pole, derived in Puntini (2025a). Adopting the short-wavelength instability approach, the stability of such flows reduces to study the stability of a system of ODEs along fluid trajectories, leading to the result that, when the steepness of the near-inertial Pollard waves exceeds a specific threshold, those waves are linearly unstable. The explicit dispersion relation of the model allows to easily compute such threshold, knowing the physical properties of the water column.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive CUR Algorithm and its Application to Reduced-Order Modeling of Random PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Certain classes of CUR algorithms, also referred to as cross or pseudoskeleton algorithms, are widely used for low-rank matrix approximation when direct access to all matrix entries is costly. Their key advantage lies in constructing a rank-r approximation by sampling only r columns and r rows of the target matrix. This property makes them particularly attractive for reduced-order modeling of nonlinear matrix differential equations, where nonlinear operations on low-rank matrices can otherwise produce high-rank or even full-rank intermediates that must subsequently be truncated to rank $r$. CUR cross algorithms bypass the intermediate step and directly form the rank-$r$ matrix. However, standard cross algorithms may suffer from loss of accuracy in some settings, limiting their robustness and broad applicability. In this work, we propose a cross oversampling algorithm that augments the intersection with additional sampled columns and rows. We provide an error analysis demonstrating that the proposed oversampling improves robustness. We also present an algorithm that adaptively selects the number of oversampling entries based on efficiently computable indicators. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed CUR algorithm for time integration of several nonlinear stochastic PDEs on low-rank matrix manifolds.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov equations for stochastic Volterra processes with singular kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We associate backward and forward Kolmogorov equations to a class of fully nonlinear Stochastic Volterra Equations (SVEs) with convolution kernels $K$ that are singular at the origin. Working on a carefully chosen Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_1$, we rigorously establish a link between solutions of SVEs and Markovian mild solutions of a Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) of transport-type. Then, we obtain two novel It\^o formulae for functionals of mild solutions and, as a byproduct, show that their laws solve corresponding Fokker-Planck equations. Finally, we introduce a natural notion of "singular" directional derivatives along $K$ and prove that (conditional) expectations of SVE solutions can be expressed in terms of the unique solution to a backward Kolmogorov equation on $\mathcal{H}_1$. Our analysis relies on stochastic calculus in Hilbert spaces, the reproducing kernel property of the state space $\mathcal{H}_1,$ as well as crucial invariance and smoothing properties that are specific to the SPDEs of interest. In the special case of singular power-law kernels, our conditions guarantee well-posedness of the backward equation either for all values of the Hurst parameter $H,$ when the noise is additive, or for all $H&gt;1/4$ when the noise is multiplicative.</description>

      <title>Noncollapsing for Curvature Flows with Inhomogeneous Speeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study closed, embedded hypersurfaces in Euclidean space evolving by fully nonlinear curvature flows, whose speed is given by a symmetric, monotone increasing, $1$-homogeneous, positive underlying speed function $F$ composed with a modulating function $\Psi$. Under the assumption that $F$ is convex or inverse-concave and that $\Psi$ satisfies the corresponding structural conditions, we establish exterior noncollapsing estimates for the flow. The main difficulty stems from the nonlinearity of the evolution equation satisfied in the viscosity sense by the exscribed curvature, whereas in previous works it is a solution to the linearized flow. Moreover, in the case where $F$ is inverse-concave, we refine Andrews and Langford's argument for the interior case.</description>

      <title>Extremal polynomials for the Rogosinski--Szeg\H{o} estimates of the third coefficient of nonnegative sine polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the class of normalized sine-polynomials $S(t),$ non-negative on $[0,\pi],$ W.Rogosinski and G.Szeg\H{o} 1950 considered a number of extremal problems and proved, among other things, sharp upper and lower estimates for the coefficient $a_3.$ Their proof is based on the Luk\'acs representation of non-negative algebraic polynomials. This method does not lead to the construction of polynomials attaining the extreme values.
  We consider the corresponding problem in the framework of normalized typically real polynomials $P(z)$ on the unit disc in $\mathbb C.$ By L.Fej\'er's method with the additional use of the Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind and their derivatives, we regain the sharp upper and lower estimates for $a_3$ and identify the extremal polynomials. The corresponding statements for sine polynomials follow by the observation $S(t)=\text{Im}\{P(e^{it})\}$. For odd $N$ the extremizers are unique, for even $N$ there is a one-parameter family of extremizers.</description>

      <title>A dynamical formulation of multi-marginal optimal transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a primal-dual dynamical formulation of the multi-marginal optimal transport problem for (semi-)convex cost functions. Even in the two-marginal setting, this formulation applies to cost functions not covered by the classical dynamical approach of Benamou-Brenier. Our dynamical formulation yields a convex optimization problem, enabling the use of convex optimization tools to find quasi-Monge solutions of the static multi-marginal problem for translation-invariant costs. We illustrate our results numerically with proximal splitting methods.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Beris-Edwards system for both biaxial and uniaxial $Q$-tensors with a general Landau-de Gennes energy density depending on four non-zero elastic constants. We prove existence of the strong solution of the Beris-Edwards system for uniaxial $Q$-tensors up to a maximal time. Furthermore, we prove that the strong solutions of the Beris-Edwards system for biaxial $Q$-tensors converge smoothly to the solution of the Beris-Edwards system for uniaxial $Q$-tensors up to its maximal existence time.</description>

      <title>Microlocal analysis of double fibration transforms with conjugate points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the structure of normal operators of double fibration transforms with conjugate points. Examples of double fibration transforms include Radon transforms, $d$-plane transforms on the Euclidean space, geodesic X-ray transforms, light-ray transforms, and ray transforms defined by null bicharacteristics associated with real principal type operators. We show that, under certain stable conditions on the distribution of conjugate points, the normal operator splits into an elliptic pseudodifferential operator and several Fourier integral operators, depending on the degree of the conjugate points. These problems were first studied for geodesic X-ray transforms by Stefanov and Uhlmann (Analysis \&amp; PDE, {\bf 5} (2012), pp.219--260). After that Holman and Uhlmann (Journal of Differential Geometry, {\bf 108} (2018), pp.459--494) proved refined results according to the degree of regular conjugate points.</description>

      <title>Almost global existence for Hamiltonian PDEs on compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an abstract result of almost global existence of small solutions to semi-linear Hamiltonian partial differential equations satisfying very weak non resonance conditions and basic multilinear estimates. Thanks to works by Delort--Szeftel, these assumptions turn out to typically hold for Hamiltonian PDEs on any smooth compact boundaryless Riemannian manifold. As a main application, we prove the almost global existence of small solutions to nonlinear Klein--Gordon equations on such manifolds: for almost all mass, any arbitrarily large $r$ and sufficiently large $s$, solutions with initial data of sufficiently small size $\varepsilon \ll 1$ in the Sobolev space $H^s \times H^{s-1}$ exist and remain in $H^s \times H^{s-1}$ for polynomial times $|t| \leq \varepsilon^{-r}$. This is the first result of almost global existence without specific assumptions on the compact manifold. We also apply this abstract result to nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equations close to ground states and nonlinear Klein--Gordon equations on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with positive quadratic potentials.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear bound states with prescribed angular momentum in the mass supercritical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19134v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the existence, orbital stability/instability and regularity of bound state solutions to nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with super-quadratic confinement in two and three spatial dimensions for the mass supercritical case. Such solutions, which are given by time-dependent rotations of a non-radially symmetric spatial profile, correspond to critical points of the underlying energy function restricted on the double constraints consisting of the mass and the angular momentum. The study exhibits new pictures for rotating Bose-Einstein condensates within the framework of Gross-Pitaevskii theory. It is proved that there exist two non-radial symmetric solutions, one of which is local minimizer and the other is mountain pass type critical point of the underlying energy function restricted on the constraints. Moreover, we derive conditions that guarantee that local minimizers are regular, the set of those is orbitally stable and mountain pass type solutions are strongly unstable. The results extend and complement the recent ones in \cite{NSS}, where the consideration is undertaken in the mass subcritical case.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic evolutions on the incompressible Navier--Stokes flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through the asymptotic expansion, the large-time behavior of the incompressible Navier-Stokes flow in $n$-dimensional whole space is drawn. In particular, the logarithmic evolution included in the flow velocity is the focus of attention. When the components of velocity are ordered from major to minor according to the parabolic scales, the logarithmically evolving components appear in a certain pattern. This work asserts that this pattern varies depending on the even-oddness of the space dimension. This means that the parity of the nonlinear drift is different in even and odd dimensions. The logarithmic term represents the nonlinear component of the phenomenon. No symmetry of the initial condition is required to prove this fact. In the preceding works, the expansion with the $2n$th order was already derived. The assertion is derived by reexamining these works in detail.</description>

      <title>Monotone Multispecies Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel notion of $\lambda$-monotonicity for an $n$-species system of partial differential equations governed by mass-preserving flow dynamics, extending monotonicity in Banach spaces to the Wasserstein-2 metric space. We show that monotonicity implies the existence of and convergence to a unique steady state, convergence of the velocity fields and second moments, and contraction in the Wasserstein-2 metric, at rates dependent on $\lambda$. In the special setting of Wasserstein-2 gradient descent of different energies for each species, we prove convergence to the unique Nash equilibrium of the associated energies and delineate the relationship between monotonicity and displacement convexity. This extends known zero-sum results in infinite-dimensional game theory to the general-sum setting. We provide a number of examples of monotone coupled gradient flow systems, including cross-diffusion, gradient flows with potentials, nonlocal interaction, linear and nonlinear diffusion, and min-max systems, and draw connections to a class of mean-field games. Numerically, we demonstrate convergence of a four-player economic model for service providers and strategic users competing in a market, and a degenerately monotone game.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The continuous dependence on the initial data and consequently the uniqueness of bounded weak solutions to a class of triangular reaction-cross-diffusion equations is shown. The class includes two-species doubly degenerate equations for nutrient taxis models describing the response of bacteria to nutrient conditions. The key difficulty is the lack of a gradient bound for the difference of the first component of the solution, due to the degeneracy. This issue is overcome by assuming a nonstandard Lipschitz-type condition, applying the $H^{-1}$ method, and carefully combining various estimations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gutzwiller trace formula relates the asymptotic spacing of quantum-mechanical energy levels in the semiclassical limit to the dynamics of periodic classical particle trajectories. We generalize this result to the case of non-smooth potentials, for which there is partial reflection of energy from derivative discontinuities of the potential. It is the periodic trajectories of an associated branching dynamics that contribute to the trace asymptotics in this more general setting; we obtain a precise description of their contribution.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the initial value problem of the incompressible generalized Navier-Stokes equations with initial data being in negative order Sobolev spaces, in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d \geq 2$. The generalized Navier-Stokes equations studied here is obtained by replacing the standard Laplacian in the classical Navier-Stokes equations by the fractional order Laplacian $-(-\Delta)^\al$ with $\al \in \left( \frac{1}{2},\frac{d+2}{4} \right]$. After an appropriate randomization on the initial data, we obtain the almost sure existence and optimal decay rate of global weak solutions when the initial data belongs to $\Dot{H}^s(\mathbb{R}^d)$ with $s\in (-\al+(1-\al)_+,0)$. Moreover, we show that the weak solutions are unique when $\al=\frac{d+2}{4}$ with $d \geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Magnetisation moment of a bounded 3D sample: asymptotic recovery from planar measurements on a large disk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.14776v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse magnetisation problem consists in inferring information about a magnetic source from measurements of its magnetic field. Unlike a general magnetisation distribution, the total magnetisation (net moment) of the source is a quantity that theoretically can be uniquely determined from the field. At the same time, it is often the most useful quantity for practical applications (on large and small scales) such as detection of a magnetic anomaly in magnetic prospection problem or finding the overall strength and mean direction of the magnetisation distribution of a magnetised rock sample. It is known that the net moment components can be explicitly estimated using the so-called Helbig's integrals which involve integration of the magnetic field data on the plane against simple polynomials. Evaluation of these integrals requires knowledge of the magnetic field data on a large region or the use of ad hoc methods to compensate for the lack thereof. In this paper, we derive higher-order analogs of Helbig's integrals which permit estimation of total magnetisation components in terms of measurement data available on a smaller region. Motivated by a concrete experimental setup for analysing remanent magnetisation of rock samples with a scanning microscope, we also extend Helbig's integrals to the situation when knowledge of only one field component is necessary. Moreover, apart from derivation of these novel formulas, we rigorously prove their accuracy. The presented approach, based on an appropriate splitting in the Fourier domain and estimates of oscillatory integrals (involving both small and large parameters), elucidates the derivation of asymptotic formulas for the net moment components to an arbitrary order, a possibility that was previously unclear. The obtained results are illustrated numerically and their robustness with respect to the noise is discussed.</description>

Abstract: We extend a classical approximation result of harmonic functions in planar domains due to Bernstein and Walsch to the setting of harmonic functions in Riemann surfaces. This result gives an exact characterization of the rate at which a harmonic function in a subdomain of a compact Riemann surface may be approached by globally defined harmonic functions with prescribed poles. We illustrate the effectiveness and the impact of the method solving general boundary value Laplace problems in subdomains of the surface; we lay the groundwork for this numerical method in Riemann surfaces represented by a gluing of hyperbolic polygons. In particular, we give a general approximation procedure that computes this basis efficiently with arbitrary precision.</description>

      <title>A convergence proof for a finite element discretization of Chorin's projection method of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Chorin's projection method combined with a finite element spatial discretization for the time-dependent incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The scheme advances the solution in two steps: a prediction step, which computes an intermediate velocity field that is generally not divergence-free, and a projection step, which enforces (approximate) incompressibility by projecting this velocity onto the (approximately) divergence-free subspace. We establish convergence, up to a subsequence, of the numerical approximations generated by this scheme to a Leray-Hopf weak solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, without any additional regularity assumptions beyond square-integrable initial data. A discrete energy inequality yields a priori estimates, which we combine with a new compactness result to prove precompactness of the approximations in $L^2([0,T]\times\Omega)$, where $[0,T]$ is the time interval and $\Omega$ is the spatial domain. Passing to the limit as the discretization parameters vanish, we obtain a weak solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. A central difficulty is that different a priori bounds are available for the intermediate and projected velocity fields; our compactness argument carefully integrates these estimates to complete the convergence proof.</description>
